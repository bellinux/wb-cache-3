40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{objective}} was to implement a Monte Carlo-based Intra-operative radiation therapy programme at {{the institution of the}} author. Three main steps were undertaken in achieving this objective. Firstly, Monte Carlo commissioning of the linear accelerator was accomplished by simulating the 101 ̆d 46510 cm and 5 cm electron applicators for 6, 12 and 18 MeV electron beams in the BEAMnrc simulation code. The phase-space files generated were used as sources for a phantom constructed in DOSXYZnrc. <b>Percentage</b> <b>Depth</b> <b>Doses</b> and profiles at various depths are extracted from the 3 -dimensional dose distributions produced by the DOSXYZnrc simulations. These are then compared with equivalent measured data using the Gamma Index evaluation method. Absolute dosimetry results utilising the TRS 398 protocol were performed. MC-calculated output factors for the 5 1 ̆d 4501 ̆d 45 a applicator relative to the reference 101 ̆d 46510 1 ̆d 4501 ̆d 45 a applicator are compared to measurements. Successful Monte-Carlo commissioning justified the use of the source and component module parameters for the ensuing simulations performed for the open cones and cut-outs. Secondly, separate linear accelerators were 'built' for 6 MeV, 12 MeV and 18 MeV beams by replacing the standard applicators with Intra-Operative Radiotherapy cones of diameters 19 mm, 45 mm and 64 mm in BEAMnrc. The resulting <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> and profiles were compared with measured data using the Gamma Index evaluation method. Measured output factors for each energy/cone combination were compared to that produced from the Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, custom-made alloy cut-outs for each cone were then 'built' and 'inserted' into the last 2 cm {{at the end of the}} cone for each energy. The <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> and profiles produced from the simulations were compared to measured data using the Gamma Index evaluation method. The resulting measured output factors were compared to that produced from Monte Carlo simulations. A patient case is also presented. It was concluded that Monte Carlo calculations, being the most accurate method of obtaining dose distributions and output factors for small irregularly shaped intra-operative radiotherapy electron beams, may be implemented at the author's institution for Intra-Operative Radiation Therapy...|$|R
40|$|A phantom-embedded {{extrapolation}} chamber (PEEC) made of Solid Water(TM) {{was used}} for studying the buildup region of megavoltage radiation beams. We investigated the polarity effect produced in the PEEC and found that radiation induced currents, called the Compton current, were the dominant cause of the polarity effect in the PEEC. In the dose build-up region of megavoltage photon beams, the collecting electrode is the primary Compton current source and {{the magnitude of the}} current depends on the measurement depth, field size, and photon beam quality. The connecting cable acts as a secondary Compton current source that produces a very small Compton current which depends on the field size and the photon beam quality, becoming the dominant source when the PEEC is placed at depths greater than the <b>depth</b> of maximum <b>dose.</b> A study of the dose build-up region of megavoltage photon beams showed that the <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> ionizations obtained from measurements are higher than the <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> obtained with Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. To validate the MC-calculated <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses,</b> the design of the PEEC was incorporated in the simulations. While the MC-calculated and measured <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> ionizations in the dose build-up region agreed with one another for the 6 MV, a non-negligible difference is observed for the 18 MV x-ray beam. A number of experiments and theoretical studies of various possible effects which could be the source of this discrepancy is investigated. We show that the contribution of contaminating neutrons and protons to the doses in the 18 MV x-ray beam is negligible. Moreover, the MC calculations using the XCOM photon cross sections database and the NIST bremsstrahlung differential cross sections do not explain the discrepancy between the MC calculations and measurement in the dose build-up region for the 18 MV and this discrepancy is yet to be further investigated...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate analytically the dose received by different points in water phantom and to compare it with dosimetry measurement data. Methods: To find the dose distribution throughout the tumor volume, first, the mathematical approach was per-formed for derivation of <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> photon beams of 6 MV and 18 MV Varian accelerator. Second, by dosimetry for different fields in different depths of water phantom, one can parameterize the obtained formula for <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>dose.</b> Results: By comparing the mathematical and dosimetry results, the parameters of PDD-expression were com-puted in terms of the dimension of equivalent square field in different depths. From this formula, one can find the PDD for any fields in different depths, surface skin dose, and depth of build-up region of dose distribution, which are in agreement with empirical results with R 2 > 0. 995, showing a good agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|Determination of dose {{distributions}} from superficial and orthovoltage irradiations of {{basal cell}} carcinoma of the nose has been performed using a nose shaped phantom constructed from paraffin wax. EBT type radiochromic film was used for dose measurements. A 2 cm diameter 50 kVp anterior field was used to irradiate the nose phantom, with sheets of film placed at 7 mm, 14 mm and 23 mm physical <b>depth.</b> The <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> at these points were measured to be 84 % ± 1. 6 %, 66 %± 2. 7 % and 50 %± 1. 2 % respectively, compared to the expected <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> of 72 %, 52 % and 34 %, measured in full scatter conditions. This discrepancy {{is believed to be}} due to the steep drop off at the sides of the nose phantom, resulting in reduced attenuation {{at the edges of the}} beam, which in turn results in an increase in the scatter contribution to the <b>dose</b> at <b>depth</b> on the central axis. Measured dose profiles from this technique showed a reasonably uniform distribution. A second technique using a 250 kVp tangent-like field to irradiate the tip of the nose was also tested. Radiochromic film was placed against the edges of the phantom for dose measurement. The dose at the surface was measured to be 27 %± 1. 5 % less than the expected dose. It is believed that this discrepancy is due to a combination of the lack of backscatter from the phantom, and a small offset between the phantom and the treatment cone. Dose measurements and profiles showed that this technique results in a variation in dose across the treated volume of 7 %. However, the difficulty in predicting the delivered dose prohibited it from clinical use...|$|R

40|$|When {{converting}} fractional (<b>percentage)</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> to tissue-phantom ratios, {{one must}} use {{a factor that}} accounts for the different source-to-point distances. Two minor correction factors are also involved. One is the ratio of total to primary dose at the two different distances from the source, for the same depth and field size. This factor is usually ignored. It was determined experimentally that this can introduce up to 1. 5 % error at 6 MV. The second correction factor reflects differences related to scattered photons and electrons at the depth of normalization in the two geometries. This correction is accounted for in published conversion procedures. It {{was found to be}} less than 1 % provided the normalization depth is sufficient for electron equilibrium, which occurs first well beyond the <b>depth</b> of maximum <b>dose.</b> One may avoid electron-equilibrium problems by using an interim normalization depth that provides electron equilibrium with some margin, renormalizing to a shallower depth if desired.

40|$|Diamond {{has long}} been the {{material}} of interest for radiotherapy dosimetry due to its high sensitivity, radiation hardness and near tissue equivalency. However natural diamond detector has not become a popular choice because of variability among detectors, high cost and response dependence on dose rate. The recent success in synthesizing single crystal diamond has reignited the interest. Synthetic diamond is highly reproducible in purity and electrical properties, combined with small size, it is a suitable candidate for small field dosimetry. A newly available synthetic single crystal diamond detector is being studied to determine the basic dosimetric characteristic and applicability in small field dosimetry. A series of measurements were made in comparison with a 0. 125 c. c ionization chamber, and two diode detectors. Response of the diamond detector is independent on dose, dose rate and energy. The output factors of small fields determined by the diamond detector is lower than that of the diode detectors and higher than that of the ionization chamber which are known to over response and under response respectively. In <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> and beam profile measurements, the diamond detector performs similarly with the two diode detectors.

Using a Farmer (0. 13 cc) ionizing chamber, the <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> were measured in the water phantom (50 cm 3) and then the SSDeff was calculated by applying the inverse square law. Results For the 100 % PDD, the SSDeff values were calculated as 79, 91, 92, 93, and 92 cm for 4, 6, 9, 12, and 15 MeV, respectively. At a depth with a certain PDD, increasing energy also increases SSDeff, and a similar increase is observed at a distinctive energy by increasing the PDD. Conclusions Using the maximum <b>dose</b> <b>depth</b> from PDD curves and the inverse square law, the required SSDeff to calculate the dose distribution of the electron beam can be calculated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{accuracy}} of the two available calculation algorithms of the Oncentra MasterPlan three-dimensional treatment planning system (TPS) – the pencil beam method and collapsed-cone convolution – in modeling the Varian enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW). Measurements were carried out for a dual high energy (6 - 15 MV) Varian DHX-S linear accelerator using ionization chambers for beam axis measurements (wedge factors and <b>depth</b> <b>doses),</b> film dosimetry for offaxis dose profiles measurements, and a diode matrix detector for two dimensional absolute dose distributions. Using both calculation algorithms, different configuration of symmetric and asymmetric fields varying the wedge’s angle were tested. Accuracy of the treatment planning system was evaluated in terms of percentage differences between measured and calculated values for wedge factors, <b>depth</b> <b>doses,</b> and profiles. As far as the absolute dose distribution was concerned, the gamma index method (Low et al. (13)) was used with 3 % and 3 mm as acceptance criteria for dose difference and distance-to-agreement, respectively. Wedge factors and <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> were within 1 % deviation between calculated and measured values. The comparison of measured and calculated dose profiles shows that the Van Dyk’s acceptance criteria (Van Dyk et al. (14)) are generally met; a disagreement can be noted for large wedge angles and field size limited to the low dose-low gradient region only. The 2 D absolute dose distribution analysis confirms the good accuracy of the two calculation algorithms in modeling the enhanced dynamic wedge. PACS number: 87. 53.

40|$|A {{computer}} program was {{developed during the}} course of this work to calculate electron arc dose distributions with the angle $ beta$ concept. The angle $ beta$ uniquely describes the dependence of radial percentage depth doses an electron arc therapy on the nominal field width, isocenter depth, and virtual source-axis distance. The $ beta$ concept can be used in clinical situations to determine the field width when the isocenter depth and the required radial <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> are known. This thesis presents an overview of the physical properties of electron arc therapy and describes in detail the angle $ beta$ pseudo-arc technique used at McGill.

40|$|AbstractRadiation {{therapy is}} an {{established}} method of cancer treatment. New technologies in cancer radiotherapy need {{a more accurate}} computation of the dose delivered in the radiotherapy treatment plan. This study presents some results of a Geant 4 -based application for simulation of the absorbed dose distribution given by a medical linear accelerator (LINAC). The LINAC geometry is accurately described in the Monte Carlo code with use of the accelerator manufacturer's specifications. The capability of the software for evaluating the dose distribution has been verified by comparisons with measurements in a water phantom; the comparisons were performed for <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> (PDD) and profiles for various field sizes and depths, for a 6 -MV electron beam. Experimental and calculated dose values were in good agreement both in PDD and in transverse sections of the water phantom...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{particular}} Dielectric Window (DW) for Standing Wave (SW) Linear Accelerators (LINAC’s). This study investigates the in-frequency return loss behaviour of the LINAC, {{in order to}} improve matching and transmitting conditions while maintaining the optimum coupling between LINAC and High Power Microwave (HPMW) source. Device design considers the DW input interface as an Input Matching Network (IMN) at the LINAC Normal Mode (NM) working frequency. Thus, design formulas are provided and Computer Aided Design (CAD) techniques are proposed. A prototype has been made and tested by performing cold S-parameter and <b>Percentage</b> <b>Depth</b> <b>Dose</b> (PDD) measurements of a LINAC with the proposed DW and with a traditional DW.

40|$|In this work, {{the authors}} have {{evaluated}} ten different ionization chambers for the relative dosimetry of kilovoltage x-ray beams in the energy range of 50 - 280 kVp. <b>Percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> in water and relative detector response (in Solid Water and in air) were measured {{for each of the}} x-ray beams studied using a number of chambers. Measured <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> data were compared with Monte Carlo calculated <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo package and the BEAMnrc user code. The accuracy of the phase space files generated by BEAMnrc was verified by calculating the half-value layer and comparing with the measured half-value layer of each x-ray beam. The results indicate that the Advanced Markus, Markus, NACP, and Roos parallel plate ionization chambers were suitable for the measurement of <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> data in this beam quality range with an uncertainty of less than 3 %, including in the regions close to the water surface. While the relative detector response of the Farmer and scanning thimble chambers exhibited a better energy response, they were not suitable for <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> measurements in the first 5 mm below the water surface with differences of up to 12 % in the surface dose measurement for the 50 kVp x-ray beam. These differences were due to dose artifacts generated by the chamber size and the dose gradient. However, at depths greater than 5 mm, the Farmer and thimble scanning chambers gave uncertainties of less than 3 % for the <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> measurements for all beam energies. The PTW PinPoint 31006 chamber was found to give varying dose differences of up to 8 % depending on the x-ray beam energy; this was attributed to the steel central electrode. The authors recommend that one of the parallel plate ionization chambers investigated be used to determine <b>depth</b> <b>dose</b> data for kilovoltage x-ray beams in the energy range studied and give correct dose information close to the surface and at depth in the water phantom. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The role of dose {{distribution}} and calculation {{is very important}} in radiation treatment planning. In external beam radiotherapy, determination of dose distribution demands a high level of dosimetric accuracy. <b>Percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> (PDDs) {{play an important role in}} achieving that accuracy. Moreover, wedges are frequently used in radiotherapy to modify the isodose distribution by compensating dose inhomogeneity. The introduction of new imaging facilities in radiotherapy increases the requirement of better dose conformity. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) always shows noteworthy potential for improving the cancer survival rate by the contribution of influential tool. In this thesis, accuracy of treatment plans has been investigated by treatment planning systems using different advanced radiotherapy techniques such as three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3 DCRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and VMAT. Varian linear accelerator (2100 C/D) has been used for 6 and 15 MV photon beam energies with 120 multileaf collimator (MLCs). PDDs and tissue maximum ratios (TMRs) were measured at various depths and field sizes using a PTW 31006 ionization chamber and a scanning water tank. Mean monitor unit, maximum and minimum doses in the PTV, conformity index, and homogeneity index were determined for each treatment plan. MapCHECK was used for Gamma analysis to meet the 95...|$|R
40|$|Transmission type {{detectors}} {{can provide}} {{a measure of the}} energy fluence and if they are real-time systems that do not significantly attenuate the radiation beam have a distinct advantage over the current method as Quality Assurance (QA) could in principle be done during the actual patient treatment. The use of diode arrays in QA holds much promise due to real-time operation and feedback when compared to other methods e. g. films which are not real-time. The goal of this work is to describe the characterization of the radiation response of a silicon diode array called the Magic Plate (MP) when operated in transmission mode (MPTM). The response linearity of MPTM was excellent (R 2 = 1). When the MP was placed in linac block tray position; the change in PDD at phantom surface (SSD 100 cm) for a 10 × 10 cm 2 was - 0. 037 %, - 0. 178 % and - 0. 949 % for 6 MV, 10 MV and 18 MV beams. Therefore, MP does not provide a significant increase in skin dose to the patient and the <b>percentage</b> <b>depth</b> <b>doses</b> showed an excellent agreement with and without MPTM for 6 MV, 10 MV and 18 MV beams...|$|R
