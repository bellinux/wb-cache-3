5|$|Interplay {{announced}} in late 1999 {{that they were}} working on a title for the Dreamcast which was known to be a 3D simulation of gambling with traditional casino games. The game was fully licensed by the Caesars Palace casino and features six card games, table games, five slot machine themes, and video game machines. Each game plays by official Caesars Palace rules and uses casino odds and payouts verified by a Ph.D in statistics. The PC version of the game received praise for its graphics and sound, but the Dreamcast version received criticism for its <b>presentation,</b> <b>graphics,</b> and slow pace.|$|E
5|$|Reviews for Advent Children {{have been}} mixed to positive: while critics have praised the <b>presentation,</b> <b>graphics</b> and fan appeal, all reviews agree that the story's context and {{delivery}} were confusing for people new to the series. While western critics were positive about Last Order, the OAV received heavy fan criticism in Japan due to its retconning of key events, which prompted the team {{to ensure that the}} event was faithfully recreated in Crisis Core. Before Crisis, due to remaining in Japan, has received limited attention in the west, but previews have been highly positive, with many praising the gameplay and graphics as being impressive for a mobile game. Opinions for Dirge of Cerberus were decidedly mixed. While many praised the story and characters, especially the focus on Vincent's character and development, critics were mixed to negative about the graphics and gameplay. Japanese magazine Famitsu notably gave the game a delayed and highly critical review. Crisis Core was generally praised, with many enjoying the story's intimate presentation of the characters and action-oriented gameplay, despite some criticism for it being aimed at fans of VII. Critics of the Compilation have generally cited Crisis Core as the best title of the series.|$|E
25|$|Both Kikutake and Kurokawa capitalised on the {{interest}} in Tange's 1960 plan by producing their own schemes for Tōkyō. Kikutake's plan incorporated three elements both on {{the land and the}} sea and included a looped highway that connected all the prefectures around the bay. Unlike Tange however its simple <b>presentation</b> <b>graphics</b> put many people off. Kurokawa's plan consisted of helix-shaped megastructures floating inside cells that extended out across the bay. Although the scheme's more convincing graphics were presented as part of a film the project was not built.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study which was {{conducted}} to determine the impact of color on learning. The entire seventh-grade class from a Midwest junior high school {{was used in the}} study. Each student was randomly assigned into one of four treatment groups: (1) color-cued presentation, color-cued assessment; (2) color-cued presentation, black/white assessment; (3) black/white presentation, color-rued assessment; (4) black/white presentation, black/white assess. nt. During their homeroom session, all students received directions via audiotape; they then, in isolation, read and studied the <b>graphic</b> <b>presentation</b> summarizing a little-known Norse myth. Finally, they demonstrated both immediate recall and two week delayed retention on the graphic assessment without the aid of the <b>presentation</b> <b>graphic.</b> By reviewing the mean performance at recall and retention {{as a function of the}} type of <b>presentation</b> <b>graphic,</b> it was determined that the preferred presentation type was color-cued. There was one major finding of the study: the important factor in enhancing performance appeared to be the presence of a systematic color cue in <b>graphic</b> <b>presentation.</b> (Contains 15 references.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of visuals and their components presented through a television monitor in the distance education classroom. As a means of accomplishing the purpose of the study, answers to the following questions were sought: (a) What are the demographic variables of the participants in the study? (b) What are the most appropriate color combinations for effective <b>presentations</b> for <b>graphics</b> utilizing distance education equipment? (c) What are the most appropriate types of fonts for effective <b>presentations</b> for <b>graphics</b> utilizing distance education equipment? (d) What are the most appropriate font sizes for effective <b>presentations</b> for <b>graphics</b> utilizing distance education equipment? (e) What are the most appropriate styles of emphasis for effective <b>presentations</b> for <b>graphics</b> utilizing distance education equipment? (f) Are there differences in preferences of color combinations, fonts and font sizes according to selected demographic variables? The design for this study was survey research. Participants were asked to rate different color combinations, font types, font sizes and styles of emphasis according to their personal preference. This study found that contrasting color combinations are essential to presentation formatting. The most preferred color combination was violet background/white text. The color preferred most for text was white. Sans-serif fonts are more desirable than serif fonts. The most preferred font size was 54. Distance or visual impairments had no significant relationship with color combination preferences, preferences for font style or styles of emphasis. Introduction/Theoretical Framewor...|$|R

The PDP-11/40 computer was housed in a tall cabinet and used random access magnetic tape drives(DECtape)for storing completed presentations.|$|E
