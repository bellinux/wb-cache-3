The <b>project,</b> <b>code</b> named WP 1.0, was to be supported by 25 editors employed by Zenodot {{as well as a}} scientific advisory board.

In September 2010, track pieces from manufacture Bolliger & Mabillard began to be delivered to the park which then led to rumours that the new roller coaster would be a Dive Coaster.

500|$|The VB-13, redesignated ASM-A-1 in 1948, was {{developed}} under the <b>project</b> <b>code</b> MX-674. It had an annular wing around the midsection of its body, mounted near the weapon's center of gravity. At {{the rear of}} the bomb was an octagonal tail surface containing the Razon control surfaces. Intended to be carryed by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, the Tarzon bomb used the combination of AN/ARW-38 [...] command link transmitter on the B-29 and an AN/URW-2 [...] receiver on the Tarzon to provide manual command guidance of range and azimuth. [...] This was done with visual tracking of the bomb's course, aided by a flare mounted in the tail of the weapon.

Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced {{the idea of an}} individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. The original <b>project</b> <b>code</b> name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass, inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly {{due to the fact that}} domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter. The developers initially considered [...] "10958" [...] as a short code, but later changed it to [...] "40404" [...] for [...] "ease of use and memorability".

2500|$|In 1987 the Esprit was restyled by {{designer}} Peter Stevens. Stevens, {{who went}} on to design the McLaren F1, produced a less angular, more rounded car. Giugiaro is said to have liked the new shape, claiming it was perhaps too close to his original design. The exterior changes were accompanied by a redesign of the interior that gave more space to the occupants.

2500|$|Developed {{under the}} <b>project</b> <b>code</b> MX-607 at Wright Field in Ohio, the JB-4 was a {{modification}} of the GB-4 glide bomb, which had entered service with the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944. Powered by a Ford PJ31 pulsejet engine, the JB-4 was intended to give an improved standoff range as opposed to its unpowered predecessor. In addition, the addition of an engine made the missile capable of being ground-launched as well. However the requirement to carry fuel for the engine meant {{that the size of}} the JB-4's warhead was limited to , compared to the [...] bomb that formed the core of the GB-4.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} year of the Pacific War {{beginning}} on 7 December 1941, Allied personnel often struggled to quickly, succinctly, and accurately identify Japanese aircraft encountered in combat. They found the Japanese designation system bewildering and awkward, as it allocated two names to each aircraft. One was the manufacturer's alphanumeric <b>project</b> <b>code,</b> and the other was the official military designation, which consisted of a description of the aircraft plus the year it entered service. For example, the military designation of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter was the [...] "Navy Type 96 Carrier Fighter". Type 96 meant that the aircraft had entered service in Imperial year 2596, equivalent to Gregorian calendar year 1936. Other aircraft, however, which had entered service the same year carried the same type number; aircraft such as the Type 96 Carrier Bomber and the Type 96 Land Attack Bomber. Adding to the confusion, the US Army and US Navy each had their own different systems for identifying Japanese aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, the Group C {{regulations}} {{underwent a}} major revamp, {{with the primary}} focus being on changing the engines to 3.5-litre units sourced from Formula One cars. The Fiat Group had previously run the Lancia LC2 in the Group C category, but had cancelled that project in 1986 after only winning one race with the LC2. In 1990, Lancia were primarily focusing on the World Rally Championship (with the Group A Delta Integrale), whilst Ferrari were focusing on their Formula One programme; this meant that Alfa Romeo were {{the only member of}} the Fiat Group that would have the capacity for a sports car racing programme; they had last competed in top-level sports car events in the 1970s, with the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33. [...] As Abarth had previously developed the Lancia LC2, it was them who Fiat turned to for the chassis development of the new Group C car, which was assigned the <b>project</b> <b>code</b> of [...] "SE 048SP". Giuseppe Petrotta, formerly of Osella, was the man selected to design the SE 048SP, and he drew up a fairly conventional car, with radiators mounted in the front of the chassis, covered rear wheels, and a nose that featured the traditional Alfa Romeo grille.|$|E

2500|$|From 1992 to 1996, chief {{engineer}} Kosaku oversaw {{development of the}} XV20 Lexus variant alongside the XV20 Toyota Camry programme under <b>project</b> <b>code</b> 416T. In mid-1993, an exterior design concept by Hiroshi Okamoto was approved and later frozen for production in January 1994, later being patented on 9 November 1994 at the Japanese patent office, under patent No. 0796802. The third-generation ES (designated MCV20) premiered in September 1996 for the 1997 model year, featuring a design that was an evolution of the VCV10. The new cars featured a 30percent stiffer body with a more rakish profile and sharper lines, reflector headlights (as opposed to projector headlights), and a more upscale-feeling interior. Introduced at a gala event on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills hosted by actress Sharon Stone, the ES 300 featured one powertrain option, a 3.0-liter V6 capable of [...] and [...] of torque and a four-speed automatic – although a , 2.5-liter 2MZ-FE V6 was also offered in the equivalent Japanese-market Windom. The ES 300 could go from [...] in 7.7 seconds. The third-generation ES was also slightly longer (overall length increased by [...] ) but weighed less than the previous model, and its drag coefficient was , improved over its predecessor. For the first time, an Adaptive Variable Suspension, capable of adjusting individual wheels' dampers according to road conditions (within 0.0025 seconds), was offered.|$|E
