5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the <b>PEGylated</b> <b>interferon</b> beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting <b>PEGylated</b> <b>interferon,</b> which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Optimized <b>Pegylated</b> <b>interferons</b> Efficacy and anti-Retroviral Approach (OPERA) study {{aimed to}} assess the {{efficacy}} and safety profile of treatment with <b>pegylated</b> <b>interferons</b> (PEG-IFNs) in interferon-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection in routine clinical practice. METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study conducted at 98 Italian referral centres {{for the treatment of}} chronic HCV and HIV co-infection. Adult subjects (n= 1523) with a confirmed diagnosis of HCV and stable HIV co-infection were followed between April 2005 and March 2011; of these, 1284 were interferon-naïve and were the focus of this analysis. Patients received PEG-IFN α 2 a or α 2 b plus ribavirin combination therapy. The choice of treatment and dose was at the investigator's discretion, according to the summary of product characteristics and current guidelines.

25|$|<b>Pegylated</b> <b>interferon</b> (PEG IFN) is dosed {{just once}} a week as a {{subcutaneous}} injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon. Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring. PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 {{per year in the}} United States, compared to $2,500-8,700 for the oral medications; however, its treatment duration is 48 weeks as opposed to the oral antivirals, which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum 1 year). PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of the}} {{available}} drugs can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2008, there are seven medications licensed {{for the treatment of}} [...] infection in the United States. These include antiviral drugs lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), tenofovir (Viread), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude), and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and <b>PEGylated</b> <b>interferon</b> alpha-2a (Pegasys). In 2015 the World Health Organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents. Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to hepatitis A and B, progression to chronic hepatitis C {{is much more}} common. The ultimate goal of hepatitis C treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The best {{way to reduce the}} long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR). SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure. Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs. The indirect acting antivirals include <b>pegylated</b> <b>interferon</b> (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV. Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype. These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas. In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ribavirin is used {{primarily}} to treat hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers (which is an orphan indication in most countries). In this former indication the oral (capsule or tablet) form of ribavirin {{is used in}} combination with <b>pegylated</b> <b>interferon</b> alfa. Including in people coinfected with hepatitis B, HIV and in the pediatric population. Statins may improve this combination's efficacy in treating hepatitis C. Ribavirin is the only known treatment {{for a variety of}} viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection, although data regarding these infections are scarce and the drug might be effective only in early stages. It is noted by the USAMRIID that [...] "Ribavirin has poor in vitro and in vivo activity against the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and the flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, and Kyasanur forest disease)" [...] The aerosol form has been used in the past to treat respiratory syncytial virus-related diseases in children, although the evidence to support this is rather weak.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} types of interferons are approved for use in humans. One was first approved for medical use in 1986. For example, in January 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of PEGylated interferon-alpha in the USA; in this formulation, PEGylated interferon-alpha-2b (Pegintron), polyethylene glycol {{is linked to the}} interferon molecule to make the interferon last longer in the body. [...] Approval for PEGylated interferon-alpha-2a (Pegasys) followed in October 2002. [...] These PEGylated drugs are injected once weekly, rather than administering two or three times per week, as is necessary for conventional interferon-alpha. When used with the antiviral drug ribavirin, <b>PEGylated</b> <b>interferon</b> is effective in treatment of hepatitis C; at least 75% of people with hepatitis C genotypes 2 or 3 benefit from interferon treatment, although this is effective in less than 50% of people infected with genotype 1 (the more common form of hepatitis C virus in both the U.S. and Western Europe). Interferon-containing regimens may also include protease inhibitors such as boceprevir and telaprevir.|$|E

More recently, the use of <b>pegylated</b> <b>interferons</b> has largely supplanted standard interferons.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityHepatitis C (HCV) is {{the most}} common {{bloodborne}} disease worldwide. Most cases of hepatitis C progress to chronic disease, with a significant portion of these ending in cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the United States hepatitis C results in 8, 000 to 10, 000 deaths annually, and this figure is expected to triple in the next 20 years. There is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C, and efforts to develop a vaccine are hampered by the high degree of mutability exhibited by the virus. Current pharmacotherapy for HCV disease is limited to interferon alpha and ribavirin, and these drugs provide long-term remission of the virus in less than 50 % of cases treated.
