Further, sage Mandavya {{is described as}} worshipping the Māṭrpaňcaka (the five mothers), Chamunda being one of them. The mothers are described as established by creator god Brahma for saving king Harishchandra from calamities. Apart from usual meaning of Chamunda as slayer of demons Chanda and Munda, Devi Purana gives a different explanation: Chanda means terrible while Munda stands for Brahma's head or lord or husband.|$|E

Charcot's triad {{is a set}} of three common findings in cholangitis: abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. This was assumed in the past to be present in 50–70% of cases, although more recently the frequency has been reported as 15–20%. Reynolds' <b>pentad</b> includes the findings of Charcot's triad with the presence of septic shock and mental confusion. This combination of symptoms indicates worsening of the condition and the development of sepsis, and is seen less commonly still.|$|E

30|$|Glyphosate-based {{herbicides}} {{are currently}} applied at various time points or periods {{over the year}} [5]. As shown in Figure  1, these can coincide {{with the presence of}} all developmental stages of the four amphibian species observed on fields, no matter if being preterm or stable. However, in all species, the risk of exposure is clearly reduced in preterm populations. This becomes clear when comparing the total number of <b>pentads</b> per species representing the time phase of reproductive behaviour (i.e. all developmental stages pooled) with the total number of <b>pentads</b> in which glyphosate-based herbicides can be applied (Figure  1). In our verbal model, possible exposure decreases for about 50 % in the early breeders when preterm (common frog 14 to 6 <b>pentads,</b> common toad 14 to 8 <b>pentads)</b> and also in the late breeders the decrease is moderate (green toad 38 to 27 <b>pentads,</b> common spadefoot 20 to 13 <b>pentads).</b> Early in the year, regarding possible exposure risk during pre-sowing/pre-emerging in spring, the improvement of preterm reproduction is only slight in all four species and affects adults as well as eggs. More evident, potential glyphosate applications in summer with siccation and stubble cultivation do no longer or less coincide with late larval and juvenile stages of species when preterm.|$|R
25|$|Tobruks primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four 4.5-inch Mark III guns, fitted forward in two twin turrets. For anti-aircraft defence, the ship carried twelve 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns: three twin mountings on the aft {{half of the}} ship, and six single mountings.

25|$|In June 1970, Vampire {{was handed}} over to Williamstown Naval Dockyard for a $US10 million {{modernisation}}. The modernisation consisted of over 2,000 upgrades and modifications. The sensor suite, including fire control systems, air radar, and surface radar, was updated. The destroyer's armament was refurbished, with the main gun turrets rebuilt and the Bofors reconditioned, although the torpedo <b>pentad</b> mount was removed. The superstructure was rebuilt, with the primary aim to enclose the open bridge area, along with modernisation of the ship's galleys and installation of more air conditioning. Redesigned masts and funnel cowlings were fitted. Vampire reentered active service on 4 March 1972.|$|E

40|$|Three covalently linked dyads such as porphyrin-ferrocene, porphyrin-BODIPY and porphyrin-sapphyrin {{containing}} one hydroxyphenyl {{group at}} the meso-position of porphyrin were synthesized by coupling the trans-functionalized porphyrin building block, 5 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 10 -(4 -iodophenyl) - 15, 20 -diphenyl porphyrin, with the ethynyl functionalized redox/chromophore building block under mild Pd(0) coupling conditions. The dyads were then reacted with SnTTP(OH) (2) in benzene in a 2 : 1 ratio at reflux temperature for 12 hours followed by simple alumina column chromatographic purification which afforded three <b>pentads</b> containing three different types of redox/chromophore components in 62 - 80 % yields. The <b>pentads</b> are very stable and freely soluble in all common organic solvents. The <b>pentads</b> formation were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and 1 D and 2 D NMR studies.

40|$|The tetrafunctionalized AB(3) -type {{porphyrin}} {{building blocks}} containing {{two different types}} of functional groups with N(4), N(3) O, N(3) S, and N(2) S(2) porphyrin cores were synthesized by following various synthetic routes. The AB(3) -type tetrafunctionalized N(4) Porphyrin building block was synthesized by a mixed condensation approach, the N(3) S and N(3) O porphyrin building blocks by a mono-ol method, and N(2) S(2) porphyrin building block by an unsymmetrical diol method. The tetrafunctionalized porphyrin building blocks were used to synthesize monofunctionalized porphyrin tetrads containing {{two different types of}} porphyrin subunits by coupling of 1 equiv of tetrafunctionalized N(4), N(3) O, N(3) S. and N(2) S(2) porphyrin building block with 3 equiv of monofunctionalized ZnN(4) porphyrin building block under mild copper-free Pd(0) coupling conditions. The monofunctionalized porphyrin tetrads were used further to synthesize unsymmetrical porphyrin <b>pentads</b> containing three different types of porphyrin subunits by coupling 1 equiv of monofunctionalized porphyrin tetrad with 1 equiv of monofunctionalized N(2) S(2) porphyrin building blocks under the same mild Pd(0) coupling conditions. The NMR, absorption, and electrochemical studies on porphyrin tetrads and porphyrin <b>pentads</b> indicated that the monomeric porphyrin subunits in tetrads and <b>pentads</b> retain their individual characteristic features and exhibit weak interaction among the porphyrin subunits. The steady state and time-resolved fluorescence studies support an efficient energy transfer from donor porphyrin subunit to acceptor porphyrin subunit in unsymmetrical porphyrin tetrads and porphyrin <b>pentads...</b>|$|R
500|$|Dr Jean-Martin Charcot, {{working at}} the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, France, is {{credited}} with early reports of cholangitis, {{as well as his}} eponymous triad, in 1877. He referred to the condition as [...] "hepatic fever" [...] (fièvre hépatique). Dr Benedict M. Reynolds, an American surgeon, reignited interest in the condition in his 1959 report with colleague Dr Everett L. Dargan, and formulated the <b>pentad</b> that carries his name. It remained a condition generally treated by surgeons, with exploration of the bile duct and excision of gallstones, until the ascendancy of ERCP in 1968. ERCP is generally performed by internal medicine or gastroenterology specialists. In 1992 it was shown that ERCP was generally safer than surgical intervention in ascending cholangitis.|$|E
500|$|The Devi Purana (6th– 10th century) {{mentions}} a {{group of}} sixteen matrikas and six other types of Matrikas mentioned, apart from the Saptamatrikas.

Kind to all creatures, the Matrikas are said to reside in various places for the benefit of children. The text paradoxically describes the Matrikas as being created by various gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra as well as being their mothers. Devi Purana describe a <b>pentad</b> of Matrikas, who help Ganesha to kill demons. Further, sage Mandavya is described as worshipping the [...] (the five mothers) named Ambika (Kaumari), Rudrani, Chamunda, Brahmi and Vaishnavi and who have been established by Brahma; for saving king Harishchandra from calamities.
