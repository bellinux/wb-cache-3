5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of <b>pustule</b> eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E

Scully cuts open Torrance's body bag and examines his corpse, but Dr. Osbourne, {{a member of the}} CDC team, tries to stop her. A <b>pustule</b> on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a gas station, where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the gas station, telling him that the contagion could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become <b>pustules.</b> Between seven and ten days the <b>pustules</b> matured and reached their maximum size. The <b>pustules</b> were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The <b>pustules</b> were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the <b>pustules,</b> {{and by the end of}} the second week the <b>pustules</b> deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|R

25|$|The Circassian women have, {{from time}} immemorial, communicated the small-pox to their {{children}} when not above six months old by making an incision in the arm, and by putting into this incision a <b>pustule,</b> taken carefully {{from the body of}} another child. This <b>pustule</b> produces the same effect in the arm it is laid in as yeast in a piece of dough; it ferments, and diffuses through the whole mass of blood the qualities with which it is impregnated. The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others. There is an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia; and when unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the inhabitants of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations when their harvest has fallen short... The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed, it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with beauties the seraglios of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian Sophy, and of all those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise.|$|E
25|$|Venom {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the ant's life as it is used to capture prey or for defence. About 95% of the venom's components are water-insoluble piperidine alkaloids, and it is particularly potent on sensitive humans. More than 14 million people are stung by them in the United States annually, where many are expected to develop allergies to the venom. Most victims experience intense burning and swelling, followed by the formation of sterile pustules, which may remain for several days. However 0.6% to 6.0% of people may suffer from anaphylaxis, which can be fatal if left untreated. Common symptoms include dizziness, chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood pressure, loss of breath, and slurred speech. More than 80 deaths have been recorded from red imported fire ant attacks. Treatment depends on the symptoms; those who only experience pain and <b>pustule</b> formation require no medical attention, but those who suffer from anaphylaxis are given epinephrines. Whole body extract immunotherapy is used to treat victims and is regarded as highly effective.|$|E
500|$|The {{exploding}} pustules {{were carefully}} rigged to burst on command. Makeup supervisor Toby Lindala constructed a handheld device that connected via tube to the faux sores. When {{the device was}} pressed, the <b>pustule</b> would burst. Filming the scenes was particularly arduous; he later noted [...] "I was jammed underneath one of the bus seats with these extras basically stepping on my head." [...] The X-Files director Frank Spotnitz remarked, [...] "When we saw the <b>pustule</b> bursting on film, we just laughed {{because it was just}} so over-the-top grotesque." [...] The Costa Rican forest at the opening was shot at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in Northern Vancouver, which also served as Puerto Rico in season opener [...] "Little Green Men". The city of Delta served for both the gas station and the bus station—actually a redecorated Dodge/Chrysler car dealership.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{inoculation}} {{is often}} used interchangeably with vaccination. However, some argue that the terms are not synonymous. Dr Byron Plant explains: [...] "Vaccination is the more commonly used term, which actually consists of a 'safe' injection of a sample taken from a cow suffering from cowpox... Inoculation, a practice probably {{as old as the}} disease itself, is the injection of the variola virus taken from a <b>pustule</b> or scab of a smallpox sufferer into the superficial layers of the skin, commonly on the upper arm of the subject. Often inoculation was done 'arm to arm' or less effectively 'scab to arm'..." [...] Inoculation oftentimes caused the patient to become infected with smallpox, and in some cases the infection turned into a severe case.|$|E
2500|$|Inoculation in the East was {{historically}} {{performed by}} blowing smallpox crusts into the nostril. In Britain, Europe and the American Colonies the preferred method was rubbing material from a smallpox <b>pustule</b> from a selected mild case (Variola minor) into a scratch between the thumb and forefinger. [...] This would generally be performed {{when an individual}} was in normal good health, and thus at peak resistance. [...] The recipient would develop smallpox; however, due to being introduced through the skin rather than the lungs, and possibly because of the inoculated individual's preexisting state of good health, the small inoculum, and the single point of initial infection, the resulting case of smallpox was generally milder than the naturally occurring form, produced far less facial scarring, and had a far lower mortality rate. As with survivors of the natural disease, the inoculated individual was subsequently immune to re-infection.|$|E
2500|$|It was noticed {{during the}} 18th century {{that people who}} had {{suffered}} from the less virulent cowpox were immune to smallpox, and the first recorded use of this idea was by a farmer Benjamin Jesty at Yetminster in Dorset, who had suffered the disease and transmitted it to his own family in 1774, his sons subsequently not getting the mild version of smallpox when later inoculated in 1789. But it was Edward Jenner, a doctor in Berkeley in Gloucestershire, who established the procedure by introducing material from a cowpox vesicle on Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid, into {{the arm of a}} boy named James Phipps. Two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox and the disease did not develop. In 1798 Jenner published An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vacciniae, which coined the term vaccination and created widespread interest. He distinguished 'true' and 'spurious' cowpox (which did not give the desired effect) and developed an [...] "arm-to-arm" [...] method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual's <b>pustule.</b> Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox, but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material, by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100,000 people were vaccinated. The second generation of vaccines was introduced in the 1880s by Louis Pasteur who developed vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax, and from the late nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.|$|E

50|$|People who are {{stung by}} red {{imported}} fire ants experience intense burning or flare-ups, followed by reddening {{of the skin}} at the sting site. This area will swell into a bump, hive or vesicle within 20 minutes. White fluid-filled sterile <b>pustules</b> begin to form within hours or days after being stung. <b>Pustules</b> on the skin remain {{for a couple of}} days, and may become infected which would require medical attention. In most cases, <b>pustules</b> dry up {{in a matter of weeks}} and leave brown scars that either remain for several months or become permanent. The formation of <b>pustules</b> occurs in almost every person stung by the ants. In one study, 96% of participants reported the formation of <b>pustules,</b> whereas 2% reported large local reactions. Between 17% to 56% of people stung develop venom-specific IgE. Many of them will experience pruritic lumps around areas where the ants stung, known as late-phase responses or cutaneous allergic reactions.|$|R
60|$|It {{often happens}} that, {{on the one}} hand, the principium vitae, or {{constitutional}} life, may be affected without any, or the least imaginable, affection of the functions; as in inoculation, where one <b>pustule</b> only has appeared, and no other perceptible symptom, and yet this has so entered into the constitution, as to indispose it to infection under the most accumulated and intense contagion; and, on the other hand, hysteria, hydrophobia, and gout will disorder the functions to the most dreadful degree, and yet often leave the life untouched. In hydrophobia, the mind is quite sound; but the patient feels his muscular and cutaneous life forcibly removed from {{under the control of}} his will.|$|E
60|$|Or {{where the}} Deacon {{is out of}} favour, perhaps some memory lingers of the great plagues, and of fatal houses still unsafe to enter within the memory of man. For in time of pestilence the {{discipline}} had been sharp and sudden, and {{what we now call}} ‘stamping out contagion’ was carried on with deadly rigour. The officials, in their gowns of grey, with a white St. Andrew’s cross on back and breast, and a white cloth carried before them on a staff, perambulated the city, adding the terror of man’s justice to the fear of God’s visitation. The dead they buried on the Borough Muir; the living who had concealed the sickness were drowned, if they were women, in the Quarry Holes, and if they were men, were hanged and gibbeted at their own doors; and wherever the evil had passed, furniture was destroyed and houses closed. And the most bogeyish part of the story is about such houses. Two generations back they still stood dark and empty; people avoided them as they passed by; the boldest schoolboy only shouted through the keyhole and made off; for within, it was supposed, the plague lay ambushed like a basilisk, ready to flow forth and spread blain and <b>pustule</b> through the city. What a terrible next-door neighbour for superstitious citizens! A rat scampering within would send a shudder through the stoutest heart. Here, if you like, was a sanitary parable, addressed by our uncleanly forefathers to their own neglect.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMost Labidostomatidae bear lateral protuberances called <b>pustules</b> {{on their}} idiosoma, {{which have been}} {{considered}} as "enigmatic" structures. Here, the fine structure of the <b>pustules</b> of Labidostoma luteum is described using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. It is shown that the <b>pustules</b> represent peculiar exocrine glands which extrude their secretions through a specialized cuticular region which is shaped like the hat of a mushroom. This region includes a space located between the epicuticle and the procuticle and {{is regarded as a}} reservoir from which secretions likely are evacuated passing through the inner epicuticle. The inner epicuticle is incompletely penetrated by numerous tubular indentations. The peculiar structure of the <b>pustules</b> is shown to be a specialized region of the complex cuticle of the mite being provided with pore canals which terminate under cuticular indentations and a peculiar tunnel system. The latter is organized in cuticular ribs by spaces between inner epicuticle and procuticle. The function of the <b>pustules</b> and the tunnel system remains unknown, but inter- and/or intraspecific communication or a defensive role seem likely...|$|R
