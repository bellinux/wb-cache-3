5|$|The larvae {{float in}} the <b>pelagic</b> <b>zone</b> of the ocean with other {{plankton}} {{for three to four}} weeks, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post-larval glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, they settle to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The coconut crab reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{are home}} to a diverse {{collection}} of life forms that {{use it as a}} habitat. Since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest oceanic trenches, including coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open <b>pelagic</b> <b>zone.</b> The organisms living in the sea range from whales 30 meters (100ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton, fungi, bacteria and viruses, including recently discovered marine bacteriophages which live parasitically inside bacteria. Marine life plays an important part in the carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing fish for use as food.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pelagic</b> <b>zone</b> {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift {{with the}} currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to {{other regions of the}} ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E

The aim of this work is to catalogue and analyze the distribution of copepod species (Crustacea, Maxillopoda) in <b>pelagic</b> and littoral <b>zones</b> from small reservoirs in the northwest of the São Paulo State, in dry and rainy seasons (2007 and 2009). METHODS: Zooplankton samplings were carried out in littoral and <b>pelagic</b> <b>zones</b> of 13 small shallow reservoirs (mean depth: 2. 6 m) using vertical hauls and plankton net (45 µm). Water physical and chemical parameters were also monitored with a multiparameter Horiba® U 10. RESULTS: Eighteen species of copepods were identified, 13 Cyclopoida and 5 Calanoida.

40|$|A {{field survey}} from the coastal ocean zones to the {{offshore}} <b>pelagic</b> <b>zones</b> of the northeastern South China Sea (nSCS) was {{conducted during the}} inter-monsoon period of May 2014 when the region was characterized by prevailing low-nutrient conditions. Comprehensive field measurements were made for not only hydrographic and biogeochemical properties but also phytoplankton growth and microzoo-plankton grazing rates. We also performed estimations of the vertical turbulent diffusivity and diffusive nutrient fluxes using a Thorpe-scale method and the upwelling nutrient fluxes by Ekman pumping using satellite-derived wind stress curl. Our results indicated {{a positive correlation between}} the integrated phytoplankton chlorophyll a and vertical nutrient fluxes in the offshore region of the nSCS during the study period. We generally found an increasing role of turbulent diffusion but a decreasing role of curl-driven upwelling in vertical transport of nutrients from the coastal ocean zones to the offshore <b>pelagic</b> <b>zones.</b> Elevated nutrient fluxes near Dongsha Islands supported high new production leading to net growth of the phytoplankton community, whereas the low fluxes near the southwest of Taiwan had resulted in a negative net community growth leading to decline of a surface phytoplankton bloom.

40|$|N 2 O {{emissions}} {{were measured}} monthly for I year using the static chamber method along the littoral and <b>pelagic</b> <b>zones</b> of Meiliang Bay in hyper-eutrophic Tailm Lake. The {{results indicated that}} littoral zones were the "hotspots" of N 2 O emissions (- 278 similar to 2 101 mu g N 2 O m(- 2) h(- 1)). While the littoral zone accounted for only 5. 4 % of the area of Meiliang Bay, the N 2 O emissions from the littoral zones were about 43. 6 % of total emissions from the bay. The importance of spatial variation on N 2 O emissions was demonstrated by dividing the lake into four unique zones through cluster analysis. The eulittoral zone was the key area of N 2 O emissions with an annual 5 % trimmed mean 429. 5 mu g N 2 O m(- 2) h- 1, following by supralittoral (138. 8 mu g N 2 O m(2) h(- 1)), infralittoral (98. 9 mu g N 2 O m(- 2) h(- 1)), and <b>pelagic</b> <b>zones</b> (15. 7 mu g N 2 O m(- 2) h(- 1)).

Persistent stratifi cation was noted in the narrower lakes, which was thought to be due to the presence of dense submerged vegetation that attenuate wind-driven turbulence. In addition, variation of thermal stratifi cation and mixing dynamics between these lakes at different water levels has corresponding effects on the biological and chemical regimes. The circulation contributes to increased transport of the phosphate that could favour submerged species and subsequently induce shifts of macrophyte community composition.

Knowledge of how trophic interaction strengths are affected by differences among habitats is crucial for understanding variation in ecological systems.

By combining new theory with extensive data (376 species, with body masses ranging from 5. 24 × 10 ⁻¹⁴ kg to 800 kg), we find that consumption rates scale sublinearly with consumer body mass (exponent of approximately 0. 85) for 2 D interactions, but superlinearly (exponent of approximately 1. 06) for 3 D interactions. These results contradict the currently widespread assumption of a single exponent (of approximately 0. 75) in consumer–resource and food-web research. Further analysis of 2, 929 consumer–resource interactions shows that dimensionality of consumer search space is probably a major driver of species coexistence, and the stability and abundance of populations...|$|R
