40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{a ceramic}} water filter with micron sized pores was {{developed}} based on diatomite raw material. The slip with diatomite earth which has tubular shaped particles was prepared by using agar. Agar is a gelatinous material derived from sea alges {{and used as}} a gelling agent in order to form ceramic filters by gel casting method. Rheology of the slip was investigated by rheometry. In the forming process, polymer and metal molds were used instead of plaster molds. After de-molding, ceramic filter samples were dried and fired at 1200 0 C / h for 2 hours. Density, phase analysis and microstructure properties of porous diatomite based filter material were measured and characterized by He <b>picnometer,</b> XRD and SEM, respectively. Water filtration performance and microbiological test results were also investigated. 1...|$|E
30|$|The leached {{solution}} was collected weekly from each lysimeter by opening the drainage valve {{located at the}} end of drainage pipe. The drainage samples were subjected to analysis for electrical conductivity (EC) and pH value. EC was determined using a conductivity meter, and pH was measured with a pH meter. The concentrations of cadmium (Cd 2 +), nickel (Ni 2 +), chromium (Cr 3 +), and lead (Pb 2 +) in effluent samples were specified by standard methods during the study period APHA (1995). Heavy metal concentrations were measured using an atomic adsorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer 3030, Waltham, MA, USA). At the end of the study, undisturbed soil samples were collected from each lysimeter using a core sampler. The bulk density and particle density of the soil samples were calculated using the cylinder and <b>picnometer</b> methods, respectively Klute (1986). The hydraulic conductivity of the soil was identified in each lysimeter using constant (for clay loamy soil) and falling head (for loamy sand soil) methods Shanableh and Kharabsheh (1996).|$|E
40|$|In this study, the in vivo {{behavior}} of a custom-made 3 D synthetic bone substitute used as scaffold for sinus augmentation procedures in an animal model was evaluated. The scaffold was a calcium phosphate ceramic fabricated by the direct rapid prototyping technique dispense-plotting. The geometrical and chemical properties of the scaffold were firstly analyzed through light and electron scanning microscope, helium <b>picnometer</b> and semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction measurements. Then, six sheep underwent monolateral sinus augmentation with the fabricated scaffolds. The animals were euthanized after healing periods of 45 and 90 days, and block sections including the grafted area were obtained. Bone samples were subjected to micro-CT, morphological and histomorphometric analyses. A complete integration of the scaffold was reported, with abundant deposition of newly formed bone tissue within the biomaterial pores. Moreover, initial foci of bone remodelling were mainly localized at {{the periphery of the}} implanted area after 45 days, while continuous bridges of mature lamellar bone were recorded in 90 days specimens, supporting the hypothesis that bone regeneration proceeds from the periphery {{to the center of the}} sinus cavit...|$|E
30|$|The {{structure}} of the synthesized NCFs was imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S- 3400 N (Hitachi, Ltd., Chiyoda-ku, Japan), including a Röntec XFlash detector (Röntec GmbH, Berlin, Germany) for energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM- 3000 F microscope, JEOL Ltd., Akishima-shi, Japan, equipped with an Oxford Instruments ISIS 300 X-ray microanalysis system and a Link Pentafet detector, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK, for EDS analyses). NCF thermal stability in air was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SETARAM Setsys Evolution, Hillsborough, NJ, USA; samples were analyzed in Pt pans at a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 850 °C {{in an atmosphere of}} air flowing at 100 mL/min). Micro-Raman spectroscopy studies were carried out using a Dilor XY Raman spectrometer (λexc = 514.5 nm, HORIBA, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). Elemental analyses of metal-free NCFs were performed using a Thermo Flash EA 1112 Series NC analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The textural properties of NCFs were studied using nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measured at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, Norcross, GA, USA) and using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method between 0.05 and 0.3 P/P 0 and t-Plot and Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Density values were measured using an AccuPyc II 1340 Micromeritics helium <b>picnometer</b> (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA).|$|E
30|$|X’Pert PRO (Panalytical) X-ray {{diffractometer}} {{was used}} to analyze the phase composition of magnetic particles. The diffraction was performed with Cokα 1 (λ = 1.7889 Å) and the ray was filtered by the graphite. The experimental parameters used were: 40 mA, 35 kV, continuous scan, scan speed 2 °/min. Particle sizes of iron-nitride coated with surfactant were measured with a 2, 100 fx transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 keV. TEM samples were prepared by dispersing the particles in alcohol using ultrasonic excitation, and then transferring the nanoparticles on the carbon films supported by copper grids. The density of the magnetic fluid was measured using a <b>picnometer</b> at 20 ± 1 °C. The sedimentation stability of the magnetic fluid was evaluated by changing the ratio of the synthetic oil (PAO 4) and surfactant. After obtaining stable magnetic fluid, the magnetic properties of the magnetic powders and the magnetic fluids were measured immediately after preparation using a LDJ 9500 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Samples were contained in a small glass cup with internal dimensions of 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3, which were sealed by gluing a small cover glass over the open end. Then the glass cup was put in the magnetic uniform area of the pole. The hysteresis curve was recorded per 1.5 s. All measurements were performed at room temperature. The relationship between the calculated/measured saturation magnetization and particle content is also discussed.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The role of {{inorganic}} {{content on}} physical properties of resin composites is well known. However, {{its influence on}} polymerization stress development has not been established. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate the influence of inorganic fraction on polymerization stress and its determinants, namely, volumetric shrinkage, elastic modulus and degree of conversion. Methods. Eight experimental composites containing 1 : 1 BisGMA (bisphenylglycidyl dimethacrylate) : TEGDMA (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (in mol) and barium glass at increasing concentrations from 25 to 60 vol. % (5 % increments) were tested. Stress was determined in a universal test machine using acrylic as bonding substrate. Nominal polymerization stress was obtained diving the maximum load by the cross-surface area. Shrinkage was measured using a water <b>picnometer.</b> Elastic modulus was obtained by three-point flexural test. Degree of conversion was determined by FT-Raman spectroscopy. Results. Polymerization stress and shrinkage showed inverse relationships with filler content (R(2) = 0. 965 and R(2) = 0. 966, respectively). Elastic modulus presented a direct correlation with inorganic content (R(2) = 0. 984). Degree of conversion did not vary significantly. Polymerization stress showed a strong direct correlation with shrinkage (R(2) = 0. 982) and inverse with elastic modulus (R(2) = 0. 966). Significance. High inorganic contents were associated with low polymerization stress values, which {{can be explained by the}} reduced volumetric shrinkage presented by heavily filled composites.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the battlements of the Tower of Palazzo Alliata Pietratagliata in Palermo, {{which is one of}} the most {{important}} examples of late medieval civil architecture in Sicily. The battlements are made by biocalcarenite and currently affected by a strong desegregation. In order to first characterize the stone some tests have been carried out on small samples collected in situ: chemical and morphological analysis through X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical polarized light microscopy (PLM), determination of total soluble salt content by measuring the conductivity and dosage of the anions and determination of the dimensional distribution of the pores. The second step was the testing of nanostructured products for the consolidation. Indeed, since for this purpose it was not possible to take the necessary amount of samples directly from the tower, the study proceeded on the limestone of Marsala, intended as the lithotype with structural and textural characteristics similar to the one used in the battlements of the tower. On these stone samples other analyses were performed: determination of bulk (MVA) and real (MVR) density through helium <b>picnometer,</b> water open porosity measurement through the method of the hydrostatic balance, x-ray diffractometry, porosimetry through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, after an induced aging of the specimens for simulating the desegregation of the stone, two nanostructured products for the consolidation, both based on nanosilica, have been applied. Then, two more cycles of diagnostics have been performed in order to understand the effect of the products on the stone. The results obtained through these various experimental techniques are reported and extensively discussed...|$|E
