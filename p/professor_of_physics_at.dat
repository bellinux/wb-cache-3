5|$|In 1871 {{he became}} the first Cavendish <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Physics</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge. Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E

She was buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend. Richard Muller, a <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>physics</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley, {{was part of}} a team that {{suggested that}} the Sun had an unseen stellar companion which caused this periodicity, with this hypothetical companion being dubbed Nemesis. Muller was already involved in the automated supernova searches underway at Leuschner, and began the search for Nemesis using the optical telescopes at Leuschner Observatory.|$|E

As one of the few American physicists with a deep understanding of the new field of quantum mechanics, he was hired by the University of California in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied {{engineering}} at the University of Rome La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>physics</b> <b>at</b> the University of Rome in 1932 and worked there until 1936, {{becoming one of the}} Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory's cyclotron deflector in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{became the}} Charles H. Swift Distinguished <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Physics</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago on 1 July 1945, {{although}} he did not depart the Los Alamos Laboratory with his family until 31 December 1945. He was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1945. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the Argonne National Laboratory on 1 July 1946, the first of the national laboratories established by the Manhattan Project. The short distance between Chicago and Argonne allowed Fermi to work at both places. At Argonne he continued experimental physics, investigating neutron scattering with Leona Marshall. He also discussed theoretical physics with Maria Mayer, helping her develop insights into spin–orbit coupling that would lead to her receiving the Nobel Prize.|$|E
