He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>health,</b> education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|Background: Inequality {{in income}} {{distribution}} {{leads to the}} incidence of poverty and increase of the gap between social classes. Evidences suggest that policymakers in many developed and developing countries {{are concerned about the}} effects of health care financing on income distribution. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> care on the distribution of income in rural and urban households in Iran. Methods: This descriptive- analytical, retrospective study was composed of a 3 -year time series. Data were collected from the household income and expenditure survey of the Statistical Centre of Iran. To measure the inequality in the distribution of resources, Lorenze Curve and Gini index estimations were used. Data were analyzed using Stata 11 software. Results: Gini coefficient for prepayment income, for the years 2008 to 2011, was respectively 0. 367, 0. 348 and 0. 369 for urban households and 0. 404, 0. 362, 0. 396, for rural households. The values of this index for post payment income in urban households were 0. 300, 0. 286 and 0. 302 and 0. 324, 0. 300, 0. 320 for rural households respectively. According to the results, <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> care services has led to a significant reduction in the Gini coefficient and increase of equity. Conclusion: The results showed that <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> care had a significant relationship with income distribution; it means that <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> care and households’ contribution in health care financing reduced the Gini coefficient and improved income distribution.

25|$|The {{pension benefit}} is not {{insignificant}} {{because it is}} estimated to cost 25% of salary over the entire 25-year period to fund a pension benefit of half the salary at age 55 for someone who starts employment at age 30. While this estimate {{is based on a}} 5% interest rate for discounting present values, a 3.5% annual salary growth rate and mortality according to the Annuity 2000 Merged Gender Mod 1 Table with ages set back 2.0 years. The key point to use the same assumptions to compare the annual yearly cost as a percent of salary for a half pay pension for someone starting at age 30 and retiring at age 62. The additional seven-year wait would drive the cost down to under 17% of salary annual cost. In essence, the MTA's proposal was a greater than 8% salary cut across the board. Using a slightly worse mortality table, the effective salary cut is still within the 7% to 6% salary cut range in terms of value given up. By not accepting the MTA pension offer, Local 100 of the TWU was not forced to a cut.

In May 1890 the ship was 'swapped' for , which had been intended to serve as flagship, but whose construction had been delayed. The crews of the two ships changed places, with Camperdown returning to the Channel fleet. Hoskins was impressed with Evan-Thomas' performance, placing him in charge of arrangements for refloating Victoria after she ran aground in the Gulf of Corinth in February 1891. Hoskins was in the habit of leaving the bridge during manoeuvres, so that his junior officers would get a chance acting as admiral to complete them.|$|E
25|$|Bieber's {{final round}} of {{collective}} bargaining talks came in 1993, but once more his control of the union's bargaining apparatus was apparent. In August and September 1992, GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, struck a critical GM parts plant with Yokich's permission, idling many other GM plants and throwing 40,000 other GM employees out of work. The Detroit Free Press later said that Bieber formally approve the strike, but Yokich was the quarterback who actually led the union through it. Despite the problems the Lordstown strike created, Bieber entered contract negotiations with the Big Three automakers seeking pledges against new layoffs. Bieber chose Ford as the strike target, and the company focused on reining in health care costs as its major goal. A new contract was reached on September 15, 1993, but the deal was considered a failure since Bieber was unable to win any major changes to the old agreement. Ford asked for a six-year rather than a three-year agreement, but gave this goal up and promised instead to increase pension payouts by 17 percent for certain veteran workers. The union agreed to a lower wage for new workers, and extend {{the time it took}} for new workers to reach the full wage. No changes were made to the wage or layoff income security provisions. However, Ford did agree to fully <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> care costs for all workers, but the workers gave up a part of their pay raises to do so. A contract with GM followed the next month. GM sought to reduce its pension costs, but failed. GM, however, forced workers to agree to use vacation time rather than use layoff pay during the summer production shutdown, and gained the right to stop paying layoff pay to workers who refuse jobs at nearby plants. The wage payment scheme was the same as the previous contract.|$|E
