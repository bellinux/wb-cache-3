40|$|This {{dissertation}} tackles {{the concept}} of market efficiency from three distinct topics in applied economics, from microfinance, to agriculture commodity market, and further to market microstructure of the most advanced economy. The first essay, entitled "Market Efficiency and Price Discovery Among Leading Rice Exporting Countries", focuses {{on the issue of}} rice market efficiency. The study establishes, under Johansen's procedure, that there are long-run price co-movements existing among the three major rice-exporting countries, and within the United States domestic markets, the long-run efficient linkage between spot and future prices of rough rice, as Chicago Board of Trade rough rice futures converge to United States Department of Agriculture rough rice prices in a cash market. Regarding the efficiency among the export market prices, results show that the hypothesis of market efficiency are rejected in two of the three pairs, namely Thai-Vietnam and ThaiUS(Arkansas). The Gonzalo & Granger (1995) decomposition method finds that the Thai and United States rice are dominant in the price discovery process. Within the United States domestic markets, the dominant is the futures market followed by the cash market of the rough rice and then the milled rice export price. The second essay, entitled "Determinants for Formal Credit and Informal Credit Access: The Case of Thai Farm Households", examines determinants for Thai agricultural households' participation in formal and its informal <b>parallel</b> <b>credit</b> markets. The study follows Heckman's two-stage selection model (1979) approach to determine the informal loan participation of Thai agricultural households. Results reveal that households tend to 'stick' to the credit market in which they were previously engaged. This finding reinforces the vicious cycle which makes it more difficult for farmers to get out of debt. Secondly, the study finds that wealthier households are less likely to access credit, {{and are more likely to}} participate in formal credits than their less wealthy peers. Results also show less probability of credit access between May and December coinciding with the planting and harvesting season accentuating the nature of loans as working-capital rather than consumption loans. Finally, the study discovers that households with owned farmland are more likely to participate in the formal credit market, while households with rented farmland are more likely to participate in the informal credit market stressing the use of owned land as collateral to participate in the former. The final essay, entitled "On the Challenge of Testing Weak-Form Market Efficiency using High Frequency Data", explores the issue of efficiency in microstructure of the Exchange-Traded-Fund (ETF). This essay shows that the profitability of a simple technical trading strategy hinges heavily on the way the Trades And Quotes (TAQ) dataset is filtered for mistakes and outliers. This paper uses ultra-high-frequency TAQ data that cover the time-span since the inception of the S&P 500 ETF from January 1993 to December 2006. First, a widely used filtering methodology proposed by Hasbrouck (2003) is adopted. Under this methodology, the technical trading strategy clearly outperforms the buy-and-hold benchmark. However, when a more appropriate (stringent) filtering methodology is used, the technical trading strategy clearly underperforms the buy-and-hold benchmark. This evidence suggests that studies that based their methodology on Hasbrouck's (2003) less stringent filtering criterion could produce misleading results...|$|E

50|$|Among {{the many}} {{conflicting}} and contested {{histories of the}} sarod, there is one that attributes its invention to the ancestors of the present-day sarod maestro, Amjad Ali Khan. Amjad Ali Khan’s ancestor Mohammad Hashmi Khan Bangash, a musician and horse trader, came to India with the Afghan rubab in the mid-18th century, and became a court musician to the Maharajah of Rewa (now in Madhya Pradesh). It was his descendants, notably his grandson Ghulam Ali Khan Bangash, a court musician in Gwalior, who changed the rubab into the sarod we know today. A <b>parallel</b> theory <b>credits</b> descendants of Madar Khan, Niyamatullah Khan in particular, with the same innovation around 1820. The sarod {{in its present form}} dates back to approximately 1820, when it started gaining recognition as a serious instrument in Rewa, Shahjahanpur, Gwalior and Lucknow. In the 20th century, the sarod received some finishing touches from Allauddin Khan, the performer-pedagogue from Maihar best known as sitarist Ravi Shankar's guru. However, {{as is the case with}} most young, evolving instruments, much work remains to be done in the area of sarod luthiery in order to achieve reliable customization, and precise replication of successful instruments. This reflects the general state of Indian instrument-making in the present day.|$|R

In such a way, the mobile banking {{will be able to}} cover all the types of applications demanded at the market level. The <b>parallel</b> processing of <b>credit</b> card bank transactions could be performed {{with the help of a}} grid network. Excluding some limitations, the grid processing offers huge opportunities to exploit the parallelism. For this reason, a lot of applications of waiting queues in grid processing were developed in the last years. Grid networks represent a distinctive and very modern field of the parallel and distributed processing. mobile banking, electronic transactions, electronic funds transfer, mobile terminal, PDA, SSL, parallel processing, grid networks, clusters...|$|R
2500|$|While {{best known}} for his accomplishments as a {{football}} player, Steketee also competed in other sports as well. In February 1919, he registered one of the highest physical fitness scores ever recorded in testing performed by the university. He was a member of Michigan's first swimming team, swam the 20-yard freestyle event in 9-3/5 seconds, and was also a skilled diver. Although gymnastics was not yet a varsity sport, he was an accomplished gymnast, and his work on the <b>parallel</b> bars was <b>credited</b> with expanding his range of motion so that he could kick higher than his head. As a senior, he also competed on the Michigan golf team. According to one account, he also played for Michigan's hockey team. His grandson, Michigan Court of Appeals Judge David H. Sawyer, said: [...] "He was one of these athletes who did everything." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the best practices {{to carry out}} the verification and validation (V&V) for a safety critical embedded system, part of a larger system-of-systems. The paper talks about the effectiveness of this strategy from performance and time schedule requirement of a project. The best practices employed for the V &Vis a modification of the conventional V&V approach. The proposed approach is iterative which introduces new testing methodologies apart from the conventional testing methodologies, an effective way of implementing the phases of the V&V and also analyzing the V&V results. The new testing methodologies include the random and non-real time testing apart from the static and dynamic tests. The process phases are logically carried out in <b>parallel</b> and <b>credit</b> {{of the results of the}} different phases are taken to ensure that the embedded system that goes for the field testing is bug free. The paper also demonstrates the iterative qualities of the process where the iterations successively find faults in the embedded system and executing the process within a stipulated time frame, thus maintaining the required reliability of the system. This approach is implemented in the most critical applications —-aerospace application where safety of the system cannot be compromised. The approach used a fixed number of iterations which is set to 4 in this application, with each iteration adding to the reliability and safety of the embedded system. Data collected and results observed are compared with a conventional approach for the same application and it is demonstrated that the strategy proposed reduces the time taken by 50...|$|R
30|$|The {{unsteadiness}} {{of capitalist}} economies is also {{center stage in}} Schumpeter’s (1934 [1912]) path-breaking work on innovation-driven economic development. At {{the core of his}} theory is entrepreneurship capable of carrying out new combinations of resources, i.e. innovations. Only the most gifted entrepreneurs are assumed to have such a pioneering capacity. In a rather complex argumentation he submitted that these entrepreneurs appear “in swarms”. A new swarm is supposed to enter the scene when the innovative boost brought to the economy by the previous swarm has ebbed away. Once the initial obstacles have been overcome, however, less entrepreneurial talent is required. Imitators get opportunities to participate in exploiting the innovation and massively invest and start producing in parallel. The result is a boom. It gets stuck once the unanticipated excess capacities bring down the profitability and a massive <b>parallel</b> repayment of <b>credits</b> induces an economic contraction. 4 Nonetheless, after each cycle, Schumpeter claims, the economy has been growing thanks to the innovation. Schumpeter's explanation is very much in line with the complex systems view. Yet, in the light of such a view, his growth optimism seems less well founded. It may be an ex post generalization of the growth that Schumpeter observed during the industrialization phase of his time. And it certainly rests on the hypothesis that (innovative) supply creates its own demand – which means that Schumpeter trusted Say’s law.|$|R
