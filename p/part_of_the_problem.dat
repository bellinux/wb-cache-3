5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of the storm is over, is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E
5|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> {{was that}} Bordeaux {{may not have}} {{appeared}} a plausible Allied target because {{it was out of}} range of fighter aircraft cover from the United Kingdom. Historian Terry Crowdy's analysis is that Ironside may have suffered simply from lack of resources. In common with other, higher-impact, Bodyguard deceptions it preyed on a concern that the Allies knew Hitler and the German High Command had discussed. Crowdy suggests that with physical deception, and more effort, Ironside could have succeeded {{in the same way as}} deceptions aimed against Calais, Normandy and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, who was Bishop of Winchester and papal legate in England, {{called an}} ecclesiastical council at Winchester on 29 August 1139, and summoned the king to answer {{charges that he}} had unlawfully arrested clergy. The king refused to attend, and sent a {{representative}} instead. After meeting for a few days, the council was dismissed on 1 September without deciding anything except {{to appeal to the}} pope in Rome. In the end, the appeal never reached Rome. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> confronting the assembled bishops was that Stephen had not expelled Roger's family from their ecclesiastical offices, merely their secular ones. Stephen's representatives argued that the bishops had given up their castles and money voluntarily to avoid secular charges. The defence taken by the king was not novel; it had been used before by William I and William II against Odo of Bayeux and William de St-Calais, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{starling}} family, Sturnidae, is {{an entirely}} Old World group apart from introductions elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common starling is the spotless starling. The non-migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian refugium during an ice age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest {{that it could be}} considered as a subspecies of the common starling. There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between nominate common starling and spotless starling. Although common starling remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The LB {{directors}} recognised that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> at Brighton {{was that}} the works was overwhelmed with work. In 1910 they purchased land at Lancing for a new carriage and wagon works, which was opened in 1912. This allowed Stroudley's carriage shed {{to be used as}} an overflow 'stock shed' by the locomotive works and the motive power depot. Locomotives repaired at Brighton were also sometimes taken to Lancing for their final painting.|$|E

Here, the offensive bogged down. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was that MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen when there were actually nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.|$|E
25|$|If {{asked to}} imagine the graph of the {{relationship}} y=ax2, one typically visualizes a range of values of x, but only one value of a. Of course a different value of a can be used, generating a different relation between x and y. Thus a is a parameter: it is less variable than the variable x or y, {{but it is not}} an explicit constant like the exponent2. More precisely, changing the parameter a gives a different (though related) problem, whereas the variations of the variables x and y (and their interrelation) are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> itself.|$|E

25|$|<b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in {{this debate}} {{revolved}} around {{the high level of}} abstraction and idealization that occurs in economic model-building on topics such as capital and economic growth. The original neoclassical models of aggregate growth presented by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan were straightforward, with simple results and uncomplicated conclusions which implied predictions about the real, empirical, world. The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that more sophisticated and complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model to say anything about the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E
25|$|The 01 was an {{experimental}} prototype built {{to explore and}} solve the problems stemming from prolonged supersonic flight. The sizable technological and operational uncertainties (no plane had yet been found able to cruise at over Mach 1.8 {{for long periods of}} time) were only one <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The weapon-related issues were the other. It took 18 months to build the 01 in Dassault's Saint-Cloud plant near Paris. In late 1958, the aircraft was transferred to the Melun-Villaroche flight testing area for finishing touches and ground tests. On 17 June 1959, French General Roland Glavany, on a five-year leave from the French Air Force since 1954, took the 01 into the air for its maiden flight.|$|E

Nothing today is known about the type's performance in combat, but of the eight on active service, no more than four appear to have been operational at any one time (October 1916). By February 1917, this number had dwindled to one aircraft only, and from April none remained in service. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> no doubt lay with their engines.

25|$|In 1616, {{long after}} his death, the Rule for Judges' Associations was published, {{which is now}} {{thought to have been}} written circa 1520-1540 and has long been {{attributed}} to Olaus Petri. These 42 general rules, a mixture of common law and statutes, have formed the basis of Scandinavian legal traditions, particularly in Sweden and Finland. Although some aspects seem outdated (particularly overt religious references), Olaus' twin values of legal certainty, and equity and justice, remain important to Nordic legal scholarship and practice. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in assessing his life, however, is that accounts of the trial which ended his legal career were also published long after his death, by Vasa's chronicler Erik Jöransson Tegel.|$|E

25|$|Shift {{workers who}} work {{throughout}} the night {{have been known to}} have far more accidents as opposed to daytime workers. This can be attributed to several factors, including fewer staff and fatigue; however, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> may be the workers poor working memory and poor performance skills due to poor memory consolidation. Both implicitly learned tasks and explicitly learned tasks improve by roughly 20% after a full nights sleep. Without an adequate nights sleep between learning a new task and performance of that task, performance fails to improve. Shift workers who are not given an adequate amount of sleep, particularly in the NREM stage, between learning and performance of a task will not perform as well as workers who maintain a standard sleep routine.|$|E
