40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare data of {{patients}} submitted to appendectomy for acute appendicitis at a <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> and at a private hospital. METHODS: A total of 200 medical records of patients submitted to appendectomy for acute appendicitis at a <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> (n= 100) and at a private hospital (n= 100), was reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Mean age and gender distribution were similar for patients of both hospitals. More patients had been previously evaluated by other physicians in the group of the <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> (n= 85) than of the private hospital (n= 13) (p< 0. 0001). Ultrasonography was performed more frequently on patients of the <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> (n= 56) than of the private hospital (n= 30) (p= 0. 0002). Length of hospital stay was longer at the <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> (3. 5 ± 2. 8 days) than at the private hospital (2. 5 ± 1. 7 days) (p= 0. 0024). Postoperative complications were more frequent at the <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> (n= 36) than at the private hospital (n= 20) (p< 0. 0117). Time to resume routine activities was longer for the <b>public</b> <b>hospital</b> (33. 2 ± 8. 3 days) than for the private hospital (16. 4 ± 5. 2 days) (p< 0. 0001). Multivariate logistic-regression analysis showed that the estimated probability of complicated appendicitis increased with the time interval between onset of symptoms and appendectomy (p< 0. 001). Independent risk factor associated with complicated appendicitis was the time interval between onset of symptoms and appendectomy (odds ratio 41. 65, 95 % CI {confidence interval} 2. 90 - 597. 49, p< 0. 0001) at the <b>public</b> <b>hospital.</b> There was no independent risk factor associated with complicated appendicitis at the private hospital.
