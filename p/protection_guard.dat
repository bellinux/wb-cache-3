50|$|The White Guard (Finnish: Suojeluskunta, plural: Suojeluskunnat, Finland-Swedish: Skyddskår, {{literally}} {{translated as}} Protection/Defense Corps) was a voluntary militia that emerged victorious over the socialist Red Guard {{as part of}} the Whites in the Finnish Civil War of 1918. The Finnish term Suojeluskunta has received many different approximations in English, including the literal translation Protection Corps, Security Guard, Civic Guards, National Guard, White Militia, Defence Corps, <b>Protection</b> <b>Guard,</b> and Protection Militia. They were generally known as the White Guard in the West due to their opposition to the communist Red Guards. In the White Army of Finland many participants were recruits, draftees and German trained Jägers and not part of the paramilitary as is sometimes erroneously thought.|$|E

KRIS was {{the most famous of}} organisations in which Sulawesi youths participated in during the fight against the Dutch. APIS was merged into KRIS soon after and Kahar became the first secretary of KRIS. In this capacity, Kahar was tasked with forming branches of KRIS in East and Central Java, thus the formation of KRIS branches in Solo, Yogyakarta, Madiun, Malang, Tegal, Magelang and Cilacap. It was during this period that Kahar met a group of political prisoners of the Dutch from the Nusakambangan and Cilacap prisons, who originated from the outer islands. He {{was on his way to}} Cilacap when he interceded and negotiated the release of the 800-odd prisoners, who were then given brief military training. This battalion became the core of Kahar's army.

40|$|Abstract — A {{new design}} concept named as active guard ring and related circuit {{implementation}} {{to improve the}} latch-up immunity of ICs are proposed. Using additional sensing circuit and active buffer to turn ON the electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection transistors, the large-dimensional ESD (or I/O) devices can provide or receive extra compensation current to the negative or positive current perturbation during the latch-up current test. The new proposed solution has been verified in 0. 6 -µm 5 V process to have much higher latch-up resistance compared with the conventional prevention method of guard ring in CMOS technology.

40|$|Over the internet, user {{profiling}} {{is one of}} the key {{activity in}} which user is asked to provide personal as well as professional information. The user is not aware about the misuse of profiling. It has been observed that user choose password from his/her profile unintentionally which create serious problem. The password has been taken from small domain which enables hackers to crack credentials by trying different fields of the user profile. To overcome this problem, proactive password checker is required which enforces password policies and prevents users from choosing easily guessable passwords. In this paper, we have introduced proactive password checking tool (Credential Proactive <b>Protection</b> <b>Guard)</b> based on user profiling which automatically check whether the given credential is safe or not and find the relationship between user profile and credentials. The focus of the current study is to check the level of association between different fields of user profile with credentials. The detailed technique, mechanism and tool of the proposed proactive password checker is also discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Today with {{increasing}} development of wireless systems, frequency utilization {{is limited by}} the problem of insufficient spectrum. In addition {{with increasing}} the implementation of the third generation (3 G) and integrated cellular phones that provide high speed packet-switching data transmission, we need more portion of spectrum. On the other hand analogue TV is moving to digital, so after this switch-over, there are some parts of the spectrum which will be free, and may be able to be used for other services. In this study we try to use the technology that is able to sense the spectrums over the DVB-T frequency band (primary system), and detect the existence/absence of primary users, and based on the detection of free spectrum, use that spectrum for LTE system as a secondary system, without harmful interference with primary users defined as Cognitive Radio (CR). Our study has shown that for coexistence and sharing between DVB-T and LTE-OFDM, at the same frequency band (662 - 742 MHz), the probability of interference is high and a large <b>protection</b> <b>guard</b> distance is needed. However when we apply Cognitive Radio technique, harmful interference can be avoided from secondary systems and improve spectrum efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a problem of}} spectrum sharing and coexistence between Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems and Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T). Previous {{studies have shown that}} coexistence of LTE and DVB-T without <b>protection</b> <b>guard</b> may cause interference. However by applying Cognitive Radio (CR) access technique, the probability of interference will decrease and the available spectrum can be used more efficiently. The main objective in spectrum sensing in a given band is to optimize the performance of the LTE as secondary network. This performance can be tested using a statistical analysis tool incorporating Monte Carlo and Spectral Emission Mask (SEM) technique. In addition, the CR access technique is used to sense the spectrum over the primary users ’ (Pu’s) band to detect the existence/absence of a Pu and use the free spectrum for LTE system as a secondary system. In this study coexistence of two different configurations was examined. The simulation results show that based on power level allocated to the secondary transmitter and in a given configuration, varying protection distances will be needed. Furthermore, tuning the transmission power levels and incorporating protection distances, can lead to more spectrum usage opportunities without harmful interference to the Pu (DVB-T receiver) ...|$|E

Simultaneous microstructure and precision measurements of physical parameters are obtained form vertical profils up to a depth of 100 m. The MST profiler is connected over a ME probe interface and the data aquisition and system control computer to the data evaluation and processing system. It can be operated in uprising and downrising mode. The profiler comprises a stainless steel housing (700 mm length, 155 mm diameter), microstructure and precision sensors with <b>protection</b> <b>guard,</b> removable weights, a ring of brushes to improve the dynamic stability, a recovery ring, a pull-relief and the output cable. Values measured by the sensors include temperature, shearing, vibration and electric conductivity.
