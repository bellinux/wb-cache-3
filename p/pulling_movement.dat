The proposed analysis refers to choices made by ho. re. ca. (hotel, restaurant, catering) activity decision-making (manager, chief) and final business consumers. Although they are end consumers due to final freight destination or their freight consumption, they have a decisional choice process that can be assumed similar to retailer's one.

40|$|International Journal of Exercise Science 5 (3) : 183 - 195, 2012. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if either of the two deadlift starting positions would yield a more efficient movement than the other; (1) the traditional Olympic lifting and deadlift starting position with the barbell over the metatarsalphalangeal joint and under the acromioclavicular joint or (2) an experimental alignment with the bar over the navicular bone and under the most inferior and medial aspect of the scapular spine. This second starting position, developed as a teaching convention, differs from the historical alignment of toes-barbell-shoulder joint and is also proposed to reduce horizontal displacement of the bar thus minimizing the amount of work needed to complete the movement. It was hypothesized that the experimental alignment would produce a more efficient <b>pulling</b> <b>movement</b> compared to a traditional starting alignment. Efficiency was defined as a barbell path approaching linear movement, with larger horizontal displacements being considered less efficient than smaller displacements. Six intermediate level weightlifters, 23. 8 ± 1. 9 years of age, 164. 7 ± 7. 9 cm in height, 81. 5 ± 31. 9 kg in body mass, completed a series of deadlifts under both alignment conditions with 90 % of their self-reported 1 RM (169. 0 ± 58. 17 kg). Posterior horizontal barbell displacement was measured by video-analysis. In the traditional alignment (metatarsalphalangeal-bar-acromioclavicular) displacement was 66. 7 ± 12. 9 mm and was 37. 5 ± 13. 7 mm in the experiment alignment (navicular-bar-scapular spine).

40|$|Fine-needle {{aspiration}} biopsy (FNAB) {{has been}} used throughout {{the world as a}} diagnos-tic tool for breast tumors. However, despite being a simple and practical procedure, the insertion technique has some peculiarities that must be taken into consideration. 1 Because of its motility, the operator must keep the lump in a single position with one hand. Thus, only the other hand will be free to hold the syringe, pull the plunger (to generate a vacuum inside the syringe) and make the forward and backward move-ments needed for locating and puncturing the tumor. The three maneuvers are simple; however, when performed at the same time, uneven results can ensue, as sometimes the volume of the aspirate can be greater or smaller. In addition, the <b>pulling</b> <b>movement</b> exerted on the plunger can occasionally dis-tract the operator, thereby causing a change in needle direction. These difficulties may make this method less than precise. 1, 2 In order to correct such difficulties, several health units have been using a pistol-grip mechanical syringe holder, first developed by Franzen and later modified by several manufacturing companies. 3 This pistol-grip mechanical syringe holder makes fine-needle aspiration biopsy much easier to perform. However, the use of the holder causes the distance between the tumor and the hand holding the device to increase. This decreases the sensitivity of the operator’s touch 4 and, moreover, the size of the assembled device frequently frightens patients, who may become less willing to collaborate in the procedure. 5 The present authors have developed a dif-ferent device with the purpose of facilitating the procedure and not frightening the patient. The idea consists of the interposition of a spring between the lateral wings of a disposable syringe and the plunger, so that the spring can exert a force on the plunger to cause distal traction, thus creating the required negative pressure inside the syringe. This vacuum would then be responsible for suctioning the collected material into the hollow needle. The operator no longer needs to actually create the vacuum, as the device does it by itself (Figure 1). This device has therefore been named the “auto-vacuum device”. 6 Initially, the physical characteristics of a steel spring that would fit into a 5 -ml syringe were defined at the School of Mechanica...|$|E

The result {{of this research was}} in the form of 18 rating scale items which were divided into 5 tests, (1) the test of 100 -meter-crawl-style swimming which consisted of 7 rating scale items: (a) body position in crawl style, (b) downward movement of the legs in crawl style, (c) inward arm movement phases in crawl style, (d) the arm pushing movement in crawl style, (e) the arm recovery movement in crawl style, (f) breathing in crawl style, and (g) effectiveness and efficiency movement in crawl style; (2) the technique and ability in 50 -meter-breaststroke-style swimming which consisted of 7 rating scale items: (a) body position in breaststroke style, (b) downward movement of the legs in crawl style, (c) gliding arm movement phases in breast stroke style, (d) the arm <b>pulling</b> <b>movement</b> in breaststroke style, (e) the arm recovery movement after pulling in breaststroke style, (f) breathing in breast stroke style, and (g) effectiveness and efficiency movement in breaststroke style; (3) live-guard swimming which consisted of 2 rating scale items: (a) the leg movement in live-guard swimming, and (b) the holding technique; (4) diving which consisted of 2 rating scale items: (a) body positioning in upward and downward movement in diving, and (b) the arm and leg movement in diving; (5) floating which consisted of 1 rating scale item: (a) the arm and leg movement when floating. The quality of the instruments was demonstrated in the validity, reliability, and objectivity. The validity in this research was measured by 3 judges using criteria and content validity. The reliability coefficient was measured using Spearman. The reliability index of the whole scale was 0. 934. The reliability indexes of crawl style, breaststroke style, live-guard swimming, diving, and floating were 0. 893, 0. 875, 0. 842, 0. 821, and 0. 812 subsequently. The objectivity among the judges was measured using correlation between judges. The correlation between judge I and judge II was 0. 829. The correlation between judge II and judge III was 0. 824. The correlation between judge I and judge III was 0. 848. Based on the values of correlation, it could be determined that the three judges possessed high correlation so that the judges provided objective ratings.

40|$|The {{effect on}} {{reaction}} time (RT) and anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) of unexpectedly changing stance conditions was studied using a push or <b>pull</b> arm <b>movement</b> task. The {{aim was to}} evaluate the modifiability of RT and APA by an external perturbation associated with an automatic compensatory reaction. Subjects standing on a moveable platform were asked to push or pull a rigid handle as quickly and as strongly as possible {{in response to the}} ‘go-signal’, a visual signal from a green or red light-emitting diode. Forward and backward translations of the platform were randomly induced at four time intervals after the go-signal. In some experiments to detect unspecific arousal there were no platform translations but an acoustic signal was given before the go-signal. Surface electromyographic activity (EMG) of upper arm and lower leg muscles was analysed. During the push task both RT and the duration of APA (onset of APA till the force signal indicating hand action) were shorter during backward than during forward translation. During the pull task the effect of platform translations was the reverse. The delay between go-signal and onset of APA remained constant. Consequently, RT and APA became shorter when the platform was translated {{in the same direction as}} that in which the upper body was displaced by the push or <b>pull</b> <b>movement,</b> and longer when it was translated in the opposite direction. The effects were maximal when translations were induced 250 ms after the go-signal, but a difference was detected up to 375 ms. Furthermore, with forward and backward platform translations RT was shorter when the translations were induced early rather than late after the go-signal. This was associated with a shortening of the delay between the go-signal and onset of APA, while APA duration remained constant. The shortened RT was in the range of that obtained when an acoustic signal was given just before the go-signal. It is concluded that (i) both the RT and the duration of APA can be modified by a translation of the support surface in a functionally appropriate way by updating the internal representation of the actual stance condition within the central nervous system. Both RT and APA are shortened when the body displacement induced by the push or <b>pull</b> <b>movement</b> and platform translation have the same direction; conversely, an inappropriate translation of the feet requires a greater APA and leads to a longer RT; (ii) both APA and RT are modifiable by platform translation for more than half the time between the go-signal and the focal push or pull movement; (iii) an unspecific effect of platform translation on RT can be identified; it may be mediated by a different neuronal substrate...|$|R

By contrast, animal adhesive pads {{are able to}} self-clean and can be reused millions of times over a lifetime with little reduction in adhesion. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this ability are still unclear. Here we test in adhesive pads of stick insects (Carausius morosus) (1) whether self-cleaning is enhanced by the liquid pad secretion, and (2) whether alternating push-pull movements aid the removal of particles. We measured attachment forces of insect pads on glass after contamination with 10 m polystyrene beads. While the amount of fluid present on the pad showed {{no effect on the}} pads' susceptibility to contamination, the recovery of adhesive forces after contamination was faster when higher fluid levels were present.

However, self-report is subject to socially desirable responding and phallometry is prone to faking and can be invasive (Kalmus & Beech, 2005). As a result, many researchers have set out to develop more reliable and less invasive methods, commonly termed indirect measures (Snowden et al., 2011). However, most of these measures are still in their infancy, difficult to implement in practice, and only provide a single outcome variable (e. g., response-latency). Drawing upon previous research (Hofmann et al., 2009; Kraus & Hofmann, 2014), a new tablet PC application (M-TASI; Multimodal Tablet for Assessing Sexual Interest) has been developed, which will be presented in this poster. On the M-TASI, individuals are shown a series of pictures (e. g., children and adults), which they either swipe downwards (towards them) or upwards (away from them) to indicate liking or disliking the picture, respectively. The M-TASI records the speed at which the images are swiped, along with reaction times and ‘touch’ data (i. e., where one touches the image). This single tool, therefore, provides converging information to determine an individual’s sexual preference. The theoretical underpinning is based on the well-supported notion that <b>pulling</b> <b>movements</b> are associated with ‘approaching’ a desired object, while pushing movements are associated with ‘avoiding’ undesired objects (Markman & Brendl, 2005). The M-TASI will be a beneficial new tool for clinicians as it adopts an indirect approach; is easy to implement; and provides multiple outcomes variables. Laws (2009) stated that the future of sexual preference assessment belongs to new technologies and we propose that the M-TASI epitomises this sentiment...|$|R
