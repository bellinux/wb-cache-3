Soil erosion is a process that can irreparably reduce the productive capacity of an agroecosystem. Dense cover crop stands physically slow down the velocity of rainfall before it contacts the soil surface, preventing soil splashing and erosive surface runoff (Romkens et al. 1990). Additionally, vast cover crop root networks help anchor the soil in place and increase soil porosity, creating suitable habitat networks for soil macrofauna (Tomlin et al. 1995).

HDAC 6 deacetylase and ubiquitin-binding activities were both required for recovery of reduced mitochondrial metabolic activity due to the loss of HDAC 6. Hsp 90, a substrate of HDAC 6, localizes to mitochondria and partly mediates the regulation of mitochondrial metabolic activity by HDAC 6. Our finding suggests that HDAC 6 regulates mitochondrial metabolism and might serve as a cellular homeostasis surveillance factor...|$|E
