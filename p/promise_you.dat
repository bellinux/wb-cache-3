500|$|Designer Milton Knight {{recalled}} that [...] "audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did." [...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. I have, and I will now <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> that if you liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E

I can <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win.

The Colts' scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning's attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts' staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying [...] "I'll leave you with this thought.

[...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to you about that, I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> I will be in big trouble".

500|$|In 2006, Italy and Switzerland participated for {{the first}} time. The Italian team, at the time ranked 17th in the world, had {{qualified}} because Italy was the host nation. They were outscored 32–1 in three games and IIHF president René Fasel declared his intention to make future tournaments more competitive and not allow host nations to automatically qualify. The Canadian team started the tournament by outscoring opponents 36–1 over three games. American defenceman Angela Ruggiero accused the team of running up the score and warned that the event's Olympic status could be called into question due to a perceived lack of competitive teams. In response, René Fasel stated that other women's teams were improving {{and that there was}} similar dominance {{in the early years of}} the men's tournament but the sport continued to grow. He added, [...] "I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> that it won't take the [...] women 64 years to win"—in reference to the Swedish men's team inability to defeat Canada in Olympic play until 1984 (the Swedish women's team defeated Canada {{for the first}} time at the 2008 4 Nations Cup).|$|E

It'll be a mixture of stuff from my long career, stuff from my years with Pink Floyd, some new things. Probably 75% of it will be old material and 25% will be new, but it will be all connected by a general theme. It will be a cool show, I <b>promise</b> <b>you.</b> It'll be spectacular like all my shows have been." [...] It is intended that the 44-date Us + Them Tour would visit the United States and Canada, showcase Waters' highlights, start on 26 May 2017 in Kansas City, MO and end on 29 October 2017 in Vancouver, BC.

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 2015, Usher {{visited his}} former {{hometown}} Chattanooga making a surprise visit at Dalewood Middle School, the Orange Grove Center and the Center for the Creative Arts. Dalewood {{is the middle}} school he attended before moving to Atlanta and the school is not that {{far away from the}} road [...] "Usher Raymond Parkway" [...] that was presented to Usher in 2001. Usher spoke to students at the Center for the Creative arts explaining the importance of education. His effort of giving back was to honor the legacy of his grandmother who passed early in the year. Who he called Nanny expressed to singer at a young age [...] "whatever you want to do, I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> can do it. We're going to look back one day, your teachers and I, and be very proud of you". At CCC, a donation of an undisclosed amount was made by the singer that would pay for new surfaces for the floors of two dance studios, a new digital lighting board and LED lights for the performing arts school's auditorium. Usher's second stop was Orange Grove Center, a nonprofit that serves adults and children with intellectual disabilities. There, he took part in a groundbreaking for planned improvements to the facility's track, said development director Heidi Hoffecker. The track will be named the Nancy Lackey Memorial Track to honor his grandmother.|$|E
500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I <b>promise</b> <b>you</b> that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
