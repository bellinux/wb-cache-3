Thus, interlaced scanning is still widely used in various television encoding systems and camcorder recording modes, in spite of unavoidable shortcomings. Standard definition television (SDTV) uses one of the three analog television encoding standards known as NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. All of them use interlaced scanning. In the case of camcorders, both scanning modes are supported during recording, but interlaced scanning is set as the default scanning mode in most camcorders.|$|R

25|$|Sony added TV {{output to}} the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can output in a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a <b>progressive</b> <b>scan</b> signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support <b>progressive</b> <b>scan.</b> They are also rendered at the 480×272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720×480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled, meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720×480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released {{a new version of the}} remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The Serial Port is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|E

The capacity of the battery was also reduced by ⅓ but the run time remained the same as the previous model due to lower power consumption. Older model batteries will still work and they extend the amount of playing time. The PSP Slim & Lite has a new gloss finish. Its serial port was also modified in order to accommodate a new video-out feature (while rendering older PSP remote controls incompatible). On a PSP-2000, PSP games will only output to external monitors or TVs in <b>progressive</b> <b>scan</b> mode, so that televisions incapable of supporting <b>progressive</b> <b>scan</b> will not display PSP games; non-game video will output in either progressive or interlaced mode. USB charging was also made possible. Buttons are also reportedly more responsive on the PSP-2000.

Criticisms about Viewtiful Joe have been few but consistent among reviews. IGN complained of the game's lack of boss variety. GameSpy has concurred, noting that the bosses were too easy due to a powerful attack that the player can perform. Reviewers have also criticized the lack of <b>progressive</b> <b>scan</b> in the game's PlayStation 2 port.

Producer Atsushi Inaba considered the game a success, achieving his goals of training staff, keeping a small budget, and selling well. However, these numbers were lower than Capcom expected, prompting the publisher to port Viewtiful Joe to PlayStation 2 in 2004, with expanded features.

With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach {{people who had}} not played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way. Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended Wii Sports to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this. Wii Sports {{was designed as a}} simple introductory line meant to offer something for both gamers and non-gamers. Sports were chosen as the theme because of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. Gameplay like running towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity. At one point in development, Mario characters were used, but were removed because of feedback from players who preferred Miis. The game supports a [...] and <b>progressive</b> <b>scan,</b> runs at 60 frames per second, and makes use of the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret the player's motion. Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible. Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii solely to play Wii Sports, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo believed players {{would be more likely to}} play Wii Sports through this distribution method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would increase its popularity by word of mouth.|$|E
