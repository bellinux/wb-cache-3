40|$|Abstract: The article {{evaluates the}} fiscal policy {{initiatives}} during the Great {{recession in the}} united states. It argues that, although the nonconventional fiscal policies targeted to the financial sector dwarfed conventional countercyclical stabilization efforts directed to the real sector, the relatively disappointing impact on employment was not only due to misdirected funding priorities, but also due to an exclusive and ill-advised focus on the output gap {{rather than on the}} employment gap. The paper argues further that conventional <b>pump</b> <b>priming</b> <b>policies</b> are incapable of closing this employment gap. To tackle the formidable labor market challenges observed {{in the united states over}} the past few decades, policy can benefit from a fundamental reorientation away from trickle-down Keynesianism and toward what is termed here “a bottom-up approach ” to fiscal policy. This approach also reconsiders the nature of countercyclical government stabilizers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether damage after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest can be diminished by changing <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> components when reinstituting cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Fifteen piglets (2 - 3 months old) were cooled to 19 °C by using the alpha-stat pH strategy. Five were cooled and rewarmed without ischemia (control animals), and the other 10 piglets underwent 90 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Of these, 5 were rewarmed and reperfused without altering the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit blood prime. In the other 5 animals, the bypass blood prime was modified (leukocyte depleted, hypocalcemic, hypermagnesemic, pH-stat, normoxic, mannitol, and an Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor) during circulatory arrest before starting warm reperfusion. Oxidant injury was assessed {{on the basis of}} conjugated dienes, vascular changes on the basis of endothelin levels, myocardial function on the basis of cardiac output and dopamine need, lung injury on the basis of pulmonary vascular resistance and oxygenation, and cellular damage on the basis of release of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase. Neurologic assessment (score 0, normal; score 500, brain death) was done 6 hours after discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Compared with animals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass without ischemia (control animals), deep hypothermic circulatory arrest without modification of the reperfusate produced an oxidant injury (conjugated dienes increased 0. 78 vs 1. 71 absorbance (Abs) 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs control animals), depressed cardiac output (6. 0 vs 4. 0 L/min, P <. 05 vs control subjects), prolonged dopamine need (P <. 001 vs control subjects), elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (74 % vs 197 %, P <. 05 vs control subjects), reduced oxygenation (P <. 01 vs control subjects), increased neurologic injury (56 vs 244, P <. 001 vs control subjects), and increased release of creatine kinase (2695 vs 6974 U/L, P <. 05 vs control subjects), aspartate aminotransferase (144 vs 229 U/L), and endothelin (1. 02 vs 2. 56 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs control subjects). Conversely, the oxidant injury was markedly limited (conjugated dienes of 0. 85 ± 0. 09 Abs 240 nmol/L per 0. 5 mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> with modification of cardiopulmonary bypass prime, resulting in increased cardiac output (5. 1 ± 0. 8 L/min), minimal dopamine need (P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> no increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (44 % ± 31 %, P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> or endothelin levels (0. 64 ± 0. 15 pg/mL, P <. 001 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> complete recovery of oxygenation (P <. 01 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> reduced neurologic damage (144 ± 33, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime),</b> and lower release of aspartate aminotransferase (124 ± 23 U/L, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime)</b> and creatine kinase (3366 ± 918, P <. 05 vs unmodified <b>pump</b> <b>prime).</b> Conclusions: A global reperfusion injury after deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was identified and changed. The injury is mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals, resulting in organ and endothelial dysfunction. Modification of global organ and endothelial damage is achieved by modifying the blood prime in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit to deliver a controlled global reperfusate when reinstituting bypass.

30|$|Although {{commonly}} used in pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) optimal dose and timing of steroid administration is unclear. We hypothesized that early administration of a {{commonly used}} dose of methylprednisolone given the evening before surgery (ultra-early) {{would be more effective}} in decreasing CPB-related inflammatory response than when given at induction of anesthesia (early) or in <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> (standard).|$|R
30|$|The use of {{corticosteroids}} as a {{means of}} diminishing the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has become a standard of practice in many institutions (Jonas 2004). Administration regimens vary since clear evidence of benefit or superiority of a particular timing remains elusive. However the administration of one dose of corticosteroid in <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> is a standard of practice at many centres and is the preferred timing described in many studies (Hauser et al. 1998). In a survey of 36 international centres 97 % of respondents used steroids in some cases and of these 83 % used a single dose (Checcia et al. 2005). Since corticosteroids require approximately 2  hours for RNA transcription, and longer for maximal effects, administration in the <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> may be too late to reduce the inflammatory response triggered by exposure to extracorporeal circulation (Ito et al. 1992; Xu et al. 1995).|$|R

Urinary excretion of microalbumin and retinol binding protein are more sensitive than routine biochemical tests of renal function after cardiac surgery. We performed a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial in cardiac surgical patients with pre-operative plasma creatinine < 130 mu mol. l(- 1). Twenty patients received 0. 5 g. kg(- 1) of mannitol in the <b>pump</b> <b>prime,</b> whereas 20 control patients received an equivalent volume of Hartmann's solution. Blood and urine samples were taken on the day before surgery and daily for 5 days postoperatively for measurement of plasma urea and creatinine, urinary creatinine, retinol binding protein and microalbumin.

The {{aim of this study}} was to find whether muscle compartment pressure was affected by the addition of albumin and mannitol to the <b>pump</b> <b>prime,</b> heparin coating or leukocyte depletion. Additionally, we studied the relationship between intraocular pressure and lower leg muscle compartment pressure. Edema during and following cardiac surgery is due to hemodynamic, osmotic and inflammatory changes, according to Starling's Law. We attempted to influence the osmotic balance and reduce the inflammatory response in order to reduce the edema. METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent cardiac surgery were randomly allocated into four groups. Group A received albumin and mannitol into the <b>pump</b> <b>prime.</b> Group B had an, heparin-coated perfusion system, Group C had a leukocyte-depletion arterial line filter and Group D was the control group, where intraocular pressure was also measured. RESULTS: Lower leg muscle compartment pressure increased significantly during and after cardiac surgery in all groups, but this increase was significantly less in Group A than in the control group 24 h after surgery. No correlation was found between muscular compartment pressure and intraocular pressure. The intraocular pressure profile is different from the muscular compartment pressure and recovers much faster. CONCLUSION: Lower leg muscle compartment pressure and intraocular pressure behave differently during and after cardiac surgery. Albumin and mannitol added to the <b>pump</b> <b>prime</b> decreases muscle compartment pressure after cardiac surgery...|$|R
