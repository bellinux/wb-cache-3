40|$|Product {{configuration}} is a {{key technology}} in today’s highly specialized economy. Within the scope of state-of-the-art B 2 B frameworks and eProcurement solutions, various initiatives {{take into account the}} <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>configuration</b> services. However, they all are based on the idea of defining quasi-standards 2 for many-to-many relationships between customers and vendors. When moving towards networked markets, where suppliers dynamically form supply-side consortia, more flexible approaches to B 2 B integration become necessary. The emerging paradigm of Web services has therefore a huge potential in business application integration. This paper presents an application scenario for configuration Web services, that is currently under development in the research project CAWICOMS. An ontology-based approach allows the advertisement of services and a configuration specific protocol defines the operational processes. However, the lack of widely adopted standards for the semantic annotation of Web services is still a major shortcoming of current Web technology...|$|E

30|$|For {{scientific}} applications {{usually a}} parallel execution environment such as MPI, OpenMP, or MapReduce is utilized. Most of these environments provide a huge set <b>of</b> <b>configuration</b> parameters that may impact the runtime of an application. For example, the Apache Hadoop framework supports an enormous {{set of parameters}} enabling to specify the number of map and reduce tasks, the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> the Java Virtual Machines, or how many tasks can be executed in parallel (on a single machine). The <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> a “good” <b>configuration</b> for such a system can be very complex. With our approach, those parameters that {{should be taken into}} account by the adaptive framework are defined in the environment descriptor and set upon job submission time to improve the behavior of the system for a specific job.|$|R
40|$|Product {{configuration}} {{is a major}} commercial {{application of}} knowledge-based systems, and joint configuration by multiple business partners is becoming a key application in today's highly specialized economy. The required integration <b>of</b> <b>configuration</b> knowledge is a challenging task due to the variety of knowledge representation formalisms used in commercial configurators. Ontology languages such as DAML+OIL provide an infrastructure for the Semantic Web {{with the goal of}} intelligent information integration. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the applicability of such languages for building configuration knowledge bases. We join the two major streams in knowledge-based configuration (description logics on one hand and predicate logic, including constraint-based and resource-balancing techniques on the other) by giving a description logic based definition <b>of</b> a <b>configuration</b> task and showing its equivalence with existing consistency-based definitions. We show that Semantic Web ontology languages can be applied to configuration by formalizing language elements relevant for building configuration knowledge bases and discuss extensions needed in order to provide full fledged configuration knowledge representation. The result is a common basis for current configuration approaches on the Semantic Web that is necessary for the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> joint <b>configuration</b> services...|$|R

The World Wide Web has appeared as the vehicle to share information and facilitate businesses like the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> simple <b>configuration</b> capabilities to users. Ontologies have gained acceptance within the research community as the way to make applications interoperable and drive the next intelligent generation of the World Wide Web known as the Semantic Web that many consider as a future enabler of future advance forms of collaborative e-business. It is just this consideration what has motivated the OBELIX * consortium to do research on multi-component product configuration, since collaborative design scenarios over the (Semantic) Web will become a future reality, but have not been researched in depth yet.

40|$|Abstract. The {{visualization}} of ontologies is a challenging task {{especially if they}} are large. We will demonstrate StarLion, a system providing exploratory visualizations which enhance the user understanding. StarLion combines many of the existing visualization methods with some novel features for providing better 2 D layouts. Specifically, one distinctive feature of StarLion is the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> Star-like graphs of variable radius whose layout is derived by a Force Directed Placement algorithm (FDPA) specially adapted for RDF Schemas. This approach enables users to gradually explore and navigate through the entire ontology without overloading them. StarLion can also handle multiple namespaces, a very useful feature for assisting the understanding of interdependent ontologies. Another distinctive characteristic of StarLion is the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> a novel method for configuring automatically the FDPA parameters based on layout quality metrics, and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> an interactive <b>configuration</b> method offered via an intuitive tool-bar. ...|$|R

Methods Female Wistar rats were treated with Midazolam (MDZ, 1. 0 mg. kg- 1) and were tested for their exploratory behaviour in either the EPM 10 O/E&# 8710;Lux or EPM 96 O/E&# 8710;Lux. Results A multiple regression analysis indicated that the O/E&# 8710;Lux is negatively associated with the %Open arm entries and %Open arm time, suggesting that as O/E&# 8710;Lux increases, the open arm exploration decreases. The estrous cycle phase did not influence the open-arm exploration in either EPM. MDZ- induced anxiolysis was detected in 96 O/E&# 8710;Lux EPM in all phases of the EC. Discussion Results {{of this study suggest}} the importance of the O/E&# 8710;Lux to establish the arm preference in the EPM, and to preserve the predictive validity of the EPM...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Internet, many Internet {{services}} have become mission critical. Network operators are therefore under tremendous pressure to make their networks highly available. Yet, network operators also need to regularly change the configuration (i. e., reconfigure) of their networks to deploy new services or upgrade network devices. Despite being necessary, such reconfiguration operations are an important source of concerns as they can lead to severe disruptions. In this thesis, we aim at enabling disruption-free routing reconfiguration which consists in modifying the way a running network forwards traffic without incurring any traffic losses. We consider both intradomain and interdomain routing protocols, the two major routing protocol families used in today's Internet. In both cases, we prove {{that it is necessary to}} precisely order the reconfiguration operations. Intuitively, this ordering is such that each intermediate state maintains the network global correctness. Unfortunately, we show that such an ordering does not always exist. Moreover, we prove that deciding if a disruption-free reconfiguration ordering exists is computationally hard (i. e., NP-hard). Despite the inherent complexity, we manage to enable disruption-free reconfiguration in most reconfiguration scenarios and to reduce significantly the number of anomalies in the rest of them. Our techniques include efficient ordering algorithms, configuration guidelines and practical reconfiguration procedures. By combining theory and practice, we also implement and evaluate a reconfiguration framework which completely automates the reconfiguration process including the live <b>provisioning</b> <b>of</b> device <b>configurations.</b> (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{notion of}} soft {{state has been}} {{introduced}} in packet-switched networks to achieve particular services for end-to-end communications, such as quality-of-service <b>provisioning</b> and <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> stateful packet filters. Protocols built upon soft state principles {{were believed to be}} simple, however in practice they are far more complex. An important issue with such protocols is to ensure their operations to be error-free and deadlock-free. In the paper the use of formal techniques is proposed, specifically, Specification and Description Language (SDL) and Message Sequence Charts (MSCs), for modelling, analysis and validation of soft-state protocols. Based on a general state management system that identifies their most representative behaviour, an extensive study on modelling and validating soft-state protocols with SDL/MSCs is presented, and it is shown that design flaws and ambiguity introduced in informally specified, textual protocols can be avoided if a protocol is formally modelled. ...|$|R

40|$|We propose and {{evaluate}} a passive measurement methodology that estimates {{the distribution of}} Round-Trip Times (RTTs) for the TCP connections that flow through a network link. Such an RTT distribution is important in buffer <b>provisioning,</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> active queue management, and detection of congestion unresponsive traffic. The proposed methodology is based on two techniques. The first technique is applicable to TCP caller-to-callee flows, and {{it is based on}} the 3 -way handshake messages. The second technique is applicable to callee-to-caller flows, when the callee transfers a number of MSS segments to the caller, and {{it is based on the}} slow-start phase of TCP. The complete estimation algorithm reports an RTT for 55 - 85 % of the TCP workload, in terms of bytes, in the traces that we examined. Verification experiments show that about 90 % of the passive measurements are within 10 % or 5 ms, whichever is larger, of the RTT that ping would measure. Also, measurements on several NLANR traces show that the two estimation techniques agree within 25 ms for 70 - 80 % of the processed TCP connections. We also apply the estimation methodology on a number of NLANR traces and examine the variability of the measured RTT distributions in both short and long timescales...|$|R
40|$|Software Defined Networking (SDN) is {{a rising}} {{networking}} paradigm {{based on the}} concept of separation between network control plane and data forwarding plane in order to improve network utilization, simplify management, reduce operating costs and enhance the <b>provisioning</b> and <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> network and telecommunication systems.

The SDN Control Layer conveys all the service logic in its core element, namely the controller, that is failure-prone and thus its performance, reliability and availability are key issues for a careful design and deployment. Some unified frameworks have been proposed to assess performance and reliability/availability in data networks: these approaches are often called performability analysis. In this paper, we address a performability analysis aimed at selecting the most suitable redundancy architecture of an SDN controller hosting a certain number of virtual operator instances by solving a redundancy optimization problem on behalf of Universal Generating Function (UGF) approach conveniently tailored for a multivariate case...|$|R
