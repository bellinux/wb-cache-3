40|$|Salicornia is a {{leafless}} C 3 annual halophyte with a greatest economic potential. A {{field study}} was conducted to evaluate Salicornia (Salicornia europaea) biomass production and feed quality and its effect on soil quality in the Mediterranean Karatas-Adana region of the Southern Turkey. Salicornia biomass, groundwater, and soils were randomly sampled from adjoining Unprotected (uncontrolled mixed grazing) and <b>Protected</b> (no grazing) <b>sites.</b> Results showed that the <b>Protected</b> <b>site</b> produced a higher amount of total (shoot and root), root, and shoot fresh biomass by 22, 45, and 12 %, respectively as compared with the Unprotected site. Total, root, and shoot dry biomass production was also higher in the <b>Protected</b> <b>site.</b> Biomass collected from the <b>Protected</b> <b>site</b> had a significantly lower content of acid detergent fiber, but higher content of digestible dry-matter and relative feed values than in biomass collected from the Unprotected site. Iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) contents were 1. 9 and 1. 8 times higher in the <b>Protected</b> <b>site</b> than in the Unprotected site. Groundwater and soil electrical conductivities were significantly lower in the <b>Protected</b> <b>site</b> than in the Unprotected site. While the soil microbial biomass, active carbon, and intermediate C pools were 36, 21 and 56 % higher, respectively, the specific maintenance respiration rates were lower (by 23 %) in the <b>Protected</b> <b>site</b> than in the Unprotected site. Results suggested that increased biomass yield of Salicornia with higher feed quality under Protection {{could be used as a}} forage crop to remediate coastal saline soils with a high water-table...|$|R

25|$|Motivated by {{a desire}} to halt looting, curb pseudoarchaeology, and to help {{preserve}} archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns. They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from <b>protected</b> <b>sites,</b> and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists. Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.|$|E

The Tabonuco forest has many of the characteristics for which tropical rain forests are noted. The forest canopy has three levels: an upper level that may be as much as 35% Tabonuco, a lower canopy, and an under story. The second most prominent tree in this forest type, the Montillo (Sloanea berteroana), has large buttress roots, typical of many rain forest trees. Such roots help support the heavy canopy of large trees growing in very wet soil. The forest floor is only scarcely vegetated, but the forest canopy is rich with aerial plants: bromeliads, orchids, vines, and arboreal ferns. The tabonuco type dominates in the subtropical wet life zone.|$|E
2500|$|Aesthetically, the {{appearance}} of Caves House, with its roots in English provincial building practice, is a contrast to the mountainous landscape of the remote Jenolan Valley, its massive limestone arches and craggy cliffs. [...] As the building {{is the work of}} a prominent colonial architect, who was influential in the development of Australian architecture, Caves House attains significance by association. [...] Historically, Caves House illustrates the considerable human activity and ingenuity necessary to provide accommodation {{in the early days of}} Australian tourism, in buildings especially designed for this purpose. [...] Vernon had to employ innovative methods to address problems posed by a major building project in a remote setting. Also, Caves House was built to service one of the earliest <b>protected</b> <b>sites</b> of natural environmental heritage in the world, declared a protected area by the New South Wales government in 1866. Lighting and sewage developments dating from the late 1880s are of significant historical importance, as they were crucial to the development of the remote area as a tourist destination. [...] Caves House has the research potential to provide archaeological evidence about the early development of New South Wales tourism. Along with the caves, it is a rare example of the development of mountain and cave tourism in New South Wales. [...] Also, of historical significance is the fact that in 1889, to provide electricity for the caves (and later, Caves House) Australia's first hydro-electricity plant was built nearby.|$|E

60|$|Conclusion.—The best {{definition}} of advancement or {{progress in the}} organic scale ever given, is that by Von Baer; and this rests {{on the amount of}} differentiation and specialisation of the several parts of the same being, when arrived, as I should be inclined to add, at maturity. Now as organisms have become slowly adapted by means of natural selection for diversified lines of life, their parts will have become, from the advantage gained by the division of physiological labour, more and more differentiated and specialised for various functions. The same part appears often to have been modified first for one purpose, and then long afterwards for some other and quite distinct purpose; and thus all the parts are rendered more and more complex. But each organism will still retain the general type of structure of the progenitor from which it was aboriginally derived. In accordance with this view it seems, if we turn to geological evidence, that organisation on the whole has advanced throughout the world by slow and interrupted steps. In the great kingdom of the Vertebrata it has culminated in man. It must not, however, be supposed that groups of organic beings are always supplanted and disappear as soon as they have given birth to other and more perfect groups. The latter, though victorious over their predecessors, may not have become better adapted for all places in the economy of nature. Some old forms appear to have survived from inhabiting <b>protected</b> <b>sites,</b> where they have not been exposed to very severe competition; and these often aid us in constructing our genealogies, by giving us a fair idea of former and lost populations. But we must not fall into the error of looking at the existing members of any lowly-organised group as perfect representatives of their ancient predecessors.|$|E
