5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and <b>partial</b> <b>deafness.</b> In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and <b>partial</b> <b>deafness,</b> the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E

[...] It was a joint operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, {{working closely with}} Hergé to attain an accurate translation as true {{as possible to the}} original work. Due in part to the large amount of language-specific word play (such as punning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus' <b>partial</b> <b>deafness,</b> it was always the intention not to translate literally, instead striving to sculpt a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right. Despite the free hand Hergé afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Hergé's intentions.|$|E

After having wiped his forehead, as already described, he set himself steadily to fulfil the duties of his situation.

As it was a physical impossibility to have his eyes on both passes at once, the old gentleman soon found that turning his head every few seconds {{from one side to the}} other became irksome. Then it became painful. At last it became torture, and then he gave up this plan in despair, resolving to devote a minute at a time to each pass, although feeling that by so doing his chances were greatly diminished.|$|E

50|$|A high {{proportion}} of ferrets with white markings which form coat patterns known as a blaze, badger, or panda coat, such as a stripe extending from their face {{down the back of}} their head to their shoulder blades, or a fully white head, have a congenital <b>deafness</b> (<b>partial</b> or total) which is similar to Waardenburg syndrome in humans.

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} an unprecedented public concern {{about the effects of}} high noise levels. The concern has mostly resulted from the increased noise levels of aircraft and the annoyance which that noise can cause to an individual exposed to it regularly. An effect of high level noise which has also resulted in enormous concern, but mostly out of the public-eye, has been that of noise induced hearing loss. Throughout industry in the U. K. alone there is an estimated 2 million people subjected to noise levels sufficiently high to endanger their hearing if regular exposure continues over a period of years. In order that these people may be protected from eventual <b>partial</b> or complete <b>deafness</b> their hearing acuity must be measured at regular intervals. The general title of the techniques used for making this measurement is audiometry. In industry there is a growing requirement for accurate and reliable but fast and simple-to-use audiometric equipment to cope with the large numbers of workers requiring regular examination. As a result of recent advances in the design and performance of digital computers intended for control applications {{the decision was made to}} investigate their possible use in routine audiometry and in particular in an industrial audiometric unit. Initially in this thesis, an extensive review of the existing audiometric techniques as used in hearing conservation programmes is given. In addition, deficiencies in the methods presently used are highlighted and discussed to reveal possible suitable areas for the application of computer techniques. As a result of this work a new concept of a screening audiometer is evolved in the form of an adaptive screening instrument capable of adjusting its measuring technique to produce optimum results from each subject and of performing much of the record keeping and result-scanning presently done by hand. To substantiate this theoretical work the proposed audiometer system was built on a computer situated in the University. A series of examinations were performed using the system and the results compared with others obtained from the same people by a conventional method. The two sets of results agreed to within acceptable limits and the degree of personal attention required to administer the test was greatly reduced. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{set out to}} {{investigate}} possible channels of communication for children who were failing markedly in school, following up evidence that expressive activities offered avenues through which many otherwise unsuccessful pupils, could succeed and come to a learning situation. I visited many schools where I could observe and teach these children even for a short time; a day or a weekend, {{and in some cases}} making repeated visits covering a period of time. I travelled widely so that schools would be representative of differing communities. I travelled widely in the United States of America, visiting schools for slow lemming und otherwise handicapped children and depart-ments of special education in colleges and universities, so that I could learn somethingin a variety of State systems of American special educatian and the uses made of expressive work. These visits and investigations both here and in America confirmed my belief that the arts and all expressive work are of major importance for all children, but particularly for the children who are failing in school and particularly at this time in the progress of our educational system. I read widely, investigating our knowledge of learning processes and medical research on such problems as brain damage, and physical and mental maturation. I had opportunity for discussion with medical colleagues on such subjects as obesity and metabolism, causes and detection of pre-natal, peri-natal and post-natal brain damage, and the early detection of <b>partial</b> sightedness and <b>deafness.</b> I investigated the nature of maladjustment in children and its link with educational subnormality, and this led me to the relationship between subnormality and delinquency. I visited factories, observing the nature of the work which might be possible for the children with whom I am concerned and discussing with personnel managers the progress and difficulties encountered by some of their less able employees. I was led to study many relevant problems, such as that of measurement and competition in education, the difficulties of acquiring the right teachers with the system of remuneration we have operating, and the place of the least able children in comprehensive schemes. The first part of the study concerns the situation as I saw it and the related problems. The second part indicates the ways in which I believe teachers could use the expressive arts and allied activity to help these children to grow in personality and liveliness and to acquire the interest in find need far language, which may lead to a lasting literacy for them. Throughout these five years I have continued to study the expressive arts which seem to be most clearly concerned {{and the ways in which}} they can be applied to the teaching of these children. These arts are: movement and dance, drama, music, painting, modelling and creating with materials of all kinds, and the world of literature used in ways which do not necessitate the ability to read and write fluently. This thesis is based upon my own experience and observation of children over a wide area and throughout many years of teaching. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
