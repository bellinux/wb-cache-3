Here, we report on a systematic study of the Cu–As–Te glassy system and show that under specific synthesis conditions using the spark-plasma-sintering technique, the α-As 2 Te 3 and β-As 2 Te 3 binary phases and the previously unreported AsTe 3 phase can be selectively crystallized within an amorphous matrix. The microstructures and transport properties of three different glass ceramics, each of them containing one of these phases with roughly the same crystalline fraction (∼ 30 % in volume), were investigated in detail by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, neutron thermodiffraction, Raman scattering (experimental and lattice-dynamics calculations), and transport-property measurements. The physical properties of the glass ceramics are compared with those of both the <b>parent</b> <b>glasses</b> and the pure crystalline phases that could be successfully synthesized. SEM images coupled with Raman spectroscopy evidence a “coast-to-island” or dendriticlike microstructure with microsized crystallites.

40|$|Chemical {{strengthening}} via {{ion exchange}} {{is commonly used}} in the industry to produce ultra-thin and resistant glasses used for high-tech applications. This process results {{in the formation of}} an ion-exchanged region near the glass surface that is under significant compressive stress, which tremendously improves the mechanical strength and the scratch resistance of the glass. The aim of this thesis is to deepen our fundamental understanding of the ion-exchange mechanisms. Since the mechanical strength against brittle fracture of ion-exchanged glasses depends on the compressive stress at the surface and the depth of interdiffusion, special attention was paid to the two main parameters affecting those properties: the <b>parent</b> <b>glass</b> composition and stress relaxation processes. First, the effect of the <b>parent</b> <b>glass</b> composition on interdiffusion properties was analyzed. We focused our study on the effect of the alkali oxide:alumina ratio and the ionic potential (charge:radius) of divalent cations on the interdiffusional properties. An increase of the Al 2 O 3 content in Na+/K+ ion-exchanged silicate glasses leads to a reduction of the depth of interdiffusion layer and an enhancement of the surface compressive stress. These trends are shown to be consistent with the compositional variation of the glass connectivity and hence, the stress relaxation occurring during the ion-exchange. It is also found that the depth of interdiffusion is higher for glasses containing divalent cations with a higher ionic potential such as Mg and Zn. This is attributed to the larger free volume available and the weaker Na-O bonds in those glasses. Second, the structural origin of stress relaxation is investigated. In the Na+/K+ ion exchanged glasses, the K+-foreign cations are introduced in the cages of the Na+-host cations. Due to stress relaxation, the size of the K-O coordination shell in ion-exchanged glasses increases. This increase is achieved by two structural adaptation mechanisms: a contraction of the Na-O, Ca-O and Mg-O coordination shell and both a shortening of the Si-NBO distances and an opening of the Q 4 Si-O-Si angles. The greater knowledge developed in this thesis on the effect of <b>parent</b> <b>glass</b> composition on interdiffusion mechanisms and stress relaxation processes provides further insight into practical ways to optimize the mechanical strength of ion-exchanged glasses.

MSiAlON {{glasses with}} {{compositions}} of M:Si:Al = 3. 45 : 3 : 2 (M = Y, Er) and varying nitrogen contents (N= 5, 8, 15, and 22 equivalent %) were produced by melting appropriate powder mixtures under nitrogen at 1715 °C. Glass-ceramics {{were obtained by}} heat treatment of the glasses for 10 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere in the range 950 - 1200 °C. From previous investigations, these compositions are expected to produce either B-phase (M 2 SiAlO 5 N) or Iw-phase (M 3 Si 2 Al 1 (O,N 10) (i. e. 10 e/o N) (M = Y, Er) after heat treatment, depending on N content and temperature. <b>Parent</b> <b>glasses</b> and the resulting glass-ceramics were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that with low nitrogen containing starting compositions, {{it is possible to}} obtain XRD patterns which appear to have similar peak positions to B-phase at lower temperatures (e. g. 975 - 1025 °C). However, more detailed investigations show that the peak positions in the pattern obtained do not quite coincide with the original B-phase and the phase formed has a contraction in the a dimension and an elongation in the c dimension. Crystallographic calculations show that this phase has a hexagonal unit cell with parameters of a = 3. 77 - 3. 82 Å and c = 9. 83 - 9. 97 Å. These parameters are functions of the nitrogen content of the B-phase...|$|R

For sake of comparison a second series without ceria was also prepared: KxCa 6. 5 xSi 8 O 21. 5 F 3. Xonotlite, tokkoite, fluorite and cristobalite were developed in all crystallized glasses; however, miserite was only identified in Ce-containing samples. Increase of K 2 O/CaO ratio, in Ce-free sample, enhanced the formation of tokkoite, and reduced the contents of xonotlite and fluorite. On the other hand, in Ce-containing samples, an increase of K 2 O/CaO ratio promotes the formation of miserite crystals. Quantitative Rietveld analyses assessed the presence of Ce 3 þ cations in miserite structure. The microstructure of Ce-free glasseceramics was relatively coarse {{in the form of}} interlocked flakes and rods; however, it became unpronounced in the sample of highest K 2 O/CaO ratio. In Ce-containing glass-ceramics, irregular nanosized grains were spread in cryptocrystalline groundmass, whose fineness increased with increasing K 2 O/CaO ratio. The CTE values of the <b>parent</b> <b>glasses</b> and their glasseceramics varied from 10. 31 to 11. 05 and from 7. 52 to 9. 84 106 C 1 respectively with lower values for Ce-free glass-ceramics. Density and micro hardness values were also measured...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the acid {{leaching}} {{of a series of}} glasses has been made. This was undertaken to provide information concerning the production of microporous glass membranes with reverse osmosis desalination potential. The chemical compositions of the glasses investigated were developed from a commercial glass composition known as 'E-glass'. This glass phase separates into mutually interconnecting acid soluble and acid insoluble phases, during cooling from the molten state. Treating the glass with mineral acid solutions removes the soluble phase, yielding a porous glass skeleton. The amount of Si 02 in the original composition was varied, and it was found possible to produce microporous glass skeletons from glasses having a range of Si 02 contents. These glasses also phase separated into mutually interconnecting phases during cooling. The <b>parent</b> <b>glasses</b> were studied by viscosity and electrical conductivity measurements. The results of those investigations were consistent with the rapid phase separation of the glasses. The leaching rates of the glasses were studied by weight loss measurements and those measurements indicated that the leaching rate was controlled by the durability of the acid soluble phase. The leached glasses were characterised by some electron microscopy, but primarily by inert gas adsorption measurements. The porous glasses contained pores of about 2 nm radius although there was also evidence of the presence of even finer pores. The reverse osmosis performance of several of the glasses was investigated using single hollow fibre membranes and salt rejections of up to 50...|$|R
