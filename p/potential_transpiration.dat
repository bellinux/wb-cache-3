50|$|When {{measuring}} {{turgor pressure}} in plants, many {{things have to}} be taken into account. It is generally stated that fully turgid cells have a turgor pressure value which is equal to that of the cell, and that flaccid cells have a value at or near zero. Other cellular mechanisms taken into consideration include the protoplast, solutes within the protoplast (solute <b>potential),</b> <b>transpiration</b> rates of the plant, and the tension of cell walls. Measurement is limited depending on the method used, some of which are explored and explained below. Not all methods can be used for all organisms, due to size and other properties. For example, a diatom won't have the same properties as a plant, which would place constrictions on what could be used to infer turgor pressure.|$|E
40|$|Balancing {{plant growth}} between {{vegetative}} and reproductive status {{is crucial for}} producing high quality greenhouse tomatoes while maintaining high productivity in long crop production seasons. In the tomato industry, certain plant morphological characteristics are used to classify plant growth status as vegetative, reproductive or balanced. Each growth status {{has been associated with}} distinct greenhouse environments which reduce or enhance transpiration. The effect of different transpiration on vegetative, reproductive or balanced plant growth status as defined by a set of plant morphological characteristics was investigated. To validate the practical significance of such classification, growth status was quantified as the relationship between variations in morphological characteristics and the fresh weight distributed between reproductive and vegetative organs. Two electrical conductivity (EC) levels of the nutrient solution, high and standard EC, were combined with two <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> environments, low and high <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration.</b> All treatment combinations were contrasted with a reference greenhouse environment similar to the industry standard. Electrical conductivity had the greatest effect on morphological characteristics which were reduced in size with high EC. For each EC level, the response decreased for increasing <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration.</b> Stem diameter had the greatest sensitivity to the different treatment combinations. For the standard EC and for the range of potential transpirations achieved, stem diameter varied within a relatively narrow range, close to the industry standard 'threshold' used to classify a balanced tomato plant. A reproductive plant growth status, as evaluated by a smaller value than this threshold, was observed only with high EC. No vegetative plants were produced within any <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> or EC treatment combination. High EC decreased the cumulative total fresh weight production by the same magnitude for all potential transpirations. <b>Potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> had a minimal effect on the total fresh weight production or on its components. As a result, the fresh weight ratio between reproductive and vegetative plant organs was similar for most <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> environments, regardless of variations in stem diameter. Therefore, within the range of <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> environments achieved, the distinction between vegetative and reproductive growth status as an indicator of fresh weight distribution and fruit yields could not be quantitatively validated...|$|E

A theoretical model previously {{developed by the}} authors for the rate of tree root water uptake together with an associated numerical simulation is used to {{study the effects of}} a wide range of soil, tree, and atmospheric parameters on partially saturated ground. The influence of different parameters on the maximum initial rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. Field measurements taken from previously published literature are compared with numerical predictions for validation. The rate of selected parameters such as <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> and its distribution, suction at wilting point, the coefficient of permeability and the distribution of root length density are studied in detail.

Root density distribution factors affect the size of the influence zone. Suction at the wilting point increases the soil matric suction and ground settlement, whereas the saturation permeability decreases the maximum soil matric suction generated.

Stomatal conductance was regulated by simulated leaf water potential (H) and/or foliar chemical signal concentrations (C; H + C). Split-root experiments were simulated by varying transpiration demands and irrigation placement. While regulation of stomatal conductance by chemical transport was unstable and oscillatory, simulated transpiration over time and root water uptake from the two soil compartments were similar for both H and H + C regulation. Increased stomatal sensitivity more strongly decreased transpiration, and decreased threshold root water potential (below which a chemical signal is produced) delayed transpiration reduction. Although simulations with H + C regulation qualitatively reproduced transpiration of plants exposed to partial rootzone drying (PRD), long-term effects seemed negligible. Moreover, most transpiration responses to PRD could be explained by hydraulic signalling alone...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that water flow into tomato fruits is affected similarly by osmotic {{potential of the}} nutrient solution and <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> (shoot environment) via their effects on stem water potential, was tested through experiments carried out in two glasshouses where climate was controlled to maintain a desired <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> rate (normal and depressed, respectively). This climate treatment was factorially combined with a root zone osmotic potential treatment, whereby two values of osmotic potential were compared in each experiment. Data showed that water uptake per unit leaf area was not affected by osmotic potential of the nutrient solution. The hydraulic resistance within the plant, deduced from measurements of leaf and stem water potential, was independent of the transpiration flow and was not affected by the osmotic potential of the nutrient solution. Water import into the fruit was affected by both treatments and was correlated with the water potential gradient between the stem and the fruit.

The seeds were collected from three sites along the natural habitat of C. africana in Sudan (viz: Edamazin, Jebel Marra and Kordofan). The experiment was conducted under natural conditions, using long soil columns with high water holding capacity. Drought had significant impacts on the physiological and morphological characteristics of C. africana seedlings, regardless of seed origin. However, the results revealed considerable intraspecific variation in the response of seedlings to drought among the studied provenances. The Kordofan provenance sustained the highest stomatal conductance, leaf water <b>potential</b> and <b>transpiration</b> rate under limited soil water availability, an attestation of drought-avoidance mechanisms. Seedlings from Edamazin and Jebel Marra origins showed simultaneous reduction in stomatal conductance, leaf water <b>potential</b> and <b>transpiration</b> rate as soil drying intensified, a characteristic response associated with drought-tolerance genotypes. Drought resulted in a significant reduction in total biomass of all provenances, which was a function of reduced shoot weight, but the root weight was not affected. The root/shoot ratio of water-stressed seedlings increased by more than 1. 6 times in all provenances. The Kordofan provenance showed the highest root/shoot ratio in the dry treatment, which might explain its superiority in the maintenance of shoot water status as drought intensified. With the exception of the Kordofan provenance, the root distribution profile was adversely affected by soil drying.

Macroscopic stress functions are currently used to estimate the effect of salinity on rootwater uptake. These functions commonly assume stress to {{be a function of}} bulk salinity and of the plant sensitivityto osmotic stress expressed as the salinity at which transpiration is reduced by half or so called tolerance value. However, they fail to integrate additional relevant factors such as atmospheric conditions or root architectural traits. We conducted a comprehensive simulation study on a single root using a 3 -D physically-based model thatresolves flow and transport to individual root segments and that couples flow in the soil and root system. Theeffect of salt concentrations on root water uptake was accounted for by including osmotic water potential gradientsbetween the solution at the soil root interface and the root xylem sap in the hydraulic gradient between thesoil and root. A large set of factors were studied, namely, <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> rate and dynamics, root lengthdensity (RLD), irrigation water quality and irrigation frequency, and leaching fraction. Results were fitted to themacroscopic function developed by van Genuchten and Hoffman (1984) and the dependency of osmotic stress andthe fitted macroscopic parameters on the studied factors was evaluated. Osmotic stress was found to be highly dependent on RLD. Low RLDs result in a larger stress to the plantdue to high evaporative demand per root length unit. In addition, osmotic stress was positively correlated topotential transpiration rate, and sinusoidal <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> lead to larger stress than when imposed as aconstant boundary condition. Macroscopic parameters are usually computed as single values for each crop and used for the entire grow-ing season. However, our study shows that both tolerance value and shape parameter p from the van Genuchtenand Hoffman (1984) function were highly dependent on both <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> and RLD. Plant salt tolerancewas lower under high evaporative demand and lower RLD. In addition, the shape of the stress curve, which isdefined by p, was found to be steeper under larger RLD and low transpiration rate.

40|$|Scaevola plumieri is an {{important}} pioneer on many tropical and subtropical sand dunes, forming a large perennial subterranean plant with only {{the tips of the}} branches emerging above accreting sand. In South Africa it is the dominant pioneer on sandy beaches along the east coast, less abundant on the south coast and absent from the southwest and west coasts. Transpiration rates (E) of S. plumieri are predictably related to atmospheric vapour pressure deficit under a wide range of conditions and can therefore be predicted from measurement of ambient temperature and relative humidity. Scaling measurements of E at the leaf level to the canopy level has been demonstrated previously. Using a geographic information system, digital maps of regional climatic variables were used to calculate digital maps of <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> from mean monthly temperature and relative humidity values, effectively scaling canopy level transpiration rates to a regional level. Monthly <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration</b> was subtracted from the monthly median rainfall to produce a map of mean monthly water balance. Seasonal growth was correlated with seasonal water balance. Localities along the coast with water deficits in summer corresponded with the recorded absence of S. plumieri, which grows and reproduces most actively in the summer months. This suggests that reduced water availability during the summer growth period limits the distribution of S. plumieri along the southwest coast, where water deficits develop in summer. Temperature is also important in limiting the distribution of S. plumieri on the southwest coast of South Africa through its effects on the growth and phenology of the plant...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} rate of root water uptake has been developed considering ground conditions, type of vegetation and climatic parameters. The three independent features in the root water uptake model incorporated in detail are soil suction, root distribution, and <b>potential</b> <b>transpiration.</b> A two dimensional finite element approach has been employed to solve the transient coupled flow and deformation equations in vicinity of a tree. To validate the model, an array of field measurements and the data have been compared with the numerical predictions. The predicted results acquired from the numerical analysis have been compared favourably with {{the field and the}} associated laboratory measurements, justifying the assumptions upon which the model has been developed...|$|E
40|$|The synergy between hydrologic extremes, plant transpiration, gross primary productivity, {{and soil}} water {{retention}} was {{studied in the}} experimental area Z√°brod ‚Äì meadow in the Bohemian Forest. Heat balance, <b>potential</b> and actual <b>transpiration,</b> entropy production and gross primary productivity were evaluated. It {{was found that the}} soil water retention is the crucial factor determining hydrologic pattern and gross primary productivity. Insufficient soil water retention leads to small entropy production by evaporation and small gross primary productivity, which results in the extremalization of the hydrologic cycle. On the other hand, in the case of sufficient soil water retention, high entropy production by transpiration and high gross primary productivity leads to the stability of the hydrologic cycle...|$|R
40|$|Young {{plants of}} Lotus creticus creticus growing in a hydroponic culture were {{submitted}} to 0, 70 and 140 mM NaCl treatments for 28 d {{and the growth}} and ecophysiological characteristics of these plants have been studied. The growth of Lotus plants was not affected by salinity when applied {{for a short period}} (about 15 d); however, 140 mM NaCl induced a decrease in shoot RGR {{at the end of the}} treatment. The root growth was not decreased, even it was stimulated by 140 mM NaCl. The osmotic adjustment of Lotus plants at 70 and 140 mM NaCl maintained constant pressure potential, avoiding the visual wilting. For a similar leaf water <b>potential,</b> cuticular <b>transpiration</b> of salinized plants was lower than in control plants due to the salinity effect on the cuticle. Moreover, the presence of hairy leaves (60 and 160 trichomes per mm 2 in young and adult leaves, respectively) allows keeping almost 81 % of sprayed water and absorbing the 9 % of the water retained, decreased the epidermal conductance to water vapour diffusion. This research was supported by UE-DGVI-PL- 9472 and CICYT (AGF- 96 - 1136 -C 02 - 02) Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} Haloxylon ammodendron C. A. Mey, a small xeric tree. Soil water content, soil evaporation, leaf water <b>potential,</b> leaf <b>transpiration</b> rate and stomatal conductance were measured at the two sites that contrast in soil texture: sandy and heavy textured, 8 km apart on the southern periphery of Gurbantonggut Desert, Central Asia, during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons. Leaf specific hydraulic conductance was calculated from the measurements, and root distributions of plants grown at the two sites were quantified by whole-root system excavation. In general, plants grown in sandy soil experienced better water status than in heavy textured soil. Low soil evaporation loss is not {{the main reason for}} this better plant water status at sandy site. Plants in sandy soil developed much deeper root systems, larger root surface areas and higher root: leaf surface area ratio than in heavy textured soil, which facilitated plants acquiring more water and surviving the prolonged drought period. Plants growing at light textured sites should have an advantage in acclimatising to the changed water conditions of the future. Plants at the more sandy sites have a larger buffering capacity to excessive variation in ambient conditions...|$|R
