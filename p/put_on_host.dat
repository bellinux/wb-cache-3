40|$|Today, coral {{bleaching}} represents {{a major concern}} for marine biologists, especially considering the upsurge of this phenomenon possibly linked to climate change. Bleached corals, deprived of most of their energy incomes, may show a partial or total mortality, which ultimately lead to shifts in reef communities. Studies focusing on cellular bleaching mechanisms have shown different ways by which algae may be expelled from gastrodermal host cells. Among those mechanisms, major emphasis has been <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>host</b> cell death, most probably due to both apoptosis and necrosis. Recovering gastrodermis is then expected to undergo regeneration process {{in order to be}} reinfected by new algae. We describe here this regeneration process in the bleached sea anemone model A. pallida. Peer reviewe...|$|E

This contribution specifically looks at silent complicity and the way it challenges conventional interpretations of corporate responsibility. Silent complicity implies that corporations have moral obligations that reach beyond the negative realm of doing no harm. Essentially, it implies that corporations have a moral responsibility to help protect human rights by <b>putting</b> pressure <b>on</b> perpetrating <b>host</b> governments involved in human rights abuses. This is a controversial claim, which this contribution proposes to analyze with a view to understanding and determining the underlying conditions that need to be met in order for moral agents to be said to have such responsibilities in the category of the duty to protect human right...|$|R

25|$|At Bristol, {{the visiting}} captain Stephen Fleming from Nottinghamshire won the toss and chose to bat—a wise choice, {{as it turned}} out, as only Mark Hardinges took wickets, but he conceded many runs in the process, {{finishing}} with four for 115. Gloucestershire were toothless, conceding 28 runs off no-balls, while their No. 5 David Hussey was deprived of a century when the team collapsed around him, finishing on 98 not out. With a run rate of above four in their 469 all out, they were <b>putting</b> pressure <b>on</b> the <b>hosts,</b> who started sedately without losing wickets. However, a spell from Ryan Sidebottom resulted in three wickets falling with only one run being scored, and that gave Northamptonshire the edge in the game. Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 250, as Mark Ealham removed the tail with three for 26 off 16 overs (with ten maidens), and, being forced to follow on, Gloucestershire lost both openers before stumps to have scored three runs for two wickets.|$|R

50|$|Diamonds found {{themselves}} in a great position for a top-seven finish and four emphatic wins in a row <b>put</b> them <b>on</b> the cusp of a Play-Off place. A draw at Scunthorpe United and a defeat at home to Kidderminster Harriers however meant a win was needed on the final day to assure qualification for the Play-Offs. This was duly delivered with a 4-2 victory away to Halifax Town, as the club finished in sixth spot to set up a Play-Off Semi-Final against Rochdale. In the first leg at Nene Park the away side twice took the lead, but both times Rushden equalised as the match finished 2-2. In a mouth-watering second leg at Spotland, an unfortunate own goal by Tarkan Mustafa <b>on</b> 63 minutes <b>put</b> the <b>hosts</b> <b>on</b> the front foot. But Diamonds immediately responded through Onandi Lowe, and with quarter of an hour to go Paul Hall went through on goal, rounded the keeper, and tucked home for a 2-1 lead (4-3 on aggregate). Rushden held on to secure a famous victory and progress to the Play-Off Final at the Millennium Stadium to play Cheltenham. Over 24,000 saw Martin Devaney put the Robins ahead, quickly cancelled out by a Paul Hall wonder goal. It wasn’t to be though as two further goals secured the win for Cheltenham to end Diamonds’ promotion hopes after a great season.|$|R
40|$|The global {{tuberculosis}} {{epidemic is}} {{the most common cause of}} death after infectious disease worldwide. Increasing numbers of infections with multi- and extensively drug-resistant variants of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, resistant even to newly discovered and last resort antibiotics, highlight the urgent need for an efficient vaccine. The protective efficacy to pulmonary tuberculosis in adults of the only currently available vaccine, M. bovis BCG, is unsatisfactory and geographically diverse. More importantly, recent clinical studies on new vaccine candidates did not prove to be better than BCG, yet. Here, we propose and discuss novel strategies to improve efficacy of existing anti-tuberculosis vaccines. Modulation of innate immune responses upon vaccination already provided promising results in animal models of tuberculosis. For instance, neutrophils have been shown to influence vaccine efficacy, both, positively and negatively, and stimulate specific antibody secretion. Modulating immune regulatory properties after vaccination such as induction of different types of innate immune cell death, myeloid-derived suppressor or regulatory T cells, production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 10 may have beneficial effects on protection efficacy. Incorporation of lipid antigens presented via CD 1 molecules to T cells have been discussed as a way to enhance vaccine efficacy. Finally, concepts of dendritic cell-based immunotherapies or training the innate immune memory may be exploitable for future vaccination strategies against tuberculosis. In this review, we <b>put</b> a spotlight <b>on</b> <b>host</b> immune networks as potential targets to boost protection by old and new tuberculosis vaccines...|$|R
