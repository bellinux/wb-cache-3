40|$|This thesis {{determined}} experimentally how temperature (cold [4 °C] versus warm [12 °C] water) affects predation {{success in}} indigenous rock (Cancer irroratus) and recently introduced green (Carcinus maenas) crabs from Newfoundland and Labrador under non-competitive and competitive conditions. Prey (the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis) capture and size selection {{as well as}} associated foraging behaviors were measured in both crab species. Additional factors (crab size, prey size, chela loss, and chemical cues from conspecifics and heterospecifics) were included to gain further insights about how this green crab introduction may alter the structure of shallow benthic ecosystems in this region. Analysis of predation data under non-competitive conditions indicated that 1) mussel capture in <b>rock</b> and green <b>crabs</b> was higher in large than small individuals, 2) chela loss decreased mussel capture uniquely in <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> while causing only subtle changes in mussel size selection in both species, and 3) chemical cues from other crabs did not affect mussel capture in <b>rock</b> <b>crabs,</b> yet altered mussel size selection {{and the frequency of}} foraging behaviors in small <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> only. Increasing temperature from 4 to 12 °C exacerbated these patterns by significantly increasing mussel capture in both species. Analysis of predation data under competitive conditions indicated that 1) green crabs primarily grasped the mussel before <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> regardless of temperature and body size and chela loss in <b>rock</b> <b>crabs,</b> 2) the number of contests between <b>rock</b> and green <b>crabs</b> was unaffected by temperature and body size and chela loss in <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> though the frequency of strong physical interactions was higher in contests with large than small <b>rock</b> <b>crabs,</b> and 3) large <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> initiated contests with green crabs more frequently than smaller conspecifics in warm water only while winning more contests than small <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> regardless of temperature. Therefore, the introduction of green crab to Newfoundland and Labrador (currently the northern distribution limit of the species) may negatively impact foraging in <b>rock</b> <b>crabs,</b> whether the latter are equal or larger in size than the largest green crabs. The observed marked preference by small green crabs for small mussels suggests that green crabs may alter mussel populations in this region, which could affect interactions with other species that rely on mussels as a food source...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Presentation date: 2001 - 06 - 08 In Yaquina Bay, Oregon, I {{observed}} {{very little}} overlap {{in the distribution}} of the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, and the larger red <b>rock</b> <b>crab,</b> Cancer productus. Red <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> dominate the more saline, cooler lower estuary and green crabs, the less saline, warmer upper estuary. Because caged green crabs survive well in the lower estuary, I decided to test the hypothesis that red <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> prey on green crabs and thus contribute to their exclusion from the more physically benign lower estuary. A laboratory species interaction experiment was designed to determine whether red <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> prey on smaller green crabs at a higher rate than on smaller crabs of their own species. Crabs of both species were collected and sorted by weight into three size classes: small, medium and large. Small and medium crabs of both species were paired with green <b>crabs</b> or red <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> of various sizes. Crab pairs were housed in individual arenas and allowed to interact for seven days. When conspecifics were paired, mortality was less than 15...|$|R

Trophic niche breadth was widest for blue crabs, narrower for lady crabs, and narrowest for Atlantic <b>rock</b> <b>crabs.</b> Trophic overlap was lowest between lady <b>crabs</b> and Atlantic <b>rock</b> <b>crabs,</b> mainly because of frequent consumption of the dwarf surfclam (Mulinia lateralis) by the former and the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) by the latter.

40|$|The role of {{predation}} in structuring soft-sediment communities varies as {{a function}} of the number and composition of predators that co-occur in a given habitat. In Bonne Bay, Newfoundland, contrasting abundances or predators in different areas of the bay may contribute to different regulatory roles of predators on infauna. To test this hypothesis, results from a field exclusion experiment were compared with 5 laboratory experiments that measured the individual effects of the main crustacean predators of the bay: snow <b>crab,</b> <b>rock</b> <b>crab,</b> and toad crab. In the field experiment, the exclusion of predators generated clear differences in infaunal composition, and 2 species (the polychaete Pholoe tecta and the clam Macoma calcarea) dominated exclusion treatments. Predator exclusion also resulted in a significant increase in density, but only a modest increase in infaunal diversity. In the laboratory, fresh, undisturbed sediment cores were paired with similar cores, protected by mesh and exposed to each crab species in order to test for their potential effects on infaunal communities. Results indicate that snow <b>crab</b> and <b>rock</b> <b>crab</b> have clear effects on species composition and, as was the case with the field experiment, the infaunal species P. tecta and M. calcarea dominated exclusion treatments for both predatory crabs. These predators also reduced total infaunal density, but only <b>rock</b> <b>crab</b> significantly reduced species richness. In contrast, toad crab effects were not significant. Given that snow <b>crab</b> and <b>rock</b> <b>crab</b> are both targeted by commercial fisheries in Atlantic Canada, our results suggest that crab fishery removal may have multiple indirect effects on infaunal communities...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal, age-class, and population-level {{changes in}} diet and {{consumption}} demand of prey by striped bass residing in coastal waters of northern Massachusetts were investigated {{to determine their}} potential predatory impact on ecologically- and economically-important prey species. Most consumption by individual striped bass of ages 3 – 8 came from crustaceans and fish. More crusta-ceans (50 – 78 % of total consumption) than fish were consumed during June–July, while more fish (52 – 88 % of total consumption) than crustaceans were consumed during August–September. <b>Rock</b> <b>crabs</b> Cancer irroratus and American lobsters Homarus americanus became {{more important to the}} production of striped bass as bass aged, but Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus became less important. Together, the biomass of prey consumed by all age-classes in 2000 totaled over 5 575 t. Atlantic menhaden accounted for 29 % of the total biomass consumed, followed by <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> (18 %), American lobster (11 %), and Atlantic herring Clupea harengus (3 %). On a numerical basis, striped bass consumed seasonally over 3, 1 940, and 965 times the numbers of lobsters, <b>rock</b> <b>crabs,</b> and men-haden, respectively, taken annually by regional and statewide fisheries, suggesting striped bass may exert considerable predation pressure on these prey populations...|$|R
40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} {{is a key}} physical factor in determining where organisms live in sedimentary marine habitats because it strongly influences the mechanical properties of the medium and thus the energy required to move through it. We examined burying efficiency in and preference among five natural sediments for two crab species – Metacarcinus magister (the Dungeness crab), a habitat specialist and Cancer productus (the red <b>rock</b> <b>crab),</b> a habitat generalist. Crab burial speeds and sediment stiffnesses were measured at five field sites. Dungeness crabs buried equally well in less stiff, well-sorted sands and more stiff, poorly-sorted mud/cobble mixtures. At all sites they buried more quickly than red <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> whose performance decreased with increasing heterogeneity of the sediment. These results are contrary to expectations based on reported habitat specificity of the two species. Burial speed decreased with increasing carapace size especially for red <b>rock</b> <b>crabs.</b> The burial success and speed of Dungeness crabs {{is associated with the}} relatively larger surface area of their propoduses and the sharper angle formed by the posterior border of the carapace and abdomen. In replicate mesocosms, crabs explored five substrates and then buried in one. Dungeness crabs tended to select well-sorted sediments similar to where we found them in the field. In contrast, red <b>rock</b> <b>crabs</b> were least likely to bury in the mud/cobble sediment in which they had the most difficulty burying although this sediment was typical of the field site where they were most common. The discrepancies among burial performance, sediment preference, and natural distribution reveal the complexity of habitat use between these co-occurring species and are in contrast to the pattern shown by burying fish and some other crab species...|$|R
