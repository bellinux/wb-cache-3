50|$|The {{grade of}} service in a TXE2 was {{dependent}} {{on the number of}} customers in an A-switch group, with access to just 25 A-B trunks. The normal standard on the earlier exchanges was 125 customers per A-switch group. If the A-switch group contained many busy <b>PBX</b> <b>lines,</b> then the number of customers might be reduced to 75. The earlier (Mark I and Mark II - the differences being slight) exchanges could handle up to 2,000 customers. Later on, Mark III TXE2s were able to handle up to 4,000 customers and on these exchanges, where the average calling rate was sufficiently low, up to 250 customers would be in an A-switch group, still with access to just 25 A-B trunks.|$|R

5000|$|... ==Multi-line hunting== Multiline <b>hunting</b> (sometimes MLH, <b>line</b> <b>hunting</b> or MHG, {{multiline}} hunting group) is {{a feature}} that allows multiple telephone lines going into a business {{to act as a}} single group, called a hunt group. This type of fallback is a somewhat more complex form of call forwarding. If the line called is busy, the call goes to the next available line. Only if no lines in the group are open does the calling party get a busy signal.|$|R
5000|$|Harlowton {{lies within}} the Montana High Plains that form {{a part of}} the Northwestern Plains.

5000|$|Although {{only one}} {{telephone}} number is usually announced, major stations typically have <b>line</b> <b>hunting,</b> {{with the same}} number being directed to any available one of several <b>lines</b> within the <b>hunt</b> group. If there are no open lines, the calling party may receive a busy signal as with an ordinary telephone call, or sometimes the special information tones followed by a recorded announcement that [...] "all circuits are busy, please try your call again later". In this case, the line often first gives that caller a ringback tone as if the call were being completed, misleading callers to think they may have actually gotten through the swarm of other calls that sometimes flood these lines.|$|R

5|$|Healthy {{adults do}} not have many predators, but human {{activities}} pose many threats. Collisions with power <b>lines,</b> <b>hunting,</b> intentional poisoning, lead accumulation from ingesting gunshot in carcasses, and pesticide accumulation take a toll on populations. Young birds at the nest are sometimes taken by golden eagles, eagle owls, and red foxes. Only rarely do adult birds attempt to drive away predators. Young birds that fall off of cliff ledges may be preyed on by mammalian predators such as jackals, foxes and wolves. Like all birds they serve as hosts for ectoparasitic birdlice including Aegypoecus perspicuus as well as organisms that live within them such as mycoplasmas.|$|R
