The roadways consist of hollow box structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, much {{research}} has been developed on the design and performance of self-centering steel moment-resisting frame (SC-MRF) systems for high-risk seismic zones. While researchers from various institutions have agreed on the advantages of SC-MRF systems, their approach to modeling the connections has varied. To date, two types of analytical models have emerged to simulate and analyze such systems: (1) explicit gap models that simulate SC-MRF connections {{through the use of}} gap elements or fiber elements that open and close, as well as <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>cable</b> elements, and (2) rotational spring models using non-linear rotational springs with hysteretic, flag-shaped moment rotation curves at each connection. This paper examines these two models and presents the advantages, disadvantages, accuracies and inaccuracies of each. While the gap element model gives a higher level of detail as to the behavior of the connections, it is quite taxing computationally, and thus is not appropriate for parametric studies that are based on statistical evaluations that require thousands of analyses. It was found that the rotational spring model, while much faster, has some limitations which must be considered. For example, since gap opening is not directly modeled, the expanding nature of the SC-MRF is not captured; therefore the additional beam axial forces developed by the expanding strands and the interaction between the floor diaphragm and the SC-MRF is neglected...|$|E

40|$|The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) {{is urging}} {{researchers}} and contractors {{to develop the}} next generation highway bridge design. New design solutions should favor the use of modular construction techniques over conventional cast-in-place reinforced concrete {{in order to reduce}} the cost of the projects and the amount of constructions on site. Earthquake resistant bridges are designed such that the columns are monolithically connected to the girder and the foundations. Hence, despite the great improvements recently made in modular bridge construction, a large amount of concrete is still cast in place to properly splice the reinforcements between the segments. Instead of designing earthquake resistant bridges with monolithic joints, it is proposed to use discontinuous connections in this thesis. The segments may rock at their interface during a severe earthquake and, if rocking rotation is too large, the structure may collapse. However, if a bridge is allowed to rock moderately, it may modify the earthquake response and drastically reduce the resisting forces within the structure. The research presented in this dissertation focuses on the modeling of rocking connections. First, the behavior of rocking rigid blocks under earthquake excitation is studied. It is proposed to restrain the rigid blocks with an unbonded <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>cable</b> in order to allow rocking but prevent overturning. The findings made on rigid blocks, however, cannot be applied to deformable structures because of the limitations of the model. Therefore, a completely different approach is proposed. Instead of modeling the behavior of an entire block, it is proposed to model only the rocking surface. A zero-length finite element is developed, allowing to represent the in-plane rocking rotation between two frame elements. It allows to investigate the behavior of a deformable column rocking freely on its base as well as the stability of a rocking column restrained with a cable and subjected to a large earthquake excitation. The consequences of a <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>cable</b> failure and yielding of the column are also investigated. It is proposed to add a dissipative fuse between the base of the column and its footing in order to enhance the stability of the structure. Finally, the behavior of a conventional monolithic bridge is compared with a bridge allowed to rock at the columns joints. The results obtained with the rigid block model show that, when columns are allowed to rock under earthquake excitation, it is possible to adjust the response and preserve stability with a <b>Post-Tensioning</b> (PT) <b>cable.</b> The implementation of the zero-length rocking element permits to study the behavior of deformable structures that are allowed to rock. At first, this element is used in combination with a very stiff elastic element and the results are consistent with the response of a rigid block. This element shows that the free rocking response of an elastic column may stop rocking and start to oscillate in flexure. The dissipative fuse in combination with a long unbonded PT cable proves to be effective. However, it is shown that, if the dissipative fuse is too large, it may prevent the column from returning to its initial position. At last, it is shown that a bridge structure allowed to rock and restrained with cables can sustain a large earthquake. The resisting moments within the columns are greatly reduced when compared with a conventional bridge while the drift ratio remains moderate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Optimum {{design for}} a {{cable-stayed}} bridge structure is very complicated because of large number of design variables. Use of ANSYS parametric design language in optimizing such structure consumes little computational time. The finished dead state analysis for single pylon double cable plane cable-stayed bridge with 120 m long is performed. Mechanics equivalent are developed for the main pylon with concrete-filled steel tube. Prestress girder finite element model is established also. The theory of minimum bending strain energy is used in deriving the objective function as the quadratic form of the <b>post-tensioning</b> <b>cable</b> forces. In addition, the maximum deflection of the pylon and the maximum stresses of the main girder are both implemented in the optimization model. Optimized cable forces are found by optimization. Calculated results show that after the optimization, the cable force slightly changes, yet the internal force state under dead load remarkably improves, the bending stress of girder {{as well as the}} deflection of pylon significantly decreases. All these variations are satisfied for the limit value of engineering code. The results obtained revealed that the method presented indeed leads to optimal structural performance for the cable-stayed bridge in particular, and might be a useful reference for the design of other similar bridges...|$|R
40|$|Allowing shear {{walls to}} rock {{is one way}} of {{protecting}} structures from earthquake damage, or at least minimising this damage. Walls allowed to rock must have the ability to resist both overturning moment, and lateral forces. While resistance to overturning is typically provided by self-weight, <b>post-tensioned</b> <b>cables,</b> and/or damping devices acting as hold-downs, a particular challenge is to provide adequate resistance to lateral forces, which will not interfere with, nor disturb the function of the devices chosen to resist overturning. During an earthquake, there will typically be high contact forces between the shear keys and shear walls. Friction induced by these contact forces can add to the moment resistance against overturning – often in an unpredictable way. While supplemental moment resistance could be considered a desirable outcome in the case of non-rocking walls; in the case of rocking walls, their load limiting ability could be compromised. A new shear key concept, that is both simple and economical, is proposed and implemented at the bottom centre of an experimental timber wall that is allowed to rock.
