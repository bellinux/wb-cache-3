5|$|In April 2013, Miliband pledged {{ahead of}} the {{upcoming}} county elections that Labour would change planning laws to give local authorities greater authority to decide what shops can open in their high streets. He also said that Labour would introduce more strenuous laws relating to <b>pay-day</b> lenders and betting shops. Labour subsequently gained nearly 300 councillors, as well as control of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire County Councils.|$|E
60|$|Frank remembered, {{but he did}} not {{say what}} he had {{forgotten}} that last <b>pay-day.</b>|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. Psha! Platonic sense! She {{makes you}} her servant; and when <b>pay-day</b> comes round, she bilks you: {{that is what}} you mean.|$|E
6000|$|... "When his <b>pay-day's</b> spent, I guess," [...] she answered. [...] "He {{was over}} to San Francisco {{yesterday}} {{looking for a}} ship. But he's got money, yet, an' he's particular {{about the kind of}} ship he signs for." ...|$|R
60|$|They dined extravagantly {{at their}} hotel at night, and next morning sneaked {{round the corner}} to economize at a Childs' Restaurant. They were tired by three in the afternoon, and dozed at the motion-pictures and said they wished {{they were back in}} Gopher Prairie--and by eleven in the evening they were again so lively that they went to a Chinese {{restaurant}} that was frequented by clerks and their sweethearts on <b>pay-days.</b> They sat at a teak and marble table eating Eggs Fooyung, and listened to a brassy automatic piano, and were altogether cosmopolitan.|$|R
60|$|Here were no ill-fed, whiskey-poisoned men, such as {{the rest}} of the sailors, who, having drunk up their last <b>pay-days,</b> had starved ashore until they had {{received}} and drunk up their advance money for the present voyage. These three, on the other hand were supple and vigorous. Their movements were spontaneously quick and accurate. Perhaps it was the way they looked at me, with incurious yet calculating eyes that nothing escaped. They seemed so worldly wise, so indifferent, so sure of themselves. I was confident they were not sailors. Yet, as shore-dwellers, I could not place them. They were a type I had never encountered. Possibly I can give a better idea of them by describing what occurred.|$|R
60|$|And Frank, who {{had gotten}} drunk last <b>pay-day,</b> had been mindful of wife and little girl far away and had done his duty.|$|E
60|$|After Mr. Lott's {{departure}} on Friday, which, fortunately, was <b>pay-day,</b> I set my desk {{in order}} and confided to Minikin written instructions concerning all matters unfinished.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the short-run effect of salary receipt on {{mortality}} among Swedish public sector employees. By exploiting variation in <b>pay-days</b> across work-places, we completely control for mortality patterns related to, for example, public holidays {{and other special}} days or events coinciding with paydays and for general within-month and within-week mortality patterns. We find {{a dramatic increase in}} mortality on the day salaries arrive. The increase is especially pronounced for younger workers and for deaths due to activity-related causes such as heart conditions and strokes. Additionally, the effect is entirely driven by an increase in mortality among low income individuals, who are more likely to experience liquidity constraints. All things considered, our results suggest that an increase in general economic activity upon salary receipt is an important cause of the excess mortality...|$|R
5000|$|According to Robert Bell, who {{published}} {{it in his}} 1846 Ancient Poems, Ballads and Songs of the Peasantry of England, the song [...] "may be confidently assigned to the seventeenth century, and {{is said to be}} a translation from the ancient Cornish tongue. We first heard it in Germany, in the pleasure-gardens of the Marienberg, on the Moselle. The singers were four Cornish miners, who were at that time, 1854, employed at some lead mines near the town of Zell. The leader or 'Captain,' John Stocker, said that the song was an established favourite with the lead miners of Cornwall and Devonshire, and was always sung on the <b>pay-days,</b> and at the wakes; and that his grandfather, who died thirty years before, at the age of a hundred years, used to sing the song, and say that it was very old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Again you're wrong--on both points. As I {{once told}} you, I have sat for hours beside the fire beneath the pines or among the {{boulders}} with your picture for company. When I was worn-out and despondent you encouraged me. You {{have been with}} me {{high up in the}} snow on the ranges, and through leagues of shadowy bush. That is not all, however, though it's difficult to speak of such things to you. There were times when as we drove the branch line up the gorge beneath the big divide, all one's physical nature shrank from the monotony of brutal labour. The <b>pay-days</b> came round, and opportunities were made for us--to forget what we had borne, and had still to bear, in the snow and the icy water. Then you laid a restraining hand on me. I could not take your picture where you could not go. Is all that to count for nothing?" ...|$|R
60|$|Benton {{slowed and}} quieted {{down a few}} days before <b>pay-day,</b> {{to get ready for the}} great rush. Only the saloons and dance-halls and gambling-hells were active, and even here the {{difference}} was manifest.|$|E
6000|$|Compton {{looked at}} his watch. [...] "It is getting late, Harold," [...] he said, [...] "and this is <b>pay-day.</b> I should think Everett could help you with the pay-roll." [...] Everett was the cashier.|$|E
6000|$|While {{he drove}} to the garage he pondered: [...] "Is it worth twenty-five plunks {{to me to be}} able to beat it to-night instead of waiting four days till <b>pay-day?</b> Nope. I'm a poor man." ...|$|E
60|$|Nineteen {{rounds of}} drinks. What more would John Barleycorn ask {{in order to}} have his will with men? They were ripe to forget their dearly {{cherished}} plans. They rolled out of the saloon and into the arms of the sharks and harpies. They didn't last long. From two days to a week saw the end of their money and saw them being carted by the boarding-house masters on board outward-bound ships. Victor was a fine body of a man, and through a lucky friendship managed to get into the life-saving service. He never saw the dancing-school nor placed his advertisement for a room in a working-class family. Nor did Long John win to navigation school. By {{the end of the week}} he was a transient lumper on a river steamboat. Red John and Axel did not send their <b>pay-days</b> home to the old country. Instead, and along with the rest, they were scattered on board sailing ships bound for the four quarters of the globe, where they had been placed by the boarding-house masters, and where they were working out advance money which they had neither seen nor spent.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the things}} to note here now is {{the arrival of the}} {{paymaster}} with his strong box, and the payment of bounties to veterans re-enlisting. Major H. is here to-day, with a small mountain of greenbacks, rejoicing the hearts of the 2d division of the First corps. In the midst of a rickety shanty, behind a little table, sit the major and clerk Eldridge, with the rolls before them, and much moneys. A re-enlisted man gets in cash about $200 down, (and heavy instalments following, as the <b>pay-days</b> arrive, one after another.) The show of the men crowding around is quite exhilarating; I like to stand and look. They feel elated, their pockets full, and the ensuing furlough, the visit home. It is a scene of sparkling eyes and flush'd cheeks. The soldier has many gloomy and harsh experiences, and this makes up for some of them. Major H. is order'd to pay first all the re-enlisted men of the First corps their bounties and back pay, and then the rest. You hear the peculiar sound of the rustling of the new and crisp greenbacks by the hour, through the nimble fingers of the major and my friend clerk E.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, that Mrs. Easygo {{really does}} like {{the society of}} human beings. She is {{genuinely}} and heartily social; and, in consequence, though she has very limited means, and no money to spend in giving great entertainments, her domestic establishment {{is a sort of}} social exchange, where more friendships are formed, more real acquaintance made, and more agreeable hours spent, than in any other place that can be named. She never has large parties,--great general <b>pay-days</b> of social debts,--but small, well-chosen circles of people, selected so thoughtfully, with a view to the pleasure which congenial persons give each other, as to make the invitation an act of real personal kindness. She always manages to have something for the entertainment of her friends, so that they are not reduced to the simple alternative of gaping at each other's dresses and eating lobster salad and ice-cream. There is either some choice music, or a reading of fine poetry, or a well-acted charade, or a portfolio of photographs and pictures, to enliven the hour and start conversation; and as the people are skillfully chosen with reference to each other, as there is no hurry or heat or confusion, conversation, in its best sense, can bubble up, fresh, genuine, clear, and sparkling as a woodland spring, and one goes away really rested and refreshed. The slight entertainment provided is just enough to enable you to eat salt together in Arab fashion,--not enough to form the leading feature of the evening. A cup of tea and a basket of cake, or a salver of ices, silently passed at quiet intervals, do not interrupt conversation or overload the stomach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By God, Davis!" [...] {{the mate}} burst forth. [...] "You'll never draw your <b>pay-day</b> in Seattle. I'll fix you out for this, killing a crazy lashed {{down in his}} bunk an' harmless. You'll follow 'm overside, my hearty." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{laughed at}} by all except one quiet comrade who gazed thoughtfully eastward, {{back over the}} vast and rolling country. This man was {{thinking}} of home, of wife and little girl, of what <b>pay-day</b> meant for them.|$|E
60|$|This {{hall was}} unusually crowded, {{and the scene}} had the number of men, though not the women and the hilarity and the gold, that was {{characteristic}} of <b>pay-day</b> in Benton. All the tables in the gambling-room were occupied.|$|E
6000|$|When Lise {{had gone}} out Janet {{sat down in the}} rocking-chair and began to rock agitatedly. What had really made her angry, she began to perceive, was the {{realization}} of a certain amount of truth in her sister's intimation concerning Ditmar. Why should she have, in Lise, continually before her eyes a degraded caricature of her own aspirations and ideals? or was Lise a mirror--somewhat tarnished, indeed--in which she read the truth about herself? For some time Janet had more than suspected that her sister possessed a new lover--a lover whom she refrained from discussing; an ominous sign, since it had been her habit to dangle her conquests before Janet's eyes, to discuss their merits and demerits with an engaging though cynical freedom. Although the existence of this gentleman was based on evidence purely circumstantial, Janet was inclined to believe him of a type wholly different from his predecessors; and the fact that his attentions were curiously intermittent and irregular inclined her to the theory that he was not a resident of Hampton. What was he like? It revolted her to reflect that he might in some ways possibly resemble Ditmar. Thus he became the object of a morbid speculation, especially at such times as this, when Lise attired herself in her new winter finery and went forth to meet him. Janet, also, had recently been self-convicted of sharing with Lise the same questionable tendency toward self-adornment to please the eye of man. The very next Saturday night after she had indulged in that mad extravagance of the blue suit, Lise had brought home from the window of The Paris in Faber Street a hat that had excited the cupidity and admiration of Miss Schuler and herself, and in front of which they had stood languishing on three successive evenings. In its acquisition Lise had expended almost the whole of a week's salary. Its colour was purple, on three sides were massed drooping lilac feathers, but over the left ear the wide brim was caught up and held by a crescent of brilliant paste stones. Shortly after this purchase--the next week, in fact,--The Paris had alluringly and craftily displayed, for the tempting sum of $6.29, the very cloak ordained by providence to [...] "go" [...] with the hat. Miss Schuler declared it would be a crime to fail to take advantage of such an opportunity but the trouble was that Lise had had to wait for two more <b>pay-days</b> and endure the suspense arising from the possibility that some young lady of taste and means might meanwhile become its happy proprietor. Had not the saleslady been obdurate, Lise would have had it on credit; but she did succeed, by an initial payment the ensuing Saturday, in having it withdrawn from public gaze. The second Saturday Lise triumphantly brought the cloak home; a velvet cloak,--if the eyes could be believed,--velvet bordering on plush, with a dark purple ground delicately and artistically spotted with a lilac to match the hat feathers, and edged with a material which--if not too impudently examined and no questions asked--might be mistaken, by the uninitiated male, for the fur of a white fox. Both investments had been made, needless to say, on the strength of Janet's increased salary; and Lise, when Janet had surprised her before the bureau rapturously surveying the combination, justified herself with a defiant apology.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, to my sorrow, {{and not by}} my will, I am he, and but now I {{was going}} forth to have certain masses said for his soul's welfare": which was true, Randal Rutherford having filled my purse against <b>pay-day.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Said Axel Gunderson, who didn't {{care for}} dancing and social functions: [...] "I've {{got a good}} <b>pay-day.</b> Now I can go home. It is fifteen years since I've seen my mother and all the family. When I pay off, I shall send my money home to wait for me. Then I'll pick a good ship bound for Europe, and arrive there with another <b>pay-day.</b> Put them together, and I'll have more money than ever in my life before. I'll be a prince at home. You haven't any idea how cheap {{everything}} is in Norway. I can make presents to everybody, and spend my money like what would seem to them a millionaire, and live a whole year there before I'd {{have to go back}} to sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "T {{know what}} you say about wages is true," [...] said the {{sergeant}} {{in command of the}} army wagon. [...] "I have it from a friend who left Havana when Lee, our consul, came away, {{that the majority of the}} Spanish troops stationed about the city hadn't seen a <b>pay-day</b> for nearly a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{where it}} hurts," [...] the sea lawyer went on. [...] "Fifteen hundred skins {{in the salt}} piles, and all honest, a big <b>pay-day</b> coming to every man Jack of us, and then to be {{captured}} and lose it all! It'd be different if we'd been poaching, but it's all honest work in open water." ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{the last}} <b>pay-day</b> Beauty Stanton's dancing-hall ever saw. Likewise {{it was to be}} the last she would ever see. In the madness of that night there was written finality--the end. Benton had reached its greatest, wildest, blackest, vilest. But not its deadliest! That must come--later--as an aftermath. But the height or the depth was reached.|$|E
60|$|Or that on Thursday, {{which is}} the three P.M. of the week, it seemed {{impossible}} to endure the tedium till Saturday noon; and that, invariably, her money was gone by Friday, so that Friday lunch was always a mere insult to her hunger, and she could never get her gloves from the cleaner till after Saturday <b>pay-day.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Smoking is {{good for}} the dyspepsy," [...] was the reply. [...] "You give me the money an' I'll pay the bills," [...] and then, when Andy still refused, the uncle waited until <b>pay-day</b> and went to the lumber camp and {{collected}} his nephew's wages. This brought on more trouble, and, because of this, Andy lost his position.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the evening}} of one <b>pay-day,</b> Dick took a short cut through the {{half-breed}} quarter of Santa Brigida. As not infrequently happens in old Spanish cities, this unsavory neighborhood surrounded the cathedral and corresponded in character with the localities known in western America as [...] "across the track." [...] Indeed, a Castilian proverb bluntly plays upon the juxtaposition of vice and bells.|$|E
60|$|From which, {{and from}} much {{which has already}} passed, it might erroneously be {{inferred}} that Young Dick was a mean and money-grubbing soul. On the contrary, he was at that instant entertaining secret thoughts and plans so utterly regardless and disdainful of his twenty millions as to place him {{on a par with}} a drunken sailor sowing the beach with a three years' <b>pay-day.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{very thing}} I'm going to do," [...] {{declared}} Red John. [...] "It's {{three years since}} I've received a line from home and ten years since I was there. Things are just as cheap in Sweden, Axel, as in Norway, and my folks are real country folk and farmers. I'll send my <b>pay-day</b> home and ship on the same ship with you for around the Horn. We'll pick a good one." ...|$|E
6000|$|Unlike {{most other}} plants the International Machine Company paid on Monday, {{and it was}} on the Monday {{following}} his assumption of his new duties that Jimmy had his first clash with Bince. He had been talking with Everett, the cashier, whom, in accordance with his [...] "method," [...] he was studying. From Everett he had learned that it was <b>pay-day</b> and he had asked the cashier to let him see the pay-roll.|$|E
60|$|We hove {{up anchor}} to a jolly chanty, and sailed out of Yokohama harbour for San Francisco. We took the {{northern}} passage, {{and with the}} stout west wind at our back made the run across the Pacific in thirty-seven days of brave sailing. We still had a big <b>pay-day</b> coming to us, and for thirty-seven days, without a drink to addle our mental processes, we incessantly planned the spending of our money.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know Bill," [...] he answered. [...] "He's over in {{the offices}} at San Antonio mostly, but he {{occasionally}} comes out here on business for Mr. Watson. I must say I don't like him very much, and I don't think the other men do either. He's a fellow who likes to drink now and then, and I understand he often gambles. That is, when he has the money. He's usually strapped long before <b>pay-day</b> comes around." ...|$|E
60|$|North we raced {{from the}} Bonin Islands {{to pick up}} the seal-herd, and north we hunted it for a hundred days into frosty, mitten weather and into and through vast fogs which hid the sun from us for a week at a time. It was wild and heavy work, without a drink or thought of drink. Then we sailed south to Yokohama, with a big catch of skins in our salt and a heavy <b>pay-day</b> coming.|$|E
