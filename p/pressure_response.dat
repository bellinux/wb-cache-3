25|$|In angina {{patients}} momentarily {{not feeling}} any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless {{there have been}} other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead to some conclusion regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood <b>pressure</b> <b>response</b> (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in systolic blood pressure), dysrhythmia and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough {{for the purposes of the}} treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress Echocardiography.|$|E

To this aim we have studied 20 borderline hypertensive patients (age range, 33 - 59, mean 45).

Ventilatory and mouth occlusion <b>pressure</b> <b>responses</b> to CO 2 were measured in eight healthy volunteers before and after the intravenous administration of 0. 3 mg/kg of diazepam and 0. 15 mg/kg of midazolam. The mean ventilatory response to CO 2 (mean +/- SEM) decreased after administration of diazepam or midazolam from 2. 0 +/- 0. 2 to 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 1. min- 1 /torr or from 2. 1 +/- 0. 2 to 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 1. min- 1 /torr, respectively. In the same volunteers, the mouth occlusion <b>pressure</b> <b>responses</b> decreased from 0. 54 +/- 0. 05 to 0. 30 +/- 0. 04 cm H 2 O/torr after midazolam and from 0. 67 +/- 0. 12 to 0. 28 +/- 0. 07 cm H 2 O/torr after diazepam. When compared with the control slopes of the ventilatory and mouth occlusion <b>pressure</b> <b>responses,</b> the drug slopes were significantly different. Respiration was similarly depressed after diazepam and after midazolam.

40|$|The airway {{pressure}} 100 msec {{after the}} onset of an inspiratory effort against a closed airway (P 100, occlusion pressure) is theoretically a more accurate index of respiratory neuron motor output than ventilation. Occlusion <b>pressure</b> and ventilation <b>responses</b> to hypercapnia were compared in repeated trials in 10 normal subjects while in the seated and supine positions. During progressive hypercapnia changes in P 100 were also compared to changes in tidal volume and inspiratory airflow.

Changing from the seated to the supine position, or vice versa, had no significant effect on either ventilation or occlusion <b>pressure</b> <b>responses</b> to CO 2.

40|$|Leaks from buried water {{distribution}} pipes are commonly located {{by applying the}} correlation technique to two measured acoustic/vibration signals {{on either side of}} a leak.

5000|$|Good headphones, well {{sealed to}} the ear, provide a flat low-frequency <b>pressure</b> <b>response</b> to the ear canal, with low {{distortion}} even at high intensities.

Headphone testing is therefore a good way to derive equal-loudness contours below about 500 Hz, though reservations have been expressed about the validity of headphone measurements when determining the actual threshold of hearing, based on observation that closing off the ear canal produces increased sensitivity to the sound of blood flow within the ear, which the brain appears to mask in normal listening conditions [...] At high frequencies, headphone measurement gets unreliable, and the various resonances of pinnae (outer ear) and ear canal are severely affected by proximity to the headphone cavity.|$|E

50|$|Micra's new-generation Xtronic CVT {{features}} a new structure combining a belt-operated CVT with an auxiliary two-speed transmission. The CVT raises the transmission ratio {{by more than}} 20% compared to other CVTs in its class, providing enhanced responsiveness on starting and acceleration and improved quietness during high-speed driving. With the auxiliary transmission, the size and weight of the CVT unit is significantly reduced. Friction is reduced by about 30% compared to other CVTs in its class, achieved by the increased transmission ratio, reduced pulley size and weight, and reduced oil agitating resistance - helping improve fuel economy. An electric oil pump is adopted in vehicles equipped with Idling Stop. Quicker oil <b>pressure</b> <b>response</b> improves startup performance and thus contributes to an improvement in fuel economy. While Idling Stop is in operation, pulley rotation is temporarily locked inside the CVT and is slowly unlocked when the engine starts again. This prevents reverse movement during a hill start and enables smooth startup.|$|E

50|$|The dorsomedial {{hypothalamic}} nucleus (DMH) receives its circadian {{information from}} the suprachiasmatic nucleus and senses leptin and other feeding cues, {{but it is also}} very possible that it contains its own feeding-entrained oscillator (FEO).

The DMH is also involved in the regulation of hypothalamic outflow to the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Almost all major nuclei and areas of the hypothalamus feed information to the DMH. The inhibition of neuronal activation using muscimol in the DMH inhibited 85% of heart rate response and 68% of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>response</b> to air stress.
