Other important pests {{of this family}} are the wheat blossom midge Sitodiplosis mosellana, the asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae) and the African rice gall midge O. oryzivora. Other pests are the coffee flower midge (Dasyneura coffeae), Soybean pod gall midge, (Asphondylia yushimai) pine needle gall midge (Thecodiplosis japonensis), the lentil flower midge (Contarinia lentis), the lucerne flower midge (C. medicaginis), and the alfalfa sprout midge (Dasineura ignorata) on the Leguminosae; the black locust tree gall midge (Obolodiplosis robiniae), the swede midge (Contarinia nasturtii), and the brassica pod midge (Dasineura brassicae) on the Cruciferae; the <b>pear</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia pyrivora) and the raspberry cane midge (Resseliella theobaldi) on fruit crops; Horidiplosis ficifolii on ornamental figs, and the rosette gall midge (Rhopalomyia solidaginis) on goldenrod stalks, Porrcondylini spp. on Citrus, Lestremia spp. on sweet potato, yam, ginger, garlic, onions, taro tubers, and potato, Lestodiplosis spp., Acaroletes spp., and Aphidoletes spp. on oranges, Lestodiplosis spp., Acaroletes spp., and Aphidoletes spp. on oranges, and Arthrocnodax spp. on limes.|$|E

40|$|Combined {{production}} of broilers and fruit trees {{is a subject}} often discussed in organic fruit production in Denmark. Very {{little research has been}} carried out on this type of production system. In organic production in Denmark, nearly no pesticides are allowed, so the need for alternative pest control is large. Apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea) and <b>pear</b> <b>midge</b> (Contarinia pyrivora) cause big crop losses in apples and pears respectively, in unsprayed organic fruit production. Both insects infest fruitlets and cause these to drop prematurely after which the pests pupate in the topsoil. In the present experiment a research orchard with the varieties ‘Discovery’ and ‘Conference’ were used as outdoor area for broilers to minimise the population of sawflies and pear midges, and to reduce the need for weeding and manuring. The trees were kept unsprayed. Fruit yield and fruit quality were assessed at harvest. White sticky traps were placed in the test area in order to measure the occurrence of sawfly over time. The infestation of <b>pear</b> <b>midge</b> was investigated counting the infested fruitlets in clusters on trees at the centre of the plots. The catch of apple sawflies was reduced in the combined apple and broiler production, but no significant effect on the yield or the fruit quality was seen. Experiences from on-farm research show that combining fruit and egg-production is one way to reduce the problem with apple sawfly, but poultry alone is not a sufficient way of controlling sawflies. The welfare and health of the broilers were excellent under fruit trees...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that midge sex pheromones could be chemically more diverse in structure {{than previously thought}} was tested {{in the context of}} four midge species of importance to UK horticulture: pear leaf midge, Dasineura pyri; <b>pear</b> <b>midge,</b> Contarinia pyrivora; blackcurrant midge, D. tetensi; and blackberry midge, D. plicatrix. The major component of the pheromone of D. pyri was identified as (2 R, 13 R, 8 Z) - 2, 13 -diacetoxy- 8 -heptadecene. Four isomers were separated by HPLC and in field tests the first eluting isomer only was attractive to male midges. Analysis of volatile collections from female C. pyrivora showed two consistent responses from male midges and they were identified as 2, 7 -diacetoxyundecane and 7 -acetoxyundecane- 2 -one. The field testing with isomers of 2, 7 -diacetoxyundecane separated by HPLC revealed that the first and the third eluting isomers were attractive. The racemic 7 -acetoxyundecane- 2 -one was active as well as the first eluting isomer from HPLC. Two EAG active components were detected in D. tetensi female volatile collections. The major component was identified as (Z) - 2, 12 -diacetoxy- 8 -heptadecene and after separation of stereoisomers by HPLC the third eluting isomer has shown to be attractive to male D. tetensi in the field. The structure for the minor component was proposed as a keto-acetate homologue of the corresponding major component. Preliminary work carried out on identification of the female sex pheromone of D. plicatrix indicated two responses from conspecific males. These were shown to be 15 -carbon acetates with the acetate function at C- 2, probably with two and one double bonds respectively. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

In 1925 Myers came to England to represent the New Zealand Government at the Second Imperial Entomological Conference. Afterwards he went to France at the request of his government to study the natural enemies of the <b>pear</b> leaf-curling <b>midge.</b> In the following year he was appointed to the staff of the Imperial Institute of Entomology to organize the breeding of parasites of injurious insects for export to the Dominions and colonies of the British Empire. He did notable work on the parasites of the blow-fly and of the timber-infesting wood wasps, which made possible their export to Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
