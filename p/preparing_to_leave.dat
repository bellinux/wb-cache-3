5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Fidel Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing to fight for South Africa had placed Cuba in its most aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Angola with his opponents on the defensive. According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E

5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country or expected to leave in the near future and would not be available for immediate combat operations.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was {{in command}} of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had {{meanwhile}} decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel.

Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.|$|E

5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} episodes {{of the eighth}} season, as Andy Griffith was <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> the {{character}} Sam Jones, played by Ken Berry, was introduced as the new star, and the series was reitled Mayberry R.F.D.. Most of the cast members continued their original roles, with Bavier becoming Sam's housekeeper. To create a smooth transition, Andy and Helen were married in the first episode with the new title and remained for a few additional episodes before leaving with a move to Raleigh, effectively ending their appearances. After RFDs cancellation in 1971, George Lindsey played Goober for many years on the popular country-variety show Hee Haw.|$|E

5|$|The Woman Hater is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Tom Taylor, a woman-hater, who sells his property to a financier at a play. In order to finalize the transaction, Taylor {{must go to the}} financier's hotel and becomes the subject of a bet by Lou Bennett that she can win his affections. Lou succeeds in the bet, but Taylor finds out and is <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> forever when Lou speaks to him. Little is known about the production or the cast other than a single credit of Violet Heming as Lou Bennett. The film was released on June 14, 1910, but is not know to have been reviewed by any trade publications. The film is presumed lost, but another production of the same name released the same year was rediscovered in New Zealand in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> The claim is that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E

5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At {{the end of the summer}} he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is <b>preparing</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
