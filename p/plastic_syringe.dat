40|$|Summary: The {{alterations}} {{of blood}} gases, pH, electrolytes and haemoglobin during 45 min storage in ice-water were measured in 6 types of syringes (1 glass and 5 <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes,</b> among these 3 "blood gas samplers"). It was confirmed that pO 2 generally is not stable in <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes.</b> However, considerable differences among <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> {{were found in}} this respect, the smallest increase occuring in an ordinary 2 ml syringe for injections and the greatest {{in one of the}} special blood gas samplers. Due to the "buffering effect " of deoxyhaemoglobin, the alterations of pO 2 are smaller in the hypoxaemic than in the normoxaemic range. Relevant pO 2 alterations in <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> are demonstrable after 20 minutes. It is concluded that blood collected in <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> must be analysed within 15 min after sampling, otherwise glass syringes should be used for blood collection. Deviations of /?CO 2, pH and electrolytes are described in detail. In general, they are due to sampling rather than to storage, and can be effectively minimized by a small dead space of the syringe and by use of an electrolyte-balanced heparin solution. The danger of erroneous haemoglobin measurements due to unequal resuspension of the red cells after storage is pointed out. Introduction „ _,. ι,,, 1 13.

50|$|For the {{quantitative}} sampling of sedimentary environments at all depths {{a wide variety}} of samplers have been devised. The simplest is a <b>plastic</b> <b>syringe</b> with the end cut off to form a piston corer which can be deployed in the littoral zone, or in the sub-littoral using SCUBA gear.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although <b>plastic</b> {{arterial}} sampling <b>syringes</b> are now commonly used, {{the effects}} of sample storage time and temperature on blood gas tensions are poorly described for samples with a high oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2) taken with these high density polypropylene syringes. METHODS [...] Two ml samples of tonometered whole blood (PaO 2 86. 7 kPa, PaCO 2 4. 27 kPa) were placed in glass syringes and in three brands of <b>plastic</b> blood gas <b>syringes.</b> The syringes were placed either at room temperature or in iced water and blood gas analysis was performed at baseline and after 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. RESULTS [...] In the first 10 minutes measured PaO 2 in <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> at room temperature fell {{by an average of}} 1. 21 kPa/min; placing the sample on ice reduced the rate of PaO 2 decline to 0. 19 kPa/min. The rate of fall of PaO 2 in glass at room temperature was 0. 49 kPa/min. The changes in PaCO 2 were less dramatic and at room temperature averaged increases of 0. 47 kPa for <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> and 0. 71 kPa for glass syringes over the entire two hour period. These changes in gas tension for <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> would lead to an overestimation of pulmonary shunt measured by the 100 % oxygen technique of 0. 6 % for each minute left at room temperature before analysis. CONCLUSIONS [...] Glass syringes are superior to <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> in preserving samples with a high PaO 2, and prompt and adequate cooling of such samples is essential for accurate blood gas analysis...|$|R

50|$|The 1950s {{also saw}} the rise and {{recognition}} of cross-contamination from used needles. This {{led to the development}} of the first fully disposable <b>plastic</b> <b>syringe</b> by New Zealand pharmacist Colin Murdoch in 1956. This period also marked a shift in interest from needle specifications to general sterility and safety. The 1980s saw the rise of the HIV epidemic and with it renewed concern over the safety of cross-contamination from used needles. New safety controls were designed on disposable needles to ensure the safety of medical workers in particular. These controls were implemented on the needles themselves, such as retractable needles, but also in the handling of used needles particularly in the use of hard-surface disposal receptacles found in every medical office today.|$|E
50|$|Very recently, {{advances}} in pattern application and deposition at reduced length scales have exploited small-scale synthesis methods including nano-scale chemical surface restructuring and photolithography of computer-generated random specular patterns to produce suitable surface contrast for DIC. The application of very fine powder particles that electrostatically {{adhere to the}} surface of the specimen and can be digitally tracked is one approach. For Al thin films, fine alumina abrasive polishing powder was initially used since the particle sizes are relatively well controlled, although the adhesion to Al films was not very good and the particles tended to agglomerate excessively. The candidate that worked most effectively was a silica powder designed for a high temperature adhesive compound (Aremco, inc.), which was applied through a <b>plastic</b> <b>syringe.</b> A light blanket of powder would coat the gage section of the tensile sample and the larger particles could be blown away gently. The remaining particles would be those with the best adhesion to the surface. While the resulting surface contrast is not ideal for DIC, the high intensity ratio between the particles and the background provide a unique opportunity to track the particles between consecutive digital images taken during deformation. This can be achieved quite straightforwardly using digital image processing techniques. Subpixel tracking can be achieved by a number of correlation techniques, or by fitting to the known intensity profiles of particles. Photolithography and Electron Beam Lithography can be used to create micro tooling for micro speckle stamps, and the stamps can print speckle patterns on{{to the surface of}} the specimen. Stamp inks can be chosen which are appropriate for optical DIC, SEM-DIC, and simultaneous SEM-DIC/EBSD studies (the ink can be transparent to EBSD).|$|E

40|$|Summary: Influences {{of storage}} {{temperature}} and blood cell metabolism {{in different types}} of syringes were investigated. Experiments were performed on blood samples with normal and elevated leukocyte counts. After equilibration with gas mixtures at normal pO 2 (86 mm Hg/ 11. 5 kPa) and elevated pO 2 (140 mm Hg/ 18. 7 kPa), sequential blood gas analyses were done within one hour. Storage temperatures were 4 °C or 22 °C. In {{the first group of}} experiments we compared glass samplers with <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> at different storage temperatures with regard to deviations of blood gas concentrations. The analysed samples had a normal cell count. Blood stored in glass syringes in ice water served as the reference, and it displayed virtually no changes. The deviations of pCO 2 and pH were relatively small. In <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> the greatest increases for pO 2 occurred after storage at 4 °C, which {{can be explained by the}} increased solubility of oxygen and the higher O 2 affinity of haemoglobin at 4 °C. When stored at room temperature, the deviations in <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> were smaller. In a second group of experiments, the influence of cell metabolism was studied. Blood gases were analysed in samples with elevated leukocyte counts (20 χ 109 / 1, 40 χ 109 / 1, 60 χ 109 / 1), and only glass syringes were used. It was demonstrated that after storage at 22 °C considerable losses in pO 2 occurred, while at 4 °C there was virtually no change. Deviations of/?O 2, pCO 2 and pH are described in detail...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined to chemometric analysis to discriminate and quantify three antibiotics by direct measurement in <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes.</b> Solutions of benzylpenicillin (PENI), amoxicillin (AMOX) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMOX/CLAV) were analyzed at therapeutic concentrations in glass vials and <b>plastic</b> <b>syringes</b> with NIR spectrometer by direct measurement. Chemometric analysis using partial least squares regression and discriminative analysis was conducted to develop qualitative and quantitative calibration models. Discrimination of the three antibiotics was optimal for concentrated solutions with 100 % of accuracy. For quantitative analysis, the three antibiotics furnished a linear response (R- 2 > 0. 9994) for concentrations ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 2 g/mL for AMOX, 0. 1 to 1. 0 MUI/mL for PENI and 0. 005 to 0. 05 g/mL for AMOX/CLAV with excellent repeatability (maximum 1. 3 %) and intermediate precision (maximum of 3. 2 %).
