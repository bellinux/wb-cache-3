5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> (Fig.16). The <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
25|$|A similar effect {{imposes a}} maximum range as well. In order to {{maximize}} range, longer times between pulses should be used, {{referred to as}} a pulse repetition time, or its reciprocal, <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{this work}} progressed, the teams {{continued}} {{development of the}} basic system. Burcham and Atkinson continued their development of the transmitter section, attempting to generate very short pulses of power to feed the magnetron. They finally settled on a solution using two tubes, a thyratron and a pentode, which produced 1µs pulses at 15kW. GEC preferred a design using a single thyratron, but this was eventually abandoned in favour of the AMRE design. Further work pushed this system to 50kW, producing 10kW of microwaves at a <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> of 2500 cycles per second.|$|E

40|$|Metal halide high {{intensity}} discharge (HID) lamps typically operate as multi-atmosphere thermal arcs in the steady state, {{but during the}} starting phase the lamps are moderate pressure glow discharges. This starting phase is of considerable interest {{because of the large}} required voltages inducing sputtering and other detrimental effects. The goal of this thesis was to investigate basic processes using rare gas mixtures so that optimum starting strategies can be developed for metal halide HID lamps. Breakdown measurements on a test lamp were conducted at various <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequencies</b> (0. 005 - 1000 Hz), voltage pulses (up to 2000 V), pressures (0. 5 – 110 Torr), and argon/xenon compositions, and with various ground planes. Photographs of discharges in argon, xenon, and a 10 % xenon in argon mixture were also taken at various pressures to provide additional insight. It was found that the mean breakdown time reflects the rate at which electrons are being created, and is dependent upon E/N (electric field) /(gas number density) and capacitive effects. Lower breakdown times are achieved by lowering pressure, increasing voltage and <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and by closer placement of ground planes...|$|R
500|$|The male call can {{be heard}} {{at any time of}} day and {{consists}} of an unusual hissing-type sound, starting as a series of one-second sibilant bursts about a second apart repeated more rapidly until they become a constant hiss lasting 7–10s. Described as [...] "rp, rp, rp, rp, rrrrrp", the sound is produced when single muscular contractions click the tymbal inward, buckling 7–9 of the tymbal ribs, each of which produces a pulse. This occurs alternately on the two tymbals and is rapidly repeated at a frequency of about 143Hz (in groups of four except when the cicada is in distress– when they are ungrouped and at a lower frequency), giving a <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> of around 1050 per second, with a relatively broad sound frequency range of 7.5–10.5kHz, that has a dominant frequency (at which the peak energy is observed) of 9.5–9.6kHz.|$|E
500|$|Singing can cease and restart suddenly, either rarely or frequently, {{and often}} ends abruptly. The song has been {{described}} as [...] "Tar-ran-tar-rar-tar-ran-tar-rar", [...] and consists of a series of pulses emitted at a rate of 240–250 a second. The tymbal covers are much larger than other species and also make the call louder and send it in a particular direction. There are two distinct phases of song, which the double drummer switches between at irregular intervals. One phase is a continuous call that can last for several minutes; during this period the frequency varies between 5.5–6.2kHz and 6.0–7.5kHz 4–6 times a second. In the other phase, the song is interrupted by breaks of increasing frequency resulting in a staccato sound. These breaks can be mistaken for silence as the difference in volume is so great, though the song actually continues at a much lower volume. During this staccato phase, which lasts for several seconds, the frequency remains around 5.75–6.5kHz. The frequency of the song is a high harmonic of the <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency,</b> which makes for a particularly ringing sound. Double drummers congregate in groups to amplify their calls, which likely drives off potential bird predators.|$|E

40|$|Electrochemotherapy is a {{technique}} where electric pulses in combination with chemotherapeutic agents are applied to tumor cells. In general, patients find electrochemotherapy tolerable, in spite of unpleasant sensations associated with contraction of muscles located beneath or {{in the vicinity of}} the electrodes. These contractions are due to the intensity of the electric pulses required for effective electropermeabilization of tumor cell membranes. Since a train of eight electric <b>pulses</b> with <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1 Hz is usually applied to the tumors, each pulse in the train excites underlying nerves and provokes muscle contractions. Therefore, for patients involved in electrochemotherapy, the use of <b>pulses</b> with <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> higher than the frequency of tetanic contraction would represent reduced number of muscle contractions and associated unpleasant sensations. Our results of the uptake of Lucifer Yellow into electropermeabilized cells in vitro show that with increased <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency</b> the uptake stays at similar levels even at frequencies up to 8. 3 kHz.

The PRF could be adjusted from 25 to 25 and 7/16th for Low, and 33 1/3 to 34 1/9th for High. This system shared the middle tower, which broadcast on both frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|These two effects {{tend to be}} at {{odds with}} each other, and {{it is not easy to}} combine both good short range and good long range in a single radar. This is because the short pulses needed for a good minimum range {{broadcast}} have less total energy, making the returns much smaller and the target harder to detect. This could be offset by using more pulses, but this would shorten the maximum range. So each radar uses a particular type of signal. Long-range radars tend to use long pulses with long delays between them, and short range radars use smaller pulses with less time between them. As electronics have improved many radars now can change their <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>frequency,</b> thereby changing their range. The newest radars fire two pulses during one cell, one for short range (about [...] ) and a separate signal for longer ranges (about [...] ).|$|E
