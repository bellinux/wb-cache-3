40|$|Condition-based {{maintenance}} (CBM) is {{an advanced}} maintenance strategy in which maintenance actions are scheduled based {{on both the}} age data and condition monitoring information. Proportional Hazards Model (PHM) is a powerful statistical tool for estimating the equipment failure rate under condition monitoring. Effective CBM using PHM can decrease the overall maintenance costs by reducing unnecessary scheduled preventive maintenance actions. In CBM using PHM, main optimization objectives including minimizing maintenance costs and maximizing equipment reliability typically conflict to each other. But the reported research only focuses on single-objective. In this thesis, we propose a multiple-objective CBM optimization approach based on physical programming, which can systematically balance the tradeoff between the optimization objectives and find the optimal solution that best represents the decision maker's preference on the objectives. In CBM using PHM, the accuracy of parameter estimation greatly affects {{the accuracy of the}} model in representing and predicting the equipment health condition. Traditional optimization methods such as Newton's methods are inaccurate because they can only find local optimal value in parameter estimation. In this thesis, we develop an approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) for PHM parameter estimation and this approach can improve the accuracy of parameter estimation significantly. To illustrate the proposed approaches, we conduct two case studies using real-world vibration monitoring data, shearing <b>pump</b> <b>bearings</b> in a food processing plant and Gould <b>pump</b> <b>bearings</b> at Canadian Kraft Mill. The proposed approaches contribute to the general knowledge of condition based maintenance, and have the potential to greatly benefit various industries...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{analysis}} of an unbalanced rotor-water pump-bearing system considering varying compliance effect and localized defects on bearing races Zheng-mei Li 1, Qiong Zhou 2, Qi An 1 and Zheng-dong Wang 1 A multi-degree of freedom (DOF) dynamic model is developed using the {{transfer matrix method}} to obtain the vibration response of an unbalanced rotor-coaxial water <b>pump</b> <b>bearing</b> system due to varying compliance and localized race defects of the bearing. In this model, the bending flexibility and masses of the rotor and bearing housing are taken into consideration. The two rolling element rows of the water <b>pump</b> <b>bearing</b> are modeled {{as a series of}} springs and dampers, and the anisotropic bearing stiffness and damping changing with the rotational speed are analyzed. The varying compliance and the localized race defect are both modeled as periodic excitations, on which the influences of the unbalanced forces in the rotor are considered. By using the vibration model, the discrete frequency spectra of vibration responses caused by the varying compliance and localized race defects of the two rolling element rows are predicted. The results show that for the varying compliance or a race defect of an individual rolling element rows, there are a series of additional components in the frequency spectrum in addition to the peaks at the harmonics of characteristic frequency due to the effect of the rotor unbalance. The response amplitude due to varying compliance of the roller row is found to be quite high in comparison to that due to varying compliance of the ball row because the axial load carried by the ball row uniforms the contact load distribution among balls and then reduces the varying compliance excitation...|$|R
