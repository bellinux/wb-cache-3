40|$|In this paper, the orderbatching {{problem in}} {{warehouses}} is investigated. Batching, or clustering orders {{together in the}} picking process to form a single picking route, reduces travel time and, as such, this phenomenon can be encountered in many warehouses. The reason for its importance is that orderpicking is a labour intensive process and, by using good batching methods, substantial savings can be obtained. The batching and routing problems are complex to solve. In practice, simple methods are used for the batching problem, such as first-come first-served (FCFS), i. e. combine orders in the route in the arriving sequence until the pick-device is full. Once clusters of orders have been formed, the calculation of the travel time for the routes requires the solution {{of a number of}} travelling salesman problems (one for each route). Two groups of heuristic algorithms are evaluated: the Seed algorithms and the somewhat more complex (and CPU time consuming) Time Savings algorithms. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated using two different routing strategies: the so-called S-shape and Largest gap strategies, which are well known in theory and practice. The heuristics are compared for travel time, number of batches formed and also for robustness. An algorithm is robust if it can be applied to any warehousing situation and still yield good results. Since the problem has to be implemented in existing Warehouse Management Systems and has to be solved online many times a day, the simplicity, transparency and CPU time are also important in most warehousing situations. It is demonstrated that even simple order batching methods lead to significant improvement compared to FCFS. Seed algorithms are best in conjunction with S-shape and a large capacity of the <b>pick</b> <b>device.</b> Time savings algorithms perform best in conjunction with Largest gap and small pickdevice capacity. If CPU time becomes important, then using simple Seed algorithms should be considered...|$|E

The order processing time, expressed in minutes, is randomly generated from U(10; 27), where U(x 1; x 2) defines a uniform distribution between x 1 and x 2.

Visual cues such as shading and colour let the user distinguish structures in the 3 -d display that are incompletely extracted by threshold segmentation. In order to be truly helpful, analysed information needs to be quantified and transferred back into the data. We extend our previously presented scheme for such display by establishing a communication between visual analysis and the display process. The main tool is a selective 3 -d <b>picking</b> <b>device.</b> For being useful on a rather rough segmentation, the device itself and the display offer facilities for object selection. Selective intersection planes let the user discard information prior to choosing a tissue of interest. Subsequently, a picking is carried out on the 2 -d display by casting a ray into the volume.

On the basis the theoretical analysis of picking mechanism and structural parameters of the half-feed picking roller, and combined with the picking performance experimental, the structural parameters of the picking blades and blades quantity of picking roller were studied. The results show that: when the straight-shaped blade is picking, the picking force is strong, the broken branch and seedling phenomenon is serious, peanut broken rate and peanut with handle rate are higher; the arc-shaped blade reduced peanut damage, and effectively reduced {{the rate of the}} peanut with handle. The picking blade radian has a large impact to the peanut broken and loss rate. When the blade radian is 70 ° and the blade radius is 35 mm, total loss rate is the lowest on the picking segment of the blade. The blade quantity has significant influence to the peanut broken and loss rate. The peanut broken rate of the 8 blades is 2 to 3 times of the 4 and 6 blades; the picking net rate of the 4 blades is much lower than 6 and 8 blades.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects of the development, at the Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering (IMAG B. V.), of an automatic harvesting machine for cucumbers was to achieve a fast and accurate eye-hand co-ordination during the picking operation. This paper presents a procedure developed for the cucumber harvesting robot to pursue this objective. The procedure contains two main components. First of all acquisition of sensory information about the working environment of the robot and, secondly, a program to generate collision-free manipulator motions to direct the end-effector to and from the cucumber. This paper elaborates on the latter. Collision-free manipulator motions were generated with a so-called path search algorithm. In this research the A*-search algorithm was used. With some numerical examples the search procedure is illustrated and analysed in view of application to cucumber harvesting. It is concluded that collision-free motions can be calculated for the seven degrees-of-freedom manipulator used in the cucumber <b>picking</b> <b>device.</b> The A*-search algorithm is easy to implement and robust. This algorithm either produces a solution or stops when a solution cannot be found. This favourable property, however, makes the algorithm prohibitively slow.

40|$|Existing on-line order {{batching}} rules, namely fixed time window batching (FTWB) and variable time window batching (VTWB), try {{to choose the}} fixed time window {{in the case of}} FTWB or the fixed number of orders in the case of VTWB. However, these solutions are not appropriate for the fluctuating order environment. The reasonable assignment of batches to order pickers is also an important issue in order picking systems. Motivated by these issues, we study the problem of integrating on-line {{order batching}} and the assignment of the batches, which is called the on-line order batching and sequencing problem with multiple pickers (OOBSPMP). The objective is to minimize the turnover time. To solve the problem, a hybrid rule-based algorithm, referred to FTWB, is proposed in order to form batches and assign them to appropriate pickers under a fluctuating order environment. Three batching situations (off-peak, normal and peak arrival time) and two assigning situations (assigning to one busy picker and assigning to one idle picker) are distinguished. Through a series of experiments, we discover several enlightening findings: (i) the rule-based algorithm demonstrates high effectiveness and efficiency in turnover time with multiple pickers; (ii) the rule-based algorithm leads to an impressive improvement in both saving time and wage costs under different arrival rates, <b>picking</b> <b>devices</b> and time intervals compared with VTWB; (iii) to obtain both good warehouse performance and a reasonable workload distribution, the factors, such as the fixed time window, the average workload per picker and the average idle time per picker are also important issues in analysing the efficiency of order picking systems.

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{available}} for the automated order-picking of goods that are packed in pouches. Pouches are produced and stored on a chain to simplify subsequent handling operations. In the order-picking zone, the chain is automatically fed forward by a cover band drive, cut into single pouches, and dispensed to fulfill customer orders. The approach is very promising but {{has not yet been}} put into practice since there is still a lack of rules for a proper dimensioning. This thesis discusses the design aspects concerned with the new order-picking method. Detailed analytical, simulative, and experimental analyses are conducted and used to derive the missing tools for the dimensioning. The special loads that occur inside the pouch chain during the feed process are analyzed, a pouch test strategy that is applicable to any case of application is developed, and a mathematical model for the evaluation of pouch and pouch chain guidance design is derived. General design aspects of the cover band drive are discussed, and a simulation model is developed for the analysis and evaluation of the mechanics of and inside the drive. In particular, this model allows for the calculation of cover band pretension variations due to the inhomogeneous and compliant pouch chains which are affecting an undisturbed feed movement. A cover band test rig is developed and used to verify the dimensioning tools. Apart from this verification, further aspects, such as the positioning accuracy of the pouch cross seals for cutting, are analyzed experimentally. Recommendations for the dimensioning of a <b>picking</b> <b>device</b> are given. Based upon the key performance figures elaborated this way, design aspects regarding an entire picking system are examined.

30|$|In this study, {{impact of}} the device size and {{thickness}} on the Cu pillars and resistive switching memory characteristics using a single Al 2 O 3 layer in the Cu/Al 2 O 3 /TiN CBRAM devices has been investigated. The amorphous Al 2 O 3 film with a thickness of 18 nm and the device sizes are observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) image. By measuring 50 randomly <b>picked</b> <b>devices,</b> the empirical result tells that large size devices are promising for future Cu pillar applications. From cumulative probability of 50 devices, the Cu pillars can reach up to a high CC of 70 mA. Hence, the strong metallic path inside the Al 2 O 3 layer {{can be used as}} a connecting way among the different stacks of high-density 3 D memory devices. Long read endurance of 105 cycles of the large size devices at a high read voltage of - 1.5 V ensures about the robustness of the Cu pillars or metallic paths. In addition, thickness-dependent resistive switching memory characteristics are also observed. Superior CBRAM characteristics such as high switching yield of 88 %, lower average RESET current of approximately 328 μA, and acceptable resistance ratio of 9.6 are obtained for the 0.4 -μm devices with a 2 -nm-thick Al 2 O 3 film under low voltage of ± 2 V, which is due to lower diffusion of Cu ions into the Al 2 O 3 films under external bias. The resistive switching mechanism is based on the formation and dissolution of the Cu filaments into the Al 2 O 3 films. Good data retention ability of > 48 h is also obtained. This CBRAM device shows forming-free current-voltage (I-V) characteristics under a CC of 30 μA, even at lowest CC of 0.1 μA.|$|R

The 20 -nm-thick Al 2 O 3 films {{have been used for}} the Cu pillar formation (i.e., stronger Cu filaments) in the Al/Cu/Al 2 O 3 /TiN structures, which can be used for three-dimensional (3 D) cross-point architecture as reported previously Nanoscale Res. Lett. 9 : 366, 2014. Fifty randomly <b>picked</b> <b>devices</b> with sizes ranging from 8 [*]×[*] 8 to 0.4 [*]×[*] 0.4 μm 2 have been measured. The 8 -μm devices show 100 % yield of Cu pillars, whereas only 74 % successful is observed for the 0.4 -μm devices, because smaller size devices have higher Joule heating effect and larger size devices show long read endurance of 105 cycles at a high read voltage of - 1.5 V. On the other hand, the resistive switching memory characteristics of the 0.4 -μm devices with a 2 -nm-thick Al 2 O 3 film show superior as compared to those of both the larger device sizes and thicker (10 nm) Al 2 O 3 film, owing to higher Cu diffusion rate for the larger size and thicker Al 2 O 3 film. In consequence, higher device-to-device uniformity of 88 % and lower average RESET current of approximately 328 μA are observed for the 0.4 -μm devices with a 2 -nm-thick Al 2 O 3 film. Data retention capability of our memory device of > 48 h makes it a promising one for future nanoscale nonvolatile application.
