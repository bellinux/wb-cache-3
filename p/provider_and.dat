5|$|Scene7 {{moved from}} San Rafael to Hamilton Landing in Novato, California in September 2002 to {{accommodate}} more employees. On July 9, 2003, the company acquired {{all of the}} assets of workflow <b>provider</b> <b>and</b> advertising software company Engage for $1.2million and assumed its $650,000 debt after Engage filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Engage was {{the parent company of}} both Cascade and MidSystems, which were two of the first companies that tried to automate prepress production for newspapers and large printers. On August 15, 2003, Scene7 acquired its top competitor, TrueSpectra of San Mateo, for an undisclosed amount of cash and stock. On June 15, 2004, Scene7 raised $7.5million in another round of financing, led by home shopping company QVC with some of Scene7's existing investors. At the same time, Jeffrey Branman, President of Interactive Technology Partners at QVC, and David Rubenstein, co-founder of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, joined Scene7's board of directors, which was composed of James Caccavo of Moore Capital, Andrew Wright of RealNetworks, and Mack.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service <b>provider</b> <b>and</b> its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

5|$|The {{facilities}} are utilised by the Route 26 Community Project, a registered charity {{based at the}} centre that works towards the betterment of lives in Deckham and neighbouring wards. The project works with Gateshead Council and the Gateshead Housing Company to provide a community cafe promoting healthy eating (the T–Junction), a gymnasium, indoor sports hall, outdoor Five-a-side football pitches and a meeting place for resident groups. The project has education provision for young children as a registered day–care <b>provider</b> <b>and</b> it also offers adult education and training. The project hosts the Carnival on the Hill/Deckham Festival, a collaborative enterprise between Route 26, Gateshead Council and Home Group, offering free activities such as go-karting and children's soft play, {{against the backdrop of}} a steel band. The second Carnival on the Hill was held on 3 September 2011 and attracted more than 1,000 visitors, including the Mayor of Gateshead and BBC local weatherman Paul Mooney.|$|E
5|$|Four British {{transports}} were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission also {{assessed the}} American Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar, Fairchild C-123 <b>Provider</b> <b>and</b> Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further {{consideration of the}} options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 {{the members of the}} mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet {{some of the most important}} elements of the requirement. At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).|$|E
5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae move like amoebae – that is, crawling on the substrate – and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist to wet environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a cell wall. This developmental stage (and the next one) serves as a nourishment <b>provider</b> <b>and</b> {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (nourishment phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme dryness or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states – the so-called microcysts. For that to happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin cell wall. In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E
