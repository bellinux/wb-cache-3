5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding {{in the field}} pole face plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field <b>pole</b> <b>plate</b> is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Apparent polar {{wander in}} the mean-lithosphere (= no-net-rotation = no-net-torque uniform drag) {{reference}} frame is compared with apparent polar wander in the hotspot reference frame {{over the past}} 100 Myr. Palaeo-magnetic <b>poles</b> and <b>plate</b> rotations previously used to determine an apparent polar wander path for the hotspot reference frame are here used to determine an apparent polar wander path in the mean-lithosphere reference frame. We find that the two paths are similar, especially for Late Cretaceous time, when a 10 "- 20 " shift of the pole occurred. To first-order the hotspots and litho-sphere (as a whole) moved in unison relative to the palaeomagnetic axis during Late Cretaceous time. A non-dipole field explanation for the apparent shift can probably be excluded. However, either motion of the time-averaged geomagnetic axis relative to the spin axis or polar wandering could have caused this shift, the latter being the more likely explanation. Key words: polar wander, hotspots, mean-lithospher...|$|R
50|$|The {{properties}} of triple junctions are most easily understood from the purely kinematic {{point of view}} where the plates are rigid and moving {{over the surface of}} the Earth. No knowledge of the Earth's interior or the geological details of the crust are then needed. Another useful simplification is that the kinematics of triple junctions on a flat Earth are essentially the same as those on the surface of a sphere. On a sphere, plate motions are described as relative rotations about Euler <b>Poles</b> (see <b>Plate</b> reconstruction), and the relative motion at every point along a plate boundary can be calculated from this rotation. But the area around a triple junction is small enough (relative {{to the size of the}} sphere) and (usually) far enough from the pole of rotation, that the relative motion across a boundary can be assumed to be constant along that boundary. Thus, analysis of triple junctions can usually be done on a flat surface with motions defined by vectors.|$|R

50|$|Most carvers {{create a}} {{sculpture}} {{from a single}} piece of argillite wherever possible. However, because an increase in the size of argillite increases the potential for failure in the piece due to inherent faults and stresses, larger sculptures are sometimes made from separate pieces carved and subsequently adhered. High relief is often carved by working against the grain. This technique lends stability to the fragile argillite. The drawback to this method is that it sometimes causes flaking, making carving in high relief an advanced carving technique. For a long, shallow piece, it is often better to work with the grain. Different objects require varying levels of skill in their execution. Panel pipes are considered the most difficult pieces to carve. Bowls are also challenging, with group figurines, boxes, <b>poles</b> and <b>plates</b> considered easier to do. The black finish of argillite is usually not natural. In its natural state, argillite is often a grey-black or green-black color. The jet-black finish is created by the carver rubbing the carving with the oils or polish as it is being created. The natural oils that skin produces are actually responsible for creating the deep black color argillite is known for, although it is also common to coat the argillite with a polish to recreate the jet-black color.|$|R

These represent the most probable systematic errors within the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy Catalogue (EDSGC) which could affect the angular correlation function. The distribution of extinction within the EDSGC area was obtained using the Stark et al. HI map and the IRAS 100 μm flux map. We find that the amplitude of the whole EDSGC correlation function varies by less than δ w= 0. 003 for reddening ratios R_V in the range 3. 25 → 6. This corresponds to a range in average extinction of A_B= 0. 12 → 0. 24.

40|$|Modern {{generations of}} {{apparent}} polar wander paths (APWPs) show the occurrence in North American and African coordinates {{of a major}} and rapid shift in <b>pole</b> position (<b>plate</b> shift) during the Middle to Late Jurassic (175 – 145 Ma) that alternative curves from the literature tend to underestimate. This Jurassic massive polar shift (JMPS), of vast and as-yet unexplored paleogeographic implications, is also predicted for Eurasia from the North Atlantic plate circuit, but Jurassic data from this continent are scanty and problematic. Here we present paleomagnetic data from the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian (upper Jurassic) Garedu Formation of Iran, {{which was part of}} Eurasia since the Triassic. Paleomagnetic component directions of primary (pre-folding) age indicate a paleolatitude of deposition that is in excellent agreement with the latitude drop predicted for Iran from APWPs incorporating the JMPS. Moreover, we show that paleolatitudes calculated from these APWPs, used in conjunction with simple zonal climate belts, better explain the overall stratigraphic evolution of Iran during the Mesozoic. As Iran drifted from the tropical arid belt to the mid-latitude humid belt in the Late Triassic, carbonate platform productivity stopped while widespread coal-bearing sedimentation started, whereas as Iran returned to arid tropical latitudes during the JMPS, carbonate platform productivity and evaporitic sedimentation resumed. These results illustrate (1) the potent, but often neglected, control that plate motion (continental drift and/or true polar wander) across zonal climate belts exerts on the genesis of sedimentary facies; and (2) the importance of precisely controlled paleogeographic reconstructions for tectonic interpretations, especially during times of fast plate motion like the Jurassic. As a suggestion for future research, we predict that the adoption of Eurasian reference paleopoles incorporating the JMPS may lead to a reconciliation (or reinterpretation) o...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluate}} teleseismically determined focal mechanisms and epicenters for earthquakes along the Macquarie Ridge Complex (MRC) from 45 °S to 61 °S and 155 °E to 168 °E, a region characterized by some previous investigators as undergoing subduction initiation. From 65 centroid moment tensors reported by Harvard, we develop statistical guidelines for choosing 26 which represent better determined, more reliable focal mechanisms for tectonic analysis. Although thrust mechanisms occur in the north, near Fiordland, elsewhere along the MRC the better determined mechanisms virtually all indicate that present-day motion along most of the MRC is strike-slip. This is consistent with sidescan sonar and multichannel reflection data collected between 50 °S and 57 °S on 1994 and 1996 cruises; the active plate boundary zone appears to be quite narrow (< 5 km wide), and no active compressional features can be observed on the seafloor. If we determine a rotation <b>pole</b> for <b>plate</b> boundary motion using only slip vectors from better determined Harvard mechanisms along the MRC, the best fitting “instantaneous” pole is at 57. 4 °S, 179. 4 °E, about 2. 5 ° north of the NUVEL-I Australian-Pacific pole, which averages motion over the last 3. 0 my. If the MRC pole was formerly farther south than at present, this could explain the existence of relict features associated with crustal shortening, such as bathymetric highs and troughs; yet, the absence of active features such as thrust faults, etc., suggests ongoing compression or subduction initiation. We also carefully read arrival times for P phases for 53 earthquakes at 16 teleseismic stations, selected to represent a range of azimuths surrounding the earthquakes; we relocated these earthquakes using standard joint epicentral determination (JED) methods. While most of the better quality relocations lie on or {{very close to the}} Australia-Pacific boundary as determined on the 1994 cruise, a few epicenters occur well away from the boundary, apparently on Cenozoic fracture zones. Thus, on the Macquarie Ridge Complex and other major strike-slip boundaries (e. g., in California), it appears that the very largest earthquakes occur on the principal plate boundary fault but that other earthquakes, some quite large, may occur away from the boundary along zones of preexisting weakness. <br/...|$|R
