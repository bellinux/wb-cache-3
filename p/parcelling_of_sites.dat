50|$|In 1987, {{the land}} was parcelled off to various groups. The Department of National Defence took over 3,000 {{hectares}} {{for use as a}} military training area; the Burwash Native Peoples Project took over 3,200 hectares for a First Nations-owned sawmill company; the Sudbury Public School Board leased part of the land for an outdoor science education program; the provincial Ministry of Transportation took over on-site gravel reserves for use in road construction; the Ministry of Natural Resources took over 6,200 hectares for timber and wildlife management; and a local country music festival was granted a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> the <b>site</b> to serve as its new venue. A citizen's group in Sudbury, the Sudbury Citizens Movement, opposed the plan and sought to acquire the site so it could establish a worker's cooperative in the institutional buildings and an affordable housing community in the residential townsite, but was not successful in overturning the selloff.|$|R

The majority of the revealed movable archaeology materials indicate traces of a nucleated Neolithic settlement of Starcevo and Vinca cultures. In some <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> this archaeological <b>site</b> during 2011, geophysical recordings, respectively magnetometer survey were carried out, resulting with reflection of several underneath structures that might indicate the remains of the Nelothic houses. From the findings in this locality is believed to be found at other residues of an ancient civilization. In Varosh, 500 m from the wake of the church is Urns, which since 1967 lies in the Museum of Kosovo. There is believed that is a Roman-Illyrian settlement. Mysteries were busy underground since 1984, where history professor, Ymer Berisha had found a carved stone.|$|R
5000|$|The council {{appeared}} {{in the forefront of}} cultural heritage protection debates during the American 2003 invasion of Iraq. A 2003 article in Science discusses Ashton and Pearlstein's advocacy for [...] "liberalization" [...] in the issuance of foreign-dig permits in Iraq and reconsideration of Iraqi cultural heritage laws to allow “some objects be certified for export." [...] On ACCP's activities concerning Iraqi cultural heritage, Zainab Bahrani’s article [...] "Looting and Conquest" [...] takes a critical counter-position. Bahrani wrote that “William Pearlstein, of the American Council for Cultural Policy (ACCP), an organization that met with the White House and the Pentagon right before the Iraq war and right after the looting the National Museum of Iraq, is appealing for the cultural theft to continue by other means, calling Iraq's antiquities-preservation laws [...] "retentionist," [...] and saying he [...] "hoped that Iraq would grant more excavation permits and consider export permits for redundant objects." [...] She adds that such “opportunism opens the door to more cultural and historical plunder, a base scramble much like the <b>parceling</b> off <b>of</b> <b>sites</b> and antiquities that occurred in the nineteenth century.” ...|$|R

40|$|The {{visual impact}} of open-pit mineral {{workings}} along sloping terrain generates conspicuous scars extending {{to the surrounding}} landscape. Such irreversible developments permanently alter the original landform. This is more pronounced in areas of high landscape value. The aim {{of this paper is}} to put forward the case for a contextual design of a restoration scheme grounded in the geophysical and cultural elements making up the landscape character and thus complimenting it. This is demonstrated through a case study of Gozo, a picturesque sister island of Malta, known as the island of Calypso after the legendary Homeric nymph, where such quarries have significant visual impact. Based on site contours derived from historical survey sheets and making reference to vernacular cultural features within the surroundings, a restoration and rehabilitation of a disused quarry based on a geocultural approach to landscape design was developed. Prior rehabilitated to sustainable agrarian <b>parcels</b> <b>of</b> land, the <b>site</b> contours were re-introduced together with field boundaries to pre-mineral operational status. This approach is a rational solution derived from rural vernacular architecture and ensures a landscape design solution which reinstates the scenic quality and the aesthetic experience of the area. peer-reviewe...|$|R

50|$|When a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air rises, it expands, {{because the}} {{pressure}} is lower at higher altitudes. As the air parcel expands, it pushes the surrounding air outward, transferring {{energy in the form}} of work from that parcel to the atmosphere. As energy transfer to a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air by way of heat is very slow, it is assumed to not exchange energy by way of heat with the environment. Such a process is called an adiabatic process (no energy transfer by way of heat). Since the rising <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere {{to make up for the}} loss, the <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air is losing energy, which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature <b>of</b> the air <b>parcel.</b> The reverse, <b>of</b> course, will be true for a <b>parcel</b> <b>of</b> air that is sinking and is being compressed.|$|R
