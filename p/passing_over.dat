5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
5|$|January 24, 2003: A {{plume of}} Arctic air {{produces}} widespread record low temperatures and light snow flurries {{along the eastern}} coastline.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of August 25, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made {{landfall}} as a Category 1 hurricane near the Miami-Dadeâ€“Broward county line in southern Florida and weakened into a tropical storm as a result. The next morning, after <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> the state, Tropical Storm Katrina moved into the Gulf of Mexico, and reintensified back to hurricane strength. As the hurricane passed over the warm waters of the Loop Current, the hurricane began to undergo rapid deepening.|$|E
5|$|Passing beneath Lawrence {{and back}} over the East Don River, the {{expressway}} begins climbing out of the valley once more. It reaches {{the top of the}} valley and curves along a plateau before <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> York Mills Road. Residential sub-divisions are present along both sides of the road, isolated from the expressway by noise barriers, from north of Lawrence to the Highway401 interchange.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to {{its peak}} intensity, {{increasing}} westerly shear disrupted the storm's circulation and thermal pattern, which caused rapid weakening to tropical storm strength and later tropical depression status. By May22, the {{low pressure area}} became poorly defined after stalling south of Cuba; {{with only a few}} squalls and showers, advisories were discontinued on Alma. The remnants of Alma continued westward near the Cayman Islands, and later turned to the north, <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> western Cuba.|$|E

5|$|The tributaries Sugar Notch Run and Spring Run lose most {{of their}} {{discharge}} (75% {{in the case of}} Spring Run) when <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> subterranean mine pools. The discharge of the creek is 3.39 cubic feet per second. Between 1938 and 1989, the highest recorded discharge of the creek was 2450 cubic feet per second. This occurred on August 18, 1955. The discharge was not higher than 1610 cubic feet per second on any other year during that time period.|$|E
5|$|Xangsane made {{landfall}} in the Philippines, battering {{the northern}} islands with torrential rains and strong winds, and causing widespread flooding and landslides. After <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> Manila and emerging over the South China Sea, the typhoon made a second landfall in central Vietnam, also causing flooding and landslides {{there and in}} Thailand. The storm was responsible for at least 279 deaths, mostly in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at least US$747 million in damage.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} formed {{north of}} Hispaniola on August 25. It moved westward, <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> the Inagua Islands before striking {{the north coast}} of Cuba as a Category 2 hurricane on August27. The cyclone weakened to Category 1 strength as it crossed the island, close to Matanzas, but regained first Category 2 and then Category 3 strength as it moved north through the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on August31 as a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, it then quickly weakened to a tropical storm while moving northward through Georgia and South Carolina. The storm entered the Atlantic {{from the state of}} Virginia on next day and dissipated on September3.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed {{into an area}} of low pressure while <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to develop into a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. <b>Passing</b> <b>over</b> one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E

5|$|Another storm {{appeared}} {{east of the}} Philippines on May26, located {{south of}} Yap. Initially, the system moved west-northwestward, <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> Palau, where 80% of houses were destroyed; damage was estimated at Â¥400,000. The storm turned to the north-northwest, then later curved back to the west-northwest, reaching the Balintang Channel north of Luzon on June2. That day, the town of Basco, Batanes in the waterway recorded a pressure of 973mbar (28.73inHg). On June3, the storm crossed over Taiwan and recurved to the northeast. It was last noted on June6 {{just south of the}} Japanese island of Kyushu.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and arching tracks <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from their pockets.|$|E
5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move west on October 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, {{and while it}} began to curve toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua on October 10 as a Category 3 hurricane. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on October 11, later <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> the Gulf of Honduras. It later struck Belize on October 13 as a strong Category 1 hurricane on October 13, tracking north-northwestward.|$|E
