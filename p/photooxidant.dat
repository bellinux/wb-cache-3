40|$|In enteric bacteria, the {{cellular}} response to oxidative stress is activated by oxidation of the iron-sulfur clusters in SoxR, which then induces transcription of soxS, turning on {{a battery of}} defense genes. Here we demonstrate both in vitro and in cells that activation of SoxR can occur in a DNA-mediated reaction with guanine radicals, an early genomic signal of oxidative stress, serving as the oxidant. SoxR in its reduced form is found to inhibit guanine damage by repairing guanine radicals. Moreover, cells treated with a DNA-binding <b>photooxidant,</b> which generates guanine radicals, promotes the expression of soxS. In vitro, this <b>photooxidant,</b> tethered to DNA 80 bp from the soxS promoter, induces transcription by activating SoxR upon irradiation. Thus, transcription can be activated from a distance through DNA-mediated charge transport. This chemistry offers a general strategy for DNA-mediated signaling of oxidative stress...|$|E

Here we examine the mechanism of E. coli Dps protection of DNA, specifically whether this DNA-binding protein can utilize DNA charge transport through the base pair π-stack to protect the genome from a distance. An intercalating ruthenium <b>photooxidant</b> was employed to generate DNA damage localized to guanine repeats, the sites of lowest potential in DNA. We find that Dps loaded with ferrous iron, in contrast to Apo-Dps and ferric iron-loaded Dps, significantly attenuates the yield of oxidative DNA damage. These data demonstrate that ferrous iron-loaded Dps is selectively oxidized to fill guanine radical holes, thereby restoring {{the integrity of the}} DNA. Luminescence studies indicate no direct interaction between the ruthenium <b>photooxidant</b> and Dps, supporting the DNA-mediated oxidation of ferrous iron-loaded Dps. Thus DNA charge transport may be a mechanism by which Dps efficiently protects the genome of pathogenic bacteria from a distance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Photooxidants</b> play an {{important}} role for the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. The presented work deals with seasonal changes of atmospheric <b>photooxidants</b> like hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), methylhydroperoxide (MHP) and formaldehyde (HCHO). The principal purpose was to follow and quantify the mixing-ratios of these photochemical species for the first time over a complete annual cycle in Antarctica. During two field campaigns at the German Antarctic station Neumayer (overwintering campaign from January 1997 until March 1998 and a shorter campaign from January to March 1999) continuous measurements of atmospheric mixing-ratios were performed. A continuous wet-chemical technique was used for peroxides and formaldehyde sampling and analysis. Species were quantified by fluorescence detection. In order to compare the results and measurements with well-known reaction mechanisms a photochemical box model was applied. The obtained time series show a pronounced seasonal variation with higher values during summer. For the first time atmospheric concentrations of H 2 O 2, MHP and HCHO were documented during polar night in winter. The mixing-ratios were significantly higher than expected due to missing actinic radiation essential for photochemical production. Trajectory analyses and calculations with a three-dimensional model showed that during winter the mixing-ratios of <b>photooxidants</b> are mainly affected by long-range transport in the free troposphere. Investigations during the Antarctic ´´ozone hole period´´ show no significant impact of the increased UV-B radiation on the <b>photooxidants.</b> The findings of this work contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the photochemistry of the investigated trace gases in the clean troposphere of Antarctica and provide a useful data record for further photochemical modeling...|$|R

40|$|A direct {{comparison}} of DNA charge transport (CT) with different photooxidants has been made. Photooxidants tested include the two metallointercalators, Rh(phi) _ 2 (bpy‘) ^(3 +) and Ru(phen) (bpy‘) (dppz) ^(2 +), and three organic intercalators, ethidium (Et), thionine (Th), and anthraquinone (AQ). CT has been examined through a DNA duplex containing an A_ 6 -tract intervening between two 5 ‘-CGGC- 3 ‘ sites {{with each of}} the photooxidants covalently tethered to one end of the DNA duplex. CT is assayed both through determination of the yield of oxidative guanine damage and, in derivative DNA assemblies, by analysis of the yield of a faster oxidative trapping reaction, ring opening of N^ 2 -cyclopropylguanine (d^(CP) G) within the DNA duplex. We find clear differences in oxidative damage ratios at the distal versus proximal 5 ‘-CGGC- 3 ‘ sites depending upon the <b>photooxidant</b> employed. Importantly, nondenaturing gel electrophoresis data demonstrate the absence of any DNA aggregation by the DNA-bound intercalators. Hence, differences seen with assemblies containing various photooxidants cannot be attributed to differential aggregation. Comparisons in assemblies using different photooxidants thus reveal characteristics of the <b>photooxidant</b> as well as characteristics of the DNA assembly. In the series examined, the lowest distal/proximal DNA damage ratios are obtained with Ru and AQ, while, for both Rh and Et, high distal/proximal damage ratios are found. The oxidative damage yields vary in the order Ru > AQ > Rh > Et, and photooxidants that produce higher distal/proximal damage ratios have lower yields. While no oxidative DNA damage is detected using thionine as a <b>photooxidant,</b> oxidation is evident using the faster cyclopropylguanosine trap; here, a complex distance dependence is found. Differences observed among photooxidants as well as the complex distance dependence are attributed to differences in rates of back electron transfer (BET). Such differences are important to consider in developing mechanistic models for DNA CT...|$|E
40|$|Mutation {{sites that}} arise in human {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{as a result of}} oxidation by a rhodium <b>photooxidant</b> have been identified. HeLa cells were incubated with [Rh(phi) 2 bpy]Cl 3 (phi is 9, 10 -phenanthrenequinone diimine), an intercalating <b>photooxidant,</b> to allow the complex to enter the cell and bind mitochondrial DNA. Photoexcitation of DNA-bound [Rh(phi) 2 bpy] 3 + can promote the oxidation of guanine from a distance through DNA-mediated charge transport. After two rounds of photolysis and growth of cells incubated with the rhodium complex, DNA mutations in a portion of the mitochondrial genome were assessed via manual sequencing. The mutational pattern is consistent with dG to dT transversions in the repetitive guanine tracts. Significantly, the mutational pattern found overlaps oxidative damage hot spots seen previously. These mutations are found within conserved sequence block II, a critical regulatory element involved in DNA replication, and these have been identified as sites of low oxidation potential to which oxidative damage is funneled. On the basis of this mutational analysis and its correspondence to sites of long-range oxidative damage, we infer a critical role for DNA charge transport in generating these mutations and, thus, in regulating mitochondrial DNA replication under oxidative stress...|$|E

Similarly stacked solid-state materials tend to be conducting along the stacking direction.

40|$|A major {{environmental}} concern {{with respect to}} hydrocarbon emissions is the formation of phytotoxic <b>photooxidants.</b> The work reported in this thesis focusses on the poorly studied anthropogenic terpene emissions from the industrial use of softwood. The advanced analytical determinations were made by adsorption sampling followed by thermal desorption and gas chromatography in the laboratory. Monoterpenes from forestry were analyzed for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Near to a harvester, the total monoterpene concentrations reached ~ 1000 mg/m 3, whereas the background level was ~ 1 mg/m 3. Prominent monoterpenes were a-pinene, b-pinene, 3 -carene, camphene, limonene, b-phellandrene, myrcene and terpinolene. Local formation of phytotoxic <b>photooxidants</b> may occur because of the short lifetimes of terpenes in air. Terpenes in process emissions and plumes from kraft pulp industries {{were found to have}} a uniform composition similar to that of pulpwood and of recovered sulphate turpentine. Predominant monoterpenes were a-pinene and 3 -carene from Scots pine. The emitted terpenes give rise to <b>photooxidants</b> and to oxidation of co-emitted sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The monoterpenes in emissions from industries producing stone groundwood and thermomechanical pulp were similar in composition to that of the processed pulpwood from Norway spruce. The major monoterpenes were a-pinene (> 50 %) and b-pinene (~ 25 %). The process emissions from a sulphite mill consisted mainly of p-cymene, formed from spruce monoterpenes by acid rearrangements. The terpene emissions from the barking of timber and pulpwood differed somewhat in composition from that of the wood. Increased proportions of b-phellandrene and myrcene were observed for Norway spruce. Oxidative decomposition and acid rearrangements of monoterpenes in the sampling cartridges were studied as major analytical difficulties.

40|$|Charge {{transport}} (CT) {{through the}} DNA base pairs {{provides a means}} to promote redox reactions at a remote site and potentially to effect signaling between molecules bound to DNA. Here we describe the oxidation of a cell-cycle regulatory protein, p 53, from a distance through DNA-mediated CT. A consensus p 53 binding site as well as three DNA promoters regulated by p 53 were synthesized containing a tethered DNA <b>photooxidant,</b> anthraquinone. Photoinduced oxidation of the protein occurs from a distance; introduction of an intervening CA mismatch, which inhibits DNA-mediated CT, prevents oxidation of p 53. DNA-mediated oxidation is shown to promote dissociation of p 53 from only some promoters, and this sequence-selectivity in oxidative dissociation correlates with the biological regulation of p 53. Under severe oxidative stress, effected here through oxidation at long range, p 53 dissociates from a promoter that activates DNA repair {{as well as the}} promoter for the negative regulator of p 53, Mdm 2, but not from a promoter activating cell-cycle arrest. Mass spectrometry results are consistent with disulfide bond formation in p 53 upon DNA-mediated oxidation. Furthermore, DNA-bound p 53 oxidation is shown in vivo by up-regulation of p 53 and subsequent irradiation {{in the presence of a}} rhodium <b>photooxidant</b> to give a new p 53 adduct that can be reversed with thiol treatment. This DNA-mediated oxidation of p 53 parallels that seen by treating cells with hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} regional scale atmosphere-chemistry {{model has}} been developed to contribute to an improved understanding of atmospheric photochemical processes. This on-line model determines meteorological processes directly together with tracer transport and photochemistry. Usually, off-line chemistry-transport-models are applied which use archived data from a meteorological model as input information. However, a number of disadvantages result from the separation of meteorological and photochemical modelling: {{only a part of}} the whole meteorological information is available in the sampled data sets and only in distinct time intervals. The availability of the whole meteorological information including subgrid scale dynamical motions like turbulence and moist convection at every model time step is the main advantage of the on-line procedure. In addition, on-line modelling allows to consider chemical-dynamical feedbacks which is not possible in the off-line mode. For validation and evaluation studies a 10 -days simulation of a summersmog episode over Europe in July 1994 has been carried out with the first version of the on-line model. The results are compared with observations and with an off-line model simulation. The on-line model is able to reproduce measured near surface concentrations in much better agreement than the off-line model does.

40|$|The Pi-stacked {{array of}} heterocylic {{aromatic}} DNA base pairs provides an intriguing medium for facilitating {{the transport of}} migrating charges. The mechanism of hole transport through this dynamic molecule has been extensively investigated using {{a wide range of}} techniques. In particular, our group has taken advantage of the octahedral metal complexes of rhodium (III) and ruthenium (II) to probe charge transport reactions through DNA at long range. These intercalating photooxidants, which are extremely well coupled to the DNA ?-stack, can provide us with mechanistic information through a variety of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques. Here we continue to investigate the mechanism of DNA-mediated charge transport on fast time scales using a variety of hole traps and photooxidants and examine this interesting chemistry in a biological context. DNA-mediated charge transport across three different adenine tracts lengths is monitored using a probe interior to the bridge, N 6 -cyclopropyladenine, CPA. Upon oxidation, the cyclopropylamine-subsituted deoxynucleoside decomposes rapidly, and the efficiency of decomposition {{can be used as a}} kinetically fast measurement of hole occupancy. This trap, incorporated serially across the bridge, can be oxidized by a distally bound <b>photooxidant,</b> [Rh(phi) 2 (bpy’) ] 3 + (phi = 9, 10 -phenanthrenequinone diimmine) without significant attenuation in yield over a distance of 5 nm. These results are consistent with complete delocalization across the DNA bridge. Photooxidation of N 2 -cyclopropylguanine, CPG, within duplex DNA is used to probe DNA charge transport reactions initiated by the covalently bound photooxidants, [Rh(phi) 2 (bpy’) ] 3 + and anthraquinone. Duplexes containing the <b>photooxidant</b> separated from the CPG trap by an increasing number of intervening bases are examined in order to probe DNA charge transport reactions with this kinetically fast hole trap as a function of distance and sequence. Charge transport events through sequences containing various length adenine tracts as well as most mixed sequence bridges do not simply decay exponentially nor geometrically as a function of distance. In particular, for variable-length A-tracts, decomposition decreases in a periodic fashion with increasing distance between the <b>photooxidant</b> and the trap; the period is ~ 4 - 5 base pairs. Results obtained from charge injection studies using 2 -aminopurine as a fluorescent probe have shown a similar periodic distance dependence. These periodicities are not observed in measurements of oxidative DNA damage using double guanine sites as a slow, irreversible hole trap. Thus, CT through DNA must be probed on multiple time scales to provide mechanistic information. These results are consistent with our model for DNA CT through transient delocalized DNA domains defined by sequence-dependent base pair dynamics. While mechanistic investigations are critical for a fundamental understanding of how charges migrate through DNA, it is important to consider the biological consequences of this process. A biological role for DNA-mediated CT has been investigated in the context of the transcription factor, p 53, a tumor suppressor protein involved in myriad cellular pathways such as apoptosis and growth arrest. DNA assemblies containing an anthraquinone <b>photooxidant</b> tethered to the 5 ’ end of sequences containing p 53 binding sites were constructed to examine the binding affinity as a function of photooxidation. We demonstrate that through photoinduced DNA-mediated CT, the p 53 protein becomes oxidized and exhibits differential binding for various promoter sequence including Gadd 45, p 21, and Mdm 2. Additionally, insertion of a mismatch intervening between the <b>photooxidant</b> and the p 53 binding site serves to attenuate this change in binding affinity associated with photooxidation. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of p 53 tryptic digests following irradiation of the DNA bound protein provides further evidence that a chemical change occurs, consistent with oxidation of a cysteine residue in the DNA binding domain. Dipyridophenazine complexes of ruthenium (II) have been used extensively to spectroscopically investigate DNA-mediated charge transport. A novel tris heteroleptic dipyridophenazine complex of ruthenium (II), [{Ru(phen) (dppz) (bpy’-his) }{Ru(NH 3) 5 }] 5 +, containing a covalently tethered ruthenium pentaammine quencher coordinated through a bridging histadine has been synthesized and characterized spectroscopically and biochemically in a DNA environment and in organic solvent. Capable of undergoing intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, the steady-state and time-resolved luminescence measurements indicate that the tethered-quencher complex is quenched relative to the parent complexes [Ru(phen) (dppz) (bpy’] 2 + and [Ru(phen) (dppz) (bpy’-his) ] 2 + in DNA and acetonitrile. Intercalated into guanine containing DNA, [{Ru(phen) (dppz) (bpy’-his) }{Ru(NH 3) 5 }] 5 +, upon excitation and intramolecular quenching, is capable of injecting charge into the duplex as evidenced by EPR detection of guanine radicals. DNA-mediated charge transport is also evidenced using a kinetically fast cyclopropylamine-substituted base as a hole trap that undergoes irreversible oxidative ring opening on the picosecond time scale. Guanine oxidation is not observed in measurements using guanine radical as a slow, irreversible hole trap indicating that back electron transfer reactions are competitive with hole injection into the duplex. Moreover, transient absorption measurements reveal a novel photophysical reaction pathway for [{Ru(phen) (dppz) (bpy’-his) }{Ru(NH 3) 5 }] 5 + in the presence of DNA, competitive with the intermolecular flash-quench process. These results illustrate the remarkable redox chemistry occurring within a bimolecular ruthenium complex intercalated in duplex DNA...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocarbons in air were {{determined}} at pioneering European service stations equipped with vapour recovery systems. Vapour recovery was found capable of eliminating 99 % of exposure during refuelling and greater than 95 % of emissions to air. Vapour recovery {{is now being}} rapidly introduced at Swedish service stations {{as a result of}} demands concerning environmental and health hazards. The analytical technique used permitted samples corresponding to a single refuelling procedure to be analyzed. Sampling on an adsorbent tube was followed in the laboratory by thermal desorption and capillary gas chromatography. All prominent hydrocarbons were well separated on a methylsilicone phase. These include benzene and the alkenes of special interest with respect to health hazards. The particular importance of alkenes with respect to the formation of ozone and other <b>photooxidants</b> is discussed. The four isomeric butenes and the six isomeric pentenes {{were determined}} and found to constitute approximately 10 % by weight of the petrol vapour. The highly reactive 2 -alkenes were more abundant than the 1 -alkenes...|$|R
40|$|DNA-mediated charge {{transport}} (CT) is exquisitely {{sensitive to}} the integrity of the bridging π-stack and is characterized by a shallow distance dependence. These properties are obscured by poor coupling between the donor/acceptor pair and the DNA bridge, or by convolution with other processes. Previously, we found a surprising periodic length dependence for the rate of DNA-mediated CT across adenine tracts monitored by 2 -aminopurine fluorescence. Here we report a similar periodicity by monitoring N 2 -cyclopropylguanosine decomposition by rhodium and anthraquinone <b>photooxidants.</b> Furthermore, we find that this periodicity is attenuated by consequent back-electron transfer (BET), as observed by direct comparison between sequences that allow and suppress BET. Thus, the periodicity can be controlled by engineering the extent of BET across the bridge. The periodic length dependence is not consistent with a periodicity predicted by molecular wire theory but is consistent with a model where multiples of four to five base pairs form an ideal CT-active length of a bridging adenine domain...|$|R
40|$|A wet de-NOx {{technique}} {{based on}} an UV-enhanced NaClO oxidation process was investigated for simulated flue gas of a diesel engine using a bench-scale reaction chamber. The effects of UV irradiation time, initial pH value, and available chlorine concentration of NaClO solution were studied, respectively. The results showed that when the UV irradiation time was 17. 5 [*]min and the initial pH value of NaClO solution was 6, NO removal efficiency of UV/NaClO solution was increased by 19. 6 % {{compared with that of}} NaClO solution. Meanwhile, when the available chlorine concentration of NaClO solution decreased from 0. 1 [*]wt% to 0. 05 [*]wt%, the enhancement in NO removal efficiency of UV/NaClO solution increased from 19. 6 % to 24 %, compared with that of NaClO solution. The reaction pathways of NaClO solution photolysis and NO removal by UV/NaClO process were preliminarily discussed. The results suggested that HOCl might be the most active species that released many UV-induced <b>photooxidants</b> through photolysis reactions, which {{played an important role in}} NO removal process...|$|R
