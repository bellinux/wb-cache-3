50|$|An Addressograph {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving inked ribbon, a platten for hand-feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot <b>pedal</b> the <b>plate</b> assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|R

5000|$|Though {{the basic}} Catalina was well {{equipped}} with {{features such as}} full carpeting, glovebox and trunk lights, dual front ashtrays, cigar lighter, glove compartment snack bar (two cup indents on the glovebox door that could be opened for use at drive-in restaurants), heater-defroster and a choice of cloth and Morrokide vinyl upholstery or expanded Morrokide (all-vinyl trim), Pontiac buyers could add even more trimmings for a few dollars more by ordering the [...] "decor group" [...] which added full wheel covers, deluxe steering wheel, chrome <b>pedal</b> trim <b>plates</b> and more. Also offered from 1962 to 1970 on most Catalina models was the Ventura custom interior (which was a separate model from 1960 to 1961), which included the interior and exterior upgrades offered with the extra-cost decor group option plus a slightly more luxurious interior of cloth or Morrokide trims similar to the costlier Pontiac Star Chief or Executive depending on the year.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} <b>pedal,</b> the throttle <b>plate</b> rotates within the throttle body, opening the throttle passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a throttle position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the throttle plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the throttle is in the idle position, wide-open throttle (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|R

50|$|The OT-64's engine, transmission, {{suspension}} and axles were produced in Czechoslovakia. The engine {{was produced by}} Tatra. The gearbox was manufactured by Praga Hostivař. It has a pre-select Praga-Wilson gearbox, (5 forward +1 reverse gears.) A gear is selected using the gear stick then when the gear is required the left pedal (gear change action/clutch combined) is pressed to the floor, giving a hiss of air sound, on release of the <b>pedal</b> the dry <b>plate</b> clutch engages after about half the return spring controlled movement. The drive then passes to an auxiliary gearbox with low, neutral and high ratios which needs to be selected before moving off, for road/neutral/off road use, this gives option to the driver of 10 forward and 2 reverse ratios. The gear change pedal is hydraulic and on action opens an air valve which causes the selected gear to engage. The armored hull and weapons were produced in Poland.|$|R

40|$|A great {{majority}} of the micromechanical resonators in the literature are based on linear response under external resonance conditions of micro-structures vibrating in some flexural or torsional modes. In this dissertation, a novel nonlinear microresonator concept is proposed which utilizes “internal resonance” phenomena and non-linear interactions between structural modes for its essential operation. The focus in this work is on systems with 1 : 2 internal resonance between two structural natural frequencies and modal interactions in the presence of quadratic nonlinearities. Two such electrostatically actuated microresonator designs are considered: a T-shaped resonator with three beam elements in T configuration, and a <b>pedal</b> resonator with <b>plate</b> type <b>pedal</b> structure supported by two beams. The T-resonator is designed to have in-plane motions with two flexural modal natural frequencies in 1 : 2 ratio, while the pedal microresonator has an out-of-plane torsional mode which has a natural frequency smaller than the natural frequency of an in-plane flexural mode. The two natural frequencies are again in a 1 : 2 ratio. In both the designs, the higher frequency mode autoparametrically excites the lower frequency mode through inertial quadratic nonlinearities. ^ Analytical models are developed for the resonators using Lagrangian formulations. The T-resonator model includes: inertial quadratic nonlinearities, cubic nonlinearities due to mid-plane stretching and curvature of the beam, electrostatic potential, and effects of thermal pre-stress. The pedal resonator model in addition to flexural deflections includes torsional rotations of the beam which contribute to kinetic and elastic energy. Linear equations of motion are used to define resonator designs so as to achieve 1 : 2 internal resonance between the desired modes. A nonlinear two-mode reduced-order model for each design is derived using linear structural modes with desired internal resonance. These nonlinear models are used to describe the static pull-in voltages that cannot be exceeded in the resonator’s operations. Asymptotic methods are then used to study the responses for the resonators and nonlinear frequency responses are developed in each case for the resonant actuation of higher frequency mode. It is shown that the lower frequency mode is excited for actuation levels only above a certain threshold, and generates a response component at half the frequency of resonant actuation. The effects of damping, thermal pre-stress, and mass and geometric perturbations from nominal design are thoroughly discussed. The nonlinear resonators show a high sensitivity to mass perturbations and, thus, hold great potential as RF filter-mixers and mass sensors. The application of the pedal resonator as a mass sensor is explored in some detail. ^ Experiments are performed on a macro sized T-structure with the flexural modes tuned to 1 : 2 resonance. Response of this T-structure is measured using Laser displacement sensors and piezoelectric patches are used for actuation. Experimental results show a large response component at half the excitation frequency when the higher frequency flexural mode is resonantly excited. The tuned T-structure response is also observed to be very sensitive to any mass perturbations. The macro T-structure behavior verifies the basic concept of T-shaped microresonator design based on 1 : 2 internal resonances. ...|$|R
