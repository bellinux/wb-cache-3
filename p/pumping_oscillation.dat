40|$|An {{opto-electronic}} {{radio-frequency oscillator}} {{that is based}} on forward scattering by the guided acoustic modes of a standard single-mode optical fiber is proposed and demonstrated. An optical pump wave is used to stimulate narrowband, resonant guided acoustic modes, which introduce phase modulation to a co-propagating optical probe wave. The phase modulation is converted to an intensity signal at the output of a Sagnac interferometer loop. The intensity waveform is detected, amplified, and driven back to modulate the optical <b>pump.</b> <b>Oscillations</b> are achieved at a frequency of 319 MHz, which matches the resonance of the acoustic mode that provides the largest phase modulation of the probe wave. Oscillations at the frequencies of competing acoustic modes are suppressed by at least 40 dB.

This finding can be interpreted to indicate that increasingly large pump fields enable the domain walls to cross larger and larger pinning barriers. The subsequent recovery process, which leads back to the equilibrium domain size distribution, proceeds {{in the absence of an}} external electrical field. This rationalizes that recovery is slowed down significantly by application of large pump field amplitudes since then the pinning barriers that have to be traversed back are larger...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the suitability of neodymium doped monomode optical fibre as a gain medium for miniature laser systems. Characterisation of the material and parameters required for quantitative analysis of such laser systems are presented in a spectroscopic analysis carried out {{in the first part of}} the thesis. Measurements performed in this section also indicate that at room temperature the wide fluorescence bands of the neodymium doped silica fibre are spectrally broadened by a homogeneous process. The behaviour of a longitudinally pumped continuous-wave fibre laser is modelled in the next section followed by the design and realisation of a practical system. Efficiencies of approximately 6 % and threshold pump powers of 8 - 12 mW have been obtained, even under narrow linewidth operation. Tunability over ranges of 45 - 60 nm has also been demonstrated. The thesis is concluded by experiments on pulsed fibre lasers. Q-switching the laser has achieved peak powers of several watts in pulses 180 ns wide with good agreement between the results obtained and predicted values. Shorter pulses 450 ps wide have been realised by mode-locking a fibre laser. Suggestions for reducing the pulse width further and the effects of material dispersion are also given.

40|$|Cooling {{of atoms}} and ions using a red-detuned laser {{has had a}} {{profound}} impact on science and technology. In this work simultaneous laser cooling and blue-detuned laser pumping of a Mg+ ion in a Paul trap is studied. Blue-detuned pumping is conventionally referred to as the heating regime, and in early work, remarkably complex behaviors (bistability and limit cycles) have been associated with this regime. These behaviors have so far not been fully explained. Here, it is shown that blue-detuned pumping, as opposed to heating, causes stimulated emission of center-of-mass phonons, leading to coherent oscillatory motion of the ion in analogy with a laser. Mechanical amplification is calculated as well as the threshold <b>pumping</b> condition for <b>oscillation.</b> A single ion in a linear radio-frequency trap is studied to verify these predictions. Blue-detuned pumping of the magnesium D 2 transition at 279. 6 nm provides amplification along the long axis of the ion trap so as to excite only axial oscillations.

40|$|The {{nucleus of}} the solitary tract (NST) {{processes}} substantial visceral afferent input and sends divergent projections to {{a wide array of}} CNS targets. The NST is essential to the maintenance of behavioural and autonomic homeostasis and is the source, as well as the recipient, of considerable noradrenergic (NE) projections. The significance of NE projections from the NST to other CNS regions has long been appreciated, but the nature of NE action on NST neurones themselves, especially on the α- 1 receptor subtype, is controversial. We used a combination of methodologies to establish, systematically, the effects and cellular basis of action of the α- 1 agonist, phenylephrine (PHE), to control NST neurones responsible for vago-vagal reflex regulation of the stomach. Immunocytochemical and retrograde tracing studies verified that the area postrema, A 2, A 5, ventrolateral medulla and locus coeruleus regions are sources of catecholaminergic input to the NST. In vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that PHE activates physiologically identified, second-order gastric sensory NST neurones. In vivo microinjection of PHE onto NST neurones caused a significant reduction in gastric tone. Finally, in vitro calcium imaging studies revealed that PHE caused dramatic cytosolic calcium oscillations in NST neurones. These oscillations are probably the result of an interplay between agonist-induced and inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) -mediated intracellular calcium release and Ca 2 +-ATPase control of intracellular calcium storage <b>pumps.</b> The <b>oscillations</b> persisted even in perfusions of zero calcium–EGTA Krebs solution suggesting that the calcium oscillation is mediated principally by intracellular calcium release–reuptake mechanisms. Cyclical activation of the NST may function to increase the responsiveness of these neurones to incoming afferent input (i. e., elevate the ‘gain’). An increase in gain of afferent input may cause an amplification of the response part of the reflex and help explain the powerful effects that α- 1 agonists have in suppressing gastric motility and producing anorexia...|$|R

Quantum phenomena {{prove to be}} attractive for physical RNGs due to their fundamental randomness and immunity to attack [1]- [5]. Optical parametric down conversion is an essential element in most quantum optical experiments including optical squeezing [9], and generation of entangled photons [10]. In an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), photons generated through spontaneous down conversion of the <b>pump</b> initiate the <b>oscillation</b> {{in the absence of}} other inputs [11, 12].

A series of diagnostic experiments are conducted {{to isolate the}} model’s response to the individual TC-associated forcings by comparing their model results. During the TCs, the BoB ocean heat content (OHC) is reduced, primarily due to TC-wind induced southward ocean heat transport (OHT) {{and a reduction in}} surface downward radiation due to increased cloudiness. BoB OHC is largely restored in the following months via enhanced surface heat fluxes, associated with cold wake restoration, and positive northward OHT. The TCs’ downward heat pumping effect is estimated to be ~ 1. 74 × 1018 J near the end of February 2000, which is less than estimates using previously published methods based on surface observations. The relatively weak heat pumping results from freshwater input by intense monsoon rainfall and river discharge in the BoB, which stabilizes stratification, forms a barrier layer, and generates temperature inversions during seasonal surface cooling. As a result, early stage TC winds entrain the warm barrier layer water and enhance enthalpy loss in the southeastern Bay, while mature stage TC winds erode the barrier layer, decrease SST through upwelling and entrainment of deeper cold water and reduce enthalpy loss in the northwestern Bay. Our findings suggest TC winds may significantly alter the interseasonal BoB heat budget through OHT and surface heat fluxes. Background southwesterly and TC winds produce positive sea surface height anomalies (SSHAs) along the northern and eastern BoB boundary via Ekman transport and direct seawater pile-up, and produce negative SSHAs along the TC tracks with rightward bias via Ekman divergence and surface cooling. The wind-induced turbulent mixing and upwelling are the primary causes for surface cooling, and the latter does not induce downward heat <b>pumping.</b> The <b>oscillations</b> of top layer currents and temperatures on the right of the TC tracks have period near inertial oscillation (~ 1. 5 days), and the near-inertial currents have strong influence on horizontal temperature advection...|$|R

40|$|Single-shot {{femtosecond}} spectroscopy {{has been}} developed and employed {{for the study of}} phase transitions of solid-state materials. Using two crossed echelons, a two dimensional spatial delay gradient was generated across a single probe pulse profile. This novel scheme enables us to monitor irreversible change in solids by acquiring many time-resolved data points with a single laser pulse. With the integration with a non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) and a conventional pump-probe instrument, ultrafast dynamics of coherent lattice vibrations and photo-induced phase transitions were examined in two different systems. Ultrafast dynamics such as coherent lattice vibrations and bond softening were investigated for Bi thin films and bulk single crystals. Depending on the thickness, transient reflectivity was changed significantly. The variations are ascribed to different electronic structures possibly originating from quantum confinement. Bond softening exhibits a strong thickness dependence due to hot carrier dynamics {{as well as to the}} different electronic structures. At high pump fluences, no phonon oscillations were observed suggesting a phase transition to liquid or to a higher symmetry crystalline phase (reverse Peierls distortion). Together with thermal modeling, double pump measurements reveal nonthermal melting occurring in bulk and thin Bi films. A higher threshold fluence for nonthermal melting is observed in bulk bismuth as compared to thin films, suggesting ultrafast carrier dynamics such as ballistic transport. In addition to nonthermal effects, thermal effects such as inelastic electron-phonon scattering and nonradiative recombination play a crucial role in melting and cooling at later times after nonthermal melting takes place. A quasi one-dimensional platinum iodide complex showed strong oscillations in reflectivity which are attributed to oscillatory motions of wave packets on a selftrapped exciton (STE) potential surface., As optical excitation increased, electron transfer from Pt 2 + to an adjacent Pt 4 + occurred over a wider range of lattice sites and weakened the oscillations. Above a certain <b>pump</b> fluence, <b>oscillations</b> disappeared completely indicating that the mixed valence, charge density wave state changed to monovalent, Mott-Hubbard phase.
