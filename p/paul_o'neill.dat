5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many {{of his family and}} friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder <b>Paul</b> <b>O'Neill</b> pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E
5|$|The Reds won Game 3 after scoring seven {{runs in the}} top of {{the third}} inning off of Mike Moore. Pitcher Tom Browning earned the win for Cincinnati, as the game ended at a score of 8–3. The Athletics took a lead in Game 4, as Carney Lansford hit a single that scored Willie McGee from second base. In the eighth inning, however, the Reds loaded the bases after singles by Barry Larkin and Herm Winningham, and an error that allowed <b>Paul</b> <b>O'Neill</b> to reach base. Larkin scored on a groundout and Winningham scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly to give Cincinnati the lead, 2–1. The lead held, as Myers came in for Rijo after one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Reds became World Series champions. Bates did not play in either game. As with all players on the World Series champion Reds, Bates received a World Series ring and visited the White House.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and <b>Paul</b> <b>O'Neill,</b> US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

25|$|Economists, {{including}} the Treasury Secretary {{at the time}} <b>Paul</b> <b>O'Neill</b> and 450 economists, including ten Nobel prize laureates, who contacted Bush in 2003, opposed the 2003 tax cuts {{on the grounds that}} they would fail as a growth stimulus, increase inequality and worsen the budget outlook considerably (see Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts).

Jorge Posada hit a leadoff double off Kim, and after retiring Spencer and Chuck Knoblauch on a groundout and strikeout, Brosius then hit a two-run home run to tie the score. Later, Soriano hit a single in the bottom of the 12th to win the game.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary <b>Paul</b> <b>O'Neill</b> and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon {{need to be addressed}} from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004, {{but it was not until}} about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.|$|E
25|$|Municipal Stadium {{was built}} in 1930 {{originally}} as a dog track which explains its unique, if not odd, layout. It holds 6,000 people. It is somewhat unusual in that it only has permanent stands along the first-base line, while bleachers lie along the third-base side. It was home to minor league baseball {{for the majority of}} its existence, beginning in 1947 with the Colonial League and from 1966 to 1986 with the AA Eastern League as an affiliate of the Dodgers, Reds, Giants, Indians, Pirates, A's, and Angels. In 1997 the stadium became home to the Waterbury Spirit which spent four seasons in the Independent League. Several future major leaguers played at the stadium, including Bobby Bonds, <b>Paul</b> <b>O'Neill,</b> Wally Joyner, Cory Snyder, and Danny Tartabull. It is now used for sporting events, primarily football and baseball, for most of the city's high schools and Little Leagues. The stadium has also been home to a few historic events. Women's softball pitcher Joan Joyce struck out Ted Williams, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky in order in the stadium, and in 1947 several members of the New York Yankees including Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Phil Rizzuto, and Spec Shea, played an exhibition game against the Waterbury Timers in the stadium.|$|E

50|$|With the {{momentum}} on their side, the Indians looked {{to finish off}} the defending champs. Andy Pettitte and Jaret Wright once again faced off. The Indians would take a 3-0 lead in the third thanks to back-to-back two-out hits by Manny Ramírez and Matt Williams. Then a sac fly by Tony Fernández in the fourth made it 4-0. However, the Yankees gave the Indians cause to pause in the fifth when an error by Ramírez cut the lead in half. Then Wade Boggs's pinch hit RBI single made it a one-run game in the sixth. The score remained 4-3 and the Yankees blew multiple chances to take the lead. The Indians also had their share of chances to put the series away. The frustration mounted in the ninth when <b>Paul</b> <b>O'Neill's</b> two-out double gave Bernie Williams a chance to hit the go-ahead homer off José Mesa, but Mesa got Williams to fly out (a fairly deep fly ball) to Brian Giles to end the series and ensure a new World Champion in 1997.|$|R
