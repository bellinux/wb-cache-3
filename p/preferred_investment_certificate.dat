40|$|It {{has been}} shown that investors can benefit from {{including}} derivatives into their portfolios. For retail investors, however, a direct investment in derivatives is often too complicated. <b>Investment</b> <b>certificates</b> offer a potential solution to this problem and may help the investor to come closer to a complete market. We analyze if retail investors who buy and hold their portfolio for one year can indeed benefit from an <b>investment</b> in these <b>certificates.</b> We use a model with stochastic volatility and jumps calibrated to the German stock market index DAX. We find that the benefit of investing in typical retail products is equivalent to an annualized risk-free excess return of at most 35 basis points for a CRRA investor with a low risk aversion. If we take transaction costs into account, this number reduces to at most 14 bp. In terms of the types of contracts, we find that discount certificates perform best, while more sophisticated certificates, in particular those with knock-in or knock-out features, should often not be held by investors at all. Therefore, standard preferences cannot explain the large observed demand for <b>investment</b> <b>certificates...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{mail survey}} of NIPF owners in two {{counties}} in northern Sweden {{was conducted to}} investigate the risk preferences, perceptions of the return and risk of timber investment relative to investment alternatives outside forestry. Our aim was to determine {{to what extent the}} NIPF owners’ harvesting behaviour was consistent with their preferences and subjective judgments. A majority of the respondents were risk-neutral or risk-prone. We found that risk preferences have significant impacts on the decision to fell; the more a forest owner likes to take risks, {{the more likely it is}} that he/she conducts final felling. The result also shows large variations among NIPF owners with respect to the subjective judgements of the return and risk of the alternative investments. For each respondent we elicited the most <b>preferred</b> <b>investment</b> alternative based on the stated risk preferences and the subjective judgements of the return and risk of the alternative <b>investments.</b> Owners whose <b>preferred</b> <b>investment</b> alternative is the mature forest are on average significantly less active in harvesting than owners with other <b>preferred</b> <b>investment</b> alternatives. The study reveals indications of the difficulties for NIPF owners to make rational decisions when faced with uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} {{were introduced}} in 1981 when the European Option Exchange in Amster- dam was introduced. Despite some opinions that say that financial derivatives cause deformations in prices at financial markets, volume of sales of financial derivatives are annually rising. Financial derivatives brought with themselves large opportunities for position creating. They can be used not only for trading, but for hedging and arbitrage as well. Nowadays, financial derivatives, namely options, are used to provide new banking products of treasury management. Yields of treasury in- struments are in certain way derived from the yields gained from other regular financial instruments on financial market. Banks use option strategies to create financial positions that are divided into smaller parts and, consecutively, sold to clients of banks as new products. Especially, option strategies are used to emit <b>investments</b> <b>certificates.</b> Situation on financial markets forces banks to create new products that bring higher potential profits at lower level of risk. The <b>investments</b> <b>certificates</b> are one of favourite instruments used. The paper deals with option strategy and its usage in creating the treasury products in banks. We focus on Inverse Vertical Ratio Call Back Spread strategy as the one, {{which can be used}} for specific <b>investment</b> <b>certificates</b> creation. The aim of the paper is to find the way of creation of Spe- ed certificates, so called Sprint certificates, Double Chance certificates or Double-up certificates. We analyze this type of certificates, derive the profit function in analytical form and we propose the way of its creation through Inverse Vertical Ratio Call Back Spread option strategy...|$|R
