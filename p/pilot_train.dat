5000|$|Red-green color {{blindness}} is {{the most}} common form, followed by blue-yellow color blindness and total color blindness. Red-green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females of Northern European descent. The ability to see color also decreases in old age. Being color blind may make people ineligible for certain jobs in certain countries. This may include <b>pilot,</b> <b>train</b> driver, and armed forces. The effect of color blindness on artistic ability, however, is controversial. The ability to draw appears to be unchanged and a number of famous artists are believed to have been color blind.|$|E

Since September 2011 SBB Cargo offers a rail shuttle between the Basel container terminal and Chavornay for transporting overseas containers. By expanding intermodal transport in Switzerland, SBB Cargo is adding to its existing business in wagonload and transit freight. The concept envisages scheduled trains connecting the main centres in Switzerland. Shuttle trains {{will go back}} and forth according to a fixed timetable. The first <b>pilot</b> <b>train</b> has been operating on a fixed timetable twice a day between Dietikon near Zurich and Renens near Lausanne since the beginning of 2012. Since September 2012, SBB Cargo has also been running a scheduled train with refrigerated containers for Migros between Neuendorf (Canton Solothurn) and Gossau (Canton St. Gallen). In June 2013 the north-south shuttle between Dietikon and Cadenazzo started running on workdays, connecting the economic centre of Zurich with the Ticino region, with an extension to Lugano Vedeggio.|$|E
40|$|The West River Treatment Plant (WRTP) is a 10. 2 million gallon per day inline direct {{filtration}} plant. Pilot scale {{studies have}} been performed at the WRTP since 1989 to evaluate treatment alternatives to meet changing regulations and to explore a possible plant expansion. Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) was evaluated during 1992 in a <b>pilot</b> <b>train</b> consisting of ozonation (either pre- or intermediate-), two stage flocculation, flotation, and filtration. The DAF train was studied {{as a method of}} plant expansion whereby solids removal by DAF would allow for increased hydraulic loading rates to the filters. The effects of several DAF train process parameters on flotation and filtration performance were evaluated. DAF performance was compared in parallel to a direct filtration train consisting of pre-ozonation, rapid mix and filtration. Dissolved air flotation followed by filtration provided effective overall treatment with respect to finished water quality and filter performance. Finished water quality for the DAF train was similar to the parallel direct filtration train as measured by turbidity, ultraviolet absorbance at 254 mn, dissolved organic carbon, and particle counts. Solids removal by DAF resulted in filter run times three times longer than for the direct filtration train at the same filter hydraulic loading rate. DAF provided effective treatment with reasonable headloss development at increased filter hydraulic loading rates. Results are presented from studies evaluating variations in several DAF train process parameters. DAF provided effective treatment using both ferric chloride with a cationic polymer and ferric chloride alone as primary coagulants. DAF performed well at recycle ratios of 9. 5 and 8. 0 percent but clogging of the needle valves at 6. 0 and 5. 0 percent recycle resulted in less effective particulate removal. Intermittent operation of a full length mechanical scraper for sludge removal was effective at frequencies of one time per hour to one time per eight hours. Flocculation times of both 16 and 8 minutes resulted in effective flotation performance. Pre-ozonation resulted in effective treatment throughout 1992. However, intermediate ozonation (after flotation) on the DAF train produced mixed results with oxidation and subsequent precipitation of manganese producing high filtered water turbidity...|$|E
