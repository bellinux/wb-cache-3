Bacteriol. 83 : 1 – 5. 1962. —Studies were made of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> production by Bacillus polymyxa during growth. It was found that elaboration of enzyme occurred during logarithmic growth and ceased when the stationary phase was reached. The specific activity of the extra-cellular enzyme remained relatively constant until lysis occurred. The increased specific activity of the intracellular <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> may be explained if one assumes {{that the rate of}} secretion of the intracellular enzyme is dependent upon the concentration of the extracellular enzyme. The concentration of the intracellular <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> dropped markedly {{at the end of the}} logarithmic growth phase; the enzyme was released into the medium during the stationary growth phase and subsequent lysis of the cells. It was shown that the intra- and extracellular enzymes were similar or identical in that both were calcium-dependent pectic acid transeliminases...|$|E

Activity of different fractions of pectolytic enzymes like PG, PME and PL was investigated during pathogenesis and correspondingly the associated resistance of the host was assayed. It was noticed that the biocontrol agent, Trichoderma significantly interacts with the <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{activity of}} the pathogen. It caused an appreciable reduction in enzymatic action. The reduction in the activity of polygalacturonase enzyme (PG) was recorded to be the highest among all the fractions of pectolytic enzymes. Such a trend appeared to be more pronounced in 'Kujja' than in 'Ghula' cultivar of jackfruit. The reduction in <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity {{was found to be}} coupled with {{a significant increase in the}} activity of polyphenol oxidase enzyme of the host tissues and a concomitant increase in host phenol content.

From unprocessed RSM, 24 % of the nonglucose polysaccharides could be fermented. Acid treatment {{did not have a}} significant effect, but enzyme addition did improve fermentability to 38 %. Most likely, the significant increase in NSP fermentability can be ascribed to the addition of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes,</b> which decreased branchiness of the water-soluble arabinan. Mainly xyloglucan, (glucurono-) xylan, (branched) arabinan, and cellulose remained in the excreta. The proportion of unextractable carbohydrates increased in excreta from broilers fed acid-extruded RSM. Probably, acid extrusion resulted in a less accessible NSP matrix, also decreasing the accessibility for <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> added in the diet. During alkaline extraction of the excreta, 39 to 52 % (wt/wt) of the insoluble carbohydrates was released as glucosyl- and uronyl-rich carbohydrates, probably originally present via ester linkages or hydrogen bonding within the cellulose-lignin network. These linkages are expected to hinder complete NSP fermentation and indicate that digestibility of RSM may benefit substantially from an alkaline treatment or addition of esterases...|$|R
40|$|Rapeseed meal (RSM) {{contains}} {{a high level}} of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) that are not well degraded in poultry and interfere with digestion of other nutrients as protein, starch, and fat. By altering physicochemical properties of NSP from RSM, processing and enzyme technologies might improve digestive utilization of RSM, enhancing its potential as a source of nutrients in poultry diets. The effects of wet milling and extrusion in combination with <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> on the degradability of RSM in broilers were investigated in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement. Wet milling and extrusion did not affect total tract apparent digestibility of DM, CP, crude fat, and nonglucose polysaccharides (NGP). Addition of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> did not affect total tract apparent digestibility of CP and crude fat, but improved degradability of NGP by 9 to 20 % units (P < 0. 001), independent of prior technological processing of RSM. This coincided with an increased NGP concentration in the ceca (4 to 7 g/g of cobalt, P < 0. 001), indicating that more NGP were solubilized such that they could enter the ceca and become available for fermentation. Particle size reduction facilitated solubilization of polysaccharides from RSM, increasing the concentration of NGP found in the ceca (4 g/g of cobalt, P = 0. 008). Without help of additional <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes,</b> those solubilized structures could, however, still not be degraded by the cecal microbiota. Feed intake, BW gain, and feed conversion ratio were not affected. No interaction between processing technologies and enzyme addition was found.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Sufri variety of date is widely cultivated in Saudi Arabia, where it 'produced large quantities of dates. The high quality dates are consumed fresh, dried or preserved, the surplus and second quality dates may be damaged by improper harvesting, handling, transporting and processing. The Sufri variety of date is one of moderate quality {{and there is a}} surplus in local markets for processing into overflows to be used as "a base" for the food industry. The present work was conducted to increase soluble solids, including sugars, in the overflows and to maintain the quality of the underflows; chemical analysis of both the overflows and the underflows revealed that Sufri date contains proteins/ amino acids and pectin in small quantities, which can be utilised as byproducts. Physical treatment involved maceration with different ratios (date/water) at mild temperatures (30 - 60 °C) for different times (10 - 30 min). Over this range the increase in soluble solids in the overflow was at a minimum but the underflow retained its quality and softening of date tissues was achieved. Different extraction ratios indicated that a lower ratio produced a low overflow which was turbid, but that the higher ratios produced overflows which were dilute. Serial extractions with the same ratio in the initial extraction was not practical. In enzymic treatment, <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> were incubated with date underflows at different concentrations, temperatures for various incubation times. Overflows increased significantly over a short time and at low temperatures (30 min and 30 °C) indicating the effectiveness of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> in releasing more of the overflows, and sugars were increased in the overflows as an indication of the effect of these enzymes on date cell walls. Pure <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> were investigated and it was found that specificity was very important for selection of suitable <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> It is concluded that the Sufri variety of date is a good source of reducing sugars, and its by-products have a promising future...|$|R

The objectives of this research were to study the effect of fermentation process based on optimum condition in terms of temperature and pH of pulp pectin depolymerization using endogenous <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> polygalakturonase (PG) and pectin metyl esterase (PME) and fermentation period in cocoa processing on quality characteristics of cocoa beans produced and to study the role of those fermentation process in reducing fermentation time to produce cocoa beans with standard quality. This research used split plot design, with treatments of process condition of cocoa fermentation as main plot and fermentation period as split plot. Treatment of process condition of cocoa fermentation consisted of optimum condition for pulp pectin depolymerization by PGs (temperature 47. 5 OC; initial pulp pH 4. 6); optimum condition of depolymerization on sequence depolymerization by PGs (temperature 48. 5 OC; initial pulp pH 8. 0 during 1 day; last temperature 47. 5 OC; initial pulp pH 4. 6 during 6 days), and natural fermentation process a control. While treatment of fermentation period consisted of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 days. Evaluation of fermentation period was carried out based on pursuant to criteria of unfermented beans content and fermentation index.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 This {{investigation}} was undertaken to determine 1) {{the effects of}} various carbon sources in defined media on <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> production, 2) {{the effect of the}} incubation period on <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity, and 3) the development of improved methods for the purification and characterization of the polygalacturonases (PG) produced by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Optimum PG and pectinesterase (PE) production on pectin medium occurred in nine days while 11 days were required for optimum pectin methyl trans-eliminase (PMTE) synthesis. PMTE was the predominant enzyme synthesized on polygalacturonic acid (PGA) with trace amounts of PG and PE. Optimum PMTE synthesis occurred in five days, while PG and PE activity decreased after three days of incubation. Only trace amounts of PG and PMTE were detected in cultures in which glucose was the sole carbon source, and PE production was greater on glucose than on PGA. Polygalacturonate trans-eliminase was not detected in any of the cultures. The action of these enzymes was determined on purified pectic substrates, using improved viscosity reduction and reducing group assays, as well as thin layer chromatography (TLC) procedures for the detection of hydrolysis products. Only endo-PG and endo-PMTE activity was present in the pectin, PGA, and glucose culture filtrates. The results obtained from the TLC of the PG-reaction-mixtures indicated a preferential release of mono-galacturonic acid from PGA, which suggest exo-PG activity.

2500|$|Before fermentation, pectin-splitting enzymes and, {{for white}} wine, fining agents such as {{bentonite}} may {{be added to}} the must in order to promote the eventual agglomeration and settling of colloids. Pectins are structural molecules in the cell walls of fruits which have the important function of 'gumming' plant cells together. The pectin content of grapes increases steadily throughout ripening, reaching levels of about 1 g/l, although it varies by varietal and pre-fermentation handling processes. Large pectin molecules can affect the amount of juice yielded at pressing, ease of filtration and clarification, and extraction of tannins. Grapes contain natural <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> responsible for softening the grape berries during ripening, but these are not active under wine-making conditions (due to pH level, SO2, and alcohol.)

The aim was to understand and improve the fermentation of NSP from RSM in poultry and pigs, by processing and enzyme addition. First, the NSP-structures in RSM were characterized as being branched arabinan, arabinogalactan type II, homogalacturonan, glucurono-xylan, XXGG- and XXXG-type xyloglucan, and cellulose. Second, RSM was processed using shear, heat, and acid prior to in vitro incubation, in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Acid-treatment combined with <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> was the best option to improve NSP-solubilization in vitro. Unprocessed and acid-extruded RSM with or without addition of enzymes were fed to broilers. In broilers, 22 % of the NSP in unprocessed RSM could be fermented, which only significantly improved to 38 % by addition of commercial <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> In broilers’ excreta, XXXG-type xyloglucan, (glucurono-) xylan, arabinan, and cellulose remained unfermented. Unprocessed and acid-extruded RSM was also fed to growing pigs and NSP-fermentation was followed along the digestive tract. In pigs, at the terminal ileum 22 % of the NSP was cumulatively fermented and total tract around 70 % was fermented.

40|$|The cell wall-degrading enzymes {{polygalacturonase}} and {{pectate lyase}} {{have been suggested}} to be crucial for penetration and colonization of plant tissues by some fungal pathogens.

Induction of polygacturonase and pectate lyase in A. nidulans requires substrate and is completely repressed by glucose. Surprisingly, inoculation of excised plant tissues with A. nidulans conidia leads to formation of necrotic, water-soaked lesions within which the organism sporulates. Thus, A. nidulans has phytopathogenic potential. The release of glucose and other sugars from wounded tissues may repress <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzyme</b> production and limit disease development. Therefore, we tested creA 204, a mutation that relieves glucose repression of some A. nidulans carbon utilization enzymes, for its effect on production of pectolytic enzymes. creA 204 failed to relieve catabolite repression of polygalacturonase or pectate lyase and {{had no effect on}} disease severity...|$|E
5000|$|Pectinases, {{also called}} <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes,</b> are {{a class of}} exoenzymes that are {{involved}} in the breakdown of pectic substances, most notably pectin. Pectinases can be classified into two different groups based on their action against the galacturonan backbone of pectin: de-esterifying and depolymerizing. [...] These exoenzymes can be found in both plants and microbial organisms including fungi and bacteria. [...] Pectinases are most often used to break down the pectic elements found in plants and plant-derived products.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this work}} was the {{construction}} of an oenological Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain able to overexpress the PGU 1 gene in order to be used in trial fermentations. Methods and Results: The recombinant strain is able to secrete an active endopolygalacturonase into the medium leaving its fermentation ability essentially unchanged. Wines obtained with the recombinant strain and the untransformed counterpart did not differ in their physicochemical parameters or major sensory characteristics. The time needed for wine filtration was dramatically reduced in wines elaborated with the PGU 1 recombinant strain, and was comparable to the filtration time shown by wines elaborated from must supplemented with fungal <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Conclusions: The oenological strain constructed in this work secretes an endopolygalacturonase into the wine in an efficient manner, resulting in an improvement in wine filtration but preserving wine typicality and keeping the methanol levels unchanged. Significance and Impact of the Study: The PGU 1 recombinant strains could be used in oenological fermentations as an alternative to commercial <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> of fungal origin.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Fusarium sambucinum to {{colonise}} potato tubers when artificially inoculated or in liquid culture, and which <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> were produced {{and in what}} amounts during such colonisation were studied. Pectin lyase (PNL) activity, represented {{by a set of}} isoenzymes focalising from isoeletric point (Ip) 6. 4 to Ip 9. 9, was detected in the culture filtrates. The PNL time course in infected tissues was characterised by an increase in enzyme production and a differential induction of the isoenzymes. Polygalacturonase (PG) activity, represented by a single alkaline band, was detected only in the culture filtrates. Two constitutive basic pectin methylesterase (PME) isoenzymes (Ip> 10. 0) were also found in both the culture filtrates and the inoculated potato tissues. In rotted tissues and culture filtrates, an increase in pH to values to over 7. 0 was recorded, which are values optimal for PNL activity. In the potato_F. sambucinum interaction, PNL activity was the principal pectolytic component and appeared to act synergistically with the increase in ambient pH during pathogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the involvement of <b>pectolytic</b> <b>enzymes</b> during infection with F. sambucinum...|$|R
