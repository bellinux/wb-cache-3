5|$|The lower {{text of the}} <b>palimpsest</b> was deciphered by biblical {{scholar and}} palaeographer Tischendorf in 1840–1843, and was edited by him in 1843–1845. Currently it is housed in the Bibliothèque {{nationale}} de France (Grec 9) in Paris.|$|E
5|$|It is a <b>palimpsest,</b> {{the whole}} book {{is known as}} Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis. The upper text is in Latin, it {{contains}} Isidore of Seville's Origines and his six letters. The lower text of the codex belongs to several much earlier manuscripts, such as Codex Guelferbytanus A, Codex Guelferbytanus B, and Codex Carolinus.|$|E
5|$|It {{is one of}} {{very few}} {{manuscript}}s of Wulfilas Gothic Bible. The manuscript is fragmentary. The four leaves of the codex were used as raw material {{for the production of}} another manuscript – Codex Guelferbytanus 64 Weissenburgensis. It is a <b>palimpsest,</b> and its text was reconstructed several times. Franz Anton Knittel was the first to examine it and decipher its text.|$|E
40|$|We usually {{think of}} <b>palimpsests</b> as old texts written on {{parchment}} over earlier erasures, but digital technology {{has caused the}} present {{to be the most}} palimpsestic of times. A survey of modern-day <b>palimpsests</b> leads to an examination of why and how people created <b>palimpsests</b> in the past. Unlike the old analog documents, our electronic <b>palimpsested</b> texts face the likelihood of relatively rapid to split-second disintegration.

5|$|Codex Zacynthius (designated by siglum Ξ or 040 in the Gregory-Aland numbering; A1 in von Soden) is a Greek New Testament codex, dated paleographically to the 6th century. First {{thought to}} have been written in the 8th century, it is a palimpsest—the {{original}} (lower) text was washed off its vellum pages and overwritten in the 12th or 13th century. The upper text of the <b>palimpsest</b> contains weekday Gospel lessons; the lower text contains portions of the Gospel of Luke, deciphered by biblical scholar and palaeographer Tregelles in 1861. The lower text is of most interest to scholars.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} {{was thought}} lost until {{the discovery of}} the Archimedes <b>Palimpsest</b> in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses infinitesimals, and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results. As with The Cattle Problem, The Method of Mechanical Theorems was written {{in the form of a}} letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a <b>palimpsest</b> on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes <b>Palimpsest.</b> Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers a {{surveillance}} camera in her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} overwritten numerous times like a <b>palimpsest,</b> to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man with ties to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes. Their work is disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), bleeding from a chest wound.|$|E
50|$|Faint legible {{remains were}} read by eye before 20th-century {{techniques}} helped make lost texts readable. To read <b>palimpsests,</b> scholars of the 19th century used chemical means that were sometimes very destructive, using tincture of gall or, later, ammonium bisulfate. Modern methods of reading <b>palimpsests</b> using ultraviolet light and photography are less damaging.|$|R

25|$|Using multi-spectral imaging it is {{possible}} to read illegible papyrus, such as the burned papyri of the Villa of the Papyri or of Oxyrhynchus, or the Archimedes <b>palimpsest.</b> The technique involves taking pictures of the illegible document using different filters in the infrared or ultraviolet range, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, the optimum spectral portion can be found for distinguishing ink from paper on the papyrus surface.|$|E

50|$|Because {{parchment}} prepared {{from animal}} hides {{is far more}} durable than paper or papyrus, most <b>palimpsests</b> known to modern scholars are parchment, which rose in popularity in Western Europe after the 6th century. Where papyrus was in common use, reuse of writing media was less common because papyrus was cheaper and more expendable than costly parchment. Some papyrus <b>palimpsests</b> do survive, and Romans referred to this custom of washing papyrus.|$|R
25|$|In February 1892, Agnes Smith Lewis {{identified}} a <b>palimpsest</b> in St Catherine's library that {{became known as}} the Syriac Sinaiticus and is still in the Monastery's possession. Agnes and her sister Margaret Dunlop Gibson returned with a team of scholars that included J. Rendel Harris, to photograph and transcribe the work in its entirety. As the manuscript predates the Codex Sinaiticus, it became crucial in understanding the history of the New Testament.|$|E

25|$|Lofn {{was first}} {{observed}} {{as a large}} high albedo circular feature (<b>palimpsest)</b> on low resolution images taken by Voyager spacecraft in 19791980.

Later in 1997 Galileo spacecraft took a number of high resolution images during its G2 and G8 orbits revealing a large flat-floored crater instead of multi-ring structure. It was determined that Adlinada is actually located slightly to the north-west of Lofn, which partially obscures it. Another multi-ring structureHeimdall is situated to the south-east of Lofn.|$|E
