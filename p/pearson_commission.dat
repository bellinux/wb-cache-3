50|$|The Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Personal Injury, {{better known}} as the <b>Pearson</b> <b>commission</b> was a United Kingdom royal commission, {{established}} in 1973 under the chairmanship of Lord Pearson. The commission reported in 1978 and made radical recommendations for tort reform, Pearson believing that tort's traditional role of compensation had become outdated with the rise of the welfare state since the end of World War II. He saw the benefits system as having the primary role of providing compensation and security following an accident, and litigation as being secondary. As a result, the commission recommended a no-fault insurance scheme for road traffic and industrial accidents, similar to the subsequent New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation, and a scheme of strict liability for consumer protection. However, the government's response was cool and the recommendations were not followed up, much to Pearson's disappointment.|$|E

5000|$|The CGIAR {{arose in}} {{response}} to the widespread concern in the mid-20th century that rapid increases in human populations would soon lead to widespread famine. Starting in 1943, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government laid the seeds for the Green Revolution when they established the Office of Special Studies, which resulted in the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), in 1960 and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in 1963 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation, developing high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties that dramatically increased production of these staple cereals, and turned India, for example, from a country regularly facing starvation in the 1960s to a net exporter of cereals by the late 1970s. But it was clear that these foundations alone could not fund all the agricultural research and development efforts needed to feed the world's population. In 1969, the <b>Pearson</b> <b>Commission</b> on International Development urged the international community to undertake [...] "intensive international effort" [...] to support [...] "research specializing in food supplies and tropical agriculture".|$|E
50|$|The BBC <b>commissioned</b> <b>Pearson</b> {{to write}} the piece for its music library, while he {{was working as a}} member of the Top of the Pops {{orchestra}} accompanying pop stars on the weekly music TV show. During production of the first series of Superstars in 1973, Heavy Action was chosen as the theme music, owing to its high energy brass fanfare opening and Olympian themes.

40|$|Introduction It {{was exactly}} forty years ago. The World Bank {{followed}} {{the recommendations of}} the <b>Pearson</b> <b>Commission,</b> which had been set up in order to evaluate the consequences of development aid. It was necessary to combat urbanisation, the Commission stated, by means of policies acting upon factors triggering rural migration and by supporting small regional centres (Ramsamy 2006). For her part, the urban planner Jane Jacobs published The Economy of Cities (1969), a work which reversed the ev [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Thoughts on {{appropriate}} conceptualization, {{measurement and}} accurate characterization of determinants of poverty {{have a long}} history. From analytical perspective, thinking about poverty {{can be traced back}} at least to the codification of poor laws in medieval England, through to the pioneering empirical studies, {{at the turn of the}} century, by Booth in London and by Rowntree in York. Rowntree’s study, published in 1901, was the first to develop a poverty standard for individual families, based on estimates of nutritional and other requirements. In the 1960 s, the main focus of poverty debate was on the level of income, reflected in macro – economic indicators like Gross National Product per capita. This was associated with emphasis on growth, as exemplified in the work of the <b>Pearson</b> <b>Commission,</b> Partners in Development (1969). In the 1970 s, poverty became prominent, notably as a result of Robert MacNamara’s celebrated speech to the World Bank Board of Governors in Nairobi in 1973, and the subsequent publication of Redistribution with Growth. Debate on poverty conceptualization was further upgraded by two factors. First was emphasis on relative deprivation, inspired by work in the UK by Runciman and Townsend. Townsend in particular, helped redefine poverty: not just as a failure to meet minimum nutrition or Subsistence levels, but rather as a failure to keep up with the standards prevalent in a given society...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the present strategy for international development as presented in various international documents such as the <b>Pearson</b> <b>Commission</b> Report and the UN Report on the Second Development Decade, from the perspective of African countries. The basic thesis of the paper is that the existing strategy on international development, with its targets and policies in the fields of trade and aid, is biased in favour of the relatively advanced developing countries and unless special measures are taken, would have the effect of deepening inequalities among the countries of the Third World. The paper proceeds by considering the rationale for special measures in favour of the least developed countries, most of which are to b found in Africa. It then analyzes the economic stratification developing within the Third World. The main elements of the international strategy for development are outlined; international commodities schemes, generalised system of preferences, and export credits in the field of trade; and development assistance targets, role of multilateral institutions, criteria for aid-givin, and growing emphasis on programme aid in the field of aid. It is then shown that unless special provisions are made, the effect of the implementation of these recommendations will be to favour the more advanced of the developing countries, often at the expense of the least developed countries. The reasons for the failure to devise and implement special measures in favour of the least developed countries are analyzed. The paper concludes by making a number of recommendations designed to ensure that the interests of the most disadvantaged part of the Third World are effectively incorporated in the measures taken for global development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis uses a {{focus on}} the <b>Pearson</b> <b>Commission</b> to explore some of the policy and {{institutional}} dynamics of international development aid during the later 1960 s and early 1970 s. It sets these explorations within a theoretical framework and an historical context. Firstly it draws on the theory of ‘international regimes’ created by international relations scholars. While acknowledging the importance of economic and military power balances, regime theorists also argue that the nature of international policy-making is partially defined by, ‘principles, rules, norms and processes’ which shape how policy-makers act. Using political science theory, the thesis identifies three groups who create and shape these regimes: elites, epistemic communities and bureaucrats. Through a close focus on the dynamics at play within the Pearson Commission’s creation, operation and reception, {{the main body of the}} thesis will identify how a small group of individuals, such as William Clark and Barbara Ward, acted to coordinate sections of these three groups within an ‘aid community’ as the international aid regime changed in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. It is argued that specific changes within this regime, including the emergence of the World Bank as a technical leader on aid matters, the establishment of the 0. 7 per cent aid volume target, and the creation of a definition of official development assistance (ODA), can be attributed to the workings of this community. This concept of a fractious and fragile aid community is used to challenge accounts of this period which emphasise the inexorability of the rise of the World Bank, or prioritise the importance of ideas and knowledge in explaining the changes in the aid regime...|$|E
