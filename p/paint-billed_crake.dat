40|$|The {{geographical}} {{ranges of}} many bird species are neither uniform nor continuous. Species {{that are common}} in some regions may be rare in others, or their status of occurrence may be uncertain. Here, we present the first documented record of Azure Gallinule (Porphyrio flavirostris) as well as details and discussion on the distribution and status of previous records of the Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), <b>Paint-billed</b> <b>Crake</b> (Neocrex erythrops), and Plain-breasted Ground-dove (Columbina minuta) in the Brazilian state of Acre. While all these species have relatively wide ranges, little is known of their distribution in the southwestern Amazon basin...|$|E
