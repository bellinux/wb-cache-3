50|$|<b>Phytomenadione</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1939. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.11 to 1.27 USD for a 10 mg vial. In the United States a course of treatment costs less than 25 USD. In 1943 Edward Doisy and Henrik Dam were given a Nobel Prize for its discovery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytomenadione,</b> {{also known}} as vitamin K1 or phylloquinone, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary {{supplement}}. As a supplement {{it is used to}} treat certain bleeding disorders. This includes in warfarin overdose, vitamin K deficiency, and obstructive jaundice. It is also recommended to prevent and treat hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Use is typically recommended by mouth or injection under the skin. Use by injection into a vein or muscle is recommended only when other routes are not possible. When given by injection benefits are seen within two hours.|$|E
40|$|The present {{manuscript}} describes simple, sensitive, accurate, {{precise and}} economical spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} <b>phytomenadione</b> in injection formulation. Method {{is based on the}} reaction of <b>phytomenadione</b> with 2, 4 dinitrophenyl hydrazine which produce deep yellow color. The yellow color chromogen shows wavelength of maximum absorbance at 350 nm. Linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 0. 1 – 1. 0 µg/ml. The method was successfully applied to pharmaceutical injection formulation because no interferences from formulation excipients were found. The suitability of this method for the quantitative determination of <b>phytomenadione</b> was proved by validation. The proposed method was found to be fast and cost effective and can be used for the routine quality control analysis of pharmaceutical formulations. The results of analysis have been validated statistically and by recovery studies...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare {{efficacy}} of intramuscular <b>phytomenadione</b> (fat soluble vitamin K or vitamin K 1) with menadione (water soluble vitamin K or vitamin K 3) in prevention of subclinical vitamin K deficiency. Design: A double-blind randomized controlled trial. Settings: Tertiary care hospital. Methods: Healthy term neonates were randomized to receive 1 mg of either <b>phytomenadione</b> (Group I, n = 85) or menadione (Group II, n = 85) intramuscularly within 2 hours of birth. PIVKA-II, a sensitive and specific marker of vitamin K deficiency {{was measured by}} ELISA method (Diagnostica Stago, France). Plasma level> 2 ng/mL was labeled as detectable PIVKA-II. Results: Birth weight (2914 ± 318 vs 2958 ± 312 g), gestation (38. 4 ± 1. 2 vs 38. 4 ± 1. 0 wk) and other baseline variables were comparable between the two groups. 48. 2 % (41 / 85) neonates in Group I and 44. 7 % (38 / 85) neonates in Group II had ‘detectable ’ PIVKA-II levels ([Relative Risk (95 % confidence interval) : 1. 1 (0. 8 - 1. 5); P = 0. 76]). Median PIVKA-II levels in Group I and Group II were 1. 99 ng/mL and 1. 97 ng/mL respectively (P = 0. 26). At 72 ± 12 h of age, mean packed cell volume and mean serum bilirubin levels were comparable in the two groups. Conclusion: Comparable PIVKA-II detection rate and PIVKA-II levels in neonates receiving <b>phytomenadione</b> or menadione indicate their similar efficacy in prevention of vitamin K deficiency. However, high PIVKA-II detection rate observed with both preparations indicates recent vitamin K deficiency and {{may be due to}} eithe...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—The {{ability of}} oral vitamin K to {{eliminate}} all risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding {{during the first three}} months of life was studied.  METHODS—Babies (n= 182 000) in the north of England judged well enough to be offered milk within 12 hours of birth were given 1 mg of <b>phytomenadione</b> (vitamin K 1) suspended in a medium chain triglyceride oil by mouth at delivery between 1993 and 1998. The parents of those who were breastfed were given a further three doses to give to the baby once every two weeks after discharge.  RESULTS—Four breastfed babies developed late vitamin K deficiency bleeding. In two, staff failed to follow policy guidelines, and in two there was undiagnosed α 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Audit suggested that 93 % of breastfed babies had all four doses, as advised.  CONCLUSIONS—An oral product that parents can administer themselves would be popular if licensed, but the total dose offered may need to be more than in this study if babies with undiagnosed liver disease are to be protected. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{experience}} report {{aimed to}} describe {{the development of the}} educational practice undertaken with nurses for the elaboration of a care proposal directed towards newborns in the obstetric center of a public hospital, based in good practices. It describes: strategies, stages of the workshops, consensuses of the care provided to the newborn, and evaluation of the process. The workshops were constituted of: embracement; interacting and raising awareness; planning, validating and defining paths; problematizing the issue; integrating; sharing and defining consensuses; and reviewing and redirecting conducts. The issues problematized were: divergences relating to skin-to-skin contact, clamping of the umbilical cord, administration of the credé method and konakion (<b>phytomenadione),</b> and bathing, among others. The group educational practice was an important instrument for the nurses to reflect critically on and problematize their health practices collectively, and is configured as a space for democratic relationships favorable to the socialization of knowledges, partnerships, negotiations, consensuses regarding the care and continuous education, allowing the creation and re-creation of knowledges, with a view to transforming and innovating the care for the newborn...|$|E

Substances taken in study for complexation were the two widely used anticoagulants – warfarin and its 5 -nitro- derivative, acenocoumarol – and their antidote, <b>phytomenadione</b> (also known as phylloquinone or vitamin K 1). For each standard substance, Raman spectra were studied between 3620 and 90 cm- 1. In order to obtain the complexes, a mixture of solutions of each calixarene and each analyte was prepared, in a stoichiometric ratio of 1 : 1 and then the solvents were evaporated. Spectra of solid residues obtained were compared with those of initial molecules. In all cases, there was observed a Raman band shifting or even the disappearance of some bands, indicating that calixarene derivatives interact with the studied molecules. In conclusion, the six calixarene derivatives taken in study {{seem to be able to}} form complexes with the molecules of warfarin, acenocoumarol and phylloquinone. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIn Chile, {{there is}} no present {{government}} policy to survey and analyse adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{in the field of}} veterinary medicine. The intent {{of this study is to}} assess, for the first time, ADR frequency in treated animals. To this purpose, a 6 -month period pilot study based on WHO recommendations was conducted to monitor ADRs in cats and dogs for frequently used drugs and common labelled signs. Of a total of 149 detected ADRs, 29 (6 in cats and 23 in dogs) were notified by means of ADR report forms, while the rest was identified after reviewing patient clinical records, thus evidencing strong under-reporting problems. More than 70 % of ADRs were related to antimicrobials, vaccines and tranquilizers. In dogs, there was a significant effect on ADRs' presentation when acepromazine, amoxicillin, carprofen, ivermectin, sextuple vaccine (polyvalent vaccine that confers immunity against canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, Leptospira canicola, L. icterohemmoragiae, canine adenovirus type 2 and canine parainfluenza virus) and <b>phytomenadione</b> (subcutaneous injection) were administered. In the case of cats, a significant influence on ADRs was detected when acepromazine, amoxicillin or vitamin K was administered. Present results suggest the need for a pharmacovigilance programme in veterinary medicine for timely ADR-presenting drug detection and drug safety improvement...|$|E
40|$|Introduction/Objective. Vitamin K {{deficiency}} {{is common}} in newborn infants and without prophylaxis {{there is a risk}} of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB). The most frequent prophylactic approach is an intramuscular (IM) injection of vitamin K 1 immediately after birth. Its efficiency to prevent late VKDB has been recently questioned by several reports. Based on our experience, we discuss the need for additional vitamin K 1 supplementation after its IM administration at birth. Methods. We present a retrospective review of 12 infants, 11 with confirmed and one with probable late VKDB despite IM prophylaxis at birth, who were treated in the two largest tertiary care pediatric hospitals in Serbia during the last 15 years. Results. All the patients were exclusively breastfed. In 11 patients, daily weight gain was normal or increased, and one patient had failure to gain weight. Six infants were previously healthy, three infants received antibiotics prior to bleeding, and in two diarrhea and cholestasis, respectively, existed previously. An intracranial bleeding was documented in nine infants, four of whom died. Conclusion. Low content of <b>phytomenadione</b> in human milk could occasionally be attributed to late VKDB despite postnatal IM injection of vitamin K 1 in otherwise healthy, exclusively breastfed infants. This might be aggravated by transient disturbance of vitamin K turnover due to antibiotic use, acute diarrhea, or transient cholestasis. We suggest that an additional vitamin K 1 supplementation after postnatal IM prophylaxis could be justified in exclusively breastfed infants...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The lack of {{availability}} of antidotes in emergency services is a worldwide concern. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the {{availability of}} antidotes used for treating poisoning in Campinas (SP). DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study of emergency services in Campinas, conducted in 2010 - 2012. METHODS: The availability, amount in stock, place of storage and access time for 26 antidotal treatments was investigated. In the hospitals, the availability of at least one complete treatment for a 70 kg adult over the first 24 hours of admission was evaluated based on stock and access recommendations contained in two international guidelines. RESULTS: 14 out of 17 functioning emergency services participated in the study, comprising pre-hospital services such as the public emergency ambulance service (SAMU; n = 1) and public emergency rooms for admissions lasting &# 8804; 24 hours (UPAs; n = 3), and 10 hospitals with emergency services. Six antidotes (atropine, sodium bicarbonate, diazepam, <b>Phytomenadione,</b> flumazenil and calcium gluconate) were stocked in all the services, followed by 13 units that also stocked activated charcoal, naloxone and diphenhydramine or biperiden. No service stocked all of the recommended antidotes; only the regional Poison Control Center had stocks close to recommended (22 / 26 antidotal treatments). The 10 hospitals had almost half of the antidotes for starting treatments, but only one quarter of the antidotes was present with stocks sufficient for providing treatment for 24 hours. CONCLUSION: The stock of antidotes for attending poisoning emergencies in the municipality of Campinas is incomplete and needs to be improved...|$|E
