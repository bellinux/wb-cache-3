The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption." [...] Variously known as background independence, the cosmological principle, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>universality,</b> the principle of uniformity, or uniformitarianism, there are important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by Stephen Jay Gould: [...] "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes. [...] It works the other way around." [...] You first assume these propositions and [...] "then you go to the out crop of rock." [...] "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way [...] "prove" [...] the validity of induction - an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)." [...] Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's [...] "uniformity of process" [...] are an assumption: [...] "As such, it is another a priori assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world." [...] Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: [...] "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation." [...] and according to R. Hooykaas: [...] "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts [...] [...] [...] It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for {{there is only one way}} in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different." ...|$|E

5000|$|Feminist justice {{ethics is}} part of a range of feminist ethical perspectives. Other popular feminist {{approaches}} to ethics include feminist ethics of care, and feminist postmodern ethics. The implementation of a feminist ethic of care often draws critique from feminist justice ethics. Feminist ethics of care is premised by the idea that morality is shaped by relational versions of our self. Our moral relations take precedence. [...] Feminist justice ethics differs itself from feminist ethics of care by chastising such a perspective for its abandonment of universal values. In feminist justice ethics, legitimate ethical critique cannot be made without utilizing a universal set of ethics. [...] Meanwhile, feminist postmodern ethics puts forth an entirely different view. A feminist postmodern perspective will perceive androcentricity in many aspects of life, including epistemology. At the same time feminist postmodernism will deny the existence of objectivity within our world. This claim is based on the notion that knowledge is subjectively constructed. [...] One feminist postmodern scholar has implicated the ethical outcomes of modern business norms {{as a result of this}} masculine-dominated society. [...] Friction between feminist justice ethics and feminist postmodern ethics exists on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>universality.</b> The former supports the idea of universal values, while the latter denies such values exist because it denies objectivity.Since a universal view on morality is typical in feminist justice ethics, the question arises: what specific values are actually universal?

5000|$|While not metaphysical naturalism per se, in {{the more}} general sense of naturalism and {{philosophy}} expressed by Kate and Vitaly (2000) [...] "there are certain philosophical assumptions made {{at the base of}} the scientific method - namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded." [...] As noted by Steven Schafersman, methodological naturalism is [...] "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within scientific method with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success (although science does have metaphysical implications), but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is." [...] Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching Creationism or Intelligent Design in US public schools such as Eugenie Scott, Schafersman asserts that [...] "while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism." [...] as well as the similarly controversial assertion: [...] "I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled." [...] On the other hand, Scott argues: that a clear distinction must be drawn between science as a way of knowing about the natural world and science as a foundation for philosophical views. One should be taught to our children in school, and the other can optionally be taught to our children at home. Once this view is explained, I have found far more support than disagreement among my university colleagues. Even someone who may disagree with my logic or understanding of philosophy of science often understands the strategic reasons for separating methodological from philosophical materialism — if we want more Americans to understand evolution.
