40|$|Coral reef {{ecosystems}} of the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, Virgin Islands National Park and {{the surrounding}} waters of <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands are a precious natural resource worthy of special protection and conservation. The mosaic of habitats including coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves, are home to a diversity of marine organisms. These benthic habitats and their associated inhabitants provide many important ecosystem services to the community of <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> such as fishing, tourism and shoreline protection. However, coral reef ecosystems throughout the U. S. Caribbean are under increasing pressure from environmental and anthropogenic stressors that threaten to destroy the natural heritage of these marine habitats. Mapping of benthic habitats is an integral component of any effective ecosystem-based management approach. Through {{the implementation of a}} multi-year interagency agreement, NOAA’s Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch and the U. S. National Park Service (NPS) have completed benthic habitat mapping, field validation and accuracy assessment of maps for the nearshore marine environment of <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> This work is an expansion of ongoing mapping and monitoring efforts conducted by NOAA and NPS in the U. S. Caribbean and replaces previous NOAA maps generated by Kendall et al. (2001) for the waters around <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> The use of standardized protocols enables the condition of the coral reef ecosystems around <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> to be evaluated in context {{to the rest of the}} Virgin Island Territories and other U. S. coral ecosystems. The products from this effort provide an accurate assessment of the abundance and distribution of marine habitats surrounding <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> to support more effective management and conservation of ocean resources within the National Park system. This report documents the entire process of benthic habitat mapping in <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> Chapter 1 provides a description of the benthic habitat classification scheme used to categorize the different habitats existing in the nearshore environment. Chapter 2 describes the steps required to create a benthic habitat map from visual interpretation of remotely sensed imagery. Chapter 3 details the process of accuracy assessment and reports on the thematic accuracy of the final maps. Finally, Chapter 4 is a summary of the basic map content and compares the new maps to a previous NOAA effort. Benthic habitat maps of the nearshore marine environment of <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands were created by visual interpretation of remotely sensed imagery. Overhead imagery, including color orthophotography and IKONOS satellite imagery, proved to be an excellent source from which to visually interpret the location, extent and attributes of marine habitats. NOAA scientists were able to accurately and reliably delineate the boundaries of features on digital imagery using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and fi eld investigations. The <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> habitat classification scheme defined benthic communities on the basis of four primary coral reef ecosystem attributes: 1) broad geographic zone, 2) geomorphological structure type, 3) dominant biological cover, and 4) degree of live coral cover. Every feature in the benthic habitat map was assigned a designation at each level of the scheme. The ability to apply any component of this scheme was dependent on being able to identify and delineate a given feature in remotely sensed imagery...|$|R

Sediment loads I predicted on a storm-by-storm basis, and annual sediment loads were calculated by summing the loads from each storm in a year. This was performed from historical rainfall data for three years: 1990, which had an approximately average total rainfall; 1986, which had the highest total rainfall in the period for which I had rainfall data; and 1989, which was the year of Hurricane Hugo, and therefore had the largest single storm.

40|$|The {{majority}} of St. John's land and coast is a National Park and {{is protected by}} the federal government. In spite of these restrictions, the population of <b>St.</b> <b>John</b> has risen in {{the past fifteen years}} as has the number of tourists that visit the island. A possible side-effect to the growing population is increased nitrogen loading to the bays, which can impact the benthic habitat. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the extent of the effects of human developments on nitrogen loading of the bays on <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands. This is accomplished by taking nitrogen samples of the bays, using ArcGIS and the Nitrogen Loading Model to estimate the nitrogen loading of the bays, and correlating historical nitrogen concentrations with increases in population. While the analysis of nitrogen samples of the bays is inconclusive, the Nitrogen Loading Model estimates that bays with greater levels of development have higher amounts of nitrogen loading. Historical nitrogen concentrations show little relationship between the level of development of the watersheds and the concentration of nitrogen within the bays. Overall, {{there is little evidence that}} nitrogen loading from development is causing excessive nitrogen loading. by Alfred Patrick Navato. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Reef fish monitoring data collected from 1988 to 2006 within Virgin Islands National Park (VINP) and adjacent reefs around <b>St.</b> <b>John,</b> U. <b>S.</b> Virgin Islands (USVI) were analyzed to provide information on the status of reef fishes during the monitoring period. Monitoring projects were initiated by the National Park Service (NPS) in the 1980 s to provide useful data for evaluation of resources and for development of a long-term monitoring program. Monthly monitoring was conducted at two reef sites (Yawzi Point and Cocoloba Cay) starting in November 1988 for 2. 5 years to document the monthly/seasonal variability in reef fish assemblages. Hurricane Hugo (a powerful Category 4 storm) struck the USVI in September 1989 resulting in considerable damage to the reefs around <b>St.</b> <b>John.</b> Abundance of fishes was lower at both sites following the storm, however, a greater effect was observed at Yawzi Point, which experienced a more direct impact from the hurricane. The storm affected species differently, with some showing only small, short-term declines in abundance, and others, such as the numerically abundant blue chromis (Chromis cyanea), a planktivorous damselfish, exhibiting a larger and longer recovery period. This report provides: 1) an evaluation of sampling methods, sample size, and methods used during the sampling period, 2) an evaluation of the spatial and temporal variability in reef fish assemblages at selected reef sites inside and outside of VINP, and 3) an evaluation of trends over 17 years of monitoring at the four reference sites.
