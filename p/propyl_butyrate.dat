40|$|The {{presence}} of 51 volatile compounds, among alcohols and esters in Brazilian sugar-cane spirit (cachaça), were investigated by high-resolution gas chromatography (HRGC). The following alcohols and esters {{were identified and}} quantified: methanol, 1, 4 -butanodiol, 2 -phenylethyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, cynamic alcohol, n-decanol, geraniol, isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, menthol, n-butanol, n-dodecanol, n-propanol, n-tetradecanol, amyl propionate, ethyl acetate, ethyl benzoate, ethyl heptanoate, isoamyl valerate, methyl propionate, <b>propyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> The average higher alcohols content (262 mg/ 100 mL in anhydrous alcohol a. a.) and total esters content (24 mg/ 100 mL a. a.) in cachaças, are smaller than in other spirits. The average methanol content in cachaças (6 mg/ 100 mL a. a.) {{is the same as}} in rum, but smaller than in wine spirit.

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to isolate, identify, and to characterize, major {{volatile}} components of tomato fruit. Simultaneously, the confirmation was extended to the reported tomato volatiles. The volatile extracts from field- and artificially - ripe fruits were compared qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The changes which occurred in the volatile components of the fruit {{at the onset of}} senescence also were delineated. A typical chromatogram from field-ripe tomatoes contained 60 peaks. The functional group properties of individual peaks were derived by chemical analysis. The short-chain (C 3 -C 6) alcohols represented 10 per cent, aldehydes and ketones 32 per cent, and hydrocarbons, long-chain alcohols, and esters were in 58 per cent of the total amount of the volatiles from the field-ripe fruits. Among alcohols and carbonyls, 3 -pantanol, 1 -nonanal, 1 -decanal, and 1 -dodecanal and among esters, propyl acetate, geranyl acetate, and cetronellyl butyrate were tentatively identified as volatile compounds of tomato fruit. Linalyl acetate, citronellyl butyrate, and geranyl butyrate were identified {{for the first time as}} the components of tomato volatiles. Comparisons of volatile concentrations of field- and artificially - ripe tomatoes were made. IN the latter category of fruits the concentrations of 1 -butanol, 3 -pentanol, 2 -methyl- 3 -hexanol, 3 -methyl-butanal, 2, 3 -butanedione, <b>propyl</b> acetate, isopentyl <b>butyrate,</b> and other unidentified carbonyls were higher than those observed in the field-ripe fruits. These short-chain compounds, especially the C 4 -C 6 moities, probably are formed in their maximum concentrations during the early stages of maturation. Under the conditions of restricted nutrient availability, sun light, and limited enzymatic activity during artificial ripening, the long-chain compounds are not sunthesized appreciably. The concentrations of some of these short-chain compounds may be to a level of masking the effects of more desirable compounds contributory to ripe tomato aroma. Notably, a pulp from the artificially ripe fruits lacked the characteristic ripe tomato aroma. The concentrations of the long-chain carbonyls and the terpene esters were low in the artificially ripe tomatoes as compared to the field-ripe ones. This may indicate major contribution of these compounds to ripe tomato aroma. An attempt has been made to theorize the mechanisms of the biogenesis of these components of tomato volatiles. The concentrations of the volatiles from field-ripe and overripe tomatoes were compared. During overripening the amounts of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acetates, and propionates generally decreased. However, the concentrations of diacetyl and butyric acid esters increased. It was assumed that at the onset of senescence the metabolic pathways for the formation of diacetyl and butyric acid were highly operative in tomato fruit. The mechanisms of these pathways were postulated...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the gas phase oxidation of the lower aliphatic esters and of propane. The kinetics of the oxidation of methyl, ethyl, and propyl formate, methyl acetate, methyl propionate and methyl butyrate were determined at various temperatures from 280 ° to 450 °C. The experiments were made in a silica reaction vessel and the pressure changes accompanying oxidation were followed on a mercury manometer. The pressure-time curves usually showed an induction period after which the rate of change of pressure in the reaction vessel increased up to a maximum. Two temperature ranges of reactivity were observed with ethyl and <b>propyl</b> formate, methyl <b>butyrate</b> and propane. The rate of oxidation increased smoothly with increasing temperature up to about 350 Â°C. Between 350 Â° and 400 °C. the rate decreased rapidly with an increase in temperature. Above 400 Â°C. the rate increased continuously until ignition occurred. At all temperatures, an increase in the initial concentration of the combustible material increased the rate of oxidation and decreased the induction period. In the high temperature region an increase in the oxygen concentration similarly increased the rate of oxidation. In the low temperature region the rate of oxidation was independent of the oxygen concentration. Except at very low partial pressures of oxygen the induction period was independent of ths oxygan concentration in both the low and high temperature regions. A mass spectrometer was used to analyse the combustion gases for the unchanged ester (or propane), for residual oxygen, and for the amount of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide formed. At all temperatures the concentrations of the major constituents were directly proportional to the pressure changes measured in the reaction vessel. Sufficient experiments were made to establish the pressure measurements as a true measure of the oxidation process. Chemical and polarographic analyses were made for formaldehyde, aoetaldehyde, total acid and peroxide substances. In each case the concentration of the intermediate species passed through a maximum as the reaction went to completion. No significant oxidation was detected during the induction period. The outstanding feature of the general kinetics of the esters was the marked dependence of the rate of oxidation, in the low temperature region, on the molecular structure of the combustible material. An increase in the carbon chain length increased the rate of oxidation much more than would have been expected from tue normal organic chemistry of a homologous series. The effect was most pronounced between the esters of higher molecular weight. An increase in the carbon chain length on the ethereal side of the ester configuration had a much greater effect than a corresponding increase on the carbonyl side. Where only methyl groups, and no metnylene groups occurred, the ease of oxidation wae greatly reduced. The kinetic results are interpreted in terms of a series of reaction steps analogous to those proposed by Cullis and Hinshelwood for paraffin oxidation. The scheme postulates the formation of peroxide substances capable, in the low temperature region, of decomposition and the propogation of a branching chain reaction. The rate expression for the oxidation reaction is of the form f([O 2], [RH]) l - 2 kF The remarkable effects of the substituent groups are attributed largely to the effect of the structural changes on the rate of decomposition, k, of the peroxide species. The theories of Walsh and Norrish are discussed in relation to the experimental evidence of the present investigation. The analytical investigation of the cool flame mixtures of propane indicated that the products of cool flame combustion are very similar to those detected in the low temperature region of oxidation. The changes in the concentrations of the initial reagents and final products followed the same pattern as that observed at lower temperatures. The polarograme of the combustion samples collected immediately before, and after, the occurrence of a cool flame, showed a marked decrease in the concentration of peroxide material with the explosion. The analyses support the theory of Hardwell and Hinshelwood, that oool flakes result from the self-heating of the gas mixture by the thermal decomposition of the peroxide intermediates. The general scheme proposed is R- + 0 2 = R 00 - R 00 - + RH = R 00 H + R- R 00 H = R 0 - + - 0 H where the temperature coefficient of the rate of decomposition of the peroxide is greater than that of the rate of formation. If the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic, under appropriate conditions of concentration and reaction temperature, self-heating would be expected, and the rate would increase rapidly until the peroxide substances are largely consumed. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{validated}} method using {{a thermal}} desorber {{combined with a}} gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometry was used to identify the volatile organic compounds released during decomposition of 6 human and 26 animal remains in a laboratory environment {{during a period of}} 6 months. 452 compounds were identified. Among them a human specific marker was sought using principle component analysis. We found a combination of 8 compounds (ethyl propionate, propyl propionate, <b>propyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> ethyl pentanoate, pyridine, diethyl disulfide, methyl(methylthio) ethyl disulfide and 3 -methylthio- 1 -propanol) that led to the distinction of human and pig remains from other animal remains. Furthermore, it was possible to separate the pig remains from human remains based on 5 esters (3 -methylbutyl pentanoate, 3 -methylbutyl 3 -methylbutyrate, 3 -methylbutyl 2 -methylbutyrate, butyl pentanoate and propyl hexanoate). Further research in the field with full bodies has to corroborate these results and search for one or more human specific markers. These markers would allow a more efficiently training of cadaver dogs or portable detection devices could be developed...|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the need for}} robust rechargeable batteries that can operate well over a wide temperature range. To this end, a number of electrolyte formulations have been developed that incorporate the use of electrolyte additives to improve the high-temperature resilience, low-temperature power capability, and life characteristics of methyl butyrate-based electrolyte solutions. These electrolyte additives include mono-fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), lithium oxalate, vinylene carbonate (VC), and lithium bis(oxalato) borate (LiBOB), which {{have been shown to}} result in improved high-temperature resilience of all carbonate-based electrolytes. Improved performance has been demonstrated of Li-ion cells with methyl butyrate-based electrolytes, including 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+MB (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %); 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+MB (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %) + 2 % FEC; 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+MB (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %) + 4 % FEC; 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+MB (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %) + lithium oxalate; 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+MB (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %) + 2 % VC; and 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+MB (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %) + 0. 10 M LiBOB. These electrolytes have been shown to improve performance in MCMB-LiNiCoO 2 and graphite-LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 experimental Li-ion cells. A number of LiPF 6 -based mixed carbonate electrolyte formulations have been developed that contain ester co-solvents, which have been optimized for operation at low temperature, while still providing reasonable performance at high temperature. For example, a number of ester co-solvents were investigated, including methyl propionate (MP), ethyl propionate (EP), methyl butyrate (MB), ethyl butyrate (EB), <b>propyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (PB), and butyl butyrate (BB) in multi-component electrolytes of the following composition: 1. 0 M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) + ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) + X (20 : 60 : 20 v/v %) [where X = ester co-solvent]. ["Optimized Car bon ate and Ester-Based Li-Ion Electrolytes", NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 4 (April 2008), p. 56. ] Focusing upon improved rate capability at low temperatures (i. e., 20 to 40 C), this approach was optimized further, resulting in the development of 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+MP (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %) and 1. 20 M LiPF 6 in EC+EMC+EB (20 : 20 : 60 v/v %), which were demonstrated to operate well over a wide temperature range in MCMB-LiNiCoAlO 2 and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (-) LiNiCoAlO 2 prototype cells...|$|E
