5000|$|In {{his role}} at the BFI, Brown made a major {{contribution}} to the science of film preservation. He was possibly the first archivist to research systematically the process of nitrate film decomposition, and consequently {{to show that it}} can be inhibited by storage in a cool and dry atmosphere. Brown is credited with having invented the term vinegar syndrome to describe the deacetylation of cellulose acetate film base. [...] He designed and built specialist printers to enable the preservation copying of shrunken and otherwise damaged originals. He was an active member of FIAF's Technical Commission, in which capacity he wrote and contributed to a number of technical manuals that are still regarded as standard reference works by film archivists today. In retirement, Brown was a prominent volunteer with the <b>Projected</b> <b>Picture</b> Trust, restoring and operating historical projectors at a museum in Bletchley Park.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of anamorphic widescreen arose {{due to a}} desire for wider aspect ratios while maintaining the use of standard (4 perf/frame) cameras and projectors, and maximising overall image detail. The modern anamorphic format has an aspect ratio of 2.40:1, meaning the (<b>projected)</b> <b>picture</b> width is 2.40 times its height, (technically it is 2.39:1, but it is known professionally as 2.40:1 or [...] "two-four-oh"). Academy format 35 mm film (standard non-anamorphic full frame with sound tracks in the image area) has an aspect ratio of 1.37:1, which is not as wide (or, equivalently, is taller). In non-anamorphic spherical ("flat") widescreen imaging, the picture is recorded on film so that its full width fits within the film frame, but substantial film frame area is wasted on portions that will be matted out {{by the time of}} projection, either on the print or in the projector, {{in order to create a}} widescreen image in the theater (Figure 1).|$|E
50|$|In 1910 Arthur Roussel {{was hired}} to build a machine that would enable the public to view a film inside their home.

The 28 mm wide film had one sprocket hole per frame on one edge of the film, 3 on the other; the large image size of 19 mm x 14 mm allowed the <b>projected</b> <b>picture</b> to be of a very high quality.The 28 mm Pathéscope K.O.K. cine-projector was patented in 1911.

5000|$|In theaters, Cinerama {{film was}} {{projected}} from three projection booths arranged {{in the same}} crisscross pattern as the cameras. They projected onto a deeply curved screen, the outer thirds of which were made of over 1100 strips of material mounted on [...] "louvers" [...] like a vertical venetian blind, to prevent light projected to {{each end of the}} screen from reflecting to the opposite end and washing out the image. This was a big-ticket, reserved-seats spectacle, and the Cinerama projectors were adjusted carefully and operated skillfully. To prevent adjacent images from creating an overilluminated vertical band where they overlapped on the screen, vibrating combs in the projectors, called [...] "jiggolos," [...] alternately blocked the image from one projector and then the other; the overlapping area thus received no more total illumination {{than the rest of the}} screen, and the rapidly alternating images within the overlap smoothed out the visual transition between adjacent image [...] "panels." [...] Great care was taken to match color and brightness when producing the prints. Nevertheless, the seams between panels were usually noticeable. Optical limitations with the design of the camera itself meant that if distant scenes joined perfectly, closer objects did not (parallax error). A nearby object might split into two as it crossed the seams. To avoid calling attention to the seams, scenes were often composed with unimportant objects such as trees or posts at the seams, and action was blocked so as to center actors within panels. This gave a distinctly [...] "triptych-like" [...] appearance to the composition even when the seams themselves were not obvious. It was often necessary to have actors in different sections [...] "cheat" [...] where they looked in order to appear to be looking at each other in the final <b>projected</b> <b>picture.</b> Enthusiasts say the seams were not obtrusive; detractors disagree. Lowell Thomas, an investor in the company with Mike Todd, was still raving about the process in his memoirs thirty years later.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of German language literature in handbooks and readers used in teaching literature in high schools and technical schools has undergone the evolution within the last fifty years, it has not changed so much as {{not being able to}} determine several relevant characteristics of its presence. (The above mentioned applies also to the reading list.) There are three features which seem to be especially distinctive for establishing the place of German language literature in teaching: 1. the German literature emerges everywhere where it is an argument for the existence of the world literature (Goethe, Schiller); 2. writers whose works influenced the Polish literature, and who made friends with Polish writers are eagerly referred to during the lectures on history of literature; 3. Those writers whose works preserve the essential cultural and philosophical issues (Kafka, Thomas Mann, Brecht), occupy a prominent place in a <b>projected</b> <b>picture</b> of the world Jilerature. The polilical, social and ideological changes taking place in Poland nowadays, have also flourished with rather essential changes in the programme of teaching literature.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 209 - 218. The {{intention}} of this dissertation is {{to clarify the}} psychological processes and effects which operate in the political detention situation, and to outline effective treatment and coping strategies. An overview of research literature and theory is provided, {{and the importance of}} viewing detention within a broad socio-political context is emphasised. In the analysis of the detention situation a number of variables likely to be operative are considered. Solitary confinement, torture, interrogation, reactions to severe stress situations, and uncertainty, unpredictability and uncontrollability are given separate discussion, prior to an at tempt to con sider the interaction of these variables in the detention situation. This <b>projected</b> <b>picture</b> is compared with case material gathered in the area. It is noted that political detention is not a uniform experience with a uniform set of effects. Rather, the effects are seen to be dependent on the particular differences in response. Nevertheless, political detention is shown to be commonly both objectively and subjectively severely stressful, with a strong likelihood of the detainee developing debilitating psychological sequelae. Post-traumatic stress disorder appears to be commonly implicated, and symptoms may persist for many years. Family and community members and organisations to which the detainee belongs suffer not only the effects of the loss of that person, but also the problems of effectively helping him or her to reintegrate. It is shown that detainees have commonly drawn on a number of resources or strategies to counteract the potentially debilitating effects of detention. The importance of prior preparation for the detention experience to facilitate an accurate appraisal of the situation and better coping is emphasized. Useful strategies that may be learned or fostered are outlined. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment that acknowledges all of the difficulties and needs particular to any specific ex-detainee, and that draws on as broad a range of available supports as possible, is stressed. Physiotherapy, psychotherapy, medication where necessary and family involvement are recommended. It is shown that much may be learned from Canadian and European units that rehabilitate victims of torture - mainly from South American countries: but that strategies need to be adapted to South African conditions...|$|E

There are two phases of the project, the first of which involves a locative tour of the exterior of the building in the form of a downloadable iPhone application that uses GPS to trigger context-aware images and audio recordings according to where the user is positioned in relation to the building.
