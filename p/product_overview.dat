This monitoring can be performed by using either of two methods: a manually inflated cuff with a stethoscope for listening to arterial wall sounds (the auscultatory method), or a blood pressure monitor that contains a pressure sensor for sensing arterial wall vibrations (the oscillometric method).

50|$|Collaborative {{decision-making}} (CDM) {{is defined}} as social media feature which, if combined with BI applications, will allow an increased distribution and discussion of information {{through a number of}} key features. These key features include annotations, discussions, and tagging, embedding, and providing decisions. Annotations help others in accepting and interpreting the data, which makes it more significant. For instance, when users are creating or analyzing reports within the BI environment, they can add commentaries and annotations so as to offer context to the data. Business leaders can be observed to be assured that they completely understand the information on which decisions are grounded. Open-access discussions will allow the contributors to post their notions as well as to read, consider and enhance the proposals of others. This feature can be a valuable device for pursuing the input of other investors. This is because of how assimilating CDM tools within the BI environment offers the possibility to hold discussions in complete view of the significant data. Tagging, on the other hand, enables the users to highlight related information in a flexible manner which makes it easy for other user to examine and recover beneficial and practical data. The ability to embed information enclosed in a BI solution into other applications is a vital factor for making sure that precise information is made accessible to decision-makers in a sensible manner. When information is embedded, it can be seen and commented on by several users. Meaning to say, ideas and suggestions can also be shared and discoursed in actual. Lastly, BI solutions are observed to have the capability of supporting appropriate decision-making that supports groups to attain explicit, quantifiable goals and objectives. These may also comprise an improved <b>product</b> <b>overview</b> or more lucrative supply chain.|$|E

40|$|This {{consultation}} paper explores what legislative reforms, and other changes, {{would be needed}} if New Zealand were to become {{a party to the}} Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco <b>Products.</b> <b>Overview</b> Since 2005 New Zealand has been a party to an international treaty that aims to prevent harms from tobacco use, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) : the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, negotiated under this Treaty, aims to provide a global response to the illicit trade in tobacco products. The Government is undertaking consultation to inform decision-making as to whether it should agree to become a party to it. This consultation document puts forward two options for consideration: 	Option 1 : New Zealand does not become a party to the Protocol and continues with its current approach to preventing illicit trade in tobacco products. 	Option 2 : New Zealand becomes a party to the Protocol and makes the necessary changes to meet the mandatory requirements of the Protocol. New Zealand’s existing laws already comply with many of the obligations in the Protocol. However, if New Zealand became a party to the Protocol, some legislative reforms would probably be needed, along with new systems, processes and initiatives to support them.

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{the application of}} industrial by-products and recycled materials. Waterproofing admixtures improve the structure and {{the properties of the}} cement stone. Development and preparation of highly effective waterproofing modifiers of durable effect, as well as development of the process procedure parameters, including mixing, activation, heat treatment, etc. are to be implemented. The composition of waterproofing modifiers is to be fine-tuned to synergize the behaviour of various ingredients of cement systems to assure the substantial improvement of their strength, freeze- and corrosion resistance. Multi-functional waterproofing admixtures were used to produce highly effective modified concretes. The key idea of the new method of modifying cement-based building materials is that the waterproofing admixture concentration is to exceed 10 % of the weight of the binding agent within the per-unit weight of the cement stone, given that its strength does not deteriorate. GKM-type modifier coupled with organo-mineral waterproofing admixture concentration agent GT-M may be recommended for mass use in the manufacturing of hydraulic concrete and reinforced concrete <b>products.</b> <b>Overview</b> of their practical implementation has proven that waterproofing modifier GKM-S, if coupled with waterproofing admixture concentration agent GT-M, improves the corrosion control inside the cement stone and makes it possible to manufacture durable concrete and reinforced concrete products that demonstrate pre-set physical and processing behaviour. Comprehensive concrete modification by modifier GKM-S and waterproofing admixture concentration agent GT-M may be {{regarded as one of the}} most ambitious methods of production of highly effective waterproof concretes...|$|R
