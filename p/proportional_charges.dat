5000|$|The United States District Court for the District of Columbia also {{dismissed}} a {{case involving}} allegations of structural bias {{on the part of}} FERC. The plaintiffs contended that the Omnibus Budget Act of 1986 funding mechanism requires the Commission to recover its budget through <b>proportional</b> <b>charges</b> on regulated entities, therefore making FERC biased in favor of the industry from which it gets its funding. But in an order issued March 22, 2017, the court said the plain language of the statute indicates that FERC does not have control over its own budget. “The Commission’s budget cannot be increased by approving pipelines; rather, statute requires the Commission to make adjustments to ‘eliminate any overrecovery or underrecovery.’ If Plaintiffs are unhappy with Congress’s chosen appropriations to the Commission…, Plaintiffs’ recourse lies with their legislative representatives.” [...] However, the D.C. Circuit has ruled against Commission procedures, stating that in one case FERC failed to consider the cumulative environmental impact of four projects that had been separately proposed by the same pipeline. The D.C. Circuit held that the projects were not financially independent and were “a single pipeline” that was “linear and physically interdependent,” so the cumulative environmental impacts should have been considered concurrently. [...] Subsequently, in a separate decision, the D.C. Circuit clarified that the “critical” factor was that all of the pipeline’s projects were either under construction or pending before FERC for environmental review at the same time. [...] This guidance has allowed FERC to address additional claims of improper segmentation.|$|E

40|$|Gauss's law in {{integral}} form {{states that}} closed surface integral of electric field is <b>proportional</b> to net <b>charge</b> present within the volume bounded by this closed surface. Gauss's law in differential form states that divergence of electric field is <b>proportional</b> to <b>charge's</b> volume density. From Gauss's law {{it is concluded}} that in vacuum, where no electric charges are present, divergence of electric field and closed surface integral of electric field are zero. In this paper we make an attempt to theoretically prove that for time-varying electric fields Gauss's law is not valid. In other words, for time-varying electric field even in vacuum divergence of electric field and closed surface integral of electric field are non-zero. We do this by considering simple sinusoidal motion of the charge and then by calculating closed surface integral at specific time of time-varying electric field due to charge motion. Results show that for charges at still and at motion with constant velocity Gauss's law is valid. However for charges moving with acceleration, Gauss's law is no longer valid.

40|$|Interventional and {{fluoroscopic}} imaging {{procedures for}} pediatric patients {{are becoming more}} prevalent because of the less-invasive nature of these procedures compared to alternatives such as surgery. Flat-panel X-ray detectors (FPD) for fluoroscopy are a new technology alternative to the image intensifier/TV (II/TV) digital system {{that has been in}} use for more than two decades. Two major FPD technologies have been implemented, based on indirect conversion of X-rays to light (using an X-ray scintillator) and then to <b>proportional</b> <b>charge</b> (using a photodiode), or direct conversion of X-rays into charge (using a semiconductor material) for signal acquisition and digitization. These detectors have proved very successful for high-exposure interventional procedures but lack the image quality of the II/TV system at the lowest exposure levels common in fluoroscopy. The benefits for FPD image quality include lack of geometric distortion, little or no veiling glare, a uniform response across the field-of-view, and improved ergonomics with better patient access. Better detective quantum efficiency indicates the possibility of reducing the patient dose in accordance with ALARA principles. However, first-generation FPD devices have been implemented with less than adequate acquisition flexibility (e. g., lack of tableside controls/information, inability to easily change protocols) and the presence of residual signals from previous exposures, and additional cost of equipment and long-term maintenance have been serious impediments to purchase and implementation. Technological advances of second generation and future hybrid FPD systems should solve many current issues. The answer to the question ‘how much better are they?–is ‘significantly better– and they are certainly worth consideration for replacement or new implementation of an imaging suite for pediatric fluoroscopy...|$|R
40|$|Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits (GMWB) {{are popular}} riders in {{variable}} annuities with withdrawal guarantees. With withdrawals {{spread over the}} life of the annuities contract, the benefit promises to return the entire initial annuitization amount irrespective of the market performance of the underlying fund portfolio. Treating the dynamic withdrawal rate as the control variable, the earlier works on GMWB have considered the construction of a continuous singular stochastic control model and the numerical solution of the resulting pricing model. This paper presents a more detailed characterization of the pricing properties of the GMWB and performs a full mathematical analysis of the optimal dynamic withdrawal policies under the competing factors of time value of fund, optionality value provided by the guarantee and penalty charge on excessive withdrawal. When a <b>proportional</b> penalty <b>charge</b> is applied on any withdrawal amount, we can reduce the pricing formulation to an optimal stopping problem with lower and upper obstacles. We then derive the integral equations for the determination of a pair of optimal withdrawal boundaries. When a <b>proportional</b> penalty <b>charge</b> is applied on the amount that is above the contractual withdrawal rate, we manage to characterize the behavior of the optimal withdrawal boundaries that separate the domain of the pricing models into three regions: no withdrawal, continuous withdrawal at the contractual rate and an immediate withdrawal of a finite amount. Under certain limiting scenarios such as a high policy fund value, the time close to expiry, or a low value of guarantee account, we manage to obtain analytical approximate solution to the singular stochastic control model of dynamic withdrawals.

40|$|The {{reasons for}} {{and the results of}} {{laboratory}} simulation studies of space plasma flow over obstacles are discussed in the context of satellite-ionosphere interactions and of forthcoming Skylab experiments. So far, it appears that ions passing through the plasma sheath are focused onto the wake axis, thereby creating an enhanced ion current which peaks at approximately a 'Mach' number of radii downstream from floating spherical bodies. The location of the peak enhancement shows a hyperbolic dependence on body potential, while its structure depends on the body cross-sectional geometry rather than on the axial dimension. There is a corresponding enhancement of the electron current coexistent with the ion-current enhancement.
