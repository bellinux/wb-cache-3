25|$|The {{international}} patent {{scene has}} become a hotbed of controversy following the decisions of U.S. courts to recognize living things as <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> Patent lawyers representing {{the interest of the}} U.S. biotechnology industry are in the forefront of the debate, pressing for other countries to adopt more extensive patent laws recognizing living materials as <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> just as U.S. courts and the United States Patent & Trademark Office have.|$|E

25|$|Whether a {{business}} method {{is regarded as}} <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> depends on the legal jurisdiction.

5000|$|In Diamond v. Chakrabarty, the United States Supreme Court {{held that}} a genetically-altered living {{microorganism}} was patent-eligible <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> The Chakrabarty Court said that [...] "we must determine whether respondent's micro-organism constitutes a 'manufacture' or 'composition of matter' {{within the meaning of}} the statute. The Court's answer to its question was yes----"respondent's micro-organism plainly qualifies as <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> matter." [...] But the Court never said which one it was.|$|R
50|$|The {{scope of}} <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> is {{significantly}} larger in the U.S. than in Europe.

5000|$|Burk {{argues that}} the proper test of patent {{eligibility}} for such a product as Dolly the sheep is whether the claim preempts field of the described <b>subject</b> <b>matter,</b> so that [...] "fundamental concepts and materials, on which all inventors must draw, are caught up in patent claims." [...] He says that the Roslin patent would not [...] "capture fundamental or basic science on which future invention will depend, or if it does so, {{there is no indication}} in the Roslin opinion that this informed the analysis of <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> matter." [...] According to Burk, the patent would not be preemptive because its covers only sheep or other mammals [...] "produced by the cloning process, a limitation that constrains the patent to the specific and novel implementation disclosed by the applicant." ...|$|R
25|$|The UK {{patent office}} did find that Macrossan's process was both novel and {{involved}} an inventive step, but nonetheless rejected the {{application for a}} patent since the claimed subject matter was not <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> under UK patent law.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} Mayo step, the court must {{determine}} whether the patent claim under examination contains an abstract idea, such as an algorithm, method of computation, or other general principle.

25|$|Under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents {{should be}} {{available}} in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. Nevertheless, there are variations on what is <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> from country to country, even among WTO member states. TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years.|$|E

2500|$|Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2347 [...] (2014), was a 2014 {{decision}} of the United States Supreme Court about <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> (patent eligibility). The issue in the case was whether certain claims about a computer-implemented, electronic escrow service for facilitating financial transactions covered abstract ideas ineligible for patent protection. The patents were held to be invalid because the claims were drawn to an abstract idea, and implementing those claims on a computer {{was not enough to}} transform that idea into [...] <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{case went}} to the Federal Circuit on an {{interlocutory}} appeal of the denial of summary judgment. The only issue on appeal from the district court was whether seeds and plants grown from seeds of sexually reproduced plants are <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> {{within the scope of}} 35 U.S.C.§101—i.e., are patent eligible. There was no other issue, such as whether J.E.M.'s conduct (selling seeds) was patent infringement under 35 U.S.C.§271(a) or whether resale of purchased seed in defiance of a label license prohibiting resale was shielded from infringement liability by the exhaustion doctrine or whether growing crops from the seed constituted [...] "making" [...] under that statute. Nonetheless, J.E.M. argued [...] "that the specifications of Pioneer's patents are not enabling; they criticize the written description and the utility of the deposits, and generally challenge validity." [...] The Federal Circuit responded, [...] "These issues were not decided by the district court, and are not before us." [...] Addressing the only issue properly before it, the court held [...] seeds and plants grown from seeds of sexually reproduced plants are <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> within the scope of 35 U.S.C.§101.|$|E
2500|$|J.E.M. {{responded that}} Pioneer’s patents that purport to confer {{protection}} for corn plants are invalid because sexually reproducing plants are not <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> {{within the scope}} of 35 U.S.C. § 101 [...] J.E.M. maintained that the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA) (and perhaps also the Plant Patent Act of 1930 (PPA)) and set forth the exclusive statutory means for the protection of complex plant life. J.E.M. argued that these statutes are more specific than § 101, and thus carve out subject matter from § 101 for special treatment. J.E.M. said that awarding utility patents for plants upsets the scheme of protection contemplated by Congress. Part of that scheme is that the PVPA provides exemptions for farmers to save seed from their crops for planting subsequent crops. Utility patents do not contain such exemptions.|$|E

Nevertheless, the student eventually must be taught to interact with the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> independent of teacher involvement if the student is to maintain effective contact with the <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> beyond the period of formal instruction...|$|R

2500|$|In most jurisdictions, {{there are}} ways for third parties to {{challenge}} the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called opposition proceedings. [...] It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries {{to prove that the}} patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> at all; [...] the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to experts in the field, at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc. [...] Patents can be found to be invalid {{in whole or in part}} for any of these reasons.|$|E
2500|$|In short, such patents, {{although}} frequently {{dressed up}} in the argot of invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to perform some of those steps. The principal flaw in these patents {{is that they do}} not contain an “inventive concept” that solves practical problems and ensures that the patent is directed to something “significantly more than” the ineligible abstract idea itself. See CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. at 2355, 2357; Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1294. As such, they represent little more than functional descriptions of objectives, rather than inventive solutions. In addition, because they describe the claimed methods in functional terms, they preempt any subsequent specific solutions to the problem at issue. See CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. at 2354; Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1301-02. It is for those reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming “abstract ideas” and has held that they are not directed to <b>patentable</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E
