5|$|As the <b>project</b> <b>name</b> suggests, {{the mobile}} robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team included director Takumi Nakazawa, {{scenario writer}} Kotaro Uchikoshi, music composers Takeshi Abo and Chiyomaru Shikura, and character designer Hidari. The game was originally {{planned to be}} titled Parasite and be unrelated to the Infinity series, but when production started it was given the <b>project</b> <b>name</b> Project Infinity 3. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi had creative differences regarding the game's ending, each having their own idea for how the game should end; because of this and time constraints, the ending was left in an unfinished state, with the development team planning to develop a sequel that would conclude the game's story. The game was positively received by reviewers at Famitsu and RPGFan, with the former complimenting the game system and plot, and the latter liking the character design and music.|$|E

25|$|SA-15 is the <b>project</b> <b>name</b> for {{a series}} of icebreaking {{multipurpose}} cargo ships built in Finland for the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The ships, capable of independent operation in all prevailing arctic ice conditions, were the first merchant vessels designed for year-round operations in the Northern Sea Route. For this purpose they have hulls that resemble those of polar icebreakers and propulsion systems capable of withstanding ice loads.|$|E
25|$|In {{open source}} {{software}} development, it's also common for projects {{to create their own}} licence under their own <b>project</b> <b>name,</b> but for the details of this licence to be a boilerplate copy from a well-known licence, or even a reference to this licence. A REL should support this, providing a means for licences to be defined by sub-classing existing licences and possibly changing their behaviour. Many of these licences are little more than vanity licences, although other dependent projects must still be able to work with them.|$|E

Phase I testing, conducted between August 24 and November 11, 1981, identified design deficiencies in the airframe and determined that the Credible Sport configuration did not have the safety margins necessary for peacetime operations. Phase II testing began June 15, 1982, continued through October 1982, and determined that the final Combat Talon II configuration, with significant improvements in design, avionics, and equipment, was ready for production.|$|E
25|$|Development of the Virtual Boy lasted four years, {{and began}} {{originally}} under the <b>project</b> <b>name</b> of VR32. Nintendo entered a licensing agreement to utilize a 3D LED eyepiece technology originally developed by U.S.-based company Reflection Technology. It also built {{a factory in}} China to be used exclusively for Virtual Boy manufacturing. Over the course of development, the console technology was down-scaled due to high costs and potential health concerns. Furthermore, an increasing amount of company resources were being reallocated to Nintendo 64 development. Lead Nintendo game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, had little involvement with the Virtual Boy software. The console was pushed to market in an unfinished state in 1995 to focus on Nintendo 64 development.|$|E
25|$|The Anzac class (also {{identified}} as the ANZAC class and the MEKO 200 ANZ type) is a ship class of ten frigates; eight operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and two operated by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). During the 1980s, the RAN began plans to replace the River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate, and settled {{on the idea of}} modifying a proven foreign design for Australian conditions. Around the same time, the RNZN was seeking to replace their Leander-class frigates while maintaining blue-water capabilities. A souring of relations between New Zealand and the United States of America in relation to New Zealand's nuclear-free zone and the ANZUS security treaty prompted New Zealand to seek improved ties with other nations, particularly Australia. As both nations were seeking warships of similar capabilities, the decision was made in 1987 to collaborate on their acquisition. The <b>project</b> <b>name</b> (and later, the class name) is taken from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of the First World War.|$|E

[...] The SE047 was an early development of the Alfa Romeo SE 048SP project in 1988. [...] The SE047's engine was ultimately not utilized in the later stages of the SE 048SP development.|$|E
500|$|The Gottlieb {{staff had}} {{difficulty}} naming the game. Aside from the <b>project</b> <b>name</b> [...] "Cubes", it was untitled {{for most of}} the development process. The staff agreed the game should be named after the main character, but disagreed on the name. Lee's title for the initial concept—Snots And Boogers—was rejected, as was a list of suggestions compiled from company employees. According to Davis, vice president of marketing Howie Rubin championed [...] as the title. Although staff members argued it was silly and would be impossible to pronounce, a few early test models were produced with [...] as the title on the units' artwork. During a meeting, [...] "Hubert" [...] was suggested, and a staff member thought of combining [...] "Cubes" [...] and [...] "Hubert" [...] into [...] "Cubert". Art director Richard Tracy changed the name to [...] "Q-bert", and the hyphen was later changed to an asterisk. In retrospect, Davis expressed regret for the asterisk, because he felt it prevented the name from becoming a common crossword term and it is a wildcard character for search engines.|$|E
