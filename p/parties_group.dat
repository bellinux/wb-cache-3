40|$|In {{parliamentary}} systems, why do <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> of {{the government}} camp initiate their own bills instead of going through the cabinet? This article suggests that such governing <b>party</b> <b>group</b> bills occur for three reasons: (a) cabinets hand out bills to the parties on the floor; (b) <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> or MPs want to signal to constituencies; or (c) parties on the floor are dissatisfied with cabinet policy making. Arguing that the absolute and relative importance of these explanations varies with institutional context, country-specific hypotheses {{with regard to the}} number of governing <b>party</b> <b>group</b> bills in Germany are tested. As expected, mechanisms (a) and (c) are especially important in explaining the occurrence of governing <b>party</b> <b>group</b> legislation in Germany...|$|R
40|$|Engaging in {{a genuine}} {{dialogue}} with stakeholders {{seems to be}} a pressing issue that corporate communicators are facing in implementing their CSR initiatives (Hess, 2008; Kaptein & van Tulder, 2003; O'Rordan & Fairbrass, 2008). However, communication features of stakeholder dialogue have yet been empirically delineated. Based on a qualitative case study of CSR initiatives by a sugar cane processing conglomerate in Thailand directed towards the sugar cane farmers as their beneficiary stakeholders, this paper attempts to characterize the lack of stakeholder dialogue from both <b>parties.</b> <b>Group</b> interviews with managers and in-depth interviews with farmers were conducted separately to identify their different perceptions, concerns, and the expected nature of dialogue. Findings from the study highlight the needs for participatory feature of CSR dialogue (Maclagan, 1999) as well as the perceived power imbalance that may exist in implementing CSR initiatives. Implications are also provided for corporate communicators to engage in genuine dialogue with their stakeholders...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} fitness of {{political}} parties for the democratisation of the European Union. At the national level political parties have successfully functioned as transmission belts between voter’s preferences and political outcomes in representative democracies. Some scholars have therefore argued that an increase in party competition at the European level could make the European Union more democratic; other scholars claim that European political parties are too weak to fend off public pressure, which would arise from an increase in political competition. Since cohesive voting behaviour {{of political parties}} is the basic prerequisite for a functioning representative democracy, this study analyses how the transnational <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> of the European Parliament are able to generate voting cohesion. Drawing on rational institutionalist theories of political parties and theories of collective action, the study outlines two competitive scenarios for explaining <b>party</b> <b>group</b> voting cohesion in the European Parliament. In the <b>party</b> <b>group</b> disciplinary scenario, the <b>party</b> <b>group</b> leadership is able to enforce voting cohesion through its disciplinary powers. The national party discipline scenario predicts that <b>party</b> <b>group</b> voting cohesion {{is dependent on the}} voluntary cooperation of the national party delegations. The empirical analysis of party disciplinary effects in the European Parliament corroborates the <b>party</b> <b>group</b> disciplinary scenario. The <b>party</b> <b>group</b> leadership of the two largest <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> is able to discipline it is members for disloyal voting behaviour. The findings do, however, also show that the <b>party</b> <b>group</b> leadership is not able to sanction national party delegations if they fail to toe the <b>party</b> <b>group</b> line. The study concludes that it will be difficult for the <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> to maintain voting cohesion, if public pressure on Members of the European Parliament increases through a more open form of political contestation at the European level. The responsibility for a successful democratisation of the European Union through party competition, therefore, lies in the hands of national political parties...|$|R

40|$|When {{it comes}} to voting in parliament, <b>party</b> <b>group</b> unity is the rule rather than the {{exception}} in most (European) parliamentary democracies.

This book introduces a theoretical model of MP decision making in which the main decision-making mechanisms, derived from the existing literature on the pathways to <b>party</b> <b>group</b> unity – cue-taking, agreement, loyalty and obedience –, are placed in a particular sequential order. The three empirical studies in this book assess the relative role of each of the mechanisms, both independent and when possible {{as a part of the}} sequential model, in getting MPs to toe the <b>party</b> <b>group</b> line and contribute to <b>party</b> <b>group</b> unity, and explore whether this varies not only between parliaments (chapter 4), but also by levels of government (chapter 5), and through time (chapter 6) ...|$|R

Our analysis suggests that Swiss parties have professionalized {{over the course of the}} last thirty years, and we demonstrate that this change has resulted from the ideological polarization in the Swiss political landscape, and conscious effort on the part of Swiss <b>party</b> <b>group</b> leaders. Thus, we contribute to the on-going debate about party change and the question of what drives the development of parties. The development of the Swiss parties is documented using data from three parliamentary surveys from the last thirty years, and two interview rounds with <b>party</b> <b>group</b> leaders, their staff and political experts...|$|R

40|$|The paper models the {{consequences}} of committee report allocation for political representation in the European Parliament. Both inter- and intra <b>party</b> <b>group</b> dynamics determine an individual legislator's ability to write reports on issues that are salient to his national <b>party.</b> First, <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> compete for salient reports {{on the basis of}} their delegation size. As a consequence, MEPs from smaller <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> are more constrained in their ability to represent the preferences of their national parties than their peers in the larger <b>party</b> <b>groups.</b> Second, the <b>party</b> <b>group</b> leadership distributes these reports among its MEPs in an attempt to maximize the cohesion of the group and the coherence of its policies. MEPs from larger national delegations, committee chairs and legislators whose policy preferences deviate from the rest of the group are allocated less salient reports than their fellow party members. The model is tested on data from the fifth European Parliament (1999 - 2001). The results confirm the importance of political representation in conditioning the legislative behaviour of MEPs. In policy areas governed by the co-decision procedure, the EP has evolved into a "normal " Parliament featuring intense competition along a left-right cleavage across <b>party</b> <b>groups</b> and a hierarchical allocation of legislative spoils within parties. In policy areas where the EP has less decision-making power, consensual politics characterised by a proportional distribution of legislative spoils prevail. ...|$|R
