25|$|Unlike {{the first}} regiment, {{the second was}} {{distinguished}} by the shako which all the modern works indicate to have been cylindrical, and was decorated by a surmounted rosette of a ganse cord and of a half-spherical <b>pompom.</b> The cord was tied in front of and behind the neck for the officers, the troopers carrying it in the usual way. The shako issued to the regiment is therefore same as that worn by the hussars at the time. The spherical <b>pompom</b> was the colour of the squadron.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a strong}} and well {{developed}} neck and forequarters, but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The rump is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting {{a firm grip on}} it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and very flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being [...] long, and resembles a <b>pompom</b> in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45–0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.|$|E
50|$|The broad-brimmed, {{whitewashed}} {{straw hat}} bears 14 prominent, woollen, <b>pompoms</b> arranged {{in the shape}} of a cross. Only eleven <b>pompoms</b> are visible, however, because three are covered by those on top. Unmarried women wear red <b>pompoms,</b> married women wear black, old women and widows wear only the mob cap. The Bollenhut can weigh up to two kilogrammes and is manufactured by female milliners. The red Bollenhut may first be worn by girls at their confirmation.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Celestial breed, described above, {{is still}} bred and exported by Chinese and Japanese breeders and is commercially available to fanciers, {{though they are}} not as commonly stocked by aquarium shops and dealers as some other goldfish varieties. It is this 240+ year old form that is described in the American standard adopted by the American Goldfish Association and the Goldfish Society of America. British fanciers prefer their Celestials to have deeper bodies and shorter fins, and have selectively bred for these features as required by the British standard. In recent decades, the Chinese have crossed Celestials with several other breeds, most commonly Lionheads, Ranchus and Hana fusas (<b>Pompoms),</b> producing much larger fish with short ranchu-like fins and very deep, blocky bodies, often with narial 'bouquets' (<b>pompoms)</b> and rudimentary headgrowths.|$|R
2500|$|The Adventures of Shuggy was {{developed}} by programmer David Johnston who had previously developed Xbox Live Indie Games titles such as A Bomb’s Way, The Tower: A Bomb’s Climb and Timeslip. Johnston wrote the game code and designed all the game's levels. <b>PomPom</b> Games provided assistance with Xbox-specific elements such as Xbox Live support. He felt that his [...] "artistic skills are {{on a par with}} a goldfish" [...] and so worked with Chris Hildenbrand of Imbri Design for all the gameplay art assets. Bennet Aldous, an artist at Fat Cat Comics and friend of Johnston created the game's comic book cutscenes. Shuggys music was composed by Jesse Hopkins.|$|E
60|$|The Boer guns {{had opened}} fire, and {{considerable}} {{bodies of the}} enemy appeared upon the flanks and in front. Their first efforts were devoted towards getting possession of the farmhouse, which would give them a point d'appui from which they could turn the whole line. Some five hundred of them charged on horseback, but were met by a very steady fire from the Artillery Rifles, while the guns raked them with shrapnel. They reached a point within five hundred yards of the building, but the fire was too hot, and they wheeled round in rapid retreat. Dismounting in a mealie-patch they skirmished up towards the farmhouse once more, but they were again checked by the fire of the defenders and by a <b>pompom</b> which Colonel Keir had brought up. No progress whatever {{was made by the}} attack in this quarter.|$|E
6000|$|I {{must confess}} that my imagination, in spite even of spurring, refuses {{to see any}} sort of {{submarine}} doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea. It must involve physical inconvenience of the most demoralizing sort simply to be in one {{for any length of}} time. A first-rate man who has been breathing carbonic acid and oil vapour under a pressure of four atmospheres becomes presently a second-rate man. Imagine yourself in a submarine that has ventured a few miles out of port, imagine that you have headache and nausea, and that some ship of the Cobra type is flashing itself and its search-lights about whenever you come up to the surface, and promptly tearing down on your descending bubbles with a ram, trailing perhaps a tail of grapples or a net as well. Even if you get their boat, these nicely aerated men you are fighting know they have a four to one chance of living; while for your submarine to be [...] "got" [...] is certain death. You may, of course, throw out a torpedo or so, with as much chance of hitting vitally as you would have if you were blindfolded, turned round three times, and told to fire revolver-shots at a charging elephant. The possibility of sweeping for a submarine with a seine would be vividly present in the minds of a submarine crew. If you are near shore you will probably be near rocks--an unpleasant complication in a hurried dive. There would, probably, very soon be boats out too, seeking with a machine-gun or <b>pompom</b> for a chance at your occasionally emergent conning-tower. In no way can a submarine be more than purblind, it will be, in fact, practically blind. Given a derelict ironclad on a still night within sight of land, a carefully handled submarine might succeed in groping its way to it and destroying it; but then it would be much better to attack such a vessel and capture it boldly with a few desperate men on a tug. At the utmost the submarine will be used in narrow waters, in rivers, or to fluster or destroy ships in harbour or with poor-spirited crews--that is to say, it will simply be an added {{power in the hands of}} the nation that is predominant at sea. And, even then, it can be merely destructive, while a sane and high-spirited fighter will always be dissatisfied if, with an indisputable superiority of force, he fails to take.[42] ...|$|E

Officers are depicted as wearing taller, higher-heeled three-quarter shoes or short boots. The troops refused to carry British knapsacks, only haversacks.|$|R
50|$|Some units added pompons to the shako {{as well as}} plumes. Many units had <b>pompoms</b> with a houpette and {{the center}} {{generally}} colored white with the company number printed in black or red. The diamond shaped plate with the regimental was most common, but some units had {{the shape of an}} eagle or the rising sun.|$|R
50|$|From February 1812, the coatee {{remained}} the same colour while plumes were no longer issued for helmets. Instead, <b>pompoms</b> coloured red, sky blue, orange, and violet were issued for the first company of each squadron. These same colors {{were used for the}} white centre of the second companies. They were armed with a Dragoon musket with a bayonet and a sword.|$|R
6000|$|So {{we stayed}} side by side, the ropes in our hand, {{a very long}} while, for we could not shape any words. Then I heard Sikandar Khan open his water- bottle and drink; and when his mouth was slaked he passed to me and said, [...] "We are absolved from our vow." [...] So I drank, and {{together}} we waited for the dawn in that place where we stood--the ropes in our hand. A little after third cockcrow we heard the feet of horses and gun wheels very far off, and so soon as the light came a shell burst {{on the threshold of}} the house, and the roof of the verandah that was thatched fell in and blazed before the windows. And I said, [...] "What of the wounded Boer-log within?" [...] And Sikandar Khan said, [...] "We have heard the order. It is a Sahibs' war. Stand still." [...] Then came a second shell--good line, but short--and scattered dust upon us where we stood; and then came ten of the little quick shells from the gun that speaks like a stammerer--yes, <b>pompom</b> the Sahibs call it--and the face of the house folded down like the nose and the chin of an old man mumbling, and the forefront of the house lay down. Then Sikandar Khan said, [...] "If it be the fate of the wounded to die in the fire, I shall not prevent it." [...] And he passed {{to the back of the}} house and presently came back, and four wounded Boer-log came after him, of whom two could not walk upright. And I said, [...] "What hast thou done?" [...] And he said, [...] "I have neither spoken to them nor laid hand on them. They follow in hope of mercy." [...] And I said, [...] "It is a Sahibs' war. Let them wait the Sahibs' mercy." [...] So they lay still, the four men and the idiot, and the fat woman under the thorn-tree, and the house burned furiously. Then began the known sound of cartouches in the roof--one or two at first; then a trill, and last of all one loud noise and the thatch blew here and there, and the captives would have crawled aside on account of the heat that was withering the thorn-trees, and on account of wood and bricks flying at random. But I said, [...] "Abide! Abide! Ye be Sahibs, and this is a Sahibs' war, O Sahibs. There is no order that ye should depart from this war." [...] They did not understand my words. Yet they abode and they lived.|$|E
