5|$|Reviewers {{appreciated}} the PS2 version for including the asked-for save feature, but complained the ported game retained the AI and level design {{issues associated with}} the Windows version. IGN remarked that it looked less impressive than the computer versions. The lower resolution, flat textures, washed out colors, and sparser environments made the game average looking. The PS2 version also exhibited clipping issues; character models and projectiles would pass through objects on occasion. The game reviewer, however, praised the console version for <b>presenting</b> <b>a</b> smooth animation, rarely dropping frames. On the contrary, other reviewers stated the frame rate dropped when there are several objects on the screen, <b>presenting</b> <b>a</b> heavy load on the graphics engine. The lack of replay value for the console version after completing the single player mode was a common complaint among the reviewers.|$|E
