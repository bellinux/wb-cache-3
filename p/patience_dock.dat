5000|$|Rumex patientia, {{known as}} <b>patience</b> <b>dock,</b> [...] "garden patience", [...] "herb patience", or [...] "monk's rhubarb", is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant {{species of the}} genus Rumex, belonging to the family Polygonaceae. In spring it is often consumed as a leaf vegetable in Southern Europe, especially in Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia and Serbia. It is also used in Romania in spring broths.|$|E
50|$|He {{realised}} at {{an early}} age the need to specialise and chose docks (Rumex), a neglected group, which was to gain him an international reputation. He published two papers in 1939 and 1944 that settled the differences between <b>Patience</b> <b>Dock</b> (Rumex patientia) and Rumex cristatus and found aliens such as Rumex confertus hybridizing with native species. He named Rumex wrightii (R conglomeratus x R frutescens and R cuneifolius), as new to science. Up until the Second World War he gained his knowledge of the British flora by travelling to every part of the British Isles collecting what was to be the largest private herbarium in the British Isles. He first visited the Isles of Scilly in September 1936 and added Western Ramping-fumitory (Fumaria occidentalis) to the flora. He returned {{over the next four years}} covering every month from March to September and recording many additional species. The first manuscript of the flora was completed in 1941 and the work was finally published in 1971.|$|E
