5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a <b>palette</b> <b>knife</b> in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
2500|$|However, most of {{her work}} was now {{landscape}} painting in oil on canvas (sometimes, however, with <b>palette</b> <b>knife</b> or on wood), and she particularly loved Ashdown Forest, which she painted over and over again.

2500|$|Further, it {{is unknown}} if the {{painting}} was completed in the studio or en plein air.

5000|$|His {{approach}} was experiential {{in terms of}} his involvement with the formal aspects of painting; brushwork, composition, and color. The artist's process creates a lush [...] "skin" [...] of paint using a combination of brush and most often a [...] "spatula," [...] a <b>palette</b> <b>knife,</b> {{in the spirit of the}} vigorous <b>palette</b> <b>knife</b> technique adopted by the master realist, Gustave Courbet.|$|E
50|$|Hopkinson {{was known}} to travel into the dense bush and forests in the Haliburton area and paint en plein air oil {{paintings}} on panels using <b>palette</b> <b>knives,</b> laying on thick layers of oil paint.

50|$|Luczak's {{travels in}} Europe {{in the early}} 1960s, led to a radical change in his style. Instead of using brushes and <b>palette</b> <b>knives,</b> he started to paint with {{his hands on the}} canvas. Initially the {{subjects}} still were figurative compositions but {{from the middle of the}} decade he created surrealistic, expressive images of dramatic landscapes, populated by fantasy figures, fish and animals. The paintings were large, performed in a personal impasto technique and often in darkish colour tones.|$|R

50|$|Enoch Mukiibi {{was born}} in Kampala in 1975 {{and is one of}} nine siblings. His talent as an artist has earned him {{recognition}} both in Uganda and abroad. For example, Aidchild, a charity organisation founded by Nathaniel Dunigan that cares for orphans with HIV/AIDS, named Enoch as their Artist of the Year in 2005 and 2007. Enoch is a free-style painter who uses oils, acrylics, and watercolours. He paints with brushes, <b>palette</b> <b>knives,</b> and his bare fingers in order to create vibrant, thick-layered strokes.His paintings include semi-abstract depictions of children, mothers, clothes, and animals.|$|R

[...] Hall uses a variety of treatments and electronic effects pedals to further process his guitar output, and sometimes incorporates radio broadcasts into his ensemble sound.|$|R

Waugh also wrote a series of instructional books, including two on painting with <b>palette</b> <b>knives,</b> {{and he was the}} editor during the 1940s and 1950s of the textbooks used in the home study course of Art Instruction, Inc. His other books include Space Answer Book (1972) and Fish and Underwater Life.|$|R
5000|$|In 1866-67, {{inspired}} by the example of Courbet, Cézanne painted a series of paintings with a <b>palette</b> <b>knife.</b> He later called these works, mostly portraits, une couillarde ("a coarse word for ostentatious virility"). Lawrence Gowing has written that Cézanne's <b>palette</b> <b>knife</b> phase [...] "was not only the invention of modern expressionism, although it was incidentally that; the idea of art as emotional ejaculation made its first appearance at this moment".|$|E

50|$|Peculiar {{feature of}} the painter's art is an {{experiment}} with composition, colour, technique. Victor ORLY has worked out his own style {{which is based on}} a combination of classical, symbolic and impressionistic painting elements. The artist practices oil painting and uses <b>palette</b> <b>knife</b> technique. Original compositional findings, rich colour palette, vague details are characteristic of his art. His brush strokes are broad and energetic, often massive, always loose, sometimes translucent, and full of emotions and feelings. In China Victor ORLY is compared to kung fu master Li Xunhuan for his work with a <b>palette</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fries unleashes {{a cacophony}} of color and texture onto each hard white field (wood panel primed with six or seven layers) to create her sophisticated, {{energetic}} paintings. A rigid surface {{is required for the}} processes she enacts; she was trained as a sculptor before shifting to this fluid, flatter medium, so her tools are important, and range from traditional choices such as <b>palette</b> <b>knives,</b> spatulas, and brushes to objects foreign to the studio including syringes, industrial objects, application objects she makes herself. This gives her myriad methods to manipulate the pure oil paint that is sometimes thickened with resin, sometimes thinned with medium, sometimes flatly silk-screened onto the face.|$|R
50|$|Alongside Lyrical Abstract {{painters}} in France, the Automatistes favoured a fluid, painterly technique {{over the}} comparatively reserved, hard-edge abstraction so {{popular in the}} U.S. and Eastern Europe at the time. Much like a nonfigurative Group of Seven, they were looking to create a distinctively Canadian artistic identity. Heavily influenced by Surrealist manifestos and poetry, their work was largely stream-of-consciousness inspired, believing {{this to be a}} truer means of communicating subconscious emotions and sensory experiences; they wanted to be liberated from intention, reason, and any kind of structure, in order to communicate a universal human experience without bias. This resulted in increasingly crude or intuitive methods such as applying paint with <b>palette</b> <b>knives</b> and fingers and painting blindfolded, their efforts contradicting their claims of working without intention.|$|R
50|$|In the studio, {{using his}} own made-up pigments, he mimics {{the cycle of}} growth and decay by working with matter in a very direct and {{hands-on}} way. He applies colours, deep pools of it, red brick, reds, molten silver and zinc, platinum and titanium, sulphuric yellows and {{so much more to}} dozens of paintings in various states of becoming. He paints standing up, applying a new layer of paint (finished paintings will comprise fifty to one hundred or more layers of paint applied {{over a period of several}} years and when completed can take up to five months to dry out). His preferred tools are <b>palette</b> <b>knives</b> (one in each hand is the norm), and a decorator's brush which he holds vertically using a stippling technique.|$|R
