They also utilize various membranophone drums (with a conical shape and only one drumhead, played with the palms of the hands) called bocúes. The drums are complemented by three <b>percuted</b> metallic idiophones (made from discarded wheel rims), which are selected considering its sonority.|$|R

2500|$|After the war, when Australia's {{military}} was re-organised {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF units in 1921, the battalion was reformed as a part-time unit of the Citizens Force, based in the New England region, assigned to the 1st Brigade. This was achieved by transferring personnel from two previously existing units: the 2nd Battalion, 33rd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment.

From the outset, the Citizen Forces units were maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service; however, in 1929, the Universal Training Scheme was abolished by the Scullin Labor government and replaced with an all volunteer force known as the [...] "Militia". This, coupled with the austerity of the Great Depression, resulted in a decline of volunteers and, as a result, the 33rd Battalion was amalgamated with the 35th Battalion to form the 35th/33rd Battalion. In 1933, the 35th/33rd was split and the 33rd joined with the 41st Battalion to form the 33rd/41st Battalion. They remained linked until October 1936, when the 33rd Battalion was reformed in its own right as part of an expansion of Australia's military force as tensions rose in Europe, raising concerns of a future war.|$|E

5000|$|In 1581 Richard Mulcaster is {{the first}} {{describe}} [...] "foteball" [...] teams consisting of players using different positions ("standings"), although passing is not stated explicitly. The first specific reference to player to player passing ("dealing")in football-like ball of Cornish hurling. [...] There are two other early allusions to passing the ball, but in each {{it is more likely}} that the ball is being kicked between members of opposing teams. David Wedderburn in 1633 suggests that his students might want to use the Latin words literally meaning [...] "strike (<b>percute)</b> it here" [...] and [...] "strike it again (or back)". Similarly, in 1650 English puritan Richard Baxter in his book Everlasting Rest: [...] "like a Football in the midst of a crowd of Boys, tost about in contention from one to another". [...] This is also alluded to in a poem of c1624 by Edmund Waller referring to a football team working together towards [...] "victory": [...] "a sort company of lusty shepherds try their force at football, care of victory... They ply their feet, and still the restless ball, Toss'd to and fro, is urged by them all." [...] The last line suggests that playing as a team emerged much earlier in English football than previously thought.|$|E

40|$|The {{patients}} with a wide variation of clinical course and subsequent cardiac events risks are classified within acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In order to select an appropriate therapeutic approach, {{there is a need}} for precise diagnostics and risk evaluation of future cardiac events, so evaluation should be done early, based on available clinical electrocardiographic and sensitive and specific biomarkers. The aim of the paper was to evaluate cardiac markers values in diagnostics of ACS, especially in the group UAP/NSTEMI, interconnections of ECG markers and cardiac troponin levels as well as their prognostic value. In the examined population there were 333 patients involved. The total follow-up period was three months. Health control check-ups were performed in the 1 st and 3 rd month since discharge and they involved clinical examination, ECG, establisment of the course of the illness regarding recurrent angina, reinfarction revascularisation or <b>percute</b> interventions, as well as the results. Laboratory analysis involved troponin T and I (TnT, TnI), myoglobin, CK-MB and CK-MB mass. Most of the examined patients belonged to the group NSTEMI, that is 50 %. Total number of male patients was 251 or 2 / 3, female patients 106 or 1 / 3. Mean age in male patients was 61, 86 ± 11, 02 years, and in female patients 64, 19 ± 10, 14 years. Although women were older about 2, 33 years, that difference was not statistically significant (p> 0, 05). Frequency and severity analysis of ST depression showed that most of the patients had ST depression (1 mm and 2 mm, each 21 %), while in the subgroups depression was 3 and 4 mm, which was present in 10 %, and 5 mm in 2, 63 %. There is a significant correlation between ST depression and positive TnT findings. In all the subgroups of {{patients with}} ST depression there was high, statistically significant, troponin level. About 40 % of patients with T wave is TnT positive, and in Tnl that relation is more expressed and is up to 50 % positive. Out of 220 patients with UAP/NSTEMI without Q-wave on admission, 18 or 8, 18 % patients developed Q-wave during hospitalisation. In 10 (13, 51 %) patients presented on admission as NSTEMI, new Q-wave was developed in TnI positive, while in the troponin negative group there were no Q-waves, what is statistically significant. High sensitivity and specificity of troponin for diagnosing acute coronary syndrome, as well as their correlation with the rate of ST depression, changes in T wave and occurrence of new Q-wave was proved. In our research troponin values were especially valuable in making the diagnosis of NSTEMI and in risk stratification...|$|E
