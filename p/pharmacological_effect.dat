25|$|Transplatin, the trans {{stereoisomer}} of cisplatin, has formula trans- {{and does}} not exhibit a comparably useful <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effect.</b> Two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the reduced anticancer effect of transplatin. Firstly, the trans arrangement of the chloro ligands is thought to confer transplatin with greater chemical reactivity, causing transplatin to become deactivated before it reaches the DNA where transplatin exerts its pharmacological action. Secondly, the stereo-conformation of transplatin is such that it is unable to form the characteristic 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) adducts formed by cisplatin in abundance.|$|E

40|$|Bryophyllum calycinum {{belongs to}} the family {{crassulaceae}} was widely used in traditional medicine especially in the tropical areas. The plant contained alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, glycosides, bufadienolides, saponins, coumarins, sitosterols, quinines, carotenoids, tocopherol and lectins. The previous pharmacological studies showed that it exerted many <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects</b> including anticancer, antioxidant immunomodulating, antibacterial, anthelmentic, antiprotozoal, neurologica (sedative and anticonvulsant), anti-inflammatory, analgesic, diuresis, antiurolithitic, nephroprotective, hepatoprotective, anti-peptic ulcer, hypotensive, antidiabetic, wound healing and other <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects.</b> The present review was designed to highlight the chemical constituents and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects</b> of Bryophyllum calycinum...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{speculative}} mechanisms have been advanced to counter this, {{the most widely}} discussed being water memory, though this is now considered erroneous since short-range order in water only persists for about 1 picosecond. No evidence of stable clusters of water molecules was found when homeopathic preparations were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance, and many other physical experiments in homeopathy {{have been found to}} be of low methodological quality, which precludes any meaningful conclusion. Existence of a <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effect</b> in the absence of any true active ingredient is inconsistent with the law of mass action and the observed dose-response relationships characteristic of therapeutic drugs (whereas placebo effects are non-specific and unrelated to pharmacological activity).|$|E
25|$|The {{bitter taste}} is almost universally {{unpleasant}} to humans. This is because many nitrogenous organic molecules {{which have a}} <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effect</b> on humans taste bitter. These include caffeine, nicotine, and strychnine, which respectively compose the stimulant in coffee, addictive agent in cigarettes, and active compound in many pesticides. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. It is also {{interesting to note that}} many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter taste is a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is a {{phenanthrene}} {{opioid receptor}} agonist– its main effect is binding to and activating the μ-opioid receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. Its intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the assay and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a full agonist while in others {{it can be a}} partial agonist or even antagonist. In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effect</b> on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the μ-opioid receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical dependence, and respiratory depression. Morphine is also a κ-opioid and δ-opioid receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, miosis (pinpoint pupils) and psychotomimetic effects. δ-Opioid is thought {{to play a role in}} analgesia. Although morphine does not bind to the σ-receptor, it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-pentazocine, inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia, suggesting downstream involvement of the σ-receptor in the actions of morphine.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} review the {{different}} <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects</b> of garlic. Garlic, Allium sativum, is a herbal plant which {{has been used in}} different food preparations since long time. Many studies have shown that allicin is the main compound in garlic which is generated from alliin with the help of alliinase enzyme and is responsible for many <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects.</b> Different studies have shown that garlic has <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects</b> such as antihypertensive, antihypercholesterolaemic, antiplatelet, hypoglycaemic, cardioprotective, antimicrobial, antineoplastic, etc. However, studies in the literature have some confl icting fi ndings and meta-analyses are also slightly different for different effects. Despite these fi ndings, most of the studies, including meta-analyses, have shown signifi cant antihypertensive and hypolipidaemic effects of garlic. Based on the data in the literature, regular dietary consumption of raw garlic, two to four grams, equivalent to one clove of garlic, or 600 - 900 mg garlic powder per day, if not contraindicated, may be effective for different benefi cial <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Methylhexanamine is an {{indirect}} sympathomimetic drug that constricts {{blood vessels and}} thus has effects on the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs. It also causes bronchodilation, inhibits peristalsis in the intestines, and has diuretic effects.

500|$|The {{main problem}} of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the {{development}} of tolerance and dependence. Tolerance manifests itself as diminished <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effect</b> and develops relatively quickly to the sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to anti-anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use. In general, tolerance to the amnesic effects does not occur. However, controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy and opposing evidence from a systematic review of the literature that tolerance frequently occurs and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long-term use. The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is, likewise, unclear. Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop, and that, [...] "memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose".|$|E

40|$|Pharmacology is {{the science}} {{underpinning}} dosing, mechanisms {{of action and}} effectiveness of drugs. Central to pharmacology, are the studies of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).

On the other hand, PD describes the relationship between drug concentrations and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effects.</b> In practice, PK is often referred as “ what the body does to the drug ” whilst PD as “ what the drug does to the body ”.

2500|$|Benzodiazepines bind to a {{specific}} benzodiazepine receptor, thereby enhancing {{the effect of the}} neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and causing CNS depression. In overdose situations this <b>pharmacological</b> <b>effect</b> is extended leading to a more severe CNS depression and potentially coma [...] or cardiac arrest. [...] Benzodiazepine-overdose-related coma may be characterised by an alpha pattern with the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation being prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses of benzodiazepines therefore cause prolonged CCT and IPLs.|$|E
