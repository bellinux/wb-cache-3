40|$|The recent {{bankruptcy}} amendments {{made significant}} revisions {{in the law}} of preferences. At {{least one of these}} changes, the elimination of the forty-five day rule from section 547 (c) (2), has the potential of rendering the trustee impotent against creditors who receive <b>preferential</b> <b>loan</b> payments while other creditors go unpaid. If this possibility materializes, the primary policy of bankruptcy preference law, equality of distribution among similarly situated creditors, will be severely undercut. The bankruptcy courts should respond by construing the ordinary course requirement strictly so as to avoid extending its protection to preferential payments of long-term loans and other atypical financings.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate on fiscal consolidation and the questionable effectiveness of the Stability and Growth Pact by addressing the problem of economic governance in the EMU with a game-theoretic principal-agent approach. Following the theory of delegation, we develop a principal-multi agent model where the EMU authorities act as a collective principal that designs contracts for each of two agents that reflect Europe's "South" and "North". We investigate what happens when agents face hidden-information moral hazard problem {{and when they are}} able to coordinate their actions. Bearing in mind the applicability of incentive mechanisms, we discuss the optimal contracts for the principal and each of the agents. We prove that the most efficient solution consists of tailor-made contracts, according to which highly indebted countries must be offered strong incentive mechanisms in the form of substantial penalties but also rewards (e. g., <b>preferential</b> <b>loans).</b> We also stress the importance of taking into account positive spillover effects, which could be facilitated by economic integration and fiscal policy coordination between the EMU Members...|$|R
40|$|While the {{provision}} of subsidized loans through the VBSP forms a cornerstone of Vietnam’s antipoverty policy, little is known {{on the impact of}} these <b>preferential</b> <b>loans.</b> In this paper, we use fixed effect regression to estimate the average effect of the program on income and expenditures of participating households, and subsequently assess the impact of the program on poverty and inequality. Our estimates indicate that the VBSP was quite effective. Participation on average seemed to have increased household income and expenditures by about thirty percent {{of the value of the}} loan, and an increase in loan size would have a similar effect. Despite that only one third of loans reaches households who are actually poor, our computations indicate that the program decreased the head count of poverty for its participants by almost four percentage points. Similarly, the program decreased the poverty gap index and the poverty-severity index by almost twenty percent. The impact on Vietnam’s inequality was significant but small, which is not surprising because of the yet limited outreach of seven percent of the rural population. ...|$|R

A particular high drop in the investment’s efficiency occurred at farms investing the most in machines and equipment. The analysis of correlation {{with the use of the}} methods of regression indicates, that the area of a farm and fixed assets had a crucial impact on the value of investment expenditures in the years 2004 – 2011.

40|$|Renewable energy plays {{significant}} role in achieving energy savings and emissions reduction. As a sustainable and environmental friendly renewable energy source, concentrated solar power (CSP) is of interest for research and development. This is because CSP plants can be equipped with thermal storage systems, thereby producing electricity when sunlight is not available. The installation of CSP plants also leads to substantial &# 039;peak shaving effects&# 039;. However, the cost of CSP generation is an obstacle hampering the commercialization of this emerging industry. This paper constructs a mathematical model of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) to calculate the power generation cost of CSP projects {{on the basis of}} lifetime cost structure analysis. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to examine the impact of different variables on the LCOE of CSP projects. The variables considered in this study are investment cost over the construction period, annual operation and maintenance cost, annual electricity production and the discount rate. Finally, the influence of incentive policies such as <b>preferential</b> <b>loans,</b> tax support and zero land cost for power stations is analyzed. This research offers a new method for power generation cost calculation of CSP projects and provides support for governments to formulate incentive policies for the industry...|$|R
