40|$|Seven of {{the eight}} genes in the avian {{pneumovirus}} (APV) genome contain a conserved 9 nt transcriptional <b>start</b> <b>sequence</b> with the virus large Q polymerase gene differing from the consensus at three positions. The sequence requirements of the APV transcriptional gene <b>start</b> <b>sequence</b> were investigated by generating a series of mutations in which each of the nine conserved bases was mutated {{to each of the}} other three possible nucleoticles in a minigenome containing two reporter genes. The effect of each mutation was assessed by measuring the relative levels of expression from the altered and unaltered gene <b>start</b> <b>sequences.</b> Mutations at positions 2, 7 and 9 significantly reduced transcription levels while alterations to position 5 had little effect. The L gene <b>start</b> <b>sequence</b> directed transcription at levels approximately 50 % below that of the consensus gene <b>start</b> <b>sequence.</b> These data suggest that there are common features in pneumovirus transcriptional control sequences...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at:[URL] code-shift keying (CCSK) is the baseband 32 -ary symbol modulation scheme used by the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS), the communication terminal for Link- 16. CCSK is not orthogonal and an analytic expression for the probability of symbol error for CCSK has thus far been elusive. In this paper, an analytic upper bound on the probability of symbol error of CCSK is derived for the 32 -chip CCSK <b>starting</b> <b>sequence</b> chosen for JTIDS. The analytically obtained probability of symbol error is compared with two different Monte Carlo simulations for additive white Gaussian noise. The results of both simulation match the analytic results very well and show that the analytic method yields a tight upper bound. A new 32 -chip CCSK <b>starting</b> <b>sequence</b> which has a smaller maximum off-peak cross-correlation value than the current JTIDS <b>starting</b> <b>sequence</b> is proposed and evaluated both analytically and by simulation.

40|$|The {{transcriptional}} <b>start</b> <b>sequence</b> {{of pneumonia}} virus of mice is more variable {{than that of}} the other pneumoviruses, with five different nine-base gene <b>start</b> (GS) <b>sequences</b> found in the PVM genome. The sequence requirements of the PVM gene start signal, and the efficiency of transcriptional initiation of the different virus genes, was investigated using a reverse genetics approach with a minigenome construct containing two reporter genes. A series of GS mutants were created, where each of the nine bases of the gene <b>start</b> consensus <b>sequence</b> of a reporter gene was changed to every other possible base, and the resulting effect on initiation of transcription was assayed. Nucleotide positions 1, 2 and 7 were found to be most sensitive to mutation whilst positions 4, 5 and 9 were relatively insensitive. The L gene GS sequence was found to have only 20 % of the activity of the consensus sequence whilst the published M 2 gene <b>start</b> <b>sequence</b> was found to be non-functional.

40|$|Although {{in vitro}} {{selection}} {{technology is a}} versatile experimental tool for discovering novel synthetic RNA molecules, finding complex RNA molecules is difficult because most RNAs identified from random sequence pools are simple motifs, consistent with recent computational analysis of such sequence pools. Thus, enriching in vitro selection pools with complex structures could increase the probability of discovering novel RNAs. Here we develop an approach for engineering sequence pools that links RNA sequence space regions with corresponding structural distributions via a “mixing matrix” approach combined with a graph theory analysis. We define five classes of mixing matrices motivated by covariance mutations in RNA; these constructs define nucleotide transition rates and are applied to chosen <b>starting</b> <b>sequences</b> to yield specific nonrandom pools. We examine the coverage of sequence space {{as a function of}} the mixing matrix and <b>starting</b> <b>sequence</b> via clustering analysis. We show that, in contrast to random sequences, which are associated only with a local region of sequence space, our designed pools, including a structured pool for GTP aptamers, can target specific motifs. It follows that experimental synthesis of designed pools can benefit from using optimized <b>starting</b> <b>sequences,</b> mixing matrices, and pool fractions associated with each of our constructed pools as a guide. Automation of our approach could provide practical tools for pool design applications for in vitro selection of RNAs and related problems...|$|R

Each channel ID can be separately processed in parallel. This obviates the problem of waiting for error correction processing. If that channel number is zero, however, it indicates that the frame of data represents a critical command only. That data is handled in a special way, independent of the software. Otherwise, the processed data further handled using special double buffering techniques to avoid problems from overrun.

The second type of starting is a different one, the engine is not connected with the dynamometer, therefore it results that there is no control of the free turbine speed from the dynamometer, only from the engine but in particular conditions.
