5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual <b>particle</b> <b>interactions</b> except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of <b>particle</b> <b>interactions,</b> develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of <b>particle</b> <b>interactions</b> (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E

5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce <b>particle</b> <b>interactions</b> which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E

25|$|Salam had a {{prolific}} research career in theoretical and high-energy physics. Salam {{had worked on}} theory of the neutrino – an elusive particle that was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli in the 1930s. Salam introduced chiral symmetry {{in the theory of}} neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the theory of electroweak interactions. Salam later passed his work to Riazuddin, who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive Higgs bosons to the theory of the Standard Model, where he later predicted the existence of proton decay. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the vector meson. The paper introduced the interaction of vector meson, photon (vector electrodynamics), and the renormalisation of vector mesons' known mass after the interaction. In 1961, Salam began to work with John Clive Ward on symmetries and electroweak unification. In 1964, Salam and Ward worked on a Gauge theory for the weak and electromagnetic interaction, subsequently obtaining SU(2) × U(1) model. Salam was convinced that all the elementary <b>particle</b> <b>interactions</b> are actually the gauge interactions. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam formulated the mathematical concept of their work. While in Imperial College, Salam, along with Glashow and Jeffrey Goldstone, mathematically proved the Goldstone's theorem, that a massless spin-zero object must appear in a theory as a result of spontaneous breaking of a continuous global symmetry. In 1960, Salam and Weinberg incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's discovery, giving it a modern form in electroweak theory, and thus theorised the Standard Model. In 1968, together with Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow, Salam finally formulated the mathematical concept of their work.In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a hypothetical particle. Salam showed the possible electromagnetic interaction between the Magnetic monopole and the C-violation, thus he formulated the magnetic photon.|$|E

30|$|The {{apparent}} {{decrease in}} adsorption density (amount adsorbed per unit {{mass of the}} adsorbent) with increase in adsorbent dose was due to progressive unsaturation of adsorption sites through the adsorption reaction. Another reason {{might be due to}} the <b>particle</b> <b>interaction,</b> such as aggregation, usually resulting from high adsorbent concentration. Such aggregation would lead to decrease in total surface area of the adsorbent and on increase in the diffusional path length (Shukla et al. 2002). <b>Particle</b> <b>interaction</b> might also desorb some of the adsorbate that was only loosely and reversibly bound to the adsorbent surface.|$|R

500|$|The major unsolved {{problem with}} TypeII supernovae {{is that it}} is not {{understood}} how the burst of neutrinos transfers its energy to the rest of the star producing the shock wave which causes the star to explode. From the above discussion, only one percent of the energy needs to be transferred to produce an explosion, but explaining how that one percent of transfer occurs has proven very difficult, even though the <b>particle</b> <b>interactions</b> involved are believed to be well understood. In the 1990s, one model for doing this involved convective overturn, which suggests that convection, either from neutrinos from below, or infalling matter from above, completes the process of destroying the progenitor star. Heavier elements than iron are formed during this explosion by neutron capture, and from the pressure of the neutrinos pressing into the boundary of the [...] "neutrinosphere", seeding the surrounding space with a cloud of gas and dust which is richer in heavy elements than the material from which the star originally formed.|$|E

2500|$|In many {{particle}} models, such as Kelvin's, {{the range}} of gravity is limited {{due to the nature}} of <b>particle</b> <b>interactions</b> amongst themselves. The range is effectively determined by the rate that the proposed internal modes of the particles can eliminate the momentum defects (shadows) that are created by passing through matter. Such predictions as to the effective range of gravity will vary and are dependent upon the specific aspects and assumptions as to the modes of interactions that are available during <b>particle</b> <b>interactions.</b> [...] However, for this class of models the observed large-scale structure of the cosmos constrains such dispersion to those that will allow for the aggregation of such immense gravitational structures.|$|E
