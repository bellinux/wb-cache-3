40|$|People wish {{to enjoy}} their {{everyday}} lives in various ways, among which entertainment plays a major role. In order to improve lifestyle with more ready access to entertainment content, we propose BlueTorrent, a P 2 P file sharing application based on ubiquitous Bluetooth-enabled devices such as PDAs, cellphones and smart phones. Using BlueTorrent, people can share audio/video contents as they move about shopping malls, airports, subway stations etc. BlueTorrent poses new challenges caused by limited bandwidth, short communications range, mobile users and variable population density. A key ingredient is efficient peer discovery. This paper approaches the problem by analyzing the Bluetooth <b>periodic</b> <b>inquiry</b> mode and by finding the optimum inquiry/connection time settings. At the application layer, the BlueTorrent index/block dissemination protocol is then designed and analyzed. The entire system is integrated and implemented both in simulation and in an experimental testbed. Simulation and measurement results are used to evaluate and validate the performance of BlueTorrent in content sharing scenarios. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{majority}} of Polish smokers declare their will {{to quit smoking}} {{and many of them}} attempt to quit. Although morbidity and mortality from tobacco-related diseases are {{among the highest in the}} world, there is a lack of comprehensive cessation support for smokers. We aimed to investigate how Poles, including the medically ill, cope with quitting cigarettes and what their motivations to quit are. Methods Convenience sampling was used for the purpose of the study. Individuals attending several health care units were screened for a history of quit attempts. Ex-smokers were defined as smoking previously at least one cigarette/day but who have no longer been smoking for at least one month. Attempts at quitting were defined as abstaining from cigarettes for at least one day. Data on socio-demographics, tobacco use, quitting behaviors and reasons to quit from 618 subjects (385 ex- and 233 current smokers) who fulfilled these criteria were collected with the use of a questionnaire. For the comparison of proportions, a chi-square test was used. Results In the entire study population, 77 % of smokers attempted to quit smoking on their own and a similar proportion of smokers (76 %) used the cold turkey method when quitting. Current smokers were more likely than former smokers to use some form of aid (p = 0. 0001), mainly nicotine replacement therapy (68 %). The most important reasons for quitting smoking were: general health concern (57 %), personal health problems (32 %) and social reasons (32 %). However, 41 % of smokers prompted to quitting by personal health problems related to tobacco smoking did not see the link between the two. A small proportion of ex-smokers (3 %) abstaining from cigarettes for longer than a year were not confident about their self-efficacy to sustain abstinence further. Conclusion The {{majority of}} Polish smokers, including patients with tobacco-related diseases, attempt to quit without smoking cessation assistance, thus there is a need for a broader professional help for them. There is also a lack of general information on hazards related to tobacco and further anti-tobacco campaigns in media are needed. Finally, former smokers should be given more attention and <b>periodic</b> <b>inquiries</b> regarding the smoking habit are worthwhile. </p...|$|R
