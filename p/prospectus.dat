5|$|The Royal Mail Case or R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading <b>prospectus</b> {{with the aid of}} the company accountant to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading <b>prospectus</b> and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading <b>prospectus</b> and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government.|$|E
5|$|Kylsart appealed his {{conviction}} on count 3 and was bailed pending the appeal. The appeal was heard in November 1931 where the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling {{that although the}} statements within the <b>prospectus</b> were all true, the document {{as a whole was}} false because of what it concealed, omitted or implied.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} elite boys’ schools in England have {{admitted}} girls for over 30 years, some thereby becoming mixed schools. In other schools, girls remain {{a very small}} minority. This paper focuses upon <b>prospectuses</b> from the latter type of school, arguing that <b>prospectuses</b> are particularly valuable {{as a basis for}} judging schools’ policies and practices in their own terms. The researchers ask questions about the nature of this form of ‘co-education’, particularly as it affects girls’ educational and social opportunities. On balance, the <b>prospectuses</b> paint a picture of boys’ schools which happen to have girls in them rather than of schools whose policies and practices have become genuinely co-educational...|$|R

5|$|In July 1904, The Judd School {{participated in}} the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an {{experimental}} basis. Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teachers Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers' Superannuation Act of 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school <b>prospectus,</b> there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the season, the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, the division's top two {{finishers}} in the previous season, were predicted to be the strongest teams by journalists such as Tom Verducci of ESPN and Joe Sheehan of Baseball <b>Prospectus.</b> However, the Indians lineup was weakened by injuries and spent just 13 days of the season in the division lead, last on May 17. The Tigers never led the AL Central and finished the season in last place, 14 games back.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{contributes}} to intellectual capital (IC) disclosure research. Focussing on reducing the information asymmetry associated with agency theory, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to investigate the extent to which managers and owners disclose IC in initial public offering (IPO) <b>prospectuses.</b> In particular, it examines the influence on post-issue stock performance based on the IPOs of technology companies listing on the NASDAQ from 2002 to 2013. Parallels are drawn to integrated reporting (), which was developed after the global financial crisis (GFC) because of the perceived shortcomings of regulated forms of financial reporting. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a two-stage methodology, using content analysis of <b>prospectuses</b> to determine the extent of IC disclosure, then combining this data with market data using regression analysis to determine the influence of IC disclosure in IPO <b>prospectuses</b> on post-issue stock performance. Findings: According to the content analysis results, these IPO <b>prospectuses</b> contain significant amounts of IC disclosure for the subsequent analysis. The authors find that after the GFC technology companies disclose more IC information. The econometric analysis also reveals that IC disclosure has a higher influence on post-issue stock performance after the GFC than before. Research limitations/implications: The research shows how IPO <b>prospectuses</b> are a valid form of disclosure to investigate the impact of reducing IC information asymmetry because they contain significant amounts of forward-looking non-financial information about the company’s development. Additionally, the results are relevant to discussions about the impact of. If IC and non-financial disclosures contained in an integrated report are forward-looking and reduce information asymmetry then may have value relevance to a firm. Practical implications: The research confirms that more IC disclosure information in <b>prospectuses</b> may positively influence companies’ post-issue stock performance, especially in the long run. However, the authors caution that disclosing IC information to investors is not the panacea for increased post-IPO share performance. Originality/value: This paper is novel because it shows the value relevance of IC disclosures to reduce information asymmetry through its focus on <b>prospectuses,</b> which helps to understand of the potential impact of. 21 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Genre {{analyses}} and contrastive rhetoric studies {{have dealt with}} {{quite a number of}} genres of writing. However, genre analysts and contrastive rhetoric researchers have not carried out adequate analyses of doctoral <b>prospectuses.</b> This paper will, subsequently, address this issue by analyzing a genre of texts of doctoral <b>prospectuses.</b> The analysis will be focused on the sub-genre of â€œBackground of the Studyâ€ of the <b>prospectuses.</b> Limitations of accessibility, however, have led this study to only focus on analyzing fourteen doctoral <b>prospectuses</b> written in English by Indonesian students of EFL accessible from the Graduate Program, State University of Malang, Indonesia. This situation suggests that the present study is preliminary. Preliminary, notwithstanding, the study will contribute to filling the gap of the under-researched issue of doctoral studies in Indonesia, particularly, those pertinent to the area of ELT. The analysis shows a tendency that the texts of Background of the Study do not show research spaces. Relevant to this, the article provides an interpretive explanation of the possible factors attributable to this issue...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of multinational underwriters on intellectual capitaldisclosure in Indonesian IPO <b>prospectuses.</b> Intellectual capital disclosure practices were driven by the adviceof underwriters. Multinational underwriters had a greater capacity to produce more relevant information so itreduced the information gap for IPO market participants. The information included IC disclosure practices inIPO <b>prospectuses.</b> This study found that the nationality of underwriting firms positively affected the extent ofintellectual capital disclosure in Indonesian IPO <b>prospectuses.</b> Exposure to IPOs in other countries and theability to combine dispersed knowledge across their international branches seemed to have a positive effect onmulti-national underwriting firms in as much as it led to a higher standard of disclosure of intellectual capitalthan that of local underwriting firms...|$|R

The Pottery Line running from a junction with the Manchester & Birmingham railway at Congleton to the Grand Junction Railway at Colwich was promoted, as 'giving the most ample accommodation to {{the towns of}} Tunstall, Burslem, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton, Longton and Stone'. The Churnet Line was to run from Macclesfield though Leek, Cheadle and Uttoxeter to join the Midland Railway line between Burton-upon-Trent and Derby forming a direct link between Manchester and Derby.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of the diaries continued, and by June 1982 Gruner + Jahr possessed 35 volumes. In early 1983 the company took the decision to work towards a publication date for the diaries. To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, Stern issued a <b>prospectus</b> to potentially interested parties, Newsweek, Time, Paris Match and a syndicate of papers owned by Murdoch. Stern rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|A <b>prospectus</b> {{was issued}} which {{contained}} a detailed {{breakdown of the}} likely costs, revenue and profits of such a scheme, and the promotors prepared to obtain an Act of Parliament. During this time, someone challenged the original survey and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the upper section, but that costs {{were likely to be}} £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett's plans, was obtained on 28 May 1827. The proprietors were empowered to raise £18,000 by the issue of 360 shares of £50 each, with powers to raise another £5,000 by mortgage, or to borrow any part of the £18,000 from the Exchequer Bills Commissioners.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share <b>prospectus</b> specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a <b>prospectus</b> to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball <b>Prospectus</b> ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E
50|$|Printed {{advertisements}} for and catalogues of books were produced in Europe {{as early as}} the 1470s, although very few survive and what we recognize today as <b>prospectuses</b> (containing information on the text, physical nature, price and availability of a forthcoming book) did not develop until the seventeenth century, when they were generally issued for books published by subscription. <b>Prospectuses</b> are of great interest to the historian and bibliographer because they often give information about a book, its author, publisher, printer or illustrator which is not available elsewhere.|$|R

5|$|The three Britons {{were brought}} to trial on 6 April 1826. Lehuby, still in the Netherlands, was tried in absentia. The Crown prosecution's case was seriously {{hampered}} by his absence, particularly because many key documents were {{with him in the}} Netherlands. The prosecutor alleged a complex conspiracy between MacGregor, Lehuby and their associates to profit personally from a fraudulent land concession and loan <b>prospectus.</b> MacGregor's lawyer, a Frenchman called Merilhou, asserted that if anything untoward had occurred, the missing managing director should be held culpable; there was no proof of a conspiracy, he said, and MacGregor could have been himself defrauded by Lehuby. The prosecutor conceded that there was insufficient evidence to prove his case, complimented MacGregor for co-operating with the investigation fairly and openly, and withdrew the charges. The three judges confirmed the defendants' release—"a full and perfect acquittal", Hippisley would write—but days later the French authorities succeeded in having Lehuby extradited, and the three men learned they would have to stand trial again.|$|E

On count 1 Kylsant was charged with issuing a document, namely the annual report for 1926 with intent to deceive the shareholders about the true state of the company, Morland was charged with aiding and abetting this offence. Count 2 was an identical count relating to the annual report for 1927 against both defendants and on count 3 Kylsant alone was charged with issuing a document—the debenture stock <b>prospectus</b> of 1928 with intent to induce people to advance property to the company. All counts were contrary to section 84 of the Larceny Act 1861. Both defendants {{pleaded not guilty to}} all counts.|$|E
