5000|$|The {{basis of}} the {{synchronized}} tremolo is a rigid assembly that incorporates both the bridge and tailpiece, which pivots on the guitar belly. In the original design, this {{was based on the}} principle of the [...] "knife edge" [...] balance. A bevel on the front underside of a steel top plate formed a wide, sharp edge that rested {{on the top of the}} guitar body. A small imbalance in tension between the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> the strings and the counterbalancing <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> the <b>springs</b> held the pivot edge firmly in place against the body.|$|R
5000|$|Modern snorkel {{induction}} masts use a fail-safe design using compressed air, {{controlled by}} a simple electrical circuit, to hold the [...] "head valve" [...] open against the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> a powerful <b>spring.</b> Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control circuit. This vents the compressed air and allows the head valve to slam shut. When the electrodes are again clear of the water, the circuit is re-energized and the valve reopens.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUcTION. The method {{described}} here {{was developed for}} the purpose of obtaining a numerical figure indicative of the contractile force of a section of the myocardium under conditions of an intact circulation. The procedure consists essentially in the addition of graduated loads to the movable lever arm of the Cushny myocardiograph typically attached in the open-chest dog prepara-tion. The graduated loads were obtained by stretching a calibrated metal spring directly attached to the string joining the kymograph writing lever and the myocardiograph lever, the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spring</b> being in opposition to the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> systolic contraction. The spring tension necessary to damp the writing stroke to near extinction was taken as an end-point indicative of the contractile force of the myocardium. This critical load, or isometric systolic tension, expressed in grams, {{has been found to be}} reasonably constant and reproducible in a given preparation and it reflects with sensitivity the effects of stimulant or depressant drugs. The lever system of the Cushny myocardiograph is relatively heavy as com...|$|R
5000|$|The {{problem of}} the diesels causing a vacuum in the {{submarine}} when the head valve is submerged still exists in later model diesel submarines, but is mitigated by high-vacuum cut-off sensors that shut down the engines when the vacuum in the ship reaches a pre-set point. Modern snorkel induction masts use a fail-safe design using compressed air, controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the [...] "head valve" [...] open against the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> a powerful <b>spring.</b> Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control, and shutting the [...] "head valve" [...] while it is submerged.|$|R
6000|$|He began {{describing}} {{the kid who}} was still asleep in the cab. I did some quick thinking. Evidently the family was {{on the trail of}} the kid, and the sheriff had received telegraphed instructions from Oregon. Yes, I had seen the kid. I had met him first in Ogden. The date tallied with the sheriff's information. But the kid was still behind somewhere, I explained, for he had been ditched from that very overland that night when it <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> Rock <b>Springs.</b> And all the time I was praying that the kid wouldn't wake up, come down out of the cab, and put the [...] "kibosh" [...] on me.|$|R

Emotional experience was manipulated using an ostracizing event and goals were experimenter-assigned.

50|$|As the {{mainspring}} {{runs down}} (Fig. 2), {{more of the}} chain is wrapped on the barrel, and the chain going to the barrel comes off the wide bottom grooves of the fusee. Now the weaker <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> the mainspring {{is applied to the}} larger radius of the bottom of the fusee. The greater turning moment provided by the larger radius at the fusee compensates for the weaker force <b>of</b> the <b>spring,</b> keeping the drive torque constant.|$|R

50|$|The Qalb {{is called}} {{the heart of the}} mystic; it is caught between the {{downward}} <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> the lower nafs, and the upward <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> the spirit of Allah and may be blackened by sin. It may be purified by reciting the names of God. The Ruh is the centre of the spirit, the breath of Allah; when awakened, it counteracts the negative <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> the nafs. The Sirr is the innermost heart, where Allah manifests his mystery to himself.|$|R
