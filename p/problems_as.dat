5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> well.

These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E

5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, the average lifespan {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days. In a different experiment, hamsters kept in captivity born in the summer lived {{for an average of}} 2.0–2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity.

After a cardiac arrest, Kirchner was rushed to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 9:15a.m. He had undergone two medical procedures that year: surgery on his right carotid artery in February and an angioplasty in September. His death was a surprise for the Argentinian population, to whom he had always represented his heart <b>problems</b> <b>as</b> not very serious.|$|E

Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designated}} the TB-7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, {{died in a}} plane crash in 1942. Supply problems complicated the aircraft's production and the Pe-8s also had engine <b>problems.</b> <b>As</b> Soviet morale boosters, they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots. The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from mechanical failure, friendly fire, or combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944.|$|E

5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial <b>problems.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, but the only option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of {{evaluating}} {{a wide range of}} alternative plans to address the ship's <b>problems</b> (<b>as</b> well as other issues at San Jacinto), TPWD, working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, adopted a Master Plan that called for placing Texas into a permanent dry berth. After the Master Plan was formally adopted by TPWD in 2004, the Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.|$|E
