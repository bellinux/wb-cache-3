40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in the restoration of blanket bogs that were afforested during the 1960 s to 1980 s, to avoid further loss of carbon to the atmosphere and to regain and defragment important blanket bog habitat. This paper reports the findings from a ten-year experiment in the UK to test the effectiveness of restoration treatments on water table depth, peat bulk density and water content, ground surface height and vegetation development. Treatments used were the six combinations of damming or not damming <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> with leaving the trees alive, felling and leaving {{them on the ground}} or felling and removing them. Combining felling with damming furrows was most successful in raising the water table, whether or not the felled trees were removed. Only where felling was combined with damming did the water table continue to recover between Years 5 and 10. Over ten years, the water level in these treatments rose to slightly below that of non-afforested reference bog at the same sites. This occurred as a rapid initial rise, following which there was only very slight further improvement. Felling caused the species composition of the vegetation to change towards that of the reference bogs. The process was slow, with the vegetation becoming more dissimilar to non-forested reference bog in the first five years and then becoming more similar to the reference bog after Year 5. Surprisingly, damming <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> had little effect on the vegetation except that, in combination with felling, it increased differentiation between the <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> and other positions on the ploughed ground. Conifer seedlings established on the restored plots, most densely where they adjoined standing forest, and had similar density and growth in all the felled treatments. The restoration treatments resulted in a decrease in bulk density and increase in water content of the upper peat, probably due to an unloading effect caused by the raised water table buoying up the drained peat layer. In some treatments this was amplified by removal of the weight of the trees. Damming the <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> caused a 5 – 7 cm rise in ground surface height, suggesting that subsidence resulting from primary consolidation and secondary compression is at least partly reversible...|$|R

40|$|Contrasting {{hydrological}} {{regimes in}} a cambic stagnohumic gley and an ironpan stagnopodzol were monitored at the Tywi Forest, Mid-Wales, during the hydrologi-cal year 1988 - 1989. Variations in the hydrological behaviour of each soil {{were observed in}} relation to hillslope topography and the localized influence of <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> and planting ridges. High rooting densities in the well-structured O horizon of the stagnohumic gley encouraged lateral seepage above the relatively impermeable subsoil and concentrated summer drying in the surface horizons. Marked subsoil drying appeared {{to be related to}} deeper root penetration where unsaturated subsoil conditions prevailed in upslope areas or beneath planting ridges. In contrast, the ironpan stagnopodzol did not have impeded drainage due to structural features and the roots penetrating the E horizon and ironpan. Moreover, the subsoil was coarsely textured and freely draining. Consequently, rooting was more extensive and hydro-logical regimes were more uniform and not simply related to topography. Soil disturbance and extensive root penetration in <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> appears to promote preferential water movement during storm events and create drier summer soil conditions...|$|R

40|$|Restoring {{afforested}} peat bogs: {{results of}} current research The value of peat bogs as open habitats and stores of carbon {{may be lost}} if they are planted with trees. The number of bogs being restored is increasing but still modest in scale relative {{to the area of}} afforested peatland. Research is currently being carried out to determine the feasibility and methodology for restoring afforested bogs. Two experiments were set up to compare a range of methods for managing trees and drainage. In the blanket bog experiment, treatments that involved both felling trees and damming <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> were more successful than others in terms of raising the water table. Bog vegetation recovered rapidly in the felled treatments, particularly those with furrows dammed. In the lowland raised bog experiment, the water table rose dramatically in all treatments. Only during a prolonged dry summer was there a difference between treatments, the water table falling deeper in the whole-tree removal than in the fell-to-waste treatment, with conventional harvesting intermediate. Bog vegetation recovered best in the whole-tree removal treatments and least well in the fell-to-waste treatments. Felling is necessary for restoring afforested bogs, but removing lop and top is not. Damming <b>plough</b> <b>furrows</b> can help to restore blanket bog but damming main drains may suffice on lowland raised bogs. Damming furrows is ineffective if the peat is severely cracked. Tree seedlings often colonise bogs undergoing restoration – removing brash mats after harvesting and periodic maintenance should reduce this problem...|$|R
