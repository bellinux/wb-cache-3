40|$|The dynamic {{performance}} of a <b>programmable</b> <b>manipulator</b> depends on both the motion profile to be followed and the feedback control method used. To improve this performance the manipulator trajectory requires planning at an advanced level and an efficient control method has to be used. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate high-level trajectory planning and trajectory tracing problems. It is shown that conventional trajectory planning methods where the motion curves are generated using standard mathematical functions are ineffective for general application especially when velocity and acceleration conditions are included. Polynomial functions are shown to be the most versatile for these applications but these can give curves with unexpected oscillations, commonly called meandering. In this study, a new method using polynomials is developed to overcome this disadvantage. A general motion design computer program (MOTDES) is developed which enables the user to produce motion curves for general body motion in a plane. The program is fully interactive and operates within a graphics environment. A planar manipulator is designed and 'constructed to investigate the practical problems of trajectory control particularly when operating at high speeds. Different trajectories are planned using MOTDES and implemented to the manipulator. The precise tracing of a trajectory requires the use of advanced control methods such as adaptive control or learning. In learning control, the inputs of the current cycle are calculated using the experience of the previous circle. The main advantage of learning control over adaptive control is its simplicity. It can be applied more easily in real time for high-speed systems. However, learning algorithms may cause saturation of the driving servo motors after a few learning cycles due to discontinuities being introduced into the command curve. To prevent this saturation problem a new approach involving the filtering of the input command is developed and tested...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT:- The {{development}} of the current work is based mainly on improving the hardware developed in previous works [6], by adding the necessary tools to support an open programming environment, and the elements of control to facilitate the experimenting of new algorithms of control. In order to accomplish this task {{it was necessary to}} perform an analysis of stability over a new controller for the PUMA 200 robot (<b>Programmable</b> Universal <b>Manipulator</b> for Assembly). The design of this controller is based on the energy molding technique. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Programmable</b> Array <b>Manipulator</b> (PAM), {{developed}} at University of Wollongong, is a novel, intelligent, programmable, and multi-directional conveyor capable of transporting {{a number of}} items toward individual destinations concurrently. PAM combines the three concepts behind {{the operation of the}} articulated robots, part feeders and conveyors to produce an efficient and high productivity machine. The work reported in this thesis is mainly concerned with modelling and simulation of PAM. This system is a modular, concurrent, and complex real-time system. The modelling is conducted at both the drive and functional levels of the system. In spite of its emphasis on PAM, the study, particularly in functional modelling, is quite generic and provides a framework for behaviour analysis, design and implementation of similar modular and concurrent real-time systems...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Programmable</b> Array <b>Manipulator,</b> or PAM, {{is a new}} {{technology}} designed to perform simultaneous manipulations on multiple objects. In its most primitive form, PAM is a matrix of actuators arranged {{in such a way}} that it may transport an object resting upon it. This transportation may be either a translation or a rotation. Such a device is currentiy under development at the University of WoUongong. The purpose of this thesis is to describe the methodology and implementation of the design factors associated with the prototype development of a PAM. Since PAM is a new device many issues need to be resolved Hiese issues include the control system design, the acmator hardware, the hardware to control the actuators and the sensor system required for object position and orientation feedback. The solutions to these issues form the basis of this thesis. The detailed design and the associated experimental verification is presented in full...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Robot {{design has}} {{recently}} become a burgeoning {{area of research}} for intelligent computation and applications range over diverse scales, from robot insects to Mars explorers. Despite the human associations, standard robot dynamics has {{more in common with}} inanimate action than animate action. The Carnegie Trust Scholarship Research Project described herein is intended to redress the balance by addressing the question: How does a robot become able to act intentionally? The question provides a focus for the project which will investigate into the fundamentals of robotic learning and action. The supporting experience in goal direction of the Intelligent Computation Group at St Andrews provides a unique opportunity for a novel answer to emerge. Detail A robot may be defined as a <b>programmable,</b> multifunction <b>manipulator</b> designed to move material, parts, tools, or specific devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks (Robot Institute of America). The above definition includes robots which are pre-programmed and operate in highly structured environments such as industrial car paint sprayers. We are interested in researchin...|$|R
