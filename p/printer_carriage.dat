These characters {{are based on}} printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer thus instructed the printer to advance the paper one line, and a carriage return indicated that the <b>printer</b> <b>carriage</b> should return {{to the beginning of}} the current line. Some rare systems, such as QNX before version 4, used the ASCII [...] (record separator, , 30 in decimal) character as the newline character.|$|E
50|$|A {{typewriter}} or electromechanical printer {{can print}} characters on paper, and execute operations such as move the carriage {{back to the}} left margin of the same line (carriage return), advance to the same column of the next line (line feed), and so on. Commands to control non-printing operations were transmitted {{in exactly the same}} way as printable characters by sending control characters with defined functions (e.g., the line feed character forced the carriage to move to the same position on the next line) to teleprinters. In modern computing and communications a few control characters, such as carriage return and line feed, have retained their original functions (although they are often implemented in software rather than activating electromechanical mechanisms to move a physical <b>printer</b> <b>carriage)</b> but many others are no longer required and are used for other purposes.|$|E
50|$|The digital glass printer is a flatbed {{digital printer}} {{designed}} with print heads to jet ceramic inks {{directly onto the}} glass. The glass remains stationary while only the <b>printer</b> <b>carriage</b> sweeps across the print table. A key feature of the printer is drop fixation in which ink droplets are dried immediately to prevent drop gain. The fixation of the ink enables a single pass of the print carriage even when printing multi layer and multi color files. The drop fixation makes inline double vision printing possible. Double vision is creating a different vision depending on {{which side of the}} glass is being viewed it is achieved by printing different graphics {{one on top of the}} other.An inline dryer was developed for real time drying to occur and to maximize factory space. A smooth color switching system in included so machine operators can easily shift between print jobs and increase throughput. The high resolution print quality - up to 720 dpi - and the precision of the printers allow glass processors to print anything from fine, sharp, small elements to complex full color images on glasses up to 3.3X18 meters in size.|$|E

40|$|The use of high-precision {{automated}} {{equipment is}} steadily increasing {{due in part}} to the progressively smaller sizes of electronic circuits. Currently, piezoelectric transducers (piezos) dominate as the actuation device for high precision machines, but shape memory alloys (SMA) may be a viable alternative to reduce monetary costs. This work explores the implementation of a low-cost linear macro-micro positioning system. The system consists of a modified <b>printer</b> <b>carriage</b> to provide long range, macro scale linear motion (approximately 200 mm range and 200 µm precision) and a micro scale system (approximately 4 mm range and 5 µm target precision) that uses an SMA actuator. A detailed description of the design and implementation of the system is given in this research. A model of the macro-stage is then generated by first identifying and inverting a simple friction model to linearize the system, thereby allowing for modified least squares (MLS) identification of a linear model. Various controllers are attempted for the macro-stage and compared with an experimentally tuned nonlinear PD controller that is implemented in the final design. A model of the micro-stage is derived through analysis of the SMA actuator. The model for the actuator is separated into two portions, an electro-thermal model, and a hysteresis model. The hysteresis model is derived using the Preisach model, and the electro-thermal model through MLS identification. To control the micro-stage, a PI controller with antiwindup is developed experimentally. The two stages are then executed together in closed loop and the resulting coupling between the two stages is briefly examined. Experimental data used for the modelling and design is presented, along with results of the final macro-micro linear positioning system...|$|E
40|$|Fused Filament Fabrication is an {{additive}} manufacturing {{process by which}} a 3 D object is created from plastic filament. The filament is pushed through a hot nozzle where it melts. The nozzle deposits plastic layer after layer to create the final object. This process has been popularized by the RepRap community. Several printers feature multiple extruders, allowing objects to be formed from multiple materials or colors. The extruders are mounted {{side by side on}} the <b>printer</b> <b>carriage.</b> However, the print quality suffers when objects with color patterns are printed – a disappointment for designers interested in 3 D printing their colored digital models. The most severe issue is the oozing of plastic from the idle extruders: Plastics of different colors bleed onto each other giving the surface a smudged aspect, excess strings oozing from the extruder deposit on the surface, and holes appear due to this missing plastic. Fixing this issue is difficult: increasing the printing speed reduces oozing but also degrades surface quality – on large prints the required speed level become impractical. Adding a physical mechanism increases cost and print time as extruders travel to a cleaning station. Instead, we rely on software and exploit degrees of freedom of the printing process. We introduce three techniques that complement each other in improving the print quality significantly. We first reduce the impact of oozing plastic by choosing a better azimuth angle for the printed part. We build a disposable rampart in close proximity of the part, giving the extruders the opportunity to wipe oozing strings and refill with hot plastic. We finally introduce a toolpath planner avoiding and hiding most of the defects due to oozing, and seamlessly integrating the rampart. We demonstrate our technique on several challenging multiple color prints, and show that our tool path planner improves the surface finish of single color prints as well.

50|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} video-display terminals (VDTs) {{in the mid-1970s}} ushered {{in the second phase}} of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a <b>printer</b> head or <b>carriage</b> can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|Many daisy wheel {{machines}} offer a {{bold type}} facility, accomplished by double- or triple-striking the specified character(s); servo-based <b>printers</b> advance the <b>carriage</b> fractionally for a wider (and therefore blacker) character, while cheaper machines perform a carriage return without a line feed {{to return to}} the beginning of the line, space through all non-bold text, and restrike each bolded character. The inherent imprecision in attempting to restrike on exactly the same spot after a carriage return provides the same effect as the more expensive servo-based printers, with the unique side effect that as the printer ages and wears, bold text becomes bolder.|$|R

50|$|Progressive {{hardware}} {{improvements to}} impact <b>printers</b> boosted the <b>carriage</b> speed, added more (typeface) font options, increased the dot density (from 60 dpi up to 240 dpi), and added color printing. Faster carriage speeds meant faster (and sometimes louder) printing. Additional typefaces allowed {{the user to}} vary the text appearance of printouts. Proportional-spaced fonts allowed the printer to imitate the non-uniform character widths of a typesetter. Increased dot density allowed for more detailed, darker printouts. The impact pins of the printhead were constrained to a minimum size (for structural durability), and dot densities above 100 dpi merely caused adjacent dots to overlap. While the pin diameter placed a lower limit on the smallest reproducible graphic detail, manufacturers {{were able to use}} higher dot density to great effect in improving text quality.|$|R
