5|$|There are {{two main}} groups of {{dissolved}} phase models: In parallel compartment models, several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition {{is controlled by the}} compartment that shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile. These compartments represent conceptual tissues and don't represent specific organic tissues. They merely represent the range of <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> organic tissues. The second group uses serial compartments, which assumes that gas diffuses through one compartment before it reaches the next.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, a non-tropical {{low over}} the {{northern}} Bahamas became more organized and formed into Tropical Depression Sixteen between Andros and Grand Bahama. Shortly after forming, the tropical depression moved over Grand Bahama and moved north parallel to the Florida coastline. The computer models initially predicted two distinct <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> storm's future, with some models indicating the storm would cross over Florida and enter the Gulf of Mexico while others indicated that it would stay offshore {{and move to the}} northeast. The official forecast from the National Hurricane Center followed the first set of guidances, though with low confidence. The storm strengthened to become Tropical Storm Ophelia early on September 7 and became a hurricane briefly the next day.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} C {{extension}} {{had been completed}} in 1926, <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear. From 1922, a series of press campaigns called {{for the improvement of}} services at the GNR's Finsbury Park station where interchanges between tube lines, mainline trains, buses and trams were notoriously bad. In June 1923, a petition from 30,000 local residents was submitted to parliament, and, in 1925, the government called a public inquiry to review options. Pick presented plans to relieve the congestion at Finsbury Park by extending the Piccadilly tube north to Southgate. Opposition from the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GNR following the 1923 grouping of railway companies) was again considerable and based on claims that the new Underground line would take passengers from the mainline services. Using data from the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead tube and C extensions, Pick demonstrated that the route planned for the new line would stimulate new residential development and increase passenger numbers for all rail operators in the area, increasing those on the Piccadilly tube by 50 million per year. Parliamentary approval was granted in 1930 to extend the Piccadilly tube north beyond Southgate to a terminus at Cockfosters. The approval also included complementary extensions of the Piccadilly tube from its western terminus at Hammersmith to supplement District Railway services to Hounslow and South Harrow. The development was again financed with government backed loans, this time through the 1929 Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act. To ensure the most efficient integration between the new tube line and the UERL's bus and tram operations, the stations were located further apart than in central areas and where road transport services could be arranged to deliver and collect the most passengers. At Manor House, the station was designed with subway exits directly on to pedestrian islands in the road served by the local trams.|$|E

25|$|Crystallization is {{a complex}} and extensively-studied field, because {{depending}} on the conditions, a single fluid can solidify into many different possible forms. It can form a single crystal, perhaps with various possible phases, stoichiometries, impurities, defects, and habits. Or, it can form a polycrystal, with various <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> size, arrangement, orientation, and phase of its grains.

25|$|In {{a complex}} with reengineered {{bacterial}} phytochrome, biliverdin has been employed as an IR-emitting chromophore for in vivo imaging. In contrast to fluorescent proteins which form their chromophore through posttranslational modifications of the polypeptide chain, phytochromes bind an external ligand (in this case, biliverdin), and successful imaging {{of the first}} bacteriophytochrome-based probe required addition of the exogenous biliverdin. Recent studies demonstrated that bacteriophytochrome-based fluorescent proteins with high affinity to biliverdin can be imaged in vivo utilizing endogenous ligand only and, thus, with the same ease as the conventional fluorescent proteins. Advent of the second and further generations of the biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome-based probes should broaden the <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-invasive in vivo imaging.|$|E
25|$|A modernist pioneer was Patrick Pearse, {{language}} {{activist and}} revolutionary, and writer of stories of idealistic content in a contemporary European form. Pearse was executed in 1916 but left a legacy which opened new <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> language. Modernist possibilities were further developed by Pádraic Ó Conaire, {{a writer of}} the 1920s on whom the European influence was evident but whose own legacy was mixed. He wrote, like Pearce, in the Irish of Conamara, sometimes setting his stories in that remote landscape {{and at other times}} in the towns. Ó Conaire has been described as the true pioneer of short story writing in Irish because of his rejection of older conventions and his determination to deal fearlessly with the truths of human nature.|$|E

25|$|The Arabic script {{as we know}} {{it today}} was unknown in Muhammad’s time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and the Quran was {{preserved}} through memorization and written references on different materials. As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible due to the absence of diacritical marks (a’jam). Vowelling marks (tashkil) to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well. Due to this there were endless <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script {{as we know it}} today, the scripta plena, which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the Department of Atomic Energy {{was founded}} with Homi Bhabha as its secretary. The Department {{provided}} funding for space research throughout India. During this time, tests continued on aspects of meteorology and the Earth's magnetic field, {{a topic that}} was being studied in India since {{the establishment of the}} observatory at Colaba in 1823. In 1954, the Uttar Pradesh state observatory was established at the foothills of the Himalayas. The Rangpur Observatory was set up in 1957 at Osmania University, Hyderabad. Space research was further encouraged by the technically inclined Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched Sputnik and opened up <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the world to}} conduct a space launch.|$|E
25|$|Miroslav Bárta instead proposes mastaba AS-54 in South-Abusir as {{the most}} {{possible}} burial site. This is promoted by the finding of a polished magnesite bowl, which shows the niswt-bity title of Huni. The mastaba itself was once pretty large and contained large niches and chapels. It also contained a quite large amount of polished dishes, vases and urnes. Contradictorily, nearly all the vessels are undecorated, no ink inscription or carving {{were found on the}} objects. Thus, the name of the true owner is yet unknown. Only one vessel clearly shows Huni's name while a few other might show small traces. Bárta thus sees two <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> owner of the mastaba: it was either a very high ranked official, such as a prince of Huni's time, or king Huni himself.|$|E

25|$|Early {{decompression}} models {{tended to}} use the dissolved phase models, and adjusted them by more or less arbitrary factors {{to reduce the risk}} of symptomatic bubble formation. Dissolved phase models are of two main groups. Parallel compartment models, where several compartments with varying rates of gas absorption (half time), are considered to exist independently of each other, and the limiting condition is controlled by the compartment which shows the worst case for a specific exposure profile. These compartments represent conceptual tissues and are not intended to represent specific organic tissues, merely to represent the range of <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> organic tissues. The second group uses serial compartments, where gas is assumed to diffuse through one compartment before it reaches the next. A recent variation on the serial compartment model is the Goldman interconnected compartment model (ICM).|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} late 1990s, which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> genre, with its dozens of minigames and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. The game was soon ported to the PC and gained much success there, as did several other originally console RPGs, blurring the line between the console and computer platforms.|$|E
25|$|Southern's {{failure was}} met with anger and disbelief by its board of directors. Although the IBA gave its {{standard}} reason for these decisions, that the competitor offered a better mix of programmes and greater investment, it was believed the station's non-local ownership may have swayed the balance against it. Another factor {{may have been the}} company's very conservative (and possibly dull) nature and that, with a new decade just dawned, the south of England would be a radically different area; it was felt that Southern Television's application was, understandably, more of the same tried and tested formula, which in time would not have reflected the <b>possibilities</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> area. Yet another possible factor was the incumbent's complacency: its original application was a mere 16-pages long. Tactfully the IBA invited Southern Television to re-submit, this time asking the company to go into more depth with its plans.|$|E
