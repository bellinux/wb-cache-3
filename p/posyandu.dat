40|$|In Indonesia, {{the village}} health post (<b>Posyandu)</b> is a {{community}} driven organisation that provides basic health and family planning services such as {{maternal and child health}} (MCH), nutrition, family planning, immunization and diarrhoeal disease control (BKKBN, 2004). During 1997 to 2000, or during the monetary crisis, it was revealed from the IFLS study that there was a 12 % drop in the usage of <b>Posyandu</b> for bothboys and girls (Strauss, et al. 2002). Almost all <b>Posyandu</b> services decline rapidly, the coverage of child growth monitoring dropped by 14 % between 1997 to 2000, and the possession of growth monitoring cards (KMS) dropped by 24 % (Marks, 2003). However, Strauss, et al. (2003 cited in Marks 2003) reveal that during the period when <b>Posyandu</b> coverage and attendance were decreasing rapidly, child height increased which indicated a better health and nutritional status (Marks, 2003). This literature review aims to give a better insight of understandingthe paradox using three factors approach, which are: intrinsic, extrinsic and macro-environmental factors. The limitation of internal factors within <b>Posyandu</b> believed to be the key of declining coverage. Among intrinsic factors are: the quality of kader, and the displacement of the family planning program (Rusydi, 2005). The role of private health care providers or NGOs, and shifts in consumer preferences are thoughtto be responsible for the improved child health indicated by increased height for age index. Broader macro-environmental factors also have had a significant impact, the monetary crisis that hit Indonesia in 1998 resulted in a reduction of both mens and womens participation in a variety of community development activities such as neighborhood improvement projects and the <b>Posyandu</b> (Frankenberg, Thomas and Beegle, 1999). Even with a broad spectrum of variability among Indonesian, nonetheless, this approach could be regarded as a template for site to site evaluation.
