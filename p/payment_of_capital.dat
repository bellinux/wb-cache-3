5000|$|Lord Goff {{noted that}} {{normally}} {{a failure to}} repay a loan results in a claim in contract, but on {{the facts of this}} case that remedy was not available because of the fraudulent changes to the documentation. Accordingly, he turned to the problem of whether there had been a total failure of consideration. He noted that [...] "although no part of the principal sum had been repaid by the appellants, two instalments of interest had been paid; and the question arises whether these two <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> interest precluded recovery on the basis that in such circumstances the failure of consideration for the advance was not total." [...] He then answered that the view of the Court was that it did not. <b>Payments</b> <b>of</b> interest were different from <b>payments</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> sums. However the court noted that it was possible that the documents were altered prior to one <b>of</b> the <b>payments,</b> in which case the payments would be treated as repayment <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> However Lord Goff was unequivocal: [...] "even if part <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> sum had been repaid, the law would not hesitate to hold that the balance of the loan outstanding would be recoverable on the ground of failure of consideration; for at least in those cases in which apportionment can be carried out without difficulty, the law will allow partial recovery on this ground (see David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1992) 175 CLR 353, 383)." ...|$|R

50|$|Sangara is {{a notable}} area of coffee production, {{lying in the}} foothills. 18 {{commercial}} coffee plantations were established in 1926, {{paving the way for}} commercial production from 1928. Louis Austen, a retired sea-captain, once managed a government coffee plantation near Sangara. Historically there were also major rubber plantations in the area; the rubber was transported to the port at Buna Bay and then shipped overseas. Sangara was also an important location for the sugar industry in the country. In 1928 a group of Cairns-based investors founded the Sangara Sugar Estates, Ltd., and proposed the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> worth £500,000 to promote sugar production in Papua New Guinea. The company was reported to have applied for some 8100 hectares of land. The sugar industry in Sangara though was reportedly not as successful as the rubber industry and some of the plantations were later converted to produce rubber.|$|E

In pursuit of capital then, all the assets of Excelsior Needle were transferred in 1898 to The Torrington Company of Maine, organized two days prior to the transfer for just that purpose. Excelsior Needle acted as the operating company of its parent company, The Torrington Company of Maine, until 1917, when the directors of both companies decided to form a single corporate entity, The Torrington Company of Connecticut. Federal tax laws, however, stipulated that the exchange {{would result in the}} <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax, something the directors of the company wished to avoid, so for the next 19 years there were two Torringtons—The Torrington Company of Maine, which acted as a holding company for the second company, and The Torrington Company of Connecticut. Excelsior Needle, meanwhile, disappeared as a distinct corporate entity, continuing on merely as the [...] "Excelsior Plant." ...|$|E
50|$|Initiatives were {{introduced}} to assist teacher training. Following the delivery of {{a report by the}} Special Committee on Teacher Education in March 1973, the Whitlam Government introduced various measures to implement its recommendations for special grants to the States for the building of teachers’ college libraries, fostering research into teacher education, increasing the number of students training to become teachers of handicapped children, and improving facilities in existing colleges of advanced education. The States Grants (Advanced Education) Act (No. 3) 1973 allocated $188 million for the development of teacher education in pre-school teachers’ colleges, State teachers’ colleges, and colleges of advanced education throughout 1973-75, while the States Grants (Advanced Education) Act of 1974 provided recurrent financial assistance for non-government teachers’ colleges for 1974 and 1975. The first national program for technical and further education resulted from the recommendations of the Committee on Technical and Further Education, established in early 1973. This committee produced an interim report in April 1974 which led to the <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and recurrent grants to the States for building and planning new technical colleges and improving facilities at existing ones, especially with respect to teacher training, library services, research facilities, and student accommodation. The sum total of Federal grants increased from $18.1 million in 1972-73 to $81.1 million in 1975-76. Expenditure on state government schools increased more than sixfold, and more than doubled on non-government schools.|$|E
50|$|Qualifying {{status is}} {{determined}} {{at the outset}} of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10 years plus) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called top-slicing based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes (unit trusts, investment trusts and OEICs). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the '5% cumulative allowance' - the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful tax planning tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.|$|E
