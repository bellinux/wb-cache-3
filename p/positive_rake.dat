40|$|High speed {{machining}} {{was developed}} over {{sixty years ago}} and at present is still limited {{to just a few}} materials, these being aluminium and its alloys, hardened steels for the mould and die industry and titanium for aerospace applications. Recently there has been additional work in high speed machining on some of the more exotic aerospace alloys such as inconel and nimonic alloys. This thesis addresses the problems encountered when machining high chromium/nickel steel alloys {{that are part of the}} stainless steel family. Three grades of stainless steel were selected for this purpose, these being a martensitic grade (416) and two austenitic grades (303 & 316). These materials were high speed milled at cuttinspeeds of up to 3, 000 m min- 1, via the use of two machining methodologies; high torque-low speed and low torque-high speed milling. High torque-low speed milling was accomplished through the use of specially designed large diameter dual-plane balanced face mills, that when rotated at 6, 000 rev mon- 1 generated a cuting speed of 3, 000 m min- 1. These cutters were capable of machining three grades of stainless steel at approximately ten times that of the cutting speeds normally selected for materials that are cut conventionally. However, at the elevated cutting speeds machining of the two austenitic grades of stainless steel exhibited high tool wear rates which contributed to both poor surface finish and high cutting forces. The lo torque-high speed machining of these stainless steel grades was undertaken via specifically designed variable axial rake angle cutters in conjunction with a gear-driven speed increaser. This head gave a maxiumum cutting speed of 750 m min- 1 when the cutters were rotated at 20, 000 rev min- 1. Experiments indicated that the three grades of stainless steel could be machined at high rotational speeds, with good surface finish produced with negative axial rake angled tools. This machining strategy caused tool 'ironing' of the machined surface. cutting forces were lower at all cutting speeds when a <b>positive</b> axial <b>rake</b> angled tool was employed, although at elevated cutting speeds tool wear was excessive regardless of any axia rake angle geometry...|$|R

Higher stagnation height would increase the size of the side flow. The anisotropic nature of the material which partly determines the stagnation region also influences the side flow due to the different deformation mechanism under the action of the tool edge. At different cutting directions, the size of the side flow has a great difference which would finally affect the machined surface quality. The cutting directions of { 100 }[*]<[*] 011 >, { 110 }[*]<[*] 001 >, and { 110 }[*]<[*] 1 - 10 [*]>[*]are beneficial to obtain a better surface quality with small side flow.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} wear {{cause in}} turning of austenitic steel with coated tools is the delamination of the coating around {{the cutting edge}} and the adjacent contact area. This {{is due to the}} strong adhesive effect between material and tool. The coating's adhesion is influenced by several terms, e. g. coating process, substrate pre-treatment, coating system, substrate as well as by micro and macro geometry of the tool. This research work is focused on two fundamental aspects: the influence of the macro geometry on the delamination behaviour of the PVD-coating, and the possibility to use FEM simulation of chip formation as a useful tool for the interpretation of the coating's failure. Several orthogonal cutting tests were performed under dry conditions, varying the rake angle between − 15 ° and + 15 °. Simultaneously, a FEM-model for the simulation of the thermal and mechanical loads of the tool was developed. The numerical model was verified by comparing simulation and experiments in terms of cutting forces and chip underside temperature. Experimental and numerical results show that high contact stress {{in the area of the}} rake face favours the partial removal of the coating by the sliding chip.

The effect of ultrasonic frequency (25 and 50 kHz) and amplitude (0, 2. 20 and 3. 68 μm) as well as the effect of the rake angle (6 ° and − 6 °) and the cutter helix angle (25 °, 35 ° and 45 °) on tool wear and quality of the workpiece surface finish were also investigated. It was found that the ultrasonic amplitude increased with cutter stretch length and input voltage, as expected. The amplitude remained constant when the cutter holding force exceeded 15 N. The experimental results showed that the ultrasonic amplitude had an optimum value with respect to surface finish. However, large amplitude ultrasonics did not necessarily improve quality.

In this study the effect of changing the rake angle of insert carbide geometries to the wear level was investigated. The tungsten carbide insert type of DNMA 432 was used as cutting tool. FCD 500, a difficult-to-cut ductile cast iron, was chosen as work material.

However, while machining the titanium alloys using solid carbide tools, even with jet infusion of coolant lower tool life was vividly seen. The high temperatures generated at the tool–work interface causes adhesion of work-material on the cutting edges; hence, shorter tool life was reported. To reduce the high tool–work interface temperature <b>positive</b> <b>rake</b> angle, higher primary relief and higher secondary relief were configured on the ball nose end-mill cutting edges. However, after an initial working period, the growth of flank wear facilitates higher cutting forces followed by work-material adhesion on the cutting edges.

Presently, validation of tool geometry is very tedious as it requires extensive machining experiments.

An end-milling tooth normally has <b>positive</b> <b>rake</b> angle and small cutting edge radius thus workpiece material cutting coefficient is also considered fixed since ploughing effect {{is not expected to}} be noticeably affected by change in number of teeth.

H 577 P ISE 2015 Xiaoxxiii, 251 pages :color illustrationsBrittle-ductile cutting mode {{transition}} (BDCMT) is {{an important}} phenomenon in ultra-precision machining of brittle materials. Though many {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the mechanism of BDCMT, a number of fundamental issues remain unclear or controversial. Four such issues are identified and investigated in this study. The first issue is the atomicscale details of BDCMT under practical undeformed chip thickness (UCT). Molecular dynamics (MD) codes based on graphics processing units are developed to enable large-scale simulations with an advanced interaction potential. MD modelling of BDCMT is realized for the first time. It is found that the tensile stress in the cutting zone increases with UCT, and finally induces brittle fracture. In the simulations, the direction of crack propagation varies with UCT, and agrees with the surface morphologies produced by plunge cutting experiments. The second issue is the relationship between the tensile and compressive stresses in BDCMT. The mechanisms of BDCMT are analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} mechanics involved. The finite element method is employed to verify the proposed mechanics on silicon and 6 H SiC, and the critical UCT (CUCT) for BDCMT are estimated accordingly. The estimated values of CUCT are verified in plunge cutting experiments. It is found that, to induce the same magnitude of compressive stress, the tool has to advance a larger distance for larger UCT, and thereby induces larger tensile strain and consequently larger tensile stress below and behind the tool. The third issue is whether high pressure phase transformation (HPPT) is the origin of ductility in BDCMT for 6 H SiC. MD simulations are conducted to investigate the mechanism of ductile deformation in BDCMT for 6 H SiC. The HPPT and dislocation activities in the machining of 6 H SiC are visualized for the first time. Micro Raman spectroscopy is conducted on a ductile-cut 6 H SiC surface, with no peaks detected for amorphous SiC. These results indicate that the ductility in BDCMT of 6 H SiC is due to both HPPT and dislocation activities, with dislocation plasticity playing a major role. The fourth issue is whether the change of effective rake angle to be highly negative accounts for BDCMT. MD simulations show that BDCMT also occurs under a <b>positive</b> <b>rake</b> angle for silicon and SiC, though the CUCT are much smaller than that under negative rake angles. This indicates that negative rake angle is a more favorable condition for BDCMT than <b>positive</b> <b>rake</b> angle, rather than an enabling factor for BDCMT. The originality and significance of this study can be summarized as (i) MD modelling of BDCMT is realized for the first time, revealing important details of BDCMT; (ii) an explicit relationship between the tensile and compressive stresses in BDCMT is revealed by mechanistic analysis; (iii) the mechanism of ductile deformation in BDCMT of 6 H SiC is visualized by MD simulations for the first time, resolving the controversy regarding the role of HPPT; (iv) it helps to achieve more comprehensive understanding on the role of rake angle in BDCMT.

On the other hand, titanium and its alloys are notorious for their poor thermal properties and high reactivity with cutting tools which classifies as difficult-to-machine materials especially at higher cutting speeds. High Speed Machining (Vc ≥ 54 m/min) attracts huge benefit on material removal rate, machining time, cutting forces, heat removal and tool life.

Note that PyC is a brittle anisotropic material and its machining characteristics differ from plastically deformable isotropic materials. Consequently, this study is aimed at developing a finite element model to understand the mechanics of material removal in the plane of transverse isotropy (horizontally stacked laminae) of PyC. A damaged plasticity model {{has been used to}} capture the effect of material degradation under machining. Uniaxial tension/compression tests have been carried out to calibrate the damaged plasticity model. A cohesive element layer has been used between the chip layer and the bulk material to simulate the delamination/peeling effect.

The orthogonal cutting model has been validated against the experimental data for different cutting conditions for cutting and thrust forces. In addition, the chip geometry has also been compared.

The dislocations are concentrated on two shearing boundaries: one expands {{from the bottom of the}} cutting edge along the {{cutting direction}} and another starts at the tip of the stagnation region to the free surface, as shown in Fig.  7 a, b. Except for the Shockley partial dislocations, stair-rod dislocations also initiate on the first shearing boundary due to the interaction of Shockley partial dislocations on different crystallographic planes, and a large number of perfect dislocations are also formed on the second shearing boundary causing the materials removed in shearing mechanism. Besides that, a mass of dislocations including Shockley partial and stair-rod dislocations are evolution in the chip in front of the tool rake face. According to Fig.  7 b, the shearing angle is about 40 ° which is the largest compared to the cutting process at other cutting directions. This is because a large stagnation region formed in front of the cutting edge works like a build-up edge sharping the tool edge and making the rake angle of the cutting tool positive. The size of build-up edge tends to increase and attain a stable state with the increase of cutting distance. Therefore, a build-up edge making the cutting tool with <b>positive</b> <b>rake</b> angle and sharp edge increases the shearing angle in the cutting process. After the cutting edge pass through, almost no dislocations and stacking faults are initiated and left in the machined subsurface. It makes the machined surface has a better roughness.|$|E

The teeth profile, as well as the tooth configuration are of fundamental importance for the blade performances; through a combination of blade rigidity and grinding wheel condition a good quality surface finish is attained for tools of commercial standard. The materials used for the production of circular saw blades are ranging from high speed steel to cemented carbides. In particular, cemented carbides, being characterized by high hardness and strength, are used in applications where materials with high wear resistance and toughness are required. The main constituents of cemented carbides are tungsten carbide and cobalt. Tungsten carbide imparts the alloys the necessary strength and wear resistance, whereas cobalt contributes to the toughness and ductility of the alloys. The WC-Co alloys are tailored for specific applications by the proper choice of tungsten carbide grain size and the cobalt content. The grain size of the tungsten carbide in WC-Co varies from about 40 μm to around 0. 3 μm, the cobalt content from 3 to 30 wt%. The coarse grained hard metals are mainly used in mining applications, the smallest grain size being about 3 μm and the minimum cobalt content 6 wt%. The grain size of tungsten carbide in the metal cutting industry, as well as for universal applications lies in the range of 1 - 2 μm.

40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on {{characterization of the}} surface microstructure evolution in pure copper after severe plastic deformation {{in the form of}} 2 ̆ 2 wave 2 ̆ 2 sliding. This deformation process is based on conventional machining with modifications in the deformation geometry which leads to a drastic change in the output. Instead of the formation of a severely deformed chip, all the deformation goes into the workpiece, forming a severely deformed region in the workpiece subsurface. The amount of strain imposed into the subsurface of the material depends on the tool rake angle and the strain rate depends on the tool speed. In the present work, this deformation method is used to study the evolution of surface microstructure with strain and strain rate, and also the development of subsurface microstructure with depth from the surface. Three rake angles of - 60 °, - 70 ° and - 80 ° and two speeds of 1 and 200 mm/s were used in 2 ̆ 2 wave 2 ̆ 2 sliding, and two rake angles of 0 and + 50 ° and speed of 10 mm/s were used in machining (chip formation) to study the surface microstructure evolution. ^ Surface and subsurface microstructures of the deformed specimens were characterized with a range of techniques including specimen preparation and imaging in the Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB/SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and Vickers microhardness. Microstructural characteristics addressed in this dissertation involve boundary spacing and misorientation of the dislocation structures formed after the deformation. Texture evolution was also addressed. ^ It was shown that the material flow during 2 ̆ 2 wave 2 ̆ 2 sliding at - 70 ° and - 80 ° rake angle was laminar while at - 60 ° was rotational; which resulted in subsurface homogeneous (∼ 1) at - 70 °, (∼ 0. 5) at - 80 ° degree and heterogeneous (∼ 2 - 3. 5) at - 60 ° effective strain distributions, respectively. It was also shown that simple shear was the main deformation mode in 2 ̆ 2 wave 2 ̆ 2 sliding. Deformation textures developed in machining and 2 ̆ 2 wave 2 ̆ 2 sliding were proven to be of simple shear type and similar those developed in torsion and ECAP. The microstructures and textures developed at the surface of a chip rake face and corresponding machined surface were similar reflecting that the same effective strain was imposed in both surfaces. It was observed that in 2 ̆ 2 wave 2 ̆ 2 sliding, the material strain-hardened to a larger depth with one pass at a more <b>positive</b> <b>rake</b> angle, and with each pass (1 - 8) at - 70 ° rake angle.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed experimental programme on understanding {{the mechanics of}} drilling in porous brittle solids. Gypsum {{was used as a}} model material for this experimental study, in which the mechanics of drilling was decoupled into equivalent problems of indentation and cutting. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanics of indentation and cutting was gained by performing experiments in 2 -D conditions. A camera and microscope assembly was used to capture images at high temporal and spatial resolution to measure the in situ deformation. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) algorithm was used to measure the deformation parameters such as velocity, strain-rate, strain and volume change. In the last part of this research, drilling experiments were performed in 3 -D conditions and an attempt was made for understanding the mechanics of drilling by relating the drilling experiment results to that of indentation and cutting. A series of wedge indentation experiments were performed under 2 -D plane-strain conditions. Development of a parabolic zone of deformation, surrounding the indenter, was observed, wherein this size of the deformation zone and the strain accumulation in the deformation zone was a function of the geometry of the indenter. The maximum effective strain decreased and the overall strain field was more diffuse with increase in the wedge angle. Significant volume change was also observed in this deformation zone and the amount of volume change increased with increase in the porosity of the material. The zones of high volume change (compaction bands) were stacked in the form of layers oriented perpendicular to the direction of indentation. These compaction bands were more localized for the case of lower angles of wedge indenter. The extent of the compaction bands was also a function of porosity and spread over a larger area for the case of low porosity samples. A change in the material response was also observed with change in porosity and geometry of the indenter. The appearance of the crack was delayed with increase in porosity and reduction of wedge angle. The experimental results were also used to validate an analytical cavity expansion model. A better prediction of indentation pressure {{and the size of the}} deformation zone was possible after volume change corrections were incorporated into the cavity expansion formulation. A series of orthogonal cutting experiments were performed in 2 -D plane-strain conditions. The e ect of tool geometry and the depth of cut on the mechanics of cutting was studied with the help of image based measurements and cutting force signatures. Different types of cutting mechanisms were observed for the case of positive and negative rake angle tool. A cyclic increase and decrease in the cutting force was observed in case of <b>positive</b> <b>rake</b> angle cutting tool. The decrease in the cutting force corresponded to the initiation of crack from the tip of the tool. The crack traversed towards the surface of the material and resulted in the removal of a material chip. With progress of cutting, the tool scratched the material surface, giving rise to the gradual increase in the cutting force as it again reached local maxima when the tool completely re-engaged with the material. For the case of negative rake angle, apart from cyclic increase and decrease of the cutting force, there was a development of a triangular dead zone at the tip of the cutting tool. The size of the dead zone varied cyclically with the progress of cutting. The length of crack, which resulted in the removal of the chip from the material, was found to be a function of the rake angle and the depth of cut. Drilling experiments were performed on gypsum samples in 3 -D conditions. Two types of twist drills with different helix angles were used for this research work. Experiments were performed on the samples with two different porosities. Thrust force and torque signatures were recorded for five values of depth of cut per revolution. Since these experiments were performed in 3 -D, image analysis was not performed. However, in order to ascertain a qualitative understanding of the drilling process, few experiments were performed on the edge of the material surface so that a cylindrical groove with semicircular cross section is made and the exposed surface of the material and the drill were imaged. The normalized thrust force and normalized torque were compared with indentation pressure and cutting force signatures and remarkable similarities between them was found. A transition from ductile to brittle type of response was observed with increase in the depth of cut per revolution, which was similar to what was observed in case of indentation. The magnitude of torque was found to be higher for high helix angle drills, which was counter to what was observed in cutting, which was due to the deposition of the material in helix for high helix angle drills, resulting in the reduction of the effective helix angle. An approximate estimate of the effective helix angle was made with the help of analytical solutions as well as from the qualitative analysis of the images...|$|E
