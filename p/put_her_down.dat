25|$|Mrs Norris: The officious, skinflint {{older sister}} of Lady Bertram, {{who lives near}} Mansfield Park. Her husband, Mr Norris, was the parson at Mansfield Park until his death. She dislikes Fanny and takes every {{opportunity}} to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> and {{make a distinction between}} Fanny's treatment and that of her wealthier cousins. Mrs Norris also takes every opportunity to save money, such as taking jellies and sewing materials from the main house for her own home. Historian and biographer Jon Spence suggested in Becoming Jane Austen that Mrs Norris was based on Austen's sister-in-law Mary Lloyd, who had married James Austen, and who was the younger sister of Austen's close friend Martha Lloyd.|$|E
2500|$|Writer Jane Espenson {{believes}} one of {{the reasons}} why Faith elicits sympathy from the audience is the touching father/daughter relationship between her and the Mayor, comparing their affection for one another to that between vampires Spike and Drusilla in the earlier season. The writers wanted to make both Faith and the Mayor as human as possible by showing they need connection and love as much as the heroic characters. Eliza Dushku claims Faith's bond with the Mayor stems from his being {{one of the}} few people in her life who does not <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> which is something she has battled with her whole life; Dushku goes on to say Faith's misplaced trust in the Mayor [...] "leads her into being more crazy".|$|E

House has Foreman stand her up again, and she crashes, {{but as soon as}} they <b>put</b> <b>her</b> back <b>down,</b> she again stabilizes.|$|R
5000|$|Sykes abuses Delia {{physically}} {{by beating}} her, economically by taking her income, and emotionally by <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> for <b>her</b> body type. The story investigates the psychological {{effects of an}} abusive relationship.|$|R
6000|$|... "See {{if it is}} not so." [...] And <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> papa {{went off}} with great strides, while she ran {{laughing}} after him, all her doubts set at rest by this agreeable energy on his part.|$|R
60|$|He then <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> on the Queen's lap, where she, purring, {{played with}} her Majesty's hand, and then sang herself to sleep.|$|E
60|$|She held up quivering lips. Her father sobbed, but she, I remarked, did not. Having <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> {{he shook}} hands with the rest present, and departed.|$|E
60|$|Lucy did not faint then, but {{she came}} near it. Bostil <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> {{and led her}} through the lines of admiring Indians and applauding riders, and left her with the women.|$|E
5000|$|Erma Crosgrain â€”the unseen nemesis of Ruby and Nadine. Although {{they are}} always <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> and calling <b>her</b> a tramp, they envy {{the fact that she}} is able to pick up a man at the bar.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Treat {{took her}} in her {{enormous}} arms, and, having kissed her, <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> quickly, and clasped Toby {{as if he had}} been a very small walnut and her arms a very large pair of nutcrackers.|$|E
60|$|The sisters {{all came}} down {{together}} with the little one, and Flora <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> within the arm her father stretched out for her. He gazed into the baby face, which, in its expressionless placidity, almost recalled her mother's tranquil sweetness.|$|E
5000|$|A {{section is}} missing, {{and when the}} text resumes, Ptolemys {{servants}} are <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> before the house, and depart.

6000|$|The affair passed at one {{leap from}} a spree to a {{nightmare}} {{of violence and}} disgust. Her hair got loose, her hat came over one eye, {{and she had no}} arm free to replace it. She felt she must suffocate if these men did not <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> and for a time they would not <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down.</b> Then with an indescribable relief her feet were on the pavement, and she was being urged along by two policemen, who were gripping her wrists in an irresistible expert manner. She was writhing to get her hands loose and found herself gasping with passionate violence, [...] "It's damnable!--damnable!" [...] to the manifest disgust of the fatherly policeman on her right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comme a l'ordinaire," [...] muttered Dermot. Eustace made {{a little}} {{stammering}} about the thing being so near {{that no one could}} tell, and Dora referred again to Harold, who <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> with a muttered [...] "Never mind" [...] under his beard.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{take this}} lady to Malcolm, Roberts, and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> {{where she can}} get to the station," [...] he said to the engineer. [...] "Nobody will see you have a passenger, but if the agent's curious, I'll fix the thing with him." ...|$|E

6000|$|She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> {{forehead}} <b>down</b> on {{the back}} of her hand and laughed again. [...] "You ought to be photographed. You look as if you were sitting for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The English {{astonished}} her, {{and somehow}} it daunted her, for the mask spoke very gravely; {{but she would}} not let him imagine that he had <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> and she rejoined laughingly, [...] "Oh, I knew that you hadn't spoken, but I thought I would make you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you like}} it, Polly?" [...] I asked. She never answered, but gazed long, {{and at last}} a {{darkness}} went trembling through her sensitive eye, as she said, [...] "Put me down."

6000|$|... "Don't mind her," [...] {{said another}} of the pussys, in a rather contemptuous voice; [...] "it's her first ribbon, and she's so vain she can think of nothing else. <b>Put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down</b> and take one of us; we can talk {{to you in a}} {{sensible}} way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{shall never}} see my {{grandson}} any more!' answered she. 'Mink has killed him, oh! oh!' And <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> head <b>down,</b> {{she began to}} weep as loudly as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{child is}} very {{young to be}} sent alone," [...] said she, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> candle <b>down</b> on the table. She {{considered}} me attentively {{for a minute or}} two, then further added-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> glass <b>down,</b> {{and noticed}} that Jack's {{eyes were fixed on}} her, with a solemn and scrutinizing attention. [...] "Do you see {{anything}} remarkable in me?" [...] she asked lightly.|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{always took}} {{the side of}} the man who was down, and, consequently, very often put himself on the wrong side; and {{although}} he did not consider that Miss Drane was down, he saw that Miss Panney had tried to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down,</b> and therefore he became her champion.|$|E
60|$|Again in {{the crowded}} streets so full of traffic, people turned to look after her.

60|$|Her {{father was}} delighted. Anna {{was very proud}} in her bearing, too {{naturally}} indifferent to smaller bonds to satisfy Ilkeston, which {{would have liked to}} <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>down.</b> But Brangwen was having no such thing. If she chose to be royal, royal she should be. He stood like a rock between her and the world.|$|E
