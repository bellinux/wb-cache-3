Mesic savannas of the Northern Territory, Australia. Byram 2 ̆ 7 s fire-line intensity (If), fuel load and architecture, and two post-fire indicators of fire intensity - scorch height (SH) and char height (CH) of woody vegetation - were determined for fires in native grass savanna and A. gayanus invaded savanna. Leaf scorch is the height at which the fire 2 ̆ 7 s radiant heat browns leaf tissue, and leaf char is the height that radiant <b>heat</b> <b>blackens</b> or consumes leaf tissue and provides an indirect measure of flame height. These data, and 5 years of similar data collected from the Kapalga Fire Project in Kakadu National Park, were used to develop empirical relationships between If and the post-fire indices of fire intensity. A relationship between A. gayanus If and SH could not be developed because complete canopy scorch occurred in most A. gayanus fires, even at low If. In contrast, A. gayanus If was strongly correlated with CH. This empirical relationship was substantially different from that for native grass fires. For a given If, there was a significantly greater CH in invaded sites. This increase in radiant heat is attributable to the increased biomass (mean 3. 6 t ha⁻&sup 1; in native grasses compared to 11. 6 t ha⁻&sup 1; in A. gayanus) and height (approximately 0. 5 m in native grasses compared to 4...|$|R
30|$|Darkening {{phenomena}} {{observed on}} painted surfaces upon intense and direct laser irradiation. The sensitivity of most pigments to the direct exposure to laser irradiation {{is an important}} issue, which requires careful study and thorough approach. Relevant research [12 – 16] {{has pointed out that}} darkening or, in the worst case scenario, <b>blackening</b> of <b>painted</b> surfaces is a material related alteration which occurs upon direct exposure to laser radiation. Although initially it was believed that such undesired alteration is irrelevant to the binding medium as it affects both paints and pigments in raw form, recent studies on the basis of different ablative methodologies using lasers of various wavelengths and pulse durations, proved that the presence of a binding media that absorbs highly the employed laser wavelength may safeguard the pigment itself [16]. Therefore for cleaning applications that involve painted components or surfaces a number of parameters must be thoroughly considered.|$|R
40|$|Aim  This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} changes in fire severity {{resulting from the}} invasion of Australia’s tropical savannas by the African grass Andropogon gayanus Kunth. (gamba grass). Location  Mesic savannas of the Northern Territory, Australia. Method  Byram’s fire-line intensity (If), fuel load and architecture, and two post-fire indicators of fire intensity – scorch height (SH) and char height (CH) of woody vegetation – were determined for fires in native grass savanna and A. gayanus invaded savanna. Leaf scorch is the height at which the fire’s radiant heat browns leaf tissue, and leaf char is the height that radiant <b>heat</b> <b>blackens</b> or consumes leaf tissue and provides an indirect measure of flame height. These data, and 5 years of similar data collected from the Kapalga Fire Project in Kakadu National Park, were used to develop empirical relationships between If and the post-fire indices of fire intensity. Results  A relationship between A. gayanus If and SH could not be developed because complete canopy scorch occurred in most A. gayanus fires, even at low If. In contrast, A. gayanus If was strongly correlated with CH. This empirical relationship was substantially different from that for native grass fires. For a given If, there was a significantly greater CH in invaded sites. This increase in radiant heat is attributable to the increased biomass (mean 3. 6 t ha− 1 in native grasses compared to 11. 6 t ha− 1 in A. gayanus) and height (approximately 0. 5 m in native grasses compared to 4 m in A. gayanus) of the standing fine fuel. Main conclusion Andropogon gayanus invasion resulted in substantial changes in fire behaviour. This has important regional implications owing to the current (10, 000 – 15, 000 km 2) and predicted (380, 000 km 2) area of invasion and the negative consequences for the native savanna biota that has evolved with frequent but relatively low-intensity fire...|$|R
50|$|Adherents of {{the school}} of {{philosophy}} founded by Kanada considered the atom to be indestructible, and hence eternal. They believed atoms to be minute objects invisible to the naked eye which come into being and vanish in an instant. Vaiseshikas further held that atoms of same substance combined with each other to produce dvyanuka (diatomic molecules) and tryanuka (triatomic molecules). Kanada also put forward the idea that atoms could be combined in various ways to produce chemical changes in presence of other factors such as <b>heat.</b> He gave <b>blackening</b> of earthern pot and ripening of fruit as examples of this phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{transient}} {{analysis of}} a built-in storage solar water heater is presented; the results obtained by the present theory are {{in close agreement with}} experimental observations as well as with predictions obtained by a more rigorous theory. The water heater consits of an insulated rectangular tank whose top surface is suitably <b>blackened</b> by blackboard <b>paint</b> and then glazed. The unit is exposed to solar radiation during sunshine hours and is covered by adequate insulation at night. The effect of insulation thicknesses (top and bottom insulation) and water mass in the tank is discussed. The importance of using a reflecting sheet instead of insulation is emphasised. ...|$|R

This treatment changes the crystalline {{structure of the}} metal, so that the caps shield the tubes from {{the influence of the}} earth's magnetic field. The treatment has three stages: recrystallising and decarbonising, steamblackening and controlled cooling. The three separate kilns, in which the process used to take place, have now been replaced by a single tunnel kiln. Since the process is now continuous and no more energy is lost during the cooling down period between th different stages, substantial energy savings have been achieved. ...|$|R

The collector consists of a plane network of polythene pipes buried in a sand mass which is kept in a wooden case, the top surface of the sand being fixed by mixing with sodium silicate, <b>blackened</b> with blackboard <b>paint</b> spray and suitably glazed. The heat can be extracted by fluids passing through the pipes. For a 2 cm depth of the plane of heat retrieval and 0 Â· 46 litre/min flow rate of water, the collector efficiency is about 55 per cent. The efficiency increases with the flow rate and decreases with the depth of the plane of heat retrieval. ...|$|R

40|$|Emphasizing {{that for}} any known toxic metal no safe dose level exists, this review {{describes}} existing {{evidence of the}} tetragenic effects of metal toxins on childhood development. Discussion of the currently available evidence of toxic effects focuses on cadmium, mercury, aluminum, arsenic, and, extensively, lead. The multicollinearity of metals is emphasized, and it is posited that metal interactions have a unique, negative, and synergistic relationship to children 's psychologic performance. The continuing lack of relevant and precise knowledge {{of the effects of}} low level exposure to toxic metals is noted. In the early 1970 s I was a teacher of children with learning and behavior disorders at Public School Number 12, an inner city elementary school situated in a chemical industrial neighborhood in south central Indianapolis. The neighborhood was composed of tiny shack-like houses (sources of peeling lead <b>paint),</b> <b>blackened</b> lots, and rutted roads, set amongst the giant buildings of the chemical plants. Directly {{across the street from the}} school was a chemical corporation making paint and pigments. By day and night the school and its neighborhood were clouded with the fumes that poured from the vents and smokestacks of the adjacent chemical plants. At night the sky was a brownish yellow. During winter semester, Kenthia, a ten year old girl with borderline mental retardation and disordered behavior, fell into convulsions in the back of her classroom. Hospitalized, she was diagnosed as lead poisoned. Soil samples taken from her family's residence turned up disturbing quantities of cadmium, arsenic, mercury and lead.

6000|$|Lying there, still awake, he {{reflected}} that he wouldn't be a scout when he grew up, {{but would be}} something like Mr. Peyton, and have a train like this, and invite the Silsbees and Susy to accompany him. For this purpose, he and Susy, early to-morrow morning, would get permission {{to come in here}} and play at that game. This would familiarize him with the details, so that he would be able at any time to take charge of it. He was already an authority on the subject of Indians! He had once been fired at--as an Indian. He would always carry a rifle like that hanging from the hooks at the end of the wagon before him, and would eventually slay many Indians and keep an account of them in a big book like that on the desk. Susy would help him, having grown up a lady, and they would both together issue provisions and rations from the door of the wagon to the gathered crowds. He would be known as the [...] "White Chief," [...] his Indian name being [...] "Suthin of a Pup." [...] He would have a circus van attached to the train, in which he would occasionally perform. He would also have artillery for protection. There would be a terrific engagement, and he would rush into the wagon, <b>heated</b> and <b>blackened</b> with gunpowder; and Susy would put down an account of it in a book, and Mrs. Peyton--for she would be there in some vague capacity--would say, [...] "Really, now, I don't see but what we were very lucky in having such a boy as Clarence with us. I begin to understand him better." [...] And Harry, who, for purposes of vague poetical retaliation, would also drop in at that moment, would mutter and say, [...] "He is certainly the son of Colonel Brant; dear me!" [...] and apologize. And his mother would come in also, in her coldest and most indifferent manner, in a white ball dress, and start and say, [...] "Good gracious, how that boy has grown! I am sorry I did not see more of him when he was young." [...] Yet even in the midst of this came a confusing numbness, and then the side of the wagon seemed to melt away, and he drifted out again alone into the empty desolate plain from which even the sleeping Susy had vanished, and he was left deserted and forgotten. Then all was quiet in the wagon, and only the night wind moving round it. But lo! the lashes of the sleeping White Chief--the dauntless leader, the ruthless destroyer of Indians--were wet with glittering tears! ...|$|R
