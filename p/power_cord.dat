5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prairie Village home {{purchase}} fell through, however, the couple's Missouri home caught fire while {{the family was}} out. Insurance investigators later determined that the fire was caused by an electrical short in a <b>power</b> <b>cord.</b> Though the house was reparable and the couple's home insurance paid out on the damage and lost property, the couple decided to move on, and Green and the children moved into the apartment in which Farrar had been living during the separation while {{the purchase of the}} Prairie Village home was re-negotiated.|$|E
5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's <b>power</b> <b>cord,</b> and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving {{their bodies and}} the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E

25|$|Transformer-less power {{supplies}} required safety precautions in their design {{to limit the}} shock hazard to users, such as electrically insulated cabinets and an interlock tying the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> to the cabinet back, so the line cord was necessarily disconnected if the user or service person opened the cabinet. A cheater cord was a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} heating element in the cylinder block, connected through a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. Some heaters pump and circulate the engine coolant while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|E
25|$|The diagram {{depicts the}} {{internal}} mechanism of a residual-current device (RCD). The device {{is designed to}} be wired in-line in an appliance <b>power</b> <b>cord.</b> It is rated to carry a maximal current of 13 A and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30 mA. This is an active RCD; that is, it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure, a useful feature for equipment that could be dangerous on unexpected re-energisation. Some early RCDs were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung over-centre mechanisms driven directly from the current transformer. As these are hard to manufacture to the required accuracy and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out, the electronically amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant.|$|E

25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or {{at a weld}} point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power on-off) cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.|$|E
25|$|Randall {{returns home}} to Kingston Falls where {{he gives the}} mogwai to Billy as a pet. Billy works in the local bank, where he fears his dog Barney will be {{captured}} and killed by the elderly Mrs. Deagle. Randall names the mogwai “Gizmo” and Billy makes sure to treat him well. When Billy’s friend Pete spills {{a glass of water}} over Gizmo, five more mogwai spawn from his back, a more troublemaking sort led by the aggressive Stripe. Billy shows one of the mogwai to his former science teacher Mr. Hanson, spawning another mogwai, who Hanson experiments on. Back at home, Stripe’s gang tricks Billy into feeding them after midnight by chewing out the <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> to his bedside clock. They make cocoons, as does Hanson’s mogwai. Shortly after, the cocoons hatch and they emerge as mischievous, reptilian monsters that torture Gizmo and try to murder Billy’s mother, while Hanson is killed by his gremlin.|$|E

25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable <b>power</b> <b>cord</b> (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening power tools may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E
