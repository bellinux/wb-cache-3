5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several weeks}} of air attacks and a short naval bombardment, {{soldiers}} of the Australian 24th Brigade were landed on Labuan from American and Australian ships on 10 June. The Australians quickly captured the island's harbour and main airfield. The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior of Labuan, and offered little resistance to the landing. The initial Australian attempts to penetrate the Japanese <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days after the invasion were not successful, and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment. A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June, but was defeated. Later that day, Australian forces assaulted the Japanese <b>position.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following days, Australian patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island. A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured. Australian casualties included 34 killed.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{differences}} in individual conative characteristics and in perceived group cohesion of the basketball players playing <b>in</b> different <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team could provide guidelines for a better selection of basketball players and better coaching work. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> <b>positions</b> of guards and forwards/ centres, and <b>the</b> four major <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team. The final sample of subjects (74 basketball players) is selected from the initial sample of 107 subjects, selected from nine men’s senior basketball teams that played in A- 1 Croatian men’s basketball league championship in 2006 / 2007. The results showed no statistically significant difference between basketball players who play <b>in</b> different <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team, neither <b>in</b> relation to two basic <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team (guards as opposed to forwards/centres), nor <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> four <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward/centre) ...|$|R
