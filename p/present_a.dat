30|$|This article <b>presents</b> <b>an</b> {{algorithm}} architecture matching of FastSLAM 2.0 algorithm on {{a heterogeneous}} architecture integrating a CPU and a GPGPU. Only few works {{deal with the}} implementation of FastSLAM 2.0 on such embedded systems. Authors in [1] <b>presented</b> <b>a</b> hardware software co-design approach of the importance weight calculation and particle update on a NIOS II processor. Moyers et al.

[3] <b>presented</b> <b>a</b> heterogeneous implementation of adaptive particle filters based on an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a CPU for mobile robot localization and people tracking applications. There is no full implementation of FastSLAM 2.0 on an embedded CPU-GPGPU published to this date. In the state of the art, we found that only the particle filter, as an algorithm of its own used for filtering, has recently been studied. Tosun et al.
