40|$|International audienceIEEE 802. 16 {{standard}} suite defines {{two main}} <b>polling</b> mode: unicast <b>polling</b> and contention-base <b>polling</b> including multicast and broadcast <b>polling.</b> Unicast <b>polling</b> completely overcomes the request collision and {{is suitable for}} real-time application. Contention-based <b>polling</b> suffers from collisions and is suitable for non-real-time applications. Though the standard defined different service classes for implementing the <b>polling</b> mechanisms, it does not define exactly an adaptation <b>polling</b> mechanism to efficiently allocate bandwidth. In this paper we evaluate the performance of different <b>polling</b> mechanisms defined in IEEE 802. 16 by simulation. We also propose a new optimal unicast and contention-based mixed <b>polling</b> mechanism and show that this optimal mixed <b>polling</b> mechanism could always achieve better performance than any <b>polling</b> mechanisms defined in IEEE 802. 16...|$|R

5|$|HMV's Poll of <b>Polls</b> was {{an annual}} list of albums {{compiled}} by British music retailer HMV from 1998 to 2012. The listing was created each December by collating year-end <b>polls</b> from approximately 30music magazines, newspapers and guides {{to determine the}} most critically acclaimed albums of the year. An album's placing in the list {{was determined by the}} number of different <b>polls</b> in which it was included. In the event of two records featuring in the same number of <b>polls,</b> the album with the highest combined placings was given the higher position on the Poll of <b>Polls.</b> In 2011, Let England Shake by PJ Harvey was named the best album of the year after receiving 21nominations– the following year, Channel Orange by Frank Ocean topped the poll with 22nominations.|$|E

50|$|An {{entrance}} <b>poll</b> is a <b>poll</b> that {{is taken}} before voters have cast their votes at the <b>polling</b> stations. It {{is akin to}} an opinion <b>poll</b> {{in the sense that}} it asks who the voter plans to vote for or some similar set of questions. The possibility that the prospective voter might change his mind after the <b>poll</b> is very small compared to that of an opinion <b>poll,</b> therefore the margin of error of an entrance <b>poll</b> is expected to be lower than that of an opinion <b>poll.</b> However, the methodology of conducting an entrance <b>poll</b> is closer to that of an exit <b>poll,</b> where actual voters are being queried as opposed to potential voters in an opinion <b>poll.</b>|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{the hybrid}} <b>polling</b> method is {{proposed}} for the direct link communication between STAs in IEEE 802.11 infrastructure networks. By the proposed <b>polling</b> method, we can integrate the sequential <b>polling</b> method in [8], which was originally developed to support the uplink data transmission from the STAs to the AP, and the simultaneous <b>polling</b> method in [7] properly according to the interference condition. In cases where the simultaneous <b>polling</b> method is not effective because of severe interference, the proposed <b>polling</b> method can employ the sequential <b>polling</b> method to complement the simultaneous <b>polling</b> method.|$|R

5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion <b>polls</b> – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four <b>polls</b> of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal <b>polls</b> showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E
