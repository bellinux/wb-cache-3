As the terrorists and hostages alike began to fall unconscious, several of the female terrorists made a dash for the balcony but passed out before they reached the stairs. They were later found shot dead. Two of the Alpha Group were also overcome by the gas.|$|E

25|$|The Danish {{national}} broadcaster faced {{some problems}} whilst organising the contest {{such as the}} lack of funds {{and the search for}} a suitable venue. The event was eventually located in the football stadium Parken, after the company running the stadium agreed to add a retractable roof to the building. This solution made it the biggest venue ever to host a Eurovision Song Contest, but the scale of it wasn't entirely a success: many of the 38,000 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> could not see the stage, and for many entries the hall appeared to be too big.|$|E

Williams had already checked the veracity of the booklet and picture, but he asked publicly if Burns was recognised and it was confirmed and Hori Waiti learnt that Burns was his father.

Later, Robinson stated: [...] "We know that the big two parties carefully select audiences to give a particular appearance. Is it a great controversy to point this out?

500|$|The {{scene where}} Ray Patterson is {{reinstated}} (to which he enters and exits to the Sanford and Son theme song) was {{a reference to}} a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx (who starred on Sanford and Son). During a show in Vegas, Redd Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very few <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Foxx angrily stated that he refused to do a show with such a small audience and walked off the stage. The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leaving, simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again. The same incident was the basis for the joke in [...] "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] where Moe Szyslak walks onto the stage and, without breaking his stride, walks off.|$|E

500|$|Harvey {{has said}} of her time with Automatic Dlamini: [...] "I ended up not singing very much but I was just happy {{to learn how to}} play the guitar. I wrote a lot during the time I was with them but my first songs were crap. I was {{listening}} to a lot of Irish folk music at the time, so the songs were folky and full of penny whistles and stuff. It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> and I probably did learn that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Beck {{began as}} a folk musician, {{switching}} between country blues, Delta blues and more traditional rural folk music in his teens. He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions. [...] "I'd {{get on the bus}} and start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I'd start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up," [...] he later recalled. He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted Dadaist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops. [...] "We had Radio Shack mics and this homemade speaker and we'd draft <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing, or we'd tie the whole audience up in masking tape," [...] Beck recalled.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} night, {{the band}} opened for Willie Nelson at Toronto's prestigious Massey Hall. A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid-set, with <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> yelling [...] "here comes the gravy!" [...] when Thornton {{tried to explain}} he liked Canadians but not the CBC radio host. Before the show, {{when asked about his}} [...] "gravy" [...] comment, Thornton claimed {{he was talking about the}} radio host. Local reviews of Thornton's Toronto performance were not positive. Toronto Star called Thornton's voice a [...] "high, tinny whine" [...] and The Globe and Mail commented that [...] "Nelson could teach Billy Bob Thornton more than a few things". On April 10, The Boxmasters dropped out of the tour early, announcing that they would not be playing with Nelson during subsequent concerts scheduled in London, Ontario and Montreal. Thornton said that band members had come down with the flu. Willie Nelson's publicist had no comment.|$|E

500|$|The tour {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics who praised Knowles' vocal abilities, dancing, choreography and energy on stage during the shows performed simultaneously.

Twenty-nine shows were submitted to Billboards boxscore grossing $24.9 million, with 272,521 fans attending the performances. The tour grossed $90 million from 96 shows in total. Throughout the tour several incidents happened; the pyrotechnics meant for the stage injured two <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> Knowles fell {{down a flight of}} stairs during a performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] and had a wardrobe malfunction. A show in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on November 1, 2007 was relocated to Jakarta, Indonesia due to Malaysia's strict rules surrounding the clothing worn by female performers.

The scene where Moe walks on and off the stage without breaking his stride was loosely based on a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx. During a show in Las Vegas, Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very few <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> Foxx reacted angrily refusing to do a show with such a small audience and walked off.

500|$|The Cockroaches' former manager, Jeremy Fabinyi, {{became the}} group's first manager. [...] Using their {{previous}} connections, he {{negotiated with the}} ABC to air their TV show {{and to help them}} promote their first recording. [...] The album cost approximately A$4,000 to produce and it sold 100,000 copies in 1991. [...] Field and Cook got teaching jobs, while Page finished his degree, so they could only perform during school holidays; finding time to do so was, as Field reported, [...] "challenging". [...] Fabinyi advised them to tour in unusual settings throughout Sydney and New South Wales. [...] The Wiggles' debut performance was at a friend's daycare facility in Randwick, for about a dozen children. They played for crowds at shopping centres like Westfield in Sydney and at small pre-school events and parties, and busked at Circular Quay, then moved on to regional tours and shows for playgroup associations, averaging about 300 <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> [...] They were promoted by local playgroups or nursing mothers' associations with whom they split their proceeds. [...] They performed at pre-schools with other ABC children's performers; when 500 people attended these concerts just to see The Wiggles, they started doing their own shows, and according to Field, [...] "Suddenly people started rolling up to performances in astonishing numbers".|$|E

50|$|The {{situation}} {{got worse}} later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shoot. A&M told Lambert they wanted more white <b>people</b> visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> There {{were a few}} scattered throughout, and {{under the guise of}} simple repositioning she began having them sit further forward. Eventually the crowd as a whole figured out what was really happening, and grew angry. Lambert told the record company representative that she absolutely could not go on due to the potential for violence, and he went out and explained things to the crowd, which calmed down enough to complete the video.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} 15 months, the trio {{released}} five singles, toured across the South, and appeared regularly on the Louisiana Hayride.

500|$|At the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony, where Björk premiered the song, {{she wore}} a very large dress which {{unfolded}} during her performance of [...] "Oceania" [...] to eventually occupy the entire stadium, and showed {{a map of the}} world in sign of union. Additionally, Björk wore [...] "bluish-purple glittery eye shadow across her lids. Her dark hair dangled in tiny twists that framed her pixieish, freckled face". Immediately after the performance at the Olympics opening ceremony, the song was downloaded more than 11,000 times on the iTunes Store. Jake Coyle from Today commented that her dress was [...] "reminiscent in its uniqueness to the infamous swan dress she wore to the Oscars in 2001". According to Jeremy D. Larson from Time, if it weren't for the fireworks {{at the end of the}} song, he was legitimately unsure if <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> would have cheered. Dominique Leone of Pitchfork was surprised by the committee's choice of bringing Björk to perform at the ceremony, and stated: [...] "They could have had anyone-- say, a reassuring Celine Dion or a physically ideal Beyoncé-- but they chose a prickly, decidedly uncomfortable Icelandic woman. On aesthetic grounds, I can't argue with their choice, but I continue to wonder about Björk's significance". [...] "Oceania" [...] was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007–08).|$|E
500|$|In July 1969, Martello {{attended}} an open {{meeting of the}} Mattachine Society's New York branch. He was appalled at the Society's negative reaction to the Stonewall riots, and castigated those gay <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> who accepted the categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness, accusing them of being self-loathing. He proceeded to publish his thoughts in an essay in which he stated that [...] "homosexuality {{is not a problem}} in itself. The problem is society's attitude towards it." [...] Those gay rights activists who rejected the Mattachine Society's approach and who favored a confrontational stance against the police and authorities founded the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), with Martello elected the group's first moderator. Martello supported the GLF's stance that condemned [...] "this rotten, dirty, vile, fucked-up capitalist conspiracy" [...] that dominated American society, and he volunteered by producing articles both for the group's newsletter Come Out! and for the wider press. He was involved in the GLF's campaign against The Village Voices decision to ban the word [...] "gay" [...] from advertisements; the magazine preferred the term [...] "homophile", which had also been used by the Mattachine Society. Wanting to break from previous gay liberation organizations, the GLF embraced the term [...] "gay", with Martello dismissing [...] "homophile" [...] as sounding like a nail file for homosexuals.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many of the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them." ...|$|E
50|$|Commentators praised Facebook Safety Check <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{wake of the}} April 2015 Nepal {{earthquake}} and compared it to Google Person Finder, a tool by Google with a similar purpose.
