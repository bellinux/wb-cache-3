2500|$|Soda ash (sodium carbonate) and potash (potassium carbonate), collectively termed alkali, {{are vital}} {{chemicals}} in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. [...] The traditional source of alkali in western Europe had been potash obtained from wood ashes.

[...] Potash was imported from North America, Scandinavia, and Russia, where large forests still stood. Soda ash was imported from Spain and the Canary Islands, where it was produced {{from the ashes of}} glasswort plants (called barilla ashes in Spain), or imported from Syria. The soda ash from glasswort <b>plant</b> <b>ashes</b> was mainly a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} forty-one glass {{fragments}} from medieval Ciudad de Vascos (Toledo, Spain) were analysed by laser ablation {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The glasses fall into three types according to the fluxing agents used: mineral natron, soda-rich <b>plant</b> <b>ash,</b> and a combination of soda ash and lead. The natron glasses can be assigned to various established primary production groups of eastern Mediterranean provenance. Different types of <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glasses indicate differences in the silica source {{as well as the}} <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> component, reflecting changing supply mechanisms. While the earlier <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> groups can be related to Islamic glasses from the Near East, both in terms of typology and composition, the chemical signature of the later samples appear to be specific to glass from the Iberian Peninsula. This has important implications for our understanding of the emerging glass industry in Spain and the distribution patterns of glass groups and raw materials. The <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> that was used for the Vascos glasses is rich in soda with low levels of potash, similar to ash produced in the eastern Mediterranean. It could therefore be possible that Levantine <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> was imported and used in Islamic period glass workshops in Spain. Unlike central and northern Europe where an independent glass industry based on potassium-rich wood ash developed during the Carolingian period, the prevalence of soda ash and soda ash lead glass on the Iberian Peninsula indicates its commercial and technological interconnection with the Islamic east.

40|$|Strontium isotopic {{analysis}} {{has been proposed}} as a suitable method to determine the primary production location of ancient <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glasses. The technique {{is based upon the}} assumption that Sr enters this glass type with the <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> used as a flux material, and that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the resulting glass reflects the geological provenance of that flux. In such case, the bulk Sr isotopic composition of the bedrock should be inherited unchanged in the plants growing on that bedrock. Different types of <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glasses have been shown to have widely differing 87 Sr/ 86 Sr compositions. In this study, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr composition of several plant species growing on different bedrock types is measured, and compared to the bulk Sr isotopic composition and petrology of that bedrock. The paper shows that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of these plants is a function not only, or even mostly, of the local geology, but also of the Sr isotopic composition of the total water consumed by that plant. This is highly likely to be both plant species dependent and dependent on the small-scale hydrology of the area immediately surrounding the plant. In this way, no definite relation between the isotopic composition of a geological outcrop and the plants growing on this bedrock can be inferred. Hence, the isotopic composition of a <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> made from such plants is uncertain and moreover species dependent. Though groups of <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glasses can certainly be compared in time and space using Sr isotopes, it may prove difficult to ascertain a <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glass type to a specific geographical-geological region. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|To {{understand}} why the morphology and texture of calcite particles {{can be used as}} a proxy for the presence of washed ash in grounds, it is necessary to briefly review the composition of fresh ash and its evolution during weathering. <b>Plant</b> <b>ash</b> is a complex assemblage of particles of variable shape, texture, mineralogy, and chemical composition that has been extensively studied because of its technologic and economic role in natural, industrial, and archaeological contests [10, 14, 15]. <b>Plant</b> <b>ash</b> properties vary widely depending on the plant species, age, and wood parts, e.g. stem, bark, branches or twigs [11], as well as on the combustion temperature and the typology of soil where the plant grew [16, 17]. The mineralogical and chemical properties of ash are also affected by aging and weathering [10, 18], mostly by the interaction with water and the environment in general. Despite this complexity, some characteristics are common to the majority of <b>plant</b> <b>ash,</b> and recurrent in various natural and anthropogenic environments.|$|R
50|$|The {{total alkali}} content in {{analyzed}} samples of Egyptian blue {{is greater than}} 1%, suggesting the alkali was introduced deliberately into the mixture and not as an impurity from other components. Sources of alkali could either have been natron from areas such as Wadi Natroun and El-Kab, or <b>plant</b> <b>ash.</b> By measuring the amounts of potash and magnesia in the samples of Egyptian blue, it is generally possible to identify which source of alkali had been used, since the <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> contains higher amounts of potash and magnesia than the natron. However, due to the low concentration of alkali in Egyptian blue, which is a mere 4% or less, compared to glass, for example, which is at 10-20%, identifying the source is not always easy. The alkali source likely was natron, although {{the reasons for this}} assumption are unclear. However, analysis by Jaksch et al. of various samples of Egyptian blue identified variable amounts of phosphorus (up to 2 wt %), suggesting the alkali source used was in actuality <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> and not natron.

5000|$|The word [...] "alkali" [...] {{is derived}} from Arabic al qalīy (or alkali), meaning the {{calcined}} ashes (see calcination), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned <b>plant</b> <b>ashes,</b> called potash and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime), a far more strongly basic substance known as caustic potash (potassium hydroxide) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally {{used in conjunction with}} animal fats to produce soft soaps, one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of saponification, one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element potassium, which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol K (from the German name Kalium), which ultimately derived from alkali.|$|E

Archeological evidence, from 300,000 years ago, in the form of ancient hearths, earth ovens, burnt animal bones, and flint, are found across Europe and the Middle East.

40|$|The {{practice}} of re-melting glass was well known, certainly from the Roman period onwards. This {{can be seen}} not only in ancient literary evidence {{but also in the}} archaeological evidence, collections of broken glass have been found in, for example, Pompeii (79 AD) and the Iulia Felix shipwreck (Third century AD). Elevated levels of certain transition metals in archaeological glasses are interpreted as indications of the mixing and/or recycling of different glasses. Assumptions have been made that all glasses could be recycled, but to what extent are these valid? Why does the evidence for the recycling of glass only occur from the Roman period onwards? From the middle of the First millennium BC to the Ninth century AD, natron glass was the predominant glass type in the Mediterranean and Europe, however, <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glass was still in use in some areas. To test the effects on the final product of mixing different composition glass types, experimental glasses were made by mixing varying quantities of replica <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glass, replica natron glass, and a modern glass. At low temperatures crystalline material formed in the products containing replica <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glass. As the <b>plant</b> <b>ash</b> glass content increased, so too did the amount of crystalline material produced. This is due to a combination of the glass compositions and the firing temperature. It appears that natron type glass can be more easily recycled at lower temperatures, although, if a high enough temperature is used then most glass types can be recycled.
