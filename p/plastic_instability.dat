40|$|Pipe failure under {{internal}} pressure loading {{is understood as}} due to the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability.</b> Law et al. [1] extended the Considere’s construction [2], which predicts the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> for tensile test specimen, {{so that it can}} predict the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability,</b> and thus burst of pipes under {{internal pressure}}. They noted that “It {{is important to note that}} the reduced stress and strain where instability occurs is not a result of the biaxial stress state, but of the vessel geometry where increased stress comes from both increased inner diameter and reduced wall thickness ” [1]. However, they intrinsically assumed that the cylinder plane that experiences instability is in plane strain state. Considering the fact that power plant pipes are often subjected to axial force from sources such as thermal expansion/contraction or fixing, the effect of deviation from the plane strain conditions should be considered. For this purpose, the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> of the elastic-plastic internally pressurized 1) 2 D plane strain pipe, 2) 3 D pipe and 3) 3 D pipe additionally subjected to axial force, were compared. The results showed that the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> could be monitored at the pressure when pRm-σθt> 0 for all the cases. Here, Rm, σθ, and t are the current mean radius, circumferential stress at mean radius and thickness at pressure p. However, the strain at this instability pressure showed non-negligible change due to presence of axial loading. On this meaning, the biaxiality affected the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability...</b>|$|E

40|$|There several {{failure modes}} that are {{considered}} in the available codes and standards in field of pressure vessel and piping. One of these failure modes is <b>plastic</b> <b>instability.</b> This failure mode {{is defined as the}} pressure for which the components/structures approach dimensional instability (large deformation), i. e. unbounded displacement for a small increment in the applied load. In order to find this pressure both large deformation and strain hardening curve are considered. When the slope of numerically generated load-deformation curve approaching zero the corresponding applied load is considered as <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> load. Unlike cylindrical and spherical pressure vessels, available theoretical solution in range of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> load for conical shells are very limited. Hence, it would be very useful to predict the behavior of these components with acceptable accuracy for design purposes. Analytical expressions are derived to determined <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> load of s conical shell subjected to internal pressure and when it is subjected to hydrostatic pressure (i. e., storage tanks). The geometrical changes can be estimated using the proposed solutions when considering the material strain hardening curve. ...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear plastic modes (NPMs) are {{collective}} displacements {{that are}} indicative of imminent <b>plastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> in elastic solids. In this work we formulate the atomistic theory that describes the reversible evolution of NPMs and their associated stiffnesses under external deformations. The deformation-dynamics of NPMs is compared {{to those of the}} analogous observables derived from atomistic linear elastic theory, namely destabilizing eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix and their associated eigenvalues. The key result we present and explain is that the dynamics of NPMs and of destabilizing eigenmodes under external deformations follow different scaling laws with respect to the proximity to imminent instabilities. In particular, destabilizing modes vary with a singular rate, whereas NPMs' exhibit no such singularity. As a result, NPMs converge much earlier than destabilizing eigenmodes to their common final form at <b>plastic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> This dynamical difference between NPMs and linear destabilizing eigenmodes underlines the usefulness of NPMs for predicting the locus and geometry of <b>plastic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> compared to their linear-elastic counterparts.

40|$|Materials {{that flow}} soften exhibit <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> during {{compressive}} deformation when Considere 2 ̆ 7 s criterion is satisfied, i. e., {{when there is}} no increase in the force required to cause deformation. Further, theories developed by Hart and Jonas et al. show that the flow localization can occur during <b>plastic</b> <b>instability.</b> The strains at which the onset and termination of flow localization occur depend on the strain-rate sensitivity of the material. Flow localization initiates earlier and terminates later for a strain-rate sensitive material in comparison to a rate insensitive material. However, in an apparent contradiction, the deformation is more homogeneous in a strain-rate sensitive material. This paper presents the results of an investigation, using computer simulation, to visualize the deformation during constant strain-rate compression of flow softening materials with different strain-rate sensitivity. The effect of strain-rate sensitivity on the initiation and termination of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> and flow localization due to mechanical damage, geometric nonuniformities, and friction were studied. Parameters developed to describe the extent of inhomogeneity during deformation are used to explain the conclusions made by Jonas et al...|$|E
40|$|The {{recrystallization}} {{texture of}} highly cold deformed IF steels is addressed. The latter {{is characterized by}} the //ND fibre and a certain spread towards the { 311 } orientation. The //ND fibre is the optimum texture for enhanced deep-drawing properties whereas the presence of any other component, such as { 311 }, will deteriorate the plastic anisotropy of the material. Previous works concluded that the recrystallized { 311 } orientation results from an oriented nucleation process related to the <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> of { 001 } deformed grains. In the present work, the microstructural nature of such <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> is investigated by high resolution orientation scanning microscopy on an annealed IF sample after cross-rolling.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} within which a robust mechanical definition of precursors to <b>plastic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> often termed `soft-spots', naturally emerges. They are shown to be collective displacements (modes) ẑ_ 0 that correspond to local minima of the `barrier function' b(ẑ). The latter {{is derived from the}} cubic approximation of the variation δ U_ẑ(s) of the potential energy upon displacing particles a distance s along ẑ. We show that modes ẑ_ 0 corresponding to low-lying minima of b(ẑ) lead to transitions over energy barriers in the glass, and are therefore associated with highly asymmetric variations δ U_ẑ(s) with s. We further demonstrate how a heuristic search for local minima of b(ẑ) can a-priori detect the locus and geometry of imminent <b>plastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> with remarkable accuracy, at strains as large as γ_c-γ∼ 10 ^- 2 away from the instability strain γ_c, where the non-affine displacements under shear are still largely delocalized.

40|$|AbstractForming limit {{diagrams}} (FLD's) {{are used}} to evaluate the workability of metal sheets. FLD's provide the failure locus at which <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> occurs and localized necking develops (commonly designated as the forming limit curve - FLC), and the failure loci at the onset of fracture by tension (FFL) or by in-plane shear (SFFL). The interest of metal formers in controlling localized necking is understandable because the consequence of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> is an undesirable surface blemish in components. However, because under certain loading conditions fracture can precede necking in sheet metal forming processes, there is a growing interest in characterizing the forming limits by necking and fracture in the FLD's. This paper gathers together a number of recently developed methodologies for detecting the onset of local necking and fracture by in-plane tension or in-plane shear, and discusses their applicability to determine experimentally the FLC's, FFL's and SFFL's...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of Ni 3 Al ribbons {{have been studied}} using in-situ SEM tensile tests between room temperature and 400 °C. The onset of plastic strain of the annealed material is characterized, after exceeding the yield stress, {{by the appearance of}} a <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> region followed by the homogeneous deformation region. The slope of the serrated zone decreases with annealing temperature and increases with test temperature. However, ribbons in the as-rapidly solidified (RS) condition do not show the <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> zone. This different behavior is related to distribution, arrangement and density of dislocations generated during rapid solidification and to their evolution during thermal treatments. Serrated yielding takes place due to the nucleation and propagation of Lüders bands, which are nucleated in high stress concentration regions and subsequently propagate through the gauge length. A model is proposed in order to explain strain hardening in the serrated zone and its dependence on annealing temperature and test temperature. © 1997 Elsevier Science S. A. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|A major {{objective}} {{of the theory of}} defects is to relate the mechanical behaviour of macroscopic materials to the spatio-temporal evolution of the microstructure. The present paper deals with the dislocation-dynamical foundations of <b>plastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> and the propagation of slip in co-herent plastic deformation modes (solitary plastic waves). Solitary waves arise from a proper balance between nonlinear localization effects and dispersion. By the dislocation dynamical approach, both nonlinear interactions and spatietemporal couplings are accessible in a quanti-tative way. Particularly, intrinsic length scales may be identified, in order {{to address the problem of}} propagation velocity selection. This is illustrated by means of various models of propagative <b>plastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> observed in tensile tests. The model assumptions are as follows: 1.) The microscopic cause of the repeated non-uniform yielding of the Portevin-Le Chdtelier (PLC) ef-fect i s dynamic strain-ageing, while the macroscopic propagation of PLC bands is controlled by intergranular incompatibility stresses. 2.) Llders bands in polycrystals result from a dislocation dynamics which is diffusion-like (owing to the random grain orientation) and bistable (owing to the stabilizing effect of the grain boundaries). 3.) This is to be compared with Llders bands in single crystals where the dislocation-poor initial state is unstable and band propagation is traced back to an interplay of cross-slip and non-axial stresses. 4.) Thermomechanical fronts arise from the interplay between heat generation during plastic deformation, heat conduction, and strain hardening. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{prediction}} of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> in sheet metals during forming processes represents nowadays an ambitious challenge. To reach this goal, a new numerical approach, {{based on the}} loss of ellipticity criterion, is proposed in the present contribution. A polycrystalline model is implemented as a user-material subroutine into the ABAQUS/Implicit finite element (FE) code. The polycrystalline constitutive model is assigned to each integration point of the FE mesh. To derive the mechanical behavior of this polycrystalline aggregate from the behavior of its microscopic constituents, the multiscale self-consistent scheme is used. The mechanical behavior of the single crystals is described by a finite strain rateindependent constitutive framework, where the Schmid law is used to model the plastic flow. The condition of loss of ellipticity at the macroscale is used as <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> criterion in the FE modeling. This numerical approach, which couples the FE method with the self-consistent scheme, is used to simulate a deep drawing process, and the above criterion is used to predict the formability limit of the studied sheets during this operation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{the onset of the}} Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect is revised by {{combining}} a study of the kinetics of the flow stress evolution upon abrupt changes in the applied strain rate and acoustic emission (AE) accompanying plastic deformation of an AlMg alloy. The kinetic measurements allow evaluating the strain-rate sensitivity of the flow stress and the time characteristics of transient processes as functions of plastic strain. Using known criteria of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability,</b> domains of instability are constructed in the (strain, strain rate) plane. A particular accent is put on the strain-rate range corresponding to the so-called “inverse” behavior. The comparison of such maps with experimental data on the critical strain testifies to the insufficiency of these criteria for explaining the onset of the PLC effect. Moreover, the slow transient kinetics contradicts observations of the fast development of stress drops. The AE measurements bear witness that the stress serrations are associated with bursts in duration of acoustic events generated by the collective motion of dislocations. The possible role of synchronization of dislocation dynamics on the onset of <b>plastic</b> <b>instability</b> is discussed...|$|E
