A {{study of the}} biological properties of the proteins which exhibit the different microstructures, was carried out. The nature of tryptic inhibitory activity and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity were investigated. All protein showed both trypsin inhibitory and alpha-amylase activities; the kinetics of the alpha-amylase revealed non-competitive mechanism. The crystalline isolates showed lower trypsin inhibitory (TI) and alpha-amylase inhibitory (AI) activities than the amorphous isolates. The extents of tryptic hydrolysis (in vitro) were not related to TI indicating involvement of some other factors, in addition to trypsin inhibitory activity. Electropherograms of SDS-PAGE indicated that the major proteins of P. lunatus beans were more resistant to tryptic hydrolysis than the major fractions of the P. vulgaris.

40|$|On the {{repeated}} either air-drying or oven-drying, rewetting and incubation of residual soils amended with r 5 N-labelled rice straw, the nitrogen supplying capacities of soils, transformation of fixed ammonium and chemical nature of decomposable organic nitrogen were investigated. The results were summarized as follows : 1). The mineralization of nitrogen derived from rice straw of residual soils was remarkably accelerated {{at the early}} stage of incubation due to both air-drying and oven-drying effects. The magnitude of a flush of mineral nitrogen was much greater in the latter than in the former. On the contrary, the mineralization of the native soil-N was continued at a fairly steady rate by the later stage of incubation. These results would account for the necessity of successively long-term application of rice straw to increase the nitrogen supplying capacities of soil. 2). A small portion of rice straw-N was fixed by soils during the mineralization process of rice straw. The application of rice straw to soils resulted in {{the promotion of the}} release of the native soil fixed ammonium, and the magnitudes of the priming effect were approximately in inverse proportion to the amounts of native fixed ammonium of soils. Ammonium mineralized due to the air-drying of residual soils was slightly fixed, while {{the repeated}} oven-drying, rewetting and incubation led to a marked increase of fixed ammonium derived from both rice straw-N and soil-N. The percentages of newly fixed ammonium of mineralized nitrogen of rice straw-N and soil-N due to the oven-drying effect ranged from 2. 3 to 9. 1 % and from 1. 6 to 9. 7 %, respectively. 3).

In the Vernier Marsh, the distribution of major constituents is heterogeneous. Thus, for each depositional environment studied (soils, drainage ditches, channels, ponds), the composition of SOM has been characterized by using two ternary diagrams ("Amorphous OM/Preserved Phytoclasts/Transformed Phytoclasts" and "Opaque/Amorphous/Gelified Particles"; OP/AP/GP).

40|$|We {{propose a}} Quantum-Inspired Subspace(QIS) Ensemble Method for {{generating}} feature ensembles based on feature selections. We assign each <b>principal</b> component a <b>Fraction</b> Transition Probability as its probability weight based on Principal Component Analysis and quantum interpretations. In order {{to generate the}} feature subset for each base regressor, we select a feature subset from principal components based on Fraction Transition Probabilities. The idea originating from quantum mechanics can encourage ensemble diversity and the accuracy simultaneously. We incorporate Quantum-Inspired Subspace Method into Random Forest and propose Quantum-Inspired Forest. We theoretically prove that the quantum interpretation corresponds to the first order approximation of ensemble regression. We also evaluate the empirical performance of Quantum-Inspired Forest and Random Forest in multiple hyperparameter settings. Quantum-Inspired Forest proves the significant robustness of the default hyperparameters on most data sets. The contribution of this work is two-fold, a novel ensemble regression algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics and the theoretical connection between quantum interpretations and machine learning algorithms.

40|$|Patients with {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) have {{an increased risk of}} developing car-diovascular disease (CVD). Traditional risk factors fail to fully explain all of this increased risk. As atherosclerosis is recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease, it has been advocated that persistent inflammatory activity in patients with SLE is the principal mechanism that promotes accelerated atherogenesis. Autoantibodies in SLE might contribute to the patho-genesis of atherosclerosis by causing injury to the endothelium and altering the metabolism of lipoproteins involved in atherogenesis. Circulating immune complexes and anti-endothelial cell antibodies can induce expression of a proinflammatory and proadhesive endothelial cell phenotype. Similarly, antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) may directly activate the endothe-lium or, via cross-reactivity with other antigens, interfere with lipoprotein metabolism. Antibodies to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (anti-oxLDL) rise with anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titres, complement activation and disease activity scores in patients with SLE. Both clinical and in vitro studies, however, have yielded conflicting results regarding the role of anti-oxLDL and aPL antibodies in CVD. Elevated levels of antibodies to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A 1 (the <b>principal</b> protein <b>fraction</b> of HDL) are found in patients with coronary ischaemia. Titres of these antibodies are significantly higher in SLE patients with persistent inflammatory disease and correlate inversely with activ-ity of paraoxonase, a key enzyme that gives HDL its anti-oxidant properties. This review summarizes the evidence that autoantibodies in SLE might contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by causing injury to the endothelium and altering the metabolism of lipopro-teins involved in atherogenesis.

40|$|Apolipoprotein A- 1 (apoA- 1) is the <b>principal</b> protein <b>fraction</b> of {{high-density}} lipoprotein (HDL), conferring {{to the latter}} many of its pleiotropic atheroprotective functions. After its effect on cholesterol efflux, the second most studied feature of apoA- 1 is its anti-inflammatory property. In addition, it interferes with lipid peroxidation and innate immune receptors. These anti-inflammatory effects are due to various properties, in particular the ability to inhibit the transendothelial migration of immune cells by reducing integrin expression, to inhibit monocyte activation and cytokine production induced by T-cell contact, to inhibit lipid peroxidation and to interfere with innate immune receptors. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} during chronic systemic inflammation HDL could lose some of its atheroprotective functions and become dysfunctional or even proinflammatory. Recent evidence suggests that specific post-translational modifications of apoA- 1 transform this genuine anti-inflammatory molecule into a proinflammatory one. The structural changes include chlorination, nitration and carbamylation of amino acids by myeloperoxidase, oxidation by reactive carbonyls, as well as glycation. Humoral autoimmunity to apoA- 1 and HDL has been reported in populations at high cardiovascular risk and constitutes another emerging mechanism contributing to the loss of functions of apoA- 1 and HDL. The fact that in recent trials cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors (torcerapib and dalcetrapib) have unfortunately failed to prevent cardiovascular disease despite increasing cholesterol efflux in vitro and HDL levels in vivo, further highlights the clinical importance of understanding the mechanisms driving apoA- 1 and HDL towards pro- or anti-inflammatory molecules. These findings should not affect current dyslipidaemia management guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Berberis microphylla is {{a native}} plant that grows in Patagonia and is {{commonly}} used by aboriginal ethnic groups in traditional medicine as an antiseptic for different diseases. The present study evaluated the antibacterial and synergistic activity of alkaloid extracts of B. microphylla leaves, stems and roots used either individually or in combination with antibiotics against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root alkaloid extracts had significant activity only against Gram-positive bacteria. Disc diffusion tests demonstrated that the root extract showed similar activity against B. cereus and S. epidermidis compared to commercial antibiotics, namely ampicillin and cephalothin, and <b>pure</b> berberine, the <b>principal</b> component of the alkaloid extracts, {{was found to be}} active only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis with similar activity to that of the root extract. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the alkaloid extracts ranged from 333 to 83 μg/mL, whereas minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) varied from 717 to 167 μg/mL. In addition, synergistic or indifferent effects between the alkaloid extracts and antibiotics against bacterial strains were confirmed...|$|R
