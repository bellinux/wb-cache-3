40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBAThe International Direct Dialing (IDD) is considering {{as one of the}} most profitable area in telecommunication industry. Initially the IDD service offered only for the key customers. Once more operators allow providing the IDD service it was opened for all the customers. Once it opens for all the customer's telecommunication operators start to operate the <b>prepaid</b> IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> service. Presently the <b>prepaid</b> IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> market is the one of the most competitive area in telecommunication industry in Sri Lanka. There are different types of <b>prepaid</b> IDD <b>call</b> <b>cards</b> entering in to market day by day. Also telecommunication operators as well as non-telecommunication operators operate these cards. There is a rapid growth in the customer base in this market segment. This research study mainly focused on the service quality in IDD <b>prepaid</b> <b>call</b> <b>card</b> market and the analysis of the customer behavior. Also it was required to identify the factors affected to the <b>prepaid</b> IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> market. The service quality was measured using well-known SERVQUAL model [...] There were four <b>prepaid</b> IDD <b>call</b> <b>cards</b> used for this research and details collected through questionnaire. The data analysis was done using SPSS software and EXCEL software. Several customer groups were identified based on their income, age and occupation. When considering the customer income group behavior it was identified that when the customer income increased then the charge satisfaction also increased. Further it reviled that when the customer income increase the satisfaction of user friendliness of the system decrease. The results were reveled that negative correlation exists between customer income and the sender quality. The satisfaction of the service quality decreased when the customer's age increased. There is a strong positive correlation between the service quality and the user friendliness of the customer helpdesk. Also there is a positive correlation exists between the service quality and the average usage, feature satisfaction, years of use, charge satisfaction. When considering the <b>prepaid</b> IDD <b>calls</b> <b>card</b> market there is 76. 8 % of the customers satisfied about the present service quality. Finally results from this research work suggest that what type ofchangcs require enhancing the <b>prepaid</b> IDD <b>call</b> <b>card</b> service...|$|R

5000|$|Stored-value {{cards are}} most {{commonly}} used for low-value transactions, such as transit system farecards, telephone <b>prepaid</b> <b>calling</b> <b>cards,</b> cafeterias, or for micropayments in shops or vending machines. They also have an advantage over most other payment cards in that when making, say, a purchase telecommunication facilities are not needed, which may be important in situations where the availability or reliability of these facilities are uncertain or costly, especially for low-value transactions. A benefit to the merchant is that bank transaction fees are not incurred as the transaction is processed offline and there {{need not be a}} reference to the bank for processing. A limitation is that these cards cannot be used for online, telephone, mail order and other [...] "card not present transactions".|$|R
5000|$|Feature Group A: The {{original}} implementation, {{in which}} a user has to dial the local telephone number of a provider's gateway, followed by (usually) a password, then the desired long-distance number. There is a different local access number in each local calling area. This requires no special capability at the local telephone company office as competing long distance providers connected using standard local lines, {{which may or may}} not support caller ID. If a carrier has no local presence, a foreign exchange line is used to reach its nearest point of presence. Once the standard means of accessing alternate long-distance carriers, local access numbers are now used primarily for low-cost <b>prepaid</b> <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> as the <b>calls</b> may be made from any phone, at flat or local rates.|$|R
50|$|You {{place this}} first call {{to get to}} the {{providers}} platform, and once connected you are authenticated via a PIN or as seen in Europe or around {{other parts of the world}} the card may have an electronic chip on it, like you may have seen on the American Express Blue card. If you use the local number provided from your home or cell phone you pay for the cost of the first call, you can see this on your bills even if you don't get connected. The reason that 800 toll free is more expensive is because the <b>Prepaid</b> <b>Calling</b> <b>Card</b> Company pays for the attempts and even when you just call to check your balance, you only pay when you are actually connected. Many Local Telephone Companies don't show local usage so you may not see that you are paying for a local call every time you make an attempt. This is not true when you call a toll free number from a land line but with Cell phones you do use air time. With most local phone companies you can get call detail to support this.|$|E

50|$|Long {{distance}} {{calling from}} landlines was opened to {{competition in the}} early 1990s {{and the use of}} long distance revenue to subsidise local service phased out a few years later. It is not possible for mobile telephone subscribers or coin-paid telephone users to select a default carrier, so long distance calls are often priced higher from these services. The use of <b>prepaid</b> telephone <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> is a possible workaround.|$|R
5000|$|Web sites offer prepaid Personal {{identification}} numbers (PINs) for calling; thus {{there is no}} physical phone <b>card.</b> <b>Prepaid</b> online <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> are more convenient to use, {{because most of the}} companies provide the option of registering the phone and avoiding using PINs at all.

These tools cannot be purchased like products, {{because they do not}} reside on the user’s machine. Rather, they can be used as “services. ” In this paper, we propose a new paying mechanism for Electronic Commerce of software tools-on-demand, that charges users according to how much they have used a given tool: pay-per-use rental. We discuss the benefits of pay-per-use for users and producers and we evidence the critical issues in designing a system to support pay-per-use. Then we introduce WebMetrics, our pay-per-use system that supplies software metrics collection and analysis tools–on-demand. WebMetrics integrates pay-per-use in a client/server Java application. It is based on the idea of prepaid “virtual cards ” similar to rechargeable <b>prepaid</b> <b>calling</b> <b>cards</b> for long distance telephone calls.
