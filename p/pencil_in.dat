25|$|A typical {{central office}} may have tens of {{thousands}} of pairs of wires that appear on terminal blocks called the main distribution frame (MDF). A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper. Before computerization of Bell System records in the 1980s, this information was handwritten in <b>pencil</b> <b>in</b> accounting ledger books.|$|E

25|$|A pencil eraser is {{an article}} of {{stationery}} attached to {{the opposite end of}} a graphite pencil's sharpened tip. The eraser itself is typically made out of gum-like or synthetic rubber that is used for rubbing out pencil mistakes on paper. On April 15, 1770, English inventor Joseph Priestley described a vegetable gum to remove pencil marks. On March 30, 1858, Hymen Lipman received the first patent for the conception and the idea of attaching an eraser {{to the end of a}} <b>pencil.</b> <b>In</b> 1862 Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for $100,000, who went to sue the pencil manufacturer Faber-Castell for infringement. In 1875, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid.|$|E

25|$|The {{composition}} of Das Rheingold occupied Wagner from 1 November 1853 to 26 September 1854. He began {{by developing a}} preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf) of the entire work from his sketches. This 77-page draft, which was written in pencil and on two (sometimes three) staves, was completed by 14 January 1854. The following month (1 February) he proceeded to make a second complete draft. It seems that his first intention {{was to make a}} composition draft in ink, just as he had done for Lohengrin, but as such a draft of the opening Prelude – which consists of little more than an arpeggiated E♭ major triad – would have been to all intents and purposes a full score, he decided to skip the intermediate stage and draft the full score in ink right away. This he proceeded to do with the Prelude, significantly revising some of its details in the process. When, however, he reached the beginning of Scene 1, he found that the remainder of the opera required too much revision and elaboration to allow him to develop a full score without first making a second complete draft. He therefore abandoned the full score in ink and proceeded to develop instead an instrumentation draft in <b>pencil,</b> <b>in</b> which he worked out most of the vocal and orchestral details of the four remaining scenes. This Instrumentationsskizze, as Wagner himself styled it, was completed by 28 May 1854.|$|E

500|$|Art Spiegelman {{described}} the artwork as [...] "quirky and ungainly". [...] Though it appears awkward, Green put considerable effort into {{elements such as}} graphical perspective, and draws attention to his craft by depicting himself drawing and by placing the drawing manuals Perspective and Fun With a <b>Pencil</b> <b>in</b> the backgrounds. In contrast to the mundane tales of Harvey Pekar, another prominent early practitioner of autobiographical comics, Green makes wide use of visual metaphors. [...] In Binky Brown symbols become literal, as when Binky imagines himself becoming a snowball hurtling into Hell or as a fish chased by a police officer who wears a crucifix. [...] The work displays {{a wide array of}} visual techniques: diagrammatic arrows; mock-scholarly documentation; a great variety in panel size, composition, and layout; and a range of contrasting mechanical and organic rendering techniques, such as screentone alongside dense hand-drawn hatching. [...] The symbolic and technical collide where the Virgin Mary becomes the vanishing point of Binky's converging [...] "pecker rays".|$|E
500|$|Bellew's {{successor}} as Garter, Sir Anthony Wagner, {{referred to}} him in his 1988 memoirs; he wrote that Bellew seemed [...] "in early years a temperamental, combative Irishman not easy to live with though always possessed of great feeling for ceremonial and heraldic design and a skillful pen and <b>pencil.</b> <b>In</b> later years I have found him ever more charming". According to The Independent, Bellew enjoyed creating colourful grants of arms, drew inspiration from medieval heraldry and allowed multi-coloured wreaths to be used and adorned with badges {{for the first time}} in English heraldry. As Garter, he managed the financial affairs of the College well, maintaining [...] "a firm hand on the tiller", and, when faced with the task of organising the Coronation, his knowledge of tradition was complemented by his eye for design: [...] "At heart he was a designer, an artist and a perfectionist in all things", remarks his obituary in The Times.|$|E

2500|$|Novelists don't usually publish {{their first}} novels until later in life. However, many novelists begin writing {{at a young}} age.

However, he was thirty before he published his first novel, the highly controversial The Wasp Factory in 1984. The success of this novel enabled Banks to become a full-time novelist. Often an important writers' juvenilia, even if not published, is prized by scholars because it provides insight into an author's biography and approach to writing; for example, the Brontë family's juvenilia that depicts their imaginary world of Gondal, currently in the British Library, has provided important information on their development as writers.|$|E
