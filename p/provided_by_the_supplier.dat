The proposed conceptual model was tested using data collected through a survey of 192 heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC-R) contractors in Canada. Results indicate that: i) the level of administrative support <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> to assist <b>the</b> contractors (i. e., the customers) with the returns process is predominant in generating the customer satisfaction; ii) the performance of returns management system is significantly and positively linked to customer satisfaction.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the coating}} system of composite bridges over time {{is an important}} issue as it has significant implications in terms of costs and environmental impacts. However, the estimation of the service life of the bridge and, in particular, of its coating protection usually relies on <b>the</b> information <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> and/or experience of the engineers, as life cycle approaches are not yet a daily practice among bridge engineers. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the time-variant performance of the protective coating of composite bridges and respective impacts. An available simplified tool was adopted in this work, which enables to model the coating degradation of steel bridges and correlate this with the condition of the bridge (or bridge element). However, the available tool has some major disadvantages, since it does not enable the consideration of uncertainties in the main parameters of the model nor the optimization of the strategy leading to the minimization of costs or other constraints. To cope with these limitations, the tool was enhanced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> consideration of an optimization procedure that is able to cope with uncertainties.

40|$|In the {{perspective}} of an announced prohibition to bring Salmonella-contaminated fresh poultry meat on the retail market as of December 2010, requirements are postulated for rapid methods for detection of Salmonella in poultry meat. These rapid methods should deliver reliable results in time {{to make it possible}} to steer the finished products in poultry slaughterhouses into the direction of the fresh poultry market or into the direction of industrial treatment. The most important requirements are the detection limit (1 cfu/ 25 g), the time of analysis (within hours up to a maximum of 24 h), the sensitivity and specificity, and the validation of the rapid detection method. To determine a requirement for the number of samples to be analyzed per unit of time of the detection methods, a sampling plan for pooling of samples is suggested. Information of commercially available detection methods from literature and data <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> was compared to the postulated requirements.

For all available methods, the time of analysis is too long to steer the production process in time.
