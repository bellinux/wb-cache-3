50|$|<b>Pork</b> <b>jowl</b> (alternately called jowl bacon or, {{especially}} in the Southern United States, hog jowl) is cured and smoked cheeks of <b>pork.</b> Hog <b>jowl</b> is a staple of soul food, but is also used outside the United States; the non-smoked Italian variant is called guanciale.|$|R
5000|$|Guanciale (...) is an Italian cured {{meat product}} {{prepared}} from <b>pork</b> <b>jowl</b> or cheeks. Its name {{is derived from}} guancia, Italian for cheek.|$|R
50|$|Like most cured <b>pork</b> products, <b>pork</b> <b>jowls</b> {{are high}} in nitrates and sodium, which give the {{potential}} for health risks, particularly for those with {{a family history of}} heart disease.|$|R
50|$|Jowler Creek {{most likely}} {{was named after}} a local citizen, {{although}} tradition states the name was selected on account of <b>pork</b> <b>jowls</b> being discharged into the creek as slaughter waste.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>pork</b> <b>jowl</b> is cured, {{like many}} other cuts of pork, {{it has been a}} {{traditional}} wintertime food as it is able to be stored {{for long periods of time}} without refrigeration.|$|R
5000|$|Oreilles de crisse (...) is a {{traditional}} Quebec dish consisting of deep-fried smoked <b>pork</b> <b>jowls.</b> It is generally served in cabanes à sucre (sugar shacks) in spring time, traditionally topped with maple syrup.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to modify the {{composition}} of chicken burgers in terms of nutritional value by substitution of 20 % of <b>pork</b> <b>jowl</b> with a mixture of rapeseed oil and linseed oil, and addition of inulin (1 %) or wheat fiber (3 %). Substitution of <b>pork</b> <b>jowl</b> with vegetable oils resulted in significant increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and rosemary extract retarded the oxidation process of lipids. Addition of wheat fiber was helpful in maintaining the thermal processing yield and texture of burgers. Microbiological quality of vacuum packed burgers subjected to 21 -day storage at + 4 °C± 1 and - 20 °C± 1 was satisfactory...|$|R
5000|$|Jowl meat {{may also}} be chopped and used as a garnish, similar to bacon bits, or served in {{sandwich}} form. [...] <b>Pork</b> <b>jowl</b> {{can be used as}} a binding ingredient in pork liver sausages such as liverwurst and braunschweiger.|$|R
50|$|The USDA {{requires}} that the product contain a minimum of 30% liver. A typical commercial formula is about 40% pork liver or scalded beef liver, 30% scalded <b>pork</b> <b>jowl,</b> 20% lean <b>pork</b> trimmings and 10% bacon ends and pieces. Added seasonings include salt and often include white pepper, onion powder or chopped onion, and mace. Curing ingredients (sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite) are optional.|$|R
5000|$|Scappi {{included}} many recipes for crostata in Opera dell'arte del cucinare. For meat and seafood based crostata, there were recipes using <b>pork</b> <b>jowls</b> or prosciutto, crayfish, anchovies, or oysters. Other savoury crostata recipes included a crostata with creamy cheese {{referred to as}} a butirata, those with truffles or field mushrooms, one with artichoke or cardoon hearts, and one with [...] "the viscera of any sort of turtle".|$|R
5000|$|A Southern US {{tradition}} of eating black-eyed peas and greens with either <b>pork</b> <b>jowls</b> or fatback on New Year's Day to ensure prosperity throughout {{the new year}} goes back hundreds of years. [...] During the American Civil War (1861 to 1865), the peas where thought to represent wealth to the Southerners, while the Northern army considered the food to be fit as livestock feed only. Pigs (and by extension, pork products) were symbolic of [...] "wealth and gluttony" [...] and consuming jowls or fatback on New Year's Day guaranteed a good new year.|$|R
40|$|Future {{progress}} in food safety of pork meat in Denmark {{may depend on}} implementation of carcass decontamination at the slaughter line. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the microbial reducing effect of hot water and lactic acid for post harvest carcass decontamination of pork. Application of hot water (80 °C) and I% and 2. 5 % lactic acid (55 °C and 80 °C) decontamination after treatment for 0, 5 and 15 s was investigated in laboratory scale using a watering device. The microbial reducing effect was quantified on a mixed flora of stationary phase cultures of E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica inoculated (107 cfu per cm 2 of each of the species) on the skin and meat surface of <b>pork</b> <b>jowl</b> samples (10 x 10 cm). Mean reductions of 1. 0 - 5. 8 Iog 10 units per cm 2 were obtained depending on the different decontamination parameters applied...|$|R
5000|$|Long {{before a}} Joselito Iberian acorn-fed ham reaches a customer's plate, it must undergo {{a series of}} {{processes}} and phases. Once slaughtered, the pigs are quartered and divided into different parts according to their intended use, with the noble cuts of meat being selected and separated out. This is a traditional process whose link with the human factor is also a key component. Various cuts of meat are extracted from the Iberian pig, including the following: pluma (a feather-shaped, fatty cut, sometimes known as featherloin in English), presa (a small cut, taken from between {{the top of the}} shoulder and the loin), cabezada (the front part of the loin), sirloin, lagarto (a long, thin cut taken from between the loin and chops, sometimes known as lace back in English), abanico (called [...] "fan" [...] in Spanish, this is a tender, juicy cut taken {{from the top of the}} ribs), <b>pork</b> <b>jowl,</b> secreto (a highly marbled cut taken from a hidden part - hence its name - that lies behind the shoulder) and pork belly. The hams also undergo an initial selection and classification process that is based on an inspection of the outer part of each piece; an analysis of aspects such as the outline, size, weight and colour; and an analysis of samples taken from the inner part. The selected hams then proceed to the bleeding process.|$|R
5000|$|Black-eyed peas — While these peas {{are almost}} never {{referred}} to as [...] "soup beans", the preparation in the Appalachian region is almost identical. Black-eyed Peas, sometimes called blackeye peas, are most common where Appalachian culture intersects with lowland soul-food and coastal food cultures. Like Hoppin' John, black-eyed peas became common as a new year's dish. However, since rice was {{not a part of}} mountain culture, the peas were cooked with <b>pork</b> (usually hog <b>jowls)</b> like soup beans and served with stewed tomatoes and collard greens. This dish becomes less common as you move into more isolated mountain communities.|$|R
40|$|Barrows and gilts (215 /gender) {{were used}} to test the effects of {{synthetic}} AA supplementation of reduced CP diets on the growth performance and quality characteristics of the LM and the fatty acid composition of the LM and s. c. jowl fat from growing-finishing swine. Pigs were blocked by BW within gender, and allocated randomly to pens (6 pigs/pen) which were then assigned randomly within each block and gender to either corn-SBM diets 1) that were devoid of synthetic lysine (Ctrl); 2) with reduced CP diets where lysine was added to all diets (RCP 1); 3) with reduced CP where lysine, threonine, and tryptophan were added to all diets (RCP 2); 4) with where lysine, threonine, and tryptophan were added to all diets (RCP 3); or 5) with reduced CP diets where lysine, threonine, tryptophan, and isoleucine was added to all diets (RCP 4). During finisher phase 3, 10 mg/kg of ractopamine was included in all diets. A subsample of whole pork loins was processed into chops for data collection. Another subsample from the whole pork loin and the s. c. fat from each jowl was freeze dried for fatty acid determination. Gilts had a greater (P = 0. 02) (lightness) L* value and drip loss than barrows, but the ultimate pH, marbling, and intramuscular fat (IMF) of the LM were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 04) for barrows than gilts. Color measurements were not affected (P 3 ̆e 0. 06) by the RCP diets, with the exception of redness (a*) which increased (P = 0. 01) with decreasing CP levels. There were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) proportions of SFA in the LM of barrows than the LM from gilts. However, gilts had an increase in PUFA content with decreasing levels of CP in the diet and barrows had a decrease in PUFA content of the LM (P = 0. 056). Barrows had greater (P = 0. 008) SFA and less (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) PUFA content in the jowl fat than gilts. The results point toward the reduced CP diets improving fresh pork quality, especially IMF. Also, <b>pork</b> lean and <b>jowl</b> fat were altered in their fatty acid composition by the reducing dietary CP...|$|R
