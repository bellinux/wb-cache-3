In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the official trade unions. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.|$|E

Gonzaga, who was the film producer, conceived it as a silent film with a score recorded on disk and synchronized to the film during its exhibition. When it was almost finished, however, Gonzaga agreed to adding voices recorded on Vitaphone, a change <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> advent of sound films and their rise in popularity in the Brazilian market during {{the production of the}} film.|$|E

5|$|<b>Prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully {{sought help}} from Emperor Ferdinand I, {{then turned to}} Poland–Lithuania. Landmeister von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be {{replaced}} by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius (Vilna). The Polish sejm refused to agree to the treaty, believing it to be a matter affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, {{commonly}} referred to as the August Coup, was <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slow disintegration of the Soviet Union that resulted from Gorbachev's reform policy and Yeltsin's drive towards an independent Russia. The New Union Treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics, which weakened the government's already tenuous hold on the economy. Pavlov received a draft of the New Union Treaty on 12 August at a Security Council meeting and managed to get it published in the Moscow News on 14 August.|$|E

In the four years after Keating's American Continental Corporation (ACC) had purchased Lincoln in 1984, Lincoln's assets had increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{initially}} had a garrison {{of eight}} gunners, five soldiers and a lieutenant, {{under the command}} of a captain. In the late 1540s, it was heavily armed {{by the standards of the}} time, with 36 pieces of artillery. In the 1580s, the castle caught fire and the timber needed for the repairs required 127 trees to be sent from the New Forest. The work was carried out in 1584, <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> threat of a Spanish invasion, but by that time its garrison had shrunk to eight men.|$|E
5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. <b>Prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smog, President Lyndon B.

The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks and pollution in China.|$|E

5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E
5|$|Before DNA analysis, the {{taxonomy}} of the widow spider genus Latrodectus had been unclear—changes {{in the number}} of species reflect the difficulty of using morphology to determine subdivisions within the genus. Substantial interest in their systematics was most likely <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> medical importance of these venomous spiders. Swedish arachnologist Tamerlan Thorell described the redback spider in 1870 from specimens collected in Rockhampton and Bowen in central Queensland. He named it Latrodectus hasseltii in honour of colleague A.W.M. van Hasselt. In the same paper, he named a female from Cape York with an all-black abdomen L. scelio, now regarded as the same species. These specimens are in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{civil rights movement and}} the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E

5|$|Crusades were expensive, and as {{the wars}} {{increased}} in number, their costs escalated. Pope UrbanII called upon the rich to help First Crusade lords such as Duke Robert of Normandy and Count Raymond of Toulouse, who subsidised knights in their armies. The total cost to King LouisIX of France of the 1284–85 Crusades was estimated at six times the king's annual income. Rulers demanded subsidies from their subjects, and alms and bequests <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> conquest of Palestine were additional sources of income. The popes ordered that collection boxes be placed in churches and, beginning in the mid-12th century, granted indulgences in exchange for donations and bequests.|$|E
5|$|Despite all {{receiving}} equal billing in the credits, {{the original}} principal cast members were paid different salaries {{in the first}} few years; Baxendale and Nesbitt were the most well-known, so received more than Ripley, Thomson, Norris and Bathurst, who were comparatively less well-known to audiences. <b>Prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> continued success of the show, Andy Harries reviewed the salaries in 2000 and decided to pay all six actors the same amount. The amount was not publicly disclosed but was believed to be £20,000 per episode, plus repeat broadcast royalties.

5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea <b>prompted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
