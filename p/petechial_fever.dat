40|$|Abstract. Described herein is the {{clinical}} presentation of a patient from Bangkok, with <b>fever,</b> <b>petechial</b> rash, history of a tick bite, and a diagnosis of spotted fever rickettsiosis. REPORT Tick-transmitted spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses are endemic throughout the world although the prevalence varies from region to region. The predominant clinical mani-festations of SFG rickettsioses include fever, headache, and rash. Tetracycline therapy is considered effective and {{is often associated with}} a rapid improvement in the patient’s restora-tion to health. In Thailand, the first detection of a SFG rickettsia occurred in 1962. The rickettsia was isolated from a mixed pool of larval ticks of Ixodes sp. and Rhipicephalus sp. collected from Rattus rattus trapped in Chiangmai Province. 1 This particular isolate is referred to as TT- 118 and recently was geneticall...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the successful treatment of Moraxella osloensis bacteremia in a 2 -year-old boy who presented with <b>fever,</b> <b>petechial</b> rash, and exacerbation of reactive airway disease. We also review the 12 cases previously {{reported in the}} literature. Moraxella osloensis is an aerobic, gram-negative coccoba-cillus infrequently isolated from clinical specimens. Because of its rarity, the clinical signi®cance and appropriate therapy for patients with infections due to M. osloensis are not well un-derstood. We report {{a case of a}} child with M. osloensis bac-teremia who presented with fever and petechiae and was suc-cessfully treated with iv cephalosporins. We also review the pertinent literature. Case Report A 2 -year-old Cambodian boy with a history of reactive air-way disease was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, rhinorrhea, wheezing, and posttussive emesis. He had receive...|$|R
40|$|Rat-bite fever is an {{uncommon}} disease {{known for its}} endemicity to occur worldwide. Although most patients tend to develop mild symptoms with improvement from conventional antibiotics, it can progress with severe complications with a mortality rate as high as 13 % without proper treatment. The authors report a complicated case of rat bite-fever involving a 61 -year old woman who presented with <b>fever,</b> <b>petechial</b> rash, and septic arthritis following a rat bite. Initially, multiple antibiotics were administered but were not effective. As a consequence, invasive procedures such as arthrotomy and joint debridement were done and prolonged antibiotic was administered until clinical resolution. Since many cases {{do not have a}} history of rat bite and may present with fever, rashes, and arthritis it is essential to distinguish it from other diseases. Here, the authors will provide details on the etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management to aid prompt detection and treatment of the disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} considerations {{raised by}} immunocompromised patients with opportunistic infection continue to expand. When such patients harbor latent or persistent infection acquired in a tropical environment, the diagnostic challenge is even greater. The Infectious Disease Service at Yale-New Haven Hospital {{was asked to}} see a middle-aged man from Peru with known T-cell lymphoma who had recently completed a course of chemotherapy. He presented {{to the hospital with}} <b>fever,</b> <b>petechial</b> skin rash, pulmonary infiltrates, and neutropenia. Ultimately this case illustrated the necessity for careful evaluation of such patients, looking, in particular, for evidence of opportunistic parasitic infection. CASE PRESENTATION DR. CHARLES BERENSON (Infectious Disease Fellow) : A 58 -year-old Peruvian man was admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital with new pulmonary infiltrates, <b>fever,</b> and a <b>petechial</b> rash, which occurred two weeks after completing a course of chemotherapy for lymphoma. He first presented to us in October 1984, with unusual skin lesions, diagnosed by skin biopsy as manifestations of polyarteritis nodosa. He was treated with prednison...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Bone marrow {{necrosis}} is a clinicopathological condition diagnosed {{most often}} at postmortem examination, {{but it is}} also seen during the course of malignancy and is not always associated with a poor prognosis. The morphological features of bone marrow necrosis are disruption of the normal marrow architecture and necrosis of myeloid tissue and medullary stroma. Non-malignant conditions associated with bone marrow necrosis are sickle cell anemia, infections, drugs (sulfasalazine, interferon α, all-trans retinoic acid, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and fludarabine), disseminated intravascular coagulation, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and acute graft versus host diseases. The malignant causes are leukemia, lymphoma and metastatic carcinomas. Herein we report the case of a patient with precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and bone marrow necrosis at initial presentation. Case presentation A 10 -year-old Kurdish boy was presented with generalized bone pain and fever of 1 month’s duration which was associated with sweating, easy fatigability, nose bleeding, breathlessness and severe weight loss. On examination, we observed pallor, tachypnea, tachycardia, low blood pressure, <b>fever,</b> <b>petechial</b> hemorrhage, ecchymoses, tortuous dilated veins over the chest and upper part of abdomen, multiple small cervical lymph node enlargements, mildly enlarged spleen, palpable liver and gross abdominal distention. Blood analysis revealed pancytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Imaging results showed mediastinal widening on a planar chest X-ray and diffuse focal infiltration of the axial bone marrow on magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral vertebrae. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy examination showed extensive bone marrow necrosis. Immunophenotyping analysis of the bone marrow biopsy confirmed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as CD 3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase markers were positive and CD 10, CD 20 and CD 79 a markers were negative. Conclusion The aggressive initial clinical presentation of our patient with huge mediastinal widening, development of superior vein cava syndrome and extensive bone marrow necrosis as initial signs made the diagnosis of the case difficult. The necrotic hematopoietic cells gave inconclusive results on the initial immunohistochemistry tests. The prognosis of bone marrow necrosis is better secondary to acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the pediatric age group compared with adults and those with underlying solid tumors. Despite the aggressive behavior at initial presentation, the patient responded to chemotherapy and necrosis disappeared at day 28 after the start of the therapeutic regimen. </p...|$|R
