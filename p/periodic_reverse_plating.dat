However, optimization of pulsed deposition processes is a challenge because of the complexity. E. g., the tendency of electroforms to acquire irregularities such as dendritic growths or other morphological instabilities, creates the need for methods to control these undesirable phenomena. One such method is <b>periodic</b> <b>reverse</b> pulses. Optimization of <b>periodic</b> <b>reverse</b> processes is not simple {{and can lead to}} local solutions that do not optimize all properties simultaneously.

Given the limited variety of <b>reversed</b> phase <b>plates,</b> mobile phase composition optimization is necessary to obtain better separation of analytes with similar characteristics, which is often a time consuming step. We present polarity-adjustable reversed phase ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) plates, which simplifies the mobile phase screening process and greatly expands the selection of <b>reversed</b> phase <b>plates.</b> The plates were fabricated on glass substrates with SiO 2 nanopillars deposited using the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique. SiO 2 nanopillars were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane to generate a super hydrophobic stationary phase. Unlike commercial silica-gel based stationary phases, the isolated nanopillar architecture presented here exposes a high surface area to post-fabrication surface treatments. In our work, an O 2 plasma treatment at different powers, pressures and exposure times was used to shorten the silane carbon chain and introduce COOH groups to the surface, producing plates with finely tunable polarities. Separation of a model dye mixture of Sudan blue and Sudan IV confirmed the tuning of surface polarities by measurement of retention behavior changes. The dye elution order reversed {{as a result of the}} change in surface polarity. When the same plasma treatment process was tested on commercial <b>reversed</b> phase <b>plates,</b> separation behavior did not change because the disordered and tortuous silica gel restricts the accessible surface area.

Such deposition techniques are advantageous as we can have good control over the material composition.|$|R

The paper presents the phenomenon of periodically reversing flow in a microchannel evaporators used in air conditioning systems which will be illustrated with high speed videos in the presentation. These evaporators have multiple parallel channels between 0. 5 and 1 mm and headers (manifolds) that have to accommodate tubes of typically 15 to 25 mm major (width). A simultaneous flow visualizations and pressure measurements confirmed the periodic flow reversal and associated fluctuations. The oscillatory behavior of the flow is linked and related with oscillations of the evaporator pressure in the inlet header and the pressure drop. Visualization of the flow in headers and tubes will be presented. Paper will present experiments that have revealed significant ratio of reversed vapor flow – {{in the range of}} 3 - 7 % of the mail flow, in addition to liquid that is reversed alongside. The magnitude and frequency of oscillations are directly proportional to heat flux.

40|$|Physical {{processes}} of sediment transport in tidal environments are extremely complicated and {{are influenced by}} numerous hydrodynamic and sedimentological factors {{over a wide range}} of temporal and spatial scales. Both tide and wave forcing play significant roles in the entrainment and transport of both cohesive and non-cohesive particles. Present understanding of sediment transport is largely empirical and based heavily on field and laboratory measurements. Sediment transport is composed of three phases: (1) initiation of motion (erosion), (2) transport, and (3) deposition. In tidal environments, the coarser non-cohesive sediments are typically transported as bedload, forming various types of bedforms. The finer cohesive sediments tend to be transported as suspended load, with their deposition occurring mostly during slack tides under calm conditions. Rate of sediment transport is generally proportional to flow velocity to the 3 rd to 5 th power. This non-linear relationship leads to a net transport {{in the direction of the}} faster velocity in tidal environments with a time-velocity asymmetry. Due to the slow settling velocity of fine cohesive sediment and a difference between the critical shear stress for erosion and deposition, scour and settling lags exist in many tidal environments resulting in a landward-fining trend of sediment grain size. The <b>periodic</b> <b>reversing</b> of tidal flow directions results in characteristic bi-directional sedimentary structures.
