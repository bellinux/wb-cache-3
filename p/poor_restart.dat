2500|$|Mansell then {{signed with}} Newman/Haas Racing to pair with Mario Andretti in the CART series, {{replacing}} Mario's son Michael {{who moved to}} F1 and McLaren. At the season opener at Surfers Paradise, Australia, {{he became the first}} [...] "rookie" [...] to take pole position and win his first race. A few weeks later however, he suffered a substantial crash at the Phoenix International Raceway, severely injuring his back. At the 1993 Indianapolis 500, Mansell would lead the race only to finish third after losing the lead to Emerson Fittipaldi and Arie Luyendyk after a <b>poor</b> <b>restart.</b> On his 40th birthday, however, Mansell would avenge his loss at Indianapolis to score a 500-mile race victory at Michigan, considered by many a tougher 500 mile race to win. He would go on to score five wins for the 1993 CART season, which, with more high-placed finishes, was good enough to earn him the championship. This enabled Mansell to become the only driver in history to hold both the Formula One and CART championships at the same time, because when he won the 1993 CART championship he was still the reigning F1 world champion, with the 1993 F1 championship not yet having been decided.|$|E
50|$|At the Coca-Cola 600, Truex led {{the most}} laps (131 of 400), but with 20 laps to go {{he had to}} make a late race fuel stop and {{finished}} 5th. At Dover, Truex led the most laps again (131 of 405), but a <b>poor</b> <b>restart</b> caused him to slide back to seventh and cost him the race to Johnson.|$|E
50|$|At Richmond, Stewart {{looked to}} be in {{contention}} for the win as he was 5th on a green-white-checkered finish, but in a fashion similar to his confrontation with Logano at Fontana; after a <b>poor</b> <b>restart</b> he lost a few positions. On the last lap, Kurt Busch tapped his bumper, moving Stewart out of the 2nd groove {{all the way up to}} the top of the race track subsequently losing about 5 positions coming home 18th while Busch took a 9th-place finish. Stewart showed his displeasure with Busch after the race had finished, rubbing with him on the race track leading to a shoving match between the two when slowing down after the race ended. Down near the haulers the two turned the attention given to race winner Harvick; to them when they had a verbal confrontation, again Stewart showing Busch his displeasure with his aggressive move. It was the first time since 2008 that the two got together in a feud.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the Maharashtra {{government}} stopped its {{run of the}} Deccan Odyssey, citing <b>poor</b> response, but <b>restarted</b> {{it after}} the monsoon season.|$|R
50|$|England tuned up {{for next}} week's game against world champions New Zealand with a {{comfortable}} 31-12 victory over Argentina at Twickenham.However, while England started brightly, their second-half performance gave reasons for concern.With England's forwards providing a solid platform and quick ball, Joe Launchbury, Billy Twelvetrees and Chris Ashton scored first-half tries.But England were <b>poor</b> after the <b>restart</b> until replacement Ben Morgan scored a late try as a capacity crowd {{was reduced to}} virtual silence at times.|$|R
40|$|A 70 -year-old male {{presented}} with first episode mania and hyponatremia, which were later corrected with {{an infusion of}} hypertonic saline. His clinical condition deteriorated because of adipsic hypernatremia associated with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Hypernatremia correction and potassium supplementation were started but could not be achieved because of manic symptoms as the patient's oral intake was <b>poor.</b> He was <b>restarted</b> on sodium valproate and olanzapine. Over the next few days, the patient's manic symptoms improved significantly and oral intake improved, which eventually led to correction of hypernatremia. Clinicians should evaluate the existence of electrolyte imbalance while dealing with a case of geriatric mania...|$|R

50|$|England {{replied to}} the early German goals with a long range shot over the bar from Lee, and Shearer, pouncing on a <b>poor</b> <b>restart</b> from the German goalkeeper could not convert the {{resulting}} chance, spectacularly mis-kicking his effort wide to the keeper's left. Shortly after, England's Grayson forced a save from the Germans running onto a pass from Shearer into the penalty box, although Grayson could not convert the rebound from the German keeper's initial block. On 22 minutes a naked streaker invaded the pitch. Despite the invasion, play continued around the streaker as the Germans advanced, with a German player even inadvertently passing the ball toward him, and he was led away by stewards only after he wandered off the pitch. The resulting German attack saw Bobic head a chance {{to the left of}} the goal, while an immediate reply from England was a goal from Ferdinand, ruled offside. England manager Howard Wilkinson chose to counter the early German dominance, with an “infusion of energy”, bringing on Thompson and Beresford. An immediate return was the foul that led to England's first goal. Novotny lost control of an attempted pass by Thompson down the left inside channel to Shearer, and having lost the ball to Shearer brought him down outside the penalty box as he advanced on goal. From the resulting free kick taken by Thompson, Ferdinand scored for England with a header low and to the right of the German goalkeeper. The German reply forced a last minute block of a Beinlich effort from Walker.|$|E
500|$|While all her contemporaries in Chile {{recognised}} her heroism, and {{the common}} soldiers she served with looked up to her as the [...] "nun of charity," [...] some men said Morales {{had gone too far}} for a woman by taking up a rifle. Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna praised her for her dedication and bravery and for her hatred for those who killed her husband, but in 1881 gave her the free advice that she should not put herself at such risk and should [...] "return quietly to her <b>poor</b> home and <b>restart</b> the life of a real woman in manual labor, in caring for her relatives, in work with the needle and thimble, and exchange, after several years of adventures and passions, the revolver for her honored and beloved sewing machine." [...] She did not follow this advice and remained in the army {{until the end of the}} war, fighting in the Battle of Huamachuco on 10 July 1883, the last battle of the war. Men like Mackenna were right to say she put herself at unusual risk for a woman at the time, for several other Chilean cantinières were killed after being captured by Peruvians during the war.|$|R
