5|$|Many of the fortifications {{built by}} the Romans in England survived into the Middle Ages, {{including}} the walls surrounding their military forts and cities. These defences were often reused during the unstable post-Roman period. The Anglo-Saxon kings undertook significant planned urban expansion in the 8th and 9th centuries, creating burhs, often protected with earth and wood ramparts. Burh walls sometimes utilised older Roman fortifications, both for <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> and to bolster their owners' reputations through the symbolism of former Roman power.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne radar sets and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E
5|$|In some matters Tyler was on {{good terms}} with Jackson. He defended Jackson for vetoing the Maysville Road funding project, which Jackson {{considered}} unconstitutional. He voted to confirm several of the president's appointments, including Jackson's future running mate Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to Britain. The leading issue in the 1832 presidential election was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, which both Tyler and Jackson opposed. Congress voted to recharter the bank in July 1832, and Jackson vetoed the bill for both constitutional and <b>practical</b> <b>reasons.</b> Tyler voted to sustain the veto and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re-election.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} to be {{understood}} as primarily a discussion of Robert Alexy's treatment of <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> and law. After a concise presentation of Alexy's theory of law and <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> I move to critically engage with Alexy’s foundation of <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> shaped by a weak transcendental - pragmatic argument, which in its present form, I will claim, can only show why sometimes we ought to follow the guidance of <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> a nd which consequently makes the authority of <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> ultimately dependent on individual decision. This in turn makes <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> a contingent notion, and less attractive for it from a Kantian perspective. Yet we can avoid that outcome — and still preserve Alexy’s comprehensive conception of law as <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> — by strengthening his foundational argument. This is something I intend to do {{in the second part of}} the paper, where, by building on the idea of constitutive necessity I put forward a transcendental foundation of <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> thereby resting Alexy’s conception of law as <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> on a noncontingent basis.

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} {{a foundation}} of the connection argued to exist between law and <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> that {{has proved to be}} highly influential and debated in contemporary legal philosophy - Alexy's. After reconstructing Alexy's conception of <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> as well as its foundation, I criticise the weak transcendental-pragmatic argument Alexy uses to ground the authority of <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b> This argument, I argue, can only show why occasionally, as opposed to necessarily, we ought to follow the guidance of <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> and consequently makes the authority of <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> ultimately dependent on an individual decision. By building on this criticism, {{in the second part of}} the essay I introduce and discuss an alternative argument that, by appealing to the idea of constitutive necessity, can provide a non-contingent basis for the validity of <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b> © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

5|$|The {{war ended}} in the Treaty of Raciąż on 22 May 1404. Władysław acceded to the formal cession of Samogitia and agreed to support the Order's designs on Pskov; in return, Konrad von Jungingen {{undertook}} to sell Poland the disputed Dobrzyń Land {{and the town of}} Złotoryja, once pawned to the Order by Władysław Opolski, and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on Novgorod. Both sides had <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> for signing the treaty at that point: the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands, the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in Silesia.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} {{portions of the}} long-running British science-fiction television programme Doctor Who that are no longer held by the BBC. Between 1967 and 1978 the BBC routinely deleted archive programmes, for various <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> (lack of space, scarcity of materials, a lack of rebroadcast rights). As {{a result of the}} cull, 97 of 253 episodes from the programme's first six years are currently missing, primarily from seasons 3 through 5, leaving 26 serials incomplete. Many more were considered lost until recovered from various sources, mostly overseas broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, around the {{coronation}} of Edward VII, a discussion started {{on the need for}} a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, to something more appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> including the multiplication of flags. Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.|$|E
25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume {{is not so much}} of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|R
40|$|My {{project is}} to reconsider the Kantian {{conception}} of <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b> Some Kantians think that practical reasoning must be more active than theoretical reasoning, on the putative grounds that such reasoning need not contend with what is there anyway, independently of its exercise. Behind that claim stands the thesis that <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> is essentially efficacious. I accept the efficacy principle, but deny that it underwrites this inference about <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b> My inquiry takes place {{against the background of}} recent Kantian metaethical debate — each side of which, I argue, correctly points to issues that need to be jointly accommodated in the Kantian account of <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b> The constructivist points to the essential efficacy of <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> while the realist claims that any genuinely cognitive exercise of <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> owes allegiance to what is there anyway, independently of its exercise. I argue that a Kantian account of respect for persons (“recognition respect”) suggests how the two claims might be jointly accommodated. The result is an empirical moral realism that is itself neutral on the received Kantian metaethical debate...|$|R
50|$|The first Critique was a {{critique}} of the pretensions of pure theoretical reason to attain metaphysical truths beyond the ken of applied theoretical reason. The conclusion was that pure theoretical reason must be restrained, because it produces confused arguments when applied outside of its appropriate sphere. However, the Critique of <b>Practical</b> <b>Reason</b> is not {{a critique}} of pure <b>practical</b> <b>reason,</b> but rather a defense of it as being capable of grounding behavior superior to that grounded by desire-based practical reasoning. It is actually a critique, then, of the pretensions of applied <b>practical</b> <b>reason.</b> Pure <b>practical</b> <b>reason</b> must not be restrained, in fact, but cultivated.|$|R
5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for <b>practical</b> <b>reasons,</b> or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for <b>practical</b> <b>reasons</b> the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or <b>practical</b> <b>reasons.</b> However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E

This {{essay is}} about how four deeply {{important}} Kantian ideas can significantly illuminate some essentially intertwined issues in philosophical theology, philosophical logic, the metaphysics of agency, and above all, morality.
