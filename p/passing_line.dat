60|$|I do {{not know}} why at the moment I could think of no excuse. I {{followed}} them rather sulkily to the table at which Strickland always sat, and he called for the board and the chessmen. They both took the situation so much {{as a matter of course}} that I felt it absurd to do otherwise. Mrs. Stroeve watched the game with inscrutable face. She was silent, but she had always been silent. I looked at her mouth for an expression that could give me a clue to what she felt; I watched her eyes for some tell-tale flash, some hint of dismay or bitterness; I scanned her brow for any <b>passing</b> <b>line</b> that might indicate a settling emotion. Her face was a mask that told nothing. Her hands lay on her lap motionless, one in the other loosely clasped. I knew from what I had heard that she was a woman of violent passions; and that injurious blow that she had given Dirk, the man who had loved her so devotedly, betrayed a sudden temper and a horrid cruelty. She had abandoned the safe shelter of her husband's protection and the comfortable ease of a well-provided establishment for what she could not but see was an extreme hazard. It showed an eagerness for adventure, a readiness for the hand-to-mouth, which the care she took of her home and her love of good housewifery made not a little remarkable. She must be a woman of complicated character, and there was something dramatic in the contrast of that with her demure appearance.|$|E
50|$|As odds {{bets are}} paid at true odds, in {{contrast}} with the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> which is always even money, taking odds on a minimum <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet lessens the house advantage compared with betting the same total amount on the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> only. A maximum odds bet on a minimum <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet often gives the lowest house edge available in any game in the casino. However, the odds bet cannot be made independently, so the house retains an edge on the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet itself.|$|R
5000|$|Once a <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet is made, it {{is always}} working and cannot be turned [...] "Off", taken down or reduced unless it wins or loses.

Players may only bet the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> on the come out roll when no point has been established, unless the casino allows put betting where the player can bet <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> or increase an existing <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> bet whenever desired and may take odds immediately if the point is already on.|$|R
5000|$|In all {{the above}} scenarios, {{whenever}} the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins, the Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> loses, and vice versa, with one exception: on the come-out roll, {{a roll of}} 12 will cause <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> bets to lose, but Don't Pass bets are pushed (or [...] "barred"), neither winning nor losing.

5000|$|If the dealer's button is [...] "On", {{the table}} is in the point round where casinos will allow odds behind an {{existing}} <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> to be bet.

50|$|The line {{starts at}} western Tehran, north of Tehran-Karaj Freeway, going {{southeast}} along Teymuri Street, intersecting line 4 at Shademan Station on Azadi Street.

It then turns northwest, <b>passing</b> <b>line</b> 4 again at Darvazeh Shemiran, and Imam Hossein Square. It then goes along Ayatollah Madani Street for 5.5 km, until reaching Resalat Expressway, where it turns east again. It goes eastwards for another 5.7 km, until reaching Farhangsara station.|$|E

Then the main line joins the Utrecht-Kampen railway (Centraalspoorweg) from Utrecht. The station has 10 tracks in total, consisting of 3 large island platforms. There is 1 <b>passing</b> <b>line</b> within the platforms and with 3 passing tracks at the northern part of the station. Access to the Leusden line is from platforms 1 and 2. The original Amersfoort line is just 200 m from the station by train. The station building is the only remnant of this.|$|E
50|$|The shooter is {{required}} to make either a <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet or a Don't Pass bet {{if he wants to}} shoot. On the come out roll each player may only make one bet on the Pass or Don't Pass, but may bet both if desired. The <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> and Don't <b>Pass</b> bet is optional for any player not shooting. In rare cases, some casinos require all players to make a minimum <b>Pass</b> <b>Line</b> or Don't <b>Pass</b> bet (if they want to make any other bet), whether they are currently shooting or not.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the game}} of craps, a dice roll of 7 on the come-out {{constitutes}} a “natural” and the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins immediately. However, if the shooter (dice thrower) rolls a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the come-out roll, that number becomes his “point”. Now, the shooter must repeat his point before he throws a seven. If he repeats his point, the <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> wins. If he rolls a seven, {{not only does the}} <b>Pass</b> <b>line</b> lose, the shooter loses control of the dice. This is called a “seven-out”.|$|R
5000|$|If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 {{is thrown}} on the come-out roll (i.e., if a point is established), most casinos allow <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> players to take odds by placing {{up to some}} {{predetermined}} multiple of the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet, behind the <b>pass</b> <b>line.</b> This additional bet wins if the point is rolled again before a 7 is rolled (the point is made) and pays at the true odds of 2-to-1 if 4 or 10 is the point, 3-to-2 if 5 or 9 is the point, or 6-to-5 if 6 or 8 is the point. Unlike the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet itself, the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> odds bet can be turned [...] "Off" [...] (not working), removed or reduced anytime before it loses. In Las Vegas, generally odds bets are required to be the table minimum. In Atlantic City and Pennsylvania, the combine odds and pass bet must be table minimum so players can bet the minimum single unit on odds depending on the point. If the point is a 4 or 10 players can bet as little as $1 on odds if the table minimum is low such as is $5, $10 or $15. If the player requests the pass odds be not working ("Off") and the shooter sevens-out or hits the point, the <b>pass</b> <b>line</b> bet will be lost or doubled and the pass odds returned.|$|R

The remainder of the line to Brighton opened shortly after on 21 September of the same year. The original station was designed by the architect David Mocatta and included a central <b>passing</b> <b>line,</b> and an awning over the platform. The station retained its importance as a junction following {{the construction of the}} line to Lewes from Keymer 3 mi to the south.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} thermal properties on temperature and the moisture profile in Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements, an Enhanced Integrated Climatic Model (EICM) analysis was performed for a typical PCC pavement section in Louisiana. The EICM analysis showed that {{the temperature in the}} middle layer of PCC pavement decreased as thermal conductivity increased, and the temperature remained constant for higher thermal conductivity values. Temperature was measured at several depths of a concrete block embedded in soil and was compared to the temperature profile predicted by the EICM. Measured temperatures inside the concrete block were higher than the temperatures predicted by the EICM. The measured temperatures reached a peak hour temperature gradient on the hottest time of day, but the EICM model did not predict the peak hour temperature gradient. MEPDG analysis was performed to estimate the effect of thermal properties on the distress of PCC pavements. From the analysis it was found that thermal cracking increased with the decrease of thermal conductivity. It was also noticed that an Integrated Climatic Model (ICM) stability failure occurred for a set of thermal conductivity and heat capacity readings in the MEPDG analysis. A <b>passing</b> <b>line</b> is proposed to separate the ICM stability passing zone and failure zone...|$|E

This ability is increased by increasing of Rayleigh number and it was showed that this ability reaches maximum value at the first cylinder () and minimum value at the second cylinder () at spacing ratio (S/D= 3) and rotation angle () for the first and () for the second cylinder respectively.       The effective variables on natural convection heat transfer from the above two cylinders are related by two correlating equations, each one explains dimensionless relation of heat transfer from each cylinder that represented by Nusselt number against Rayleigh number, rotation angle, and the spacing ratio between two cylinders.   </p...|$|E
