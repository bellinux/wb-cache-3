However, many of these technologies require a barrier filtration system capable of removing particulate material from the coal-derived fuel- or flue-gas to protect the gas turbine from damage.

Continued satisfactory operation of ceramic candle filter units is dependent on satisfactory removal, through periodic back pulsing, of the filter cake that builds up during operation. This study examines, through experimental and computational modelling, the deposition process and the factors that affect the build up of the filter cake of a single filter element in cross-flow and parallel flow.

The current work explores the hydrodynamics of a small-scale circulating <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> at elevated operating pressures ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 25 MPa. The initial experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure with air and O/CO environments as the fluidisation gas to simulate the hydrodynamics in a CFB. A comparison between the effects of air and O/CO mixtures on the hydrodynamics was outlined in this paper for particles of 160 μm diameter. A small but distinct effect on axial voidage was observed due to the change in gas density in the dense zone of the bed at lower gas velocity, while only minimal differences were noticed at higher gas velocities. The hydrodynamic parameters such as pressure drop and axial voidage profile along the height were reported at two different bed inventories (0. 5 and 0. 75 kg) for three mean particle sizes of 160, 302 and 427 μm and three superficial gas velocities. It was observed that the operating pressure {{had a significant effect}} on the hydrodynamic parameters of bed pressure drop and axial bed voidage profiles. The effect of solids loading resulted in an exponential change in pressure drop profile at atmospheric pressure as well as at elevated pressure.

40|$|Abstract. - Worldwide, {{advanced}} {{coal-fired power}} generation systems are being introduced that offer significant {{economic and environmental}} advantages over pulverised fuel (pf) firing. Many of these systems are combined cycles based on fluidised bed combustion and/or gasifica-tion. In such combined cycles, materials selection and performance are key factors in determin-ing plant availability. Consequently material evaluation studies for the various components form {{an integral part of}} any development programme. This paper provides a review of materials is-sues for two advanced technologies, namely <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> combustion (PFBC) and the British Coal Topping Cycle. Particular attention is paid to the approach adopted to overcome these issues and their influence on plant design. PFBC development in the United Kingdom is outlined.

40|$|Independent power {{producers}} {{will build a}} substantial fraction of expected new coal-fired power generation in developing countries over the coming decades. To reduce perceived risk and obtain financing for their projects, they are currently building and plan to continue to build subcritical coal-fired plants with generating efficiency below 40 %.

If such plants were built in Asia over the coming decades, the savings in carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetime would be measured in billions of tons. IPPs perceive supercritical technology as riskier and higher cost than conventional technology. The truth needs to be confirmed by discussions with additional experienced power engineering companies. Better communication among the interested parties could help to overcome the IPP perception issue. Governments working together with industry might be able to identify creative financing arrangements which can encourage the use of more efficient pulverised clean coal technologies, while awaiting the commercialisation of advanced clean-coal technologies like gasification combined cycle and <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> combustion...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-phase}} reactor {{model has}} been developed using a system of ordinary differential equations in MATLAB to model the carbonation reaction and therefore determine the kinetics of calcium oxide in a <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> reactor {{as part of the}} calcium looping cycle. The model assumes that the particulate and bubble phases are modelled as a CSTR and a PFR respectively. The random pore model developed by Bhatia and Perlmutter 1 is incorporated into the system of equations to predict the rate of carbonation for pressures up to 5 bara total, and CO 2 partial pressures up to 150 kPa.

40|$|The {{development}} of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) has raised interest towards novel <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> (FB) energy applications. In these applications, limestone can be utilized for S 02 and/or CO 2 capture. The {{conditions in the}} new applications differ from the traditional atmospheric and <b>pressurised</b> circulating <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> (CFB) combustion conditions in which the limestone is successfully used for SO 2 capture. In this work, a detailed physical single particle model with a description of the mass and energy transfer inside the particle for limestone was developed. The novelty of this model was {{to take into account the}} simultaneous reactions, changing conditions, and the effect of advection. Especially, the capability to study the cyclic behaviour of limestone on both sides of the calcination-carbonation equilibrium curve is important in the novel conditions. The significances of including advection or assuming diffusion control were studied in calcination. Especially, the effect of advection in calcination reaction in the novel combustion atmosphere was shown. The model was tested against experimental data; sulphur capture was studied in a laboratory reactor in different <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> conditions. Different Conversion levels and sulphation patterns were examined in different atmospheres for one limestone type. The Conversion curves were well predicted with the model, and the mechanisms leading to the Conversion patterns were explained with the model simulations. In this work, it was also evaluated whether the transient environment has an effect on the limestone behaviour compared to the averaged conditions and in which conditions the effect is the largest. The difference between the averaged and transient conditions was notable only in the conditions which were close to the calcination-carbonation equilibrium curve. The results of this study suggest that the {{development of}} a simplified particle model requires a proper understanding of physical and chemical processes taking place in the particle during the reactions. The results of the study will be required when analysing complex limestone reaction phenomena or when developing the description of limestone behaviour in comprehensive 3 D process models. In order to transfer the experimental observations to furnace conditions, the relevant mechanisms that take place need to be understood before the important ones can be selected for 3 D process model.

In this third phase of the SERF project the external costs of three additional fusion power plant models using silicon carbide as structural material have been analysed.

40|$|AbstractCO 2 mineral sequestration, a. k. a. mineral {{carbonation}} offers {{an alternative to}} “conventional” CCS that involves underground storage of pressurised CO 2. It is being developed for locations that lack access to underground storage capacity for CO 2 and/or have access to suitable mineral resources, or for users that aim at marketable (hydro-) carbonate or otherwise useful solid product. The “Åbo Academi route” of producing Mg(OH) 2 from serpentinite rock followed by gas-solid carbonation in a <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> (PFB) has been further developed and optimized towards industrial demonstration. Recoverable ammonium sulphate salt is used as the fluxing agent for Mg extraction from rock. While Mg(OH) 2 production and its scale-up and subsequent carbonation are yet to be demonstrated beyond 78 and 65 % efficiency, respectively, the carbonation reaction reaches an equilibrium already after 10 - 15 minutes. Process energy requirements are ∼ 3 GJ (heat) /t CO 2 (similar to the capture stage of “conventional” CCS), while using ∼ 3 t rock/t CO 2, with separate streams of unreacted rock, FeOOH and MgCO 3 as main products. The scale-up activities involve defining reactor types and conditions for the Mg(OH) 2 production and the carbonation, respectively, using flue gas at ∼ 500 °C, 20 bar CO 2 partial pressure. This implies compression of a complete flue gas stream. It was shown that carbonation at a given (wet) CO 2 pressure gives results similar to when operating with diluted gas streams at higher pressures, at the same CO 2 partial pressure. Also simultaneous carbonation and sulphation of Mg(OH) 2 {{was found to be}} realizable. The beneficial role of increased yet reasonable levels of water vapour pressure is another research topic.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} release of the Kyoto {{protocol}} the demand for CO 2 -free processes have been increasing. In this paper three different concepts with no or a very small release of CO 2 to the atmosphere are evaluated and compared concerning plant efficiency and investment cost. A novel approach to biomass gasification is proposed to provide fuel for a combined gas turbine cycle, where the biomass {{is considered to be a}} renewable fuel with zero impact regarding CO 2 in the exhaust gases. The gasification concept used is a Dual <b>Pressurised</b> <b>Fluidised</b> <b>Bed</b> Gasifier (DPFBG) system, using steam and recycled product gas as fluidising agent in the gasification reactor. In the separate combustion reactor air is used as fluidising agent. The second cycle is a hybrid fuelled Humid Air Turbine (HAT) cycle with post-combustion CO 2 -separation. Steam used for regenerating the amines in the separation plant is produced using a biomass boiler, and natural gas is used as fuel for the humid air turbine. With this fuel mix the net release of CO 2 can even be less than zero if the exhaust gas from the steam generator is mixed and cleaned together with the main exhaust gas flow. The third cycle proposed is a combined cycle with postcombustion CO 2 -separation and the steam generation for the CO 2 -separation integrated in the bottoming steam cycle. All power cycles have been modelled in IPSEpro [trademark] (tm), a heat and mass balance software, using advanced component models developed by the authors. An equilibrium model is employed both for the gasification and the separation of CO 2 from exhaust gases. All three power cycles show efficiencies around 45 %, which is high for a biomass gasification cycle. The HAT and the combined cycle show efficiency drops of about 8 percentage points, due to the post-combustion treatment of exhaust gases...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{clean coal}} technologies, e. g. power {{generation}} from integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> combustor, have attracted increased interest from {{the scientific and}} technological communities {{over the last few}} decades. Pressures up to 40 atm have been applied to these technologies, which inherently result in an increase in coal throughput, a reduction in pollutant emissions and an enhancement in the intensity of reaction. Therefore, fundamental understanding of the effect of operating pressure on coal reactions is essential to the development of these technologies. In this paper, the pressure effect on a variety of aspects of coal reactions reported in the open literature has been reviewed. Major emphasis of the paper is given to experimental observations, although some theoretical modelling is reviewed. The pressure has been found to significantly influence the volatiles yield and coal swelling during devolatilisation, hence the structure and morphology of the char generated. More char particles of high porosity are formed at higher pressures. Char structure appears to {{play a significant role in}} burnout of residual char and ash formation. In general, at higher pressures, coal particles burn quicker and form finer ash particles. Increasing reactant pressure enhances char combustion and gasification reaction rate, which can be understood by an adsorption–desorption mechanism. These factors have been applied to the understanding of a practical high-pressure gasifier. Most of the work published has been at the lower temperatures (typically < 1000 °C), which can be achieved in experiments involving captive particles or coal samples. Experiments in pressurised TGA and wire mesh systems at these low temperatures are the most commonly reported, with some experiments for entrained flow system reported at the higher temperatures typical IGCC conditions in entrained flow reactors. Although the difficulty and cost have restricted these experiments, the entrained flow work is the current research need. The structure of the char generated has recently been related to char reactivity and the ash formed, but the mechanisms leading to the effect of pressure on this structure are not understood. Progressing the understanding of the formation of char structure at pressure and its relation to coal properties is an obvious research need...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: p. 173 - 182. The {{objective}} of this dissertation was to investigate {{compressed air energy storage}} as an alternative generation capacity for the South African electricity industry. In chapter one, an introduction to energy storage, electrical energy storage was introduced as an alternative generation option. Various energy storage technologies were discussed with their characteristics and applications. Compressed air energy storage was identified as a competitive energy storage option to pumped hydro in particular, and a suitable contender for the South African electricity market. In chapter two, the literature review, an in-depth study into compressed air energy storage was conducted. Many aspects of CAES were covered including CAES variants, underground pressurised air storage, projects and pre-feasibility studies, and operational plants. Due to the additional fuelling that certain CAES variants require, a Charge Energy Factor and a Fuel Heat Rate were defined. From the literature review it was seen that to date, only two CAES plants are still in operation. They are both of the conventional CAES type and use fuel-oil or alternatively natural gas for combustion In chapter three, an analysis of Eskom's demand, Eskom's future demand growth was analysed. A prediction in load growth, based on several economic scenarios, was made and the capacity of a suitable CAES plant, to meet this future demand, was determined. Chapter four, underground air storage reservoirs, focused on the aspects and prospects of storing compressed air underground in South Africa. Past underground air storage in South Africa was discussed and unused goldmines were identified as the most convenient and cost effective storage volumes available. The uniqueness of individual underground air storage volumes in mines were discussed as well as techniques necessary for the conversion of existing cavities. Both constant volume and constant pressure systems were investigated and mine cavern conversion costs where estimated per electric energy generated (R/kWh). Two of the most likely CAES turbo-machinery configurations suitable for South Africa were evaluated in chapter five, conceptual designs and cost analysis. The two types of CAES were conventional CAES and CAES with <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> combustors (CAESIPFBC).

40|$|Fossil fuels still {{dominate}} the energy supply in modern societies. The resources, however, are depleting. Therefore, other energy sources {{are to be}} exploited further within this century. Biomass {{is one of the}} practically CO 2 neutral, renewable contributors to the future energy production. Nowadays many modern, high efficiency (combined) power and heat producing systems using biomass are or become commercially available. One promising route to efficient power and heat supply is the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle. This cycle is particularly of interest for medium to larger scale installations. Pressurised operation of the gasifier offers the advantage of smaller process equipment, including that for the necessary downstream gas cleaning. Also, the work needed to compress the gas for gasturbine use will be much smaller or not needed at all. High temperature gas filtration offers the benefit of increased overall efficiencies of the power and heat producing cycle. This integrated gasification technology, however, is still in a stage of development and demonstration. When instead of absorption gas cleaning, high temperature, dry gas filtration is applied, nitrogen compounds, like ammonia (NH 3) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN), are not dissolved in the absorption liquid. As a result NOx emissions in gas turbine combustors are produced. NOx is known for its negative effects on the health of humans and animals and acidification of soil and water. Therefore, increasingly stringent emission restrictions are imposed on this component. Both coal and biomass contain nitrogen in their chemical structure and in gasification processes this so-called fuel bound nitrogen is converted to a large extent into NOx precursors. This PhD thesis assesses the experimental and theoretical work which was performed to study the behaviour of nitrogen compounds during air blown pressurised stationary fluidised bed gasification of biomass and brown coal, followed by high temperature ceramic gas filtration. Gasification experiments have been performed using a 1. 5 MWthermal pilot plant situated in Delft and a smaller scale test rig at the university of Stuttgart. Under the <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> gasification conditions studied, the main fuel bound nitrogen component produced is NH 3, whereas HCN is formed to a minor extent (only a few percent of the fuel bound nitrogen). In cooperation with TU Eindhoven, small-scale fuel characterization experiments have been carried out to obtain model parameters for the gasification process. These form the input basis of a gasifier model that has been validated with measurements at the pilot facilities. Design, Engineering and Productio...|$|E

A {{study was}} done to {{investigate}} sulphur dioxide capture capacities of South African mined dolomites, limestone and coal ash derived from high inertinite coal. The study was carried out under atmospheric and <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> coal combustion conditions using a thermogravimetric analyser. Temperatures between 750 - 900 °C were used. A typical flue gas mixture composed of 2000 ppm S 02, 5. 3 % 02 and C 02 concentration of 10 and 20 % for atmospheric and pressurised sulphation respectively and balance N 2 was used. The performance of the sorbents was examined at atmospheric (0. 875 bar) pressure where the active part of the sorbent was CaO and at 10 and 15 bar where the active part of the sorbent was CaC 03. Coal ash had a calcium content of 7 % by weight, this was much lower compared to dolomite and limestone which had between 20 - 30 % calcium by weight. The sorbents' structural characterisation was done using nitrogen adsorption and mercury porosimetry. Compared to coal ash, the raw dolomite and limestone had a relatively smaller internal surface area, between 0. 4 - 1. 0 m 2 /g, for the uncalcined state, then increasing to between 10 - 15 m 2 /g on calcination. Coal ash had a relatively high internal surface area of 11 m 2 /g, which {{is comparable to the}} calcined sorbents. The porosity of raw sorbents increased from about 0. 2 to 0. 35 on calcination. Sulphation at atmospheric pressure showed a calcium conversion of between 22 - 44 % for dolomites, 37 - 49 % for limestone and 13 - 28 % for coal ash after 180 minutes. At atmospheric pressure, dolomites and coal ash reactivity started off relatively fast followed by a sudden decline after 20 % conversion, this is attributed to the change from kinetic control to product layer control; limestone did not show a decline in reactivity. Under pressurised conditions the reaction started off relatively slow and no signs of reaction decline were observed up to 180 minutes reaction period. Sulphation at 15 bar was higher than at 10 bar. At 15 bar dolomite calcium conversion observed ranged between 16 - 34 %, for limestone it was between 18 - 36 % and coal ash conversion was relatively higher, at 28 - 35 % calcium conversion. The conversion results obtained compare well with results obtained by other researchers. A modified unreacted shrinking core model with variable effective diffusivity accounting for change in diffusion with growing product layer was successfully used to model results at both atmospheric and pressurised conditions.

40|$|The goal {{of power}} plants with higher {{efficiency}} and lower environmental risk than conventional power plants has produced {{three types of}} combined cycle power plants. These are: 1) the conventional combined cycle (CCC) power plant, 2) the <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> combustion (PFBC) power plants, and 3) the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants. The efficiency of the CCC power plant has been sufficiently improved {{so that it is}} higher than the conventional power plant. Due to high combustion temperature in the gas turbine, the problem of NOx arose. Different NOx reduction techniques were adopted, such as steam or water injection, and dry low-NOx combustors. Strict environmental regulations in various countries were still violated. Therefore, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) was installed in the waste heat boiler. Due to design of the CCC power plant, there is still risk of high NOx emission with a simple-cycle operation of the gas turbine. If the simple-cycle operation is not permitted then the effectiveness (energy availability) of the plant deteriorates. The PFBC and IGCC are new rival technologies. Both have a potential for higher efficiency and lower environmental risk than pulverized coal fired (PCF) power plants. These benefits will be lost if the effectiveness of these plants does not compete with the effectiveness of PCF power plants. Backup fuel can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of an IGCC power plant. Improving the effectiveness by using backup fuel involves increased cost for the fuel. If the gas turbine is operated as a simple-cycle with a backup fuel, then the problem of high NOx emission arises, as for the CCC power plant. Differently designed combined cycle power plants have been analysed to investigate the effects of reserve capacity (active redundancy) and repair policy. The Markov process has been used for the analysis and the following results were obtained. 1. The CCC power plant with an appropriate reserve capacity and a suitable repair policy can be chosen to obtain greater effectiveness of the plant with less NOx emission. 2. The effectiveness of PFBC power plants can potentially compete with the effectiveness of PCF plants. With an appropriate reserve capacity or double repair crew policy, the effectiveness of PFBC power plants can be even higher than that of the PCF power plants. 3. With an appropriate reserve capacity and with double repair crepolicy, the effectiveness of IGCC power plants can be improved to equal the effectiveness of PCF power plants. 4. The PFBC power plants have more potential for higher effectiventhan IGCC power plants without backup fuel. 5.

40|$|High {{temperature}} erosion - corrosion is {{the major}} source for degradation of components such as heat exchangers, tubes, cyclones and water walls used in Fluidised Bed Combustion (FBC) plants. By coating the exposed components with a protective material, the degradation rate can be decreased. The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} erosion - corrosion resistance of coatings deposited with the arc-spray, High Velocity Oxy Fuel (HVOF) and laser techniques. The erosion - corrosion tests have been performed in three different power plants; one Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB) plant fired with biomass, one Multi Bed Combustion (MBC) plant fired with a mixture of coal and biomass and one <b>Pressurised</b> <b>Fluidised</b> <b>Bed</b> Combustion (PFBC) plant fired with coal. The erosion - corrosion resistance of coatings has also been examined in one laboratory jet nozzle test rig and one fluidised bed test rig. Further, the adhesion strength of coatings deposited on substrates of a low-alloyed steel (1 Cr 0. 5 Mo) has been tested. A number of commercially available coating qualities have been used in this study. The reference material is the Fe-based Metcoloy 2 coating, which was deposited with all the three methods available. The other coatings can be divided into Ni-based, Co-based, carbide - containing and Fe-based. Under active - service conditions Co-based coatings show the best overall performance. It is suggested that the erosion resistance is partly due to the presence of carbide rich phases dispersed in the coating. The softer Ni based coatings are generally more subjected to erosion. The corrosion resistance of Fe-based coatings is poor at higher temperatures in more corrosive environments. Chromium carbide - containing coatings are excellent in the coal fired erosive environment but degrade severely in the biomass fired plants showing that stable hard phases, such as carbide, at the exposure temperature decrease the degradation rate. Tungsten and Ti-carbide containing coatings suffer from severe degradation in all environments. The coated samples were subjected to erosion- corrosion in a jet nozzle rig in air at 520 ºC or 550 ºC. Compared to a solid 304 L steel (Fe 19 Cr 10 Ni), the erosion - corrosion resistance of the coatings tested (Fe-based, Ni-based and carbide - containing) is higher. The oxides formed on the eroded area of the Metcoloy 2 coating are 10 - 60 times thicker than those formed on the non - eroded area. Consequently, erosion has increased the oxide growth rate. The increased oxide thickness on the eroded areas is due to the formation of cracks and pores in the oxide scale. These will enhance the inward transport of molecular oxygen through the oxide layer to the oxide/metal interface where the metal phase is oxidised. Erosion - corrosion tests performed in the fluidised bed test rig at 550 °C in air shows that the erosion resistance of thermally sprayed coatings is higher in comparison to laser deposited coatings. The use of acoustic emission for determining the adhesion strength of the coatings proved to be successful and more reliable than the traditional four point bending test with a subsequent metallographic examination. HVOF sprayed coatings start to delaminate at a strain of about 1 %, arc sprayed at a strain of about 1. 4  2 % while laser deposited coatings did not delaminate for strains up to 15 %. However, by increasing the splat size in the arc sprayed coatings the strain at which delamination occurred was increased to a bout 10 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of a solid-liquid model biological <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> under a step change in fluid superficial velocity is described. During a transient step change, the <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> divides into a top zone which remains at the initial porosity and a bottom zone which settles at the final porosity. The interface of discontinuity in porosity moves progressively upwards through the <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed.</b> The velocity at which {{the top of the}} <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> expands or contracts and the upward velocity of the porosity transition interface depend only upon the initial and final states of the bed porosity and the fluid superficial velocity. This results in a linear evolution with time of the total bed height and the height of porosity transition interface. The proposed model is well suited to describe the transient response of low-density particles in a <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed,</b> such as encountered in biological systems, to a sudden change of liquid superficial velocity.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{several aspects of}} ash {{chemistry}} are discussed. An issue of primary concern for boiler operators is the formation of ash deposits. New biomass fuels are introduced, {{many of which have}} unfavourable ash melting behaviour due to high levels of alkali metal species and chlorine. In addition to the inferior heat recovery caused by insulating deposits, aggressive ash components may cause corrosion on heat exchanger tube materials. In fluidised bed combustion, ash sintering and melting can cause bed material agglomeration and, at worst, total bed sintering. Furthermore, chemical reactions involving bed ash components may add to the sintering through formation of new products encapsulating the original particles. Reducing conditions, which in combination with high SO 2 levels resulted in formation of CaS, was observed in the bottom bed of an FBC boiler. Under reducing conditions, due to insufficient fuel-air mixing and staged combustion, transformations and eutectics in the systems CaS - CaSO 4 - alkali species and silicates-iron-rich oxides increase the risk for sintering. Chemical mechanisms involved in bed material agglomeration, deposit formation and fouling of heat exchanger surfaces during coal firing in <b>pressurised</b> <b>fluidised</b> <b>bed</b> combustors were investigated. The results showed that all of the following three chemical systems CaS - CaSO 4 - alkali species, silicate - alkali - chlorine and silicate systems containing iron-rich oxides had contributed to the sintering and fouling processes. Furthermore, the use of fuel additives to enhance the ash melting point in biomass combustion has been investigated. Kaolin was found to be a more effective additive than dolomite. This can be assigned partly to chemical reactions between kaolin and alkali salts from the fuel ash and partly to physical adsorption of the ash melt. In the second part of this thesis the environmental effects of ash utilisation and deposition are discussed. Recycling of wood ash to forest soil may be used as a means of maintaining a sustainable forestry and avoiding a mineral nutrient impoverishment in the forest soil. In order to obtain suitable release rates for nutrients, a stabilisation of the ash is recommended. Stabilisation may be accomplished by moistening and agglomeration of the ash. In this so-called hardening process some ash components form secondary hydrated minerals with low solubility. The secondary minerals contribute to inter-particle bonding during agglomeration The most important transformation is that of Ca(OH) 2 to CaCO 3 since it reduces the solubility of calcium and the alkalinity of the ash. Thus, a pH shock in the forest soil is avoided. The ash particle dissolution rate is dependent on the particle size and the stability of the hardened ash matrix. The results obtained indicate that granulation may be a more efficient agglomeration method than spontaneous self-hardening. Potassium is mainly present in soluble salts and thus the release rate is rather high whereas the release of phosphorous as well as minor and trace metals is very slow due to the high pH of the pore water. Since P is an essential plant nutrient, its slow release from wood ash may be problematic. Granules were observed to retain alkali chlorides better than spontaneously formed agglomerates. Ashes from co-combustion of wood with peat, coal and oil were also investigated. The coal and peat introduce inorganic species such as sulphides, clay minerals and feldspars, giving the ash a higher content of S, Al, Si and Fe than that of wood ash. However, the release of minor and trace metals was equally low as observed for pure wood ashes. Thus, the results obtained in this work indicate that a limited admixture of fossil fuels may not be detrimental {{to the use of the}} ash as a forest mineral fertiliser...|$|E
