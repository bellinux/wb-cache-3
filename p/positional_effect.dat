50|$|Classical {{astrometry}} concerns only motions in {{the plane}} of the sky and ignores the star's radial velocity, i.e. its space motion along the line-of-sight. Whilst critical for an understanding of stellar kinematics, and hence population dynamics, its effect is generally imperceptible to astrometric measurements ({{in the plane}} of the sky), and therefore it is generally ignored in large-scale astrometric surveys. In practice, it can be measured as a Doppler shift of the spectral lines. More strictly, however, the radial velocity does enter a rigorous astrometric formulation. Specifically, a space velocity along the line-of-sight means that the transformation from tangential linear velocity to (angular) proper motion is a function of time. The resulting effect of secular or perspective acceleration is the interpretation of a transverse acceleration actually arising from a purely linear space velocity with a significant radial component, with the <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> proportional to the product of the parallax, the proper motion, and the radial velocity. At the accuracy levels of Hipparcos it is of (marginal) importance only for the nearest stars with the largest radial velocities and proper motions, but was accounted for in the 21 cases for which the accumulated <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> over two years exceeds 0.1 milliarc-sec.

40|$|Children’s {{early use}} of {{grammatical}} morphemes is notoriously variable. Recent {{findings indicate that}} some variability in early productions is systematically related to speech planning factors, suggesting that variability in morpheme production is not solely the consequence of impoverished syntactic representations. For example, {{research has shown that}} plural -s is produced more reliably in utterance-final compared to utterance-medial position. Here we examined the locus of the <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> for plural -s. Productions of eight plural nouns in utterance-medial and utterance-final position were elicited from three groups of 2 -year-olds. Across the groups, we manipulated articulatory difficulty of the medial context such that it consisted of a stop consonant (e. g., dogs bark), a stressed vowel (e. g., dogs eat), or an unstressed vowel (e. g., dogs arrive). Results showed a robust <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> for the difficult context created by the stop consonant. The <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> was not observed for the simple articulatory context created by the stressed vowel. However, planning difficulty for the unstressed vowel was sufficiently increased such that the <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> again emerged in this context. These results suggest that production of grammatical morphemes is influenced by articulatory planning factors, which points to specific constraints for theoretical accounts of language acquisition. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Prosodic and articulatory factors {{influence}} children’s {{production of}} inflectional morphemes. For example, plural –s is produced more reliably in utterancefinal compared to utterance-medial position (i. e., the <b>positional</b> <b>effect),</b> {{which has been}} attributed to the increased planning time in utterance-final position. In previous investigations of plural –s, utterance-medial plurals were followed by a stop consonant (e. g., dogs bark), inducing high articulatory complexity. We examined whether the <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> would be observed if the utterance-medial context were simplified to a following vowel. Method: An elicited imitation task was used to collect productions of plural nouns from 2 -year-old children. Nouns were elicited utterance-medially and utterancefinally, with the medial plural followed by either a stressed or an unstressed vowel. Acoustic analysis was used to identify evidence of morpheme production. Results: The <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> was absent when the morpheme was followed by a vowel (e. g., dogs eat). However, it returned when the vowel-initial word contained 2 syllables (e. g., dogs arrive), suggesting that the increased processing load in the latter condition negated the facilitative effect of the easy articulatory context. Conclusions: Children’s productions of grammatical morphemes reflect a rich interaction between emerging levels of linguistic competence, raising considerations for diagnosis and rehabilitation of language disorders. 8 page(s...|$|E

The {{result of}} Frank {{was based on}} the negative externality due to the expenditure cascade: the rush for position pushing all agents to increase expenditure doesn’t lead to any positional gains. We argue that this result might no longer be true in two cases: first, if public goods are concerned or, second, if consumers possess heterogeneous preferences towards status seeking. In a theoretical model, we show that economic agents might voluntarily contribute to public good provision if they possess sufficiently high positional preferences.

40|$|The gene {{silencing}} effect of short interfering RNA (siRNA) {{is known to}} vary strongly with the targeted position of the mRNA. A number of hypotheses have been suggested to explain this phenomenon. We would like to test if this <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> is mainly due to the secondary structure of the mRNA at the target site. We proposed that this structural factor can be characterized by a single parameter called "the hydrogen bond (H-b) index", which represents {{the average number of}} hydrogen bonds formed between nucleotides in the target region {{and the rest of the}} mRNA. This index can be determined using a computational approach. We tested the correlation between the H-b index and the gene-silencing effects on three genes (Bcl- 2, hTF and cyclin B 1) using a variety of siRNAs. We found that the gene-silencing effect is inversely dependent on the H-b index, indicating that the local mRNA structure at the targeted site is the main cause of the <b>positional</b> <b>effect.</b> Based on this finding, we suggest that the H-b index can be a useful guideline for future siRNA design.

40|$|Beyond {{the normal}} DNA {{transactions}} mediated by topoisomerase II, we have recently {{demonstrated that the}} cleavage activity of the two human topoisomerase II isoforms is several-fold stimulated if a ribonucleotide rather than a deoxyribonucleotide is present at the scissile phosphodiester in one strand of the substrate. Here we show that ribonucleotides exert a position-specific effect on topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage without altering the sequence specificity of the enzyme. Ribonucleotides located within the 4 bp cleavage stagger stimulate topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage, whereas ribonucleotides located outside the stagger in general have an inhibitory effect. Results obtained from competition experiments indicate that the position-specific effect of ribonucleotides on topoisomerase II activity is caused by altered substrate interaction. When cleavage is performed with substrates containing one ribonucleotide in both strands or several ribonucleotides in one strand {{the effect of the}} individual ribonucleotides on cleavage is not additive. Finally, although topoisomerase II recognizes substrates with longer stretches of ribonucleotides, an RNA/DNA hybrid where one strand is composed entirely of RNA is not cleaved by the enzyme.

In other words, some people care for their relative position. Although such motivations for purchase have been identified early (e. g., Veblen, 1899; Hirsch, 1976; Frank, 1985; Alpizar et al., 2005), theoretical and empirical investigations about their importance in relation to public goods remain scarce (e. g., Solnick and Hemenway, 2005). We propose an economic model and an experimental design enabling to reveal the existence of positional concerns in individuals' contributions to a public good. Individuals may have (i) positive positional concerns if they gain utility from contributing more than the average contribution, or (ii) negative positional concerns if they gain utility from contributing less than the average contribution. A sizeable theoretical or experimental literature devotes attention to multiple explanations for positive contributions to public goods (e. g., warm-glow, reciprocity [Croson, 2007]). Disentangling positional motivations from other motivations such as reciprocity constitute a challenge. In our theoretical model of contribution to a public good, we consider individuals motivated by reciprocity and relative standing. First, one's contribution may induce (or deter) others in the community to participate in the public good in the following period (incentive effect). Second, one's contribution may secure a certain position in the community as being a larger or lower contributor than the average contributor in the community (<b>positional</b> <b>effect).</b> The incentive and positional effects will interact. Let us suppose that the incentive effect is negative. When increasing his contribution, individual i will expect a decrease in others' contributions. Assume further that individual i has simultaneously positive positional concerns (deriving utility from contributing more than the average contribution). This will trigger the incentive of individual i to contribute more, thus inducing others to contribute less and securing a higher position in the group. On the other hand, if we assume that individual i has negative positional concerns (deriving utility from contributing less than the average contribution), this will trigger the incentive of individual i to contribute less, thus inducing others to contribute more and securing to the individual a lower position in the group. On the other extreme, suppose the incentive effect is positive. When increasing his contribution, individual i will expect an increase in others' contributions. Then, the behavior of individual i will depend on the magnitude of the incentive effect as compared to the <b>positional</b> <b>effect.</b> Experiments in the laboratory provide a unique setting for controlling the variables of interest of our economic model. We use two experimental designs: a partner design where individuals are associated to the same group from period to period and a stranger design where individuals are randomly re-matched at each period with other individuals to form a group. While the partner design includes both incentive and positional effects, the stranger design should include only positional effects. In the stranger design, individuals will not play with the same other players from one period to another and will try only to secure a certain position and not to induce a certain contribution behavior. To investigate these two effects and their We find empirical evidence of positional concerns in public good games. We find that (i) There is a significant positive incentive effect only in the partner treatment. When incentive effects are present (partner treatment), individuals adapt their contribution according to the beliefs on how their contribution may induce (or deter) others in the community to participate in the public good in the following period. (ii) Individuals have positional concerns in both in the partner and stranger treatments. (iii) The <b>positional</b> <b>effect</b> is less important in the partner treatment than in the stranger one. Positional concerns might be counterbalanced by reciprocity concerns.
