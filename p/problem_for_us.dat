5|$|North Korean troops {{promptly}} set up {{a roadblock}} directly behind the 19th Infantry's line in its main route of supply along the road {{near the village of}} Tuman, just south of Yusong on Taejon's western outskirts. The roadblock quickly became a serious <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces trying to move ammunition and wounded to and from the Kum River line. Around 13:00 on July 16, the 19th Infantry Regimental commander contacted Dean, who ordered him to break the roadblock. However, North Korean troops had {{set up a}}t least six machine-gun nests above the road at Tuman, and repeated attacks against it were unable to drive the North Korean troops away.|$|E
5|$|The real <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> {{planners}} {{was a lack}} {{of sufficient}} intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} aim of Abnaa el-Balad was {{to counteract}} Israeli attempts to [...] "divide and rule" [...] by capitalizing on old family feuds {{between the various}} representatives in the Arab municipal councils in Israel.

According to Kiwan, Abnaa el-Balad differed from other Palestinian groups in Israel at the time in that, [...] "The <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> is ... the question of the Palestinian people."

60|$|But the {{biography}} of Plato is interior. We are {{to account for the}} supreme elevation of this man, in the intellectual history of our race,--how it happens that, in proportion to the culture of men, they become his scholars; that, as our Jewish Bible has implanted itself in the table-talk and household life of every man and woman in the European and American nations, so the writings of Plato have pre-occupied every school of learning, every lover of thought, every church, every poet,--making it impossible to think, on certain levels, except through him. He stands between the truth and every man's mind, and has almost impressed language, and the primary forms of thought, with his name and seal. I am struck, in reading him, with the extreme modernness of his style and spirit. Here is the germ of that Europe we know so well, in its long history of arts and arms; here are all its traits, already discernible in the mind of Plato,--and in none before him. It has spread itself since into a hundred histories, but has added no new element. This perpetual modernness is the measure of merit, in every work of art; since the author of it was not misled by anything shortlived or local, but abode by real and abiding traits. How Plato came thus to be Europe, and philosophy, and almost literature, is the <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to solve.|$|E
6000|$|Now, the {{language}} of poetry is simpler than that of prose; as anyone can see who has read what the old-fashioned protestant used to call confidently [...] "his" [...] Bible. And, being simpler, it is also truer; and, being truer, it is also fiercer. And, {{for most of the}} infamies of our time, there is really nothing plain enough, except the plain language of poetry. Take, let us say, the ease of the recent railway disaster, and the acquittal of the capitalists' interest. It is not a scientific <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to investigate. It is a crime committed before our eyes; committed, perhaps, by blind men or maniacs, or men hypnotised, or men in some other ways unconscious; but committed in broad daylight, so that the corpse is bleeding on our door-step. Good lives were lost, because good lives do not pay; and bad coals do pay. It seems simply impossible to get any other meaning out of the matter except that. And, if in human history there be anything simple and anything horrible, it seems to have been present in this matter. If, even after some study and understanding of the old religious passions which were the resurrection of Europe, we cannot endure the extreme infamy of witches and heretics literally burned alive--well, the people in this affair were quite as literally burned alive. If, when we have really tried to extend our charity beyond the borders of personal sympathy, to all the complexities of class and creed, we still feel something insolent about the triumphant and acquitted man who is in the wrong, here the men who are in the wrong are triumphant and acquitted. It is no subject for science. It is a subject for poetry. But for poetry of a terrible sort.|$|E

I recollect [...] that I had transferred my headquarters from a boat in the river [...] to a house a short distance back from the levee. I was seated [...] on the piazza engaged in conversation with my staff when Sherman [...] came up. After a few moments' conversation {{he said that he}} would [...] like to see me alone. We passed into the house together and shut [...] the door after us. Sherman then expressed his alarm at the move [...] I had ordered, saying that I was putting myself in a position [...] voluntarily which an enemy would be glad to manoeuvre a year--or [...] a long time--to get me in. I was going into the enemy's country, [...] with a large river behind me and the enemy holding points [...] strongly fortified above and below. He said that it was an [...] axiom in war that when any great body of troops moved against an [...] enemy they should do so from a base of supplies, which they would [...] guard as they would the apple of the eye, etc. He pointed out [...] all the difficulties that might be encountered in the campaign [...] proposed, and stated in turn what would be the true campaign to [...] make. This was, in substance, to go back until high ground [...] could be reached on the east bank of the river; fortify there [...] and establish a depot of supplies, and move from there, being [...] always prepared to fall back upon it in case of disaster. I [...] said this would take us back to Memphis. Sherman then said that [...] was the very place he would go to, and would move by railroad [...] from Memphis to Grenada, repairing the road as we advanced. To [...] this I replied, the country is already disheartened over the [...] lack of success on the part of our armies; the last election [...] went against the vigorous prosecution of the war, voluntary [...] enlistments had ceased throughout most of the North and [...] conscription was already resorted to, and if we went back so far [...] as Memphis it would discourage the people so much that bases of [...] supplies would be of no use: neither men to hold them nor [...] supplies to put in them would be furnished. The <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> [...] was to move forward to a decisive victory, or our cause was [...] lost. No progress was being made in any other field, and we had [...] to go on.|$|E
