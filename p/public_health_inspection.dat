2500|$|Since its founding, the EU has {{operated}} among an increasing plurality {{of national and}} globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, {{and in any case}} under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states [...] "have limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and have thus created a body of law which binds both their nationals and themselves" [...] on the [...] "basis of reciprocity". EU law would not [...] "be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question". This meant any [...] "subsequent unilateral act" [...] of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>inspection</b> fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In [...] "accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law", said the Court of Justice, the [...] "directly applicable measures of the institutions" [...] (such as the Regulations in the case) [...] "render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law".

METHODS: The industrial systems in Guangzhou were classified into six categories according to the Chinese <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Inspection</b> Statistical Report. Baseline data on 79, 547 workers, age > or = 35, were retrieved from individual health records under the Guangzhou Occupational Health Surveillance Record System established in 1989 - 1992. In this prospective cohort study, the workers' vital status and causes of death were followed up until 31 December 1998. Using SPSS 10. 0, crude death rates were calculated and relative risks(RR) (95 % CI) were estimated using Cox proportional-hazard models. RESULTS: (1) Among 79, 547 workers were 49, 355 men and 30, 192 women, with mean age of (43. 8 +/- 6. 5) years, and 64 % were aged 35 - 44. The mean age difference of workers in different industries was +/- 1 year. At baseline, 41 % had been exposed to occupational hazards. Exposure was most prevalent in petroleum chemical industry(53. 9 %), followed by metallurgical industry, and the lowest exposure was in mechanical industry (30. 2 %). (2) The mean follow-up period was (8. 0 +/- 1. 3) years with 633, 510 person-years. 1, 577 workers had died with a total death rate of 248. 9 per 100, 000 person-years. The death rate in rubber industry was the highest, followed by metallurgical and petroleum chemical industries. Malignant neoplasms, vascular and respiratory diseases were most common, constituting 80. 3 % of all causes of death. (3) For all causes of death and the three main categories, the top three crude death rates were observed in rubber and petroleum chemical industries, and in the metallurgical industry except for vascular causes. The rubber industry had the highest crude death rate for all and vascular causes, and the metallurgical industry for malignant neoplasms and respiratory causes. (4) With the light industry as a reference (RR = 1. 0), the metallurgical industry had the highest adjusted relative risks (RR) (95 % CI) of 1. 62 (1. 20 - 2. 18) and 7. 42 (3. 38 - 16. 31) for malignant neoplasms and respiratory causes, respectively. The rubber industry had the highest RR of 1. 69 (1. 40 - 2. 04) for all causes. A significant RR of 2. 03 (1. 43 - 2. 88) for vascular causes was observed only in the rubber industry. CONCLUSIONS: The {{main causes of death}} varied from industry. Malignant neoplasms and respiratory diseases were the leading causes in metallurgical and petroleum chemical industries. In rubber industry, vascular and respiratory causes were most common. Preventive measures for disease control should be tailor-made for each industry. 目的　比較廣州市不同工業行業職工的主要死因。方法　將廣州市工業系統參照中國衛生監督統計報告表行業分類分為 6 個行業,以 1989 ～ 1992 年實施職業健康監護系統中建立的 795 4 7 名年齡≥ 35 歲的工廠職工個體健康檔案為基礎資料,按前瞻性隊列研究方法,隨訪至 1998 年 12 月 31 日,登記隊列中職工的生存狀態和死亡原因,計算粗死亡率,用Cox比例風險模型計算RR及 95 %CI。結果　 (1) 795 4 7 名職工中,男 4 935 5 人、女 30 192 人,平均年齡 (43. 8 ± 6. 5) 歲, 6 4 %的職工年齡在 35 ～ 4 4 歲,各行業職工年齡相近,相差± 1 歲; 4 1 %的職工接觸職業有害因素,石化行業職業有害因素接觸率最高 (5 3. 9 %),冶金行業次之,機械行業最低 (30. 2 %) 。 (2) 截至 1998 年 12 月 31 日,平均追蹤 (8. 0 ± 1. 3) 年,共 6 335 10 人年;共有 15 77 名職工死亡,總死亡率為 2 4 8. 9 / 10 萬人年,其中橡膠行業總死亡率最高,其次為冶金和石化行業,主要死因為惡性腫瘤、血管疾病和呼吸系統疾病,占總死亡人數的 80. 3 %。(3) 全死因和血管疾病的粗死亡率橡膠行業排第一位,惡性腫瘤和呼吸系統疾病粗死亡率則為冶金行業排第一位。 (4) 調整各相關因素后,以輕工行業為對照(RR為 1. 0),發現冶金行業的惡性腫瘤和呼吸系統疾病的要死因為血管疾病, 其次是呼吸系統疾病;工業行業職工疾病的控制應有針對性。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The ethnic nature and diversity of foods prepared within each pavilion presents a unique problem for food inspectors as each culture prepares food in their own very unique way. In 2010, the Russian pavilion at Folklorama was implicated in a foodborne outbreak of E. coli O 157 causing 37 illnesses and 18 hospitalizations.

40|$|Foodborne {{illness is}} {{prevented}} by {{inspection and surveillance}} conducted by health departments across America. Appropriate restaurant behavior is enforced and monitored via <b>public</b> <b>health</b> <b>inspections.</b> However, surveillance coverage provided by state and local health departments is insufficient in preventing the rising number of foodborne illness outbreaks. To address this need for improved surveillance coverage we conducted a supplementary form of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> surveillance using social media data: Yelp. com restaurant reviews {{in the city of}} San Francisco. Yelp is a social media site where users post reviews and rate restaurants they have personally visited. Presence of keywords related to health code regulations and foodborne illness symptoms, number of restaurant reviews, number of Yelp stars, and restaurant price range were included in a model predicting a restaurant's likelihood of health code violation measured by the assigned San Francisco <b>public</b> <b>health</b> code rating. For a list of major health code violations see (S 1 Table). We built the predictive model using 71, 360 Yelp reviews of restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. The predictive model was able to predict health code violations in 78 % of the restaurants receiving serious citations in our pilot study of 440 restaurants. Training and validation data sets each pulled data from 220 restaurants in San Francisco. Keyword analysis of free text within Yelp not only improved detection of high-risk restaurants, but it also served to identify specific risk factors related to health code violation. To further validate our model we applied the model generated in our pilot study to Yelp data from 1, 542 restaurants in San Francisco. The model achieved 91 % sensitivity 74 % specificity, area under the receiver operator curve of 98 %, and positive predictive value of 29 % (given a substandard health code rating prevalence of 10 %). When our model was applied to restaurant reviews in New York City we achieved 74 % sensitivity, 54 % specificity, area under the receiver operator curve of 77 %, and positive predictive value of 25 % (given a prevalence of 12 %). Model accuracy improved when reviews ranked highest by Yelp were utilized. Our results indicate that <b>public</b> <b>health</b> surveillance can be improved by using social media data to identify restaurants at high risk for health code violation. Additionally, using highly ranked Yelp reviews improves predictive power and limits the number of reviews needed to generate prediction. Use of this approach as an adjunct to current risk ranking of restaurants prior to inspection may enhance detection of those restaurants participating in high risk practices that may have gone previously undetected. This model represents a step forward in the integration of social media into meaningful <b>public</b> <b>health</b> interventions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{geographical}} information system (GIS) technologies in <b>public</b> <b>health</b> surveillance is gradually gaining momentum {{around the world and}} many applications have already been reported in the literature. In this study, GIS technology was used to help county departments of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> to implement environmental health surveillance for the Athens 2004 Olympic and Para Olympic Games. Methods In order to assess the workload in each Olympic county, 19 registry forms and 17 standardized inspection forms were developed to register and inspect environmental <b>health</b> items requiring <b>inspection</b> (Hotels, restaurants, swimming pools, water supply system etc), respectively. Furthermore, related databases were created using Epi Info 2002 and a {{geographical information system}} (GIS) were used to implement an integrated Environmental <b>Health</b> <b>inspection</b> program. The project was conducted in Athens by the Olympic Planning Unit (OPU) of the National School of <b>Public</b> <b>Health,</b> in close cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity and the corresponding departments of <b>Public</b> <b>Health</b> in all municipalities that were scheduled to host events during the Athens 2004 Olympic and Para Olympic games. Results A total of 44, 741 premises of environmental health interest were geocoded into GIS databases and several electronic maps were developed. Using such maps in association with specific criteria, we first identified the maximum workload required to execute environmental <b>health</b> <b>inspections</b> in all premises within the eleven Olympic County Departments of <b>Public</b> <b>Health.</b> Six different scenarios were created for each county, based on devised algorithms in order to design the most effective and realistic inspection program using the available inspectors from each municipality. Furthermore, GIS applications were used to organize the daily inspection program for the Olympic games, provide coloured displays of the inspection results and link those results with the <b>public</b> <b>health</b> surveillance of specific cases or outbreak investigation. Conclusion Our computerised program exhibited significant efficiency in facilitating the prudent use of <b>public</b> <b>health</b> resources in implementing environmental <b>health</b> <b>inspections</b> in densely populated urban areas as well as in rural counties.

Methods: A total of 604 HIAs, sampled across three geographical regions of China at three administrative levels, participated in a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2013. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the status of mandated operations, manpower, revenue and expenditures, and institutional infrastructure. Differences in these characteristics across the geographical regions and administrative levels were compared. Results: On average, the HIAs had not fully implemented the 11 mandated functions at any administrative levels. Governmental financial allocations were the main sources of revenue. Three primary personnel employment models coexisted and most employed the quasi-civil service employment model. The institutional infrastructure did not meet governmental mandated standards with respect to building area or the number and types of equipment available to conduct key functions. Conclusions: In 2012, the majority of the HIAs in China at the provincial, municipal, and county levels did not meet the mandated requirements, although positive indications toward meeting these requirements were observed. It is necessary for the government {{to pay more attention to}} institutional resources (buildings, equipment, and the level of the staff’s educational attainment) and ensure that the HIAs can meet their service delivery objectives...|$|R
40|$|The {{public concern}} for safe food {{has been a}} topic of {{increasing}} interest. More and more media outlets are publishing the <b>health</b> <b>inspection</b> scores and reports in their newspapers, on television and radio and on the Internet. Health agencies and local regulations are requiring restaurants to post their inspection ratings publicly on the premises. ^ The purpose {{of this research is}} twofold. The first purpose is to develop and test a measure for determining foodservice and health agency professionals 2 ̆ 7 attitude toward the media reporting of <b>health</b> <b>inspection</b> reports. The second purpose is to develop a web based survey instrument to deliver the questionnaire. ^ <b>Public</b> <b>health</b> officials 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward foodservice professionals, <b>health</b> <b>inspection</b> professionals, media reporting of inspection reports and the inspection process was measured using a scale based on semantic differential theory. Common bi-polar adjectives were used to ascertain attitudes {{in each of the four}} subject areas. ^ An important finding of the study was that <b>public</b> <b>health</b> officials 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward foodservice professionals 2 ̆ 7 influence on inspection and media reporting, attitudes toward media reporting, attitude toward the inspection process, and experience as a foodservice inspector were all influential on the perceived relationship between inspectors and foodservice professionals. ...|$|R
50|$|State health {{departments}} have different names and responsibilities; {{in some states}} they are top-level administrative agencies, while in other states they are a division or bureau of another office. Health departments are usually responsible for <b>public</b> <b>health,</b> including preventive medicine, epidemiology, vaccinations, environmental health (sometimes including <b>health</b> <b>inspections),</b> and the licensing of health care professionals; the collection and archiving of vital records such as birth and death certificates and sometimes marriage and divorce certificates; health statistics; developmental disabilities; mental health; occupational safety and health; receiving and recording reports of notifiable diseases; and tobacco control.|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} and prevalence {{of food safety}} practices among food staff working in food establishments in Manitoba is underrepresented {{and has not been}} adequately reviewed and researched. Uncertified food staff are at higher risk of not following food safety practices that can cause contamination of food and result in foodborne illness. The purpose of this quantitative {{study was to determine the}} prevalence of food safety practices among food staff in Manitoba and to determine the relationship between food safety certification and routine <b>health</b> <b>inspections.</b> Pender 2 ̆ 7 s health promotion model and Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s social cognitive theory were used to explain the relationships and associations between variables. Archived data dating from 2012 to 2014 of <b>health</b> <b>inspection</b> reports on 558 food establishments were collected and analyzed using the Manitoba Health Hedgehog database. Chi Square, Pearson Correlation Coefficients, and Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s Exact Tests revealed the association of food safety practices, routine <b>health</b> <b>inspections,</b> and food safety certification. Results indicated no statistical difference between food safety practices and routine <b>health</b> <b>inspections.</b> Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s r analysis revealed a weak relation between routine inspections, internal temperature, thermometer use, and food storage/food protection noncompliance. Logistic regression analysis revealed that food safety certification was not a predictor of food safety practice compliance. This study can provide a bridge to reevaluate current health policies pertaining to food safety practices in Manitoba. This study adheres to the need for social change in establishing and creating prevention programs for food staff. Food safety programs can safeguard the food industry and protect <b>public</b> <b>health</b> from foodborne illnesses...|$|R
