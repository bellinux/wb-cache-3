25|$|The {{demarcation}} {{between science}} and pseudoscience has philosophical and scientific implications. Differentiating science from pseudoscience has <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> {{in the case of}} health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education. Distinguishing scientific facts and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs, such as those found in astrology, alchemy, medical quackery, occult beliefs, and creation science combined with scientific concepts, is part of science education and scientific literacy.|$|E
25|$|Distinguishing {{science from}} pseudoscience has <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> {{in the case}} of health care, expert testimony, {{environmental}} policies, and science education. Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive, and dangerous to patients, and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers, and the public as to what treatments are appropriate. Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making bad decisions in selecting curricula.|$|E
25|$|A deeper {{understanding}} of the mechanisms underlying consciousness on the biochemical level has <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> which extend to the development of more effective and reliable anesthetics. This method is especially useful for the study of consciousness because of anesthetic's well-known ability to elicit unconsciousness. This often happens in a single moment, giving the impression of a collapse of conscious coherence. Stuart Hameroff is a notable anesthesiologist who promotes this method {{in the development of a}} science of consciousness.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of his career, Lebesgue also made forays into the realms of complex {{analysis}} and topology. He also had a disagreement with Émile Borel about whose integral was more general. However, these minor forays pale in comparison to his contributions to real analysis; his contributions to this field had a tremendous impact on the shape of the field today and his methods have become an essential part of modern analysis. These have important <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> for fundamental physics of which Lebesgue would have been completely unaware, as noted below.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advances}} in molecular biology {{stemming from the}} discovery of the DNA double helix eventually led to ways to sequence genes. James Watson directed the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health. The ability to sequence and manipulate DNA is now central to the biotechnology industry and modern medicine. The austere beauty of the structure and the <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> of the DNA double helix combined to make Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids; A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid {{one of the most prominent}} biology articles of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|What is knowledge? What is experience? How do they interact? Is there a correlational, causal, or {{reciprocal}} relationship between knowledge and experience? These {{and other related}} questions {{have been at the}} forefront of investigation by problem solvers, scientists, psychologists, and philosophers for centuries. These questions, but particularly the problem of how experience and knowledge interrelate, have broad theoretical and <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> for such academic disciplines as epistemology, linguistics, and psychology (specifically the subdiscipline of thinking and problem solving). Gaining a more precise understanding of human knowledge, whether defined as innate, experiential, or both, is an important part of effective problem solving.|$|E

25|$|In halakha, {{there are}} two general types of fast: the {{communal}} fast and the individuals' fast. Among other differences between the two, a special prayer is added by the Chazzan (leader of the prayers) on communal fasts whenever both ten fasting individuals congregate and the Chazzan is fasting. While the Magen Avraham treats the fast as an individuals' fast, the Shiyurei K'nesset Ha-G'dolah, the P'ri Chadash, and the Or Zaru'a {{view it as a}} communal fast. To avoid the <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> of the controversy, the Mishnah Berurah suggests that a firstborn should not serve as Chazzan {{on the day of the}} fast.|$|E
25|$|Following {{their return}} from exile in Geneva {{during the reign}} of Queen Mary I and King Philip, English Protestants known as Puritans (who {{remained}} within the Church of England) and separatists (who separated from it) began to attempt to introduce some of the more radical reforms they had experienced in Geneva into the worship of the Church of England, and in some ways to go beyond them. They sought to rid worship of any element not specifically prescribed in the Bible, though they disagreed on the <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> of this. They also favored liturgical decisions to be made at the lowest level possible, rather than by a regional or national authority.|$|E
25|$|Cells are the {{building}} blocks of all living organisms. Within these cells are coils of DNA, genetic information instructing for how our cells will develop and operate. A small segment of DNA is a gene which codes for the making of proteins and passing on traits to offspring in reproduction. The main goal of a gene is to reproduce and thrive in its environment in relative to competitors. <b>Practical</b> <b>implications</b> in crime investigation, disorders and increasingly talent prediction and career decision making have considered their association with genes and biology, but the idea of biology and marketing is a growing body of knowledge.

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the fractional-order {{derivative}} and obtain analytic numeric {{solution of the}} model presented in [10]. The rationale behind the application of fractional derivatives can also be ascertained {{from some of the}} current papers published on mathematical modeling [12 – 16]. In addition to this, the <b>practical</b> <b>implication</b> of fractional derivative can be established in [17].|$|R
30|$|Another {{factor that}} can hinder {{networking}} for organizational innovations is the difficulty {{to apply the}} lessons learnt in the own company: “A lot of theories are used, but the <b>practical</b> <b>implication</b> is another story” (farmer interview). Because of these difficulties, some growers prefer to exchange management experiences with their own colleagues, although these contacts are usually limited.|$|R
25|$|Abduction, deduction, and {{induction}} make incomplete {{sense in}} isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic {{way of thinking about}} conceivable <b>practical</b> <b>implications,</b> every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.|$|E
25|$|Bile {{pigments}} such as biliverdin possess significant anti-mutagenic and antioxidant {{properties and}} therefore may fulfil a useful physiological function. Biliverdin and bilirubin {{have been shown}} to be potent scavengers of peroxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants — all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin — as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments — may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though further research is needed to confirm these results. There are currently no <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his career, Durkheim was {{concerned}} primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology {{as a new}} academic discipline. Second, to analyze how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background {{could no longer be}} assumed; to that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and social integration. Lastly, Durkheim {{was concerned}} with the <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> of scientific knowledge. The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work: ...|$|E
500|$|More recently, {{considerations}} {{in deciding whether}} to close a court have included [...] "the costs and <b>practical</b> <b>implications</b> of running a court, the public facilities, waiting times, workload levels and the overall standard of service {{that can be made}} available over the area as a whole". Monmouth, for example, was based in the Shire Hall until it was closed in 2002 because of the poor standard of the court accommodation, the lack of access for people with disabilities and the high cost to run the court compared with the use it received. The Government estimated in March 2000 that the closure of 55 county courts in England and Wales (including 9 courts in Wales) in the previous 6 years had saved a minimum of £6million, through reductions in rent and accommodation charges, running costs and judicial expense.|$|E

25|$|One <b>practical</b> <b>implication</b> of {{explicitly}} {{declaring the}} state to be a republic in 1949 was that it automatically terminated the state's membership of the British Commonwealth, {{in accordance with the}} rules in operation at the time.
