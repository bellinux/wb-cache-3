In Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey, author Nicholas Schaffner interviewed <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Barrett before and during his Pink Floyd days. These included friends Peter and Susan Wynne-Wilson, artist Duggie Fields (with whom Barrett shared a flat during the late 1960s), June Bolan and Storm Thorgerson, among others.|$|E

Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it {{was produced}} by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film documents Muntz's life, paying particular attention to his colorful career, and includes interviews with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> him and home movie footage contributed by his children.|$|E

There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E

25|$|Robert A. Heinlein {{reported}} that Smith had planned a seventh Lensman novel, set {{after the events}} described in Children of the Lens, which was unpublishable at that time (the early 1960s). Smith told Heinlein that the new novel proceeded inexorably from matters left unresolved in Children, a statement easily supported by a careful reading of Children. Careful searches by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Smith well (including Frederik Pohl, Smith's editor, and Verna Smith Trestrail, Smith's daughter) have failed to locate any material related to such a story. Smith apparently never wrote any of it down.|$|E
25|$|The film {{adaptation}} makes much of de Janzé's eccentricities, including {{scenes in}} which she watches a polo match with a snake twined around her shoulders, or doses herself with a syringe of morphine in the ladies' toilet. In 1988, Miles stated at the Cannes Film Festival that as an actress de Janzé was a difficult character for her to portray. When she first arrived in Kenya, Miles sought <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Alice {{but was unable to}} learn anything substantial due to those acquaintances' confused perceptions of de Janzé; some were even uncertain as to her true nationality.|$|E
25|$|The Sunday Times was wary {{of being}} duped, {{especially}} in light of the recent Hitler Diaries hoax. As a result, the newspaper insisted on verifying Vanunu's story with leading nuclear weapon experts, including former U.S. nuclear weapons designer Theodore Taylor and former British AWE engineer Frank Barnaby, who agreed that Vanunu's story was factual and correct. In addition, a reporter, Max Prangnell, was sent to Israel to find <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Vanunu and verify his story. Prangnell verified Vanunu's backstory, meeting a few people at Ben-Gurion University who identified Vanunu from a photograph, as well as meeting neighbors and others who confirmed he had worked at the Dimona nuclear plant.|$|E

25|$|While {{waiting for}} trial, Lucy Ann Berry was remanded to the jail, {{where she was}} held for more than 17 months without being hired out, which was {{customary}} to offset expenses and earn money for slaves' masters. In February 1844 the case went to trial. By then her mother's case had been settled, and Polly Wash was declared free. In addition, Wash had affidavits from <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> her and her daughter. Judge Robert Wash (Fanny Berry Wash's widower and Polly's previous master) testified that Lucy Ann was definitely Polly Berry Wash's child. The jury believed the case for freedom had been proved, and the judge announced Lucy Ann Berry was free. She was approximately 14 years old.|$|E
25|$|Contemporaneous {{documents}} reveal {{little about}} Pontiac before 1763. He was probably born between 1712 and 1725, perhaps at an Ottawa {{village on the}} Detroit or Maumee rivers. Other sources state {{that he may have}} been born in Defiance, Ohio. The tribal affiliation of his parents is uncertain. According to an 18th-century Ottawa tradition, Pontiac's mother was an Ottawa and his father an Ojibwa, although some sources claim that one of his parents was a Miami. Some sources also state that he might have been born a Catawba and taken as prisoner, then adopted as Ottawa. Pontiac was always identified as an Ottawa by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> him. He had also lived in close proximity to Fort Detroit (which he later besieged) since 1732.|$|E
25|$|Gould is {{a popular}} subject of {{biography}} and even critical analysis. Philosophers such as Giorgio Agamben and Mark Kingwell have interpreted Gould's life and ideas. References to Gould and his work are plentiful in poetry, fiction, and the visual arts. François Girard's Genie Award winning 1993 film, Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould includes documentary interviews with <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> him, dramatizations of scenes from Gould's life, and fanciful segments including an animation set to music. Thomas Bernhard's renowned 1983 novel The Loser (Der Untergeher) purports to be an extended first-person essay about Gould and his lifelong friendship with two fellow students from the Mozarteum school in Salzburg, both of whom have abandoned their careers as concert pianists due to the intimidating example of Gould's genius.|$|E
