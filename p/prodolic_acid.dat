Dehydration with H2SO4 gives the indene ethanol 4. Acid catalyzed condensation of 4 with ethyl acetoacetate then gives the fused tetrahydropyran derivative 5 (no doubt by a scheme quite analogous to <b>prodolic</b> <b>acid).</b> The ester is then saponified to the corresponding acid, {{which is then}} converted to the dimethylamide (6). Reduction with LiAlH4 completes the synthesis of the antidepressant agent pirandamine (7).|$|E
