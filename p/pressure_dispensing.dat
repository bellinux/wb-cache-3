40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} adhesives (ECA) are {{an alternative}} to tin/lead solders for attaching Surface Mount Devices (SMD) in electronic assemblies. ECAs are mixtures of a polymer binder (for adhesion) and conductive filler (for electrical conductivity). They bring more conductivity, higher strength, less weight and longer durability than metal alloys. ECAs can offer numerous advantages such as fewer processing steps, lower processing temperature and fine pitch capability. Multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were used as conductive fillers in this research because of their novel electronic and mechanical properties. The high aspect ratio of the nanotubes {{makes it possible to}} percolate at low loadings to obtain good electrical and mechanical properties. Replacing the metal filler with CNTs in the adhesive made the ECA light weight, corrosion resistant, reduced processing temperature, lead free, electrically conductive and high mechanical strength. The MWCNTs at different loadings were mixed with epoxy and epoxy: heloxy to form a composite mixture.

The waveguides were also found to be suitable for single-mode operation through a series of approximate calculations. This is also something previously not achieved with the larger waveguides. This novel approach to waveguide fabrication could reduce the expense and time of creating single mode waveguides for rapid development applications.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve ultra-fine dot solder paste dispensing, both solder {{material}} and dispensing equipment have to be optimized. Dispensability of solder paste was evaluated in terms of “dispensing rate”, consistency of dispensing rate, and the stability of dispensing rate with time. Within the given conditions, threshold values for dispensability seem to exist for viscosity, powder size, and metal content. The desired solder paste properties include fine solder powder, low viscosity, low metal content, high flux activation temperature, and a high thixotropic index. Results were obtained for the Archemides Metering Valve style pump and the Piston Positive Displacement pump. Some of these data were compared to data obtained from a Pneumatic type pump. With {{the use of a}} small nozzle inner diameter, a relatively high pressure is desired for better consistency. For Archimedes Metering Valve assembly with a small nozzle inner diameter, a high consistency may be achieved by using a high encoder count and/or a higher <b>pressure.</b> The <b>dispensing</b> rate of Archimedes type pump increases with increasing nozzle inner diameter and increasing encoder count. This relation could allow more flexible control on metering the paste volume dispensed. For piston pump systems, the dispensing rate increases moderately with increasing nozzle inner diameter and increasing pressure. Interestingly, delay time was found to have negligible effect on dispensing rate, consistency, and stability, possibly due to the relatively high viscosity of solder paste materials. Pneumatic dispensing systems are more prone to clogging, presumably due to cold welding developed under cyclic pressurizing of the paste...|$|R

40|$|The subject {{discussed}} in this thesis is the dosing of droplets in the femto (10 - 15) liter range. In this study, droplets were dispensed using a hollow cantilever atomic force microscope (AFM). Dispensing small volumes finds its applications in for example in single cell manipulation, where a drug is delivered inside a single cell to study {{the reaction of the}} cell to the drug. The working principle of an AFM can be compared with a vinyl player: a small needle is scanning a surface, which can be used for imaging with atomic resolution. For controlled dispensing of small droplets the needle and the cantilever were made hollow and a commercially available AFM system was adapted for fluidic applications. The hollow cantilever AFM chip is connected by tubing to a syringe which acts as fluidic reservoir. Small droplets of water will evaporate almost immediately; to increase the “lifetime” of the droplet a climate controller was added to increase the humidity. Therefore the influence of the climate controller on the AFM system was studied. With the described system droplets in the femto liter range were dispensed on a surface, however controlled dispensing remained a challenge. Therefore this research investigates the parameters influencing the droplet size and how these parameters can be controlled to dispense a desired volume. Two different ways of dispensing are experimentally investigated: just by touching the substrate and using the surface forces to pull liquid from the cantilever onto the substrate and by applying pressure to the liquid reservoir. For dispensing by surface forces, parameters such as surface energy and contact time are investigated to deliver a desired volume. A trend was observed that with increasing contact time an increase in volume is dispensed. For <b>dispensing</b> with additional <b>pressure,</b> a correlation was found between the time of applied <b>pressure</b> and <b>dispensed</b> volume.

Direct writing includes a variety of processes that use different mechanisms to transfer materials on to substrates and can be generally distinguished from conventional rapid prototyping processes by a feature resolution in the sub-micron to micron range. The dispensing system studied in this thesis is a pneumatically actuated micro-extruder which is capable of processing a wide variety of materials. This material dispensing tool is capable of depositing small amounts of material to build three dimensional structures in an accurate and repeatable manner. The material dispensing system in this study has a variety of manufacturing applications ranging from printed electronics to biomedical applications. The material dispensing system employs a needle valve mechanism that allows ink or slurry to be deposited onto a substrate using air <b>pressure.</b> The <b>dispensing</b> tool used for this research is an nScrypt SmartPump. This research is focused on analyzing the extrusion process and developing and validating a parametric model for the input parameters using a design of experiments (DOE) approach. The aim is to improve the repeatability and accuracy of the process. A two phase approach was used to identify significant input parameters impacting the dimensional properties of a printed track. The first set of experiments employed a 2 -level fractional factorial screening design where all user controllable parameters were tested against the response variables - height and width of a printed track. Significant parameters from this analysis were then used to build a regression equation for both height and width. It was observed that while the regression equation for height was accurate in predicting the output at intermediate levels, the regression equation for width was unable to do so and displayed signs of curvature. A higher order three-level regression model was then fit to the significant parameters for width and was found to be satisfactory in predicting process output. The errors observed between predicted outputs from the regression equations and actual output dimensions from the validation experiments were less than 2 % and 3 % for height and width respectively...|$|R
30|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a microfluidic AFM (atomic force microscope) cantilever-based platform to enable the local dispensing and aspiration of liquid with volumes in the pico-to-femtoliter range. The platform consists of a basic AFM measurement system, microfluidic AFM chip, fluidic interface, automated substrate alignment, external pressure control system and controlled climate near the dispensing area. The microfluidic AFM chip has a hollow silicon dioxide (SiO 2) cantilever connected to an on-chip fluid reservoir at one end and a slicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) tip with an aperture on the other end. A 3 D printed plastic fluidic interface glued over the on-chip reservoir was used to connect microfluidics and macrofluidics. The fluidics is connected to an external pressure control system ranging from − 0.8  bar to 5  bar with 0.1  bar resolution. This <b>pressure</b> range allows <b>dispensing</b> and aspiration of liquids through the cantilever tip aperture. The controlled climate with a temperature control range between 25 °C – 40 °C and humidity up to 95 % near the dispensing area keeps the droplets for sufficiently long time before they evaporate.

Experiments were performed with two types of cantilevers with different geometrical configurations.

40|$|Fluid {{dispensing}} is {{a method}} by which fluid materials are delivered to substrates, boards or work-pieces in a controllable manner. This method has been widely used in various packaging processes in the electronics manufacturing industry. In these processes, the flow rate of fluid dispensed and the profile of fluid formed on a board {{are the two most}} important performance variables to be controlled consistently. This research presents a comprehensive study on the modeling and control of the time-pressure dispensing processes. First of all, the characterization of the rheological behaviour of fluids for electronics packaging is addressed from both time-independent and time-dependent perspectives. Under the assumption that the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>dispensing</b> syringe has reached a steady-state status, a model representative of the steady-state flow rate of fluid dispensed is developed. To represent the profile of fluid formed on a board, the spreading of fluid on a board is addressed and a solution to this problem is established. To consider the influence of time-dependent fluid behaviour in fluid dispensing, a method of applying model updating technique is developed in this study. Based on this method, an off-line control of the dispensing process is developed to improve the consistency in the flow rate of fluid dispensed, which is broken by the time-dependent fluid behaviour. Taking into account air compressibility and the fluid inertia, a model is developed to represent the dynamics of the flow rate of fluid dispensed, which shows that the dynamics is sensitive to the air volume in the syringe. Based on the model, the inconsistency in the fluid amount dispensed due to the variation of the air volume in the syringe over a dispensing process is investigated, and an off-line control is developed to alleviate the amount inconsistency. Experiments on a typical commercial dispensing system are designed and carried out to verify the effectiveness of the models and the off-line control developed in this study. It is shown that the model results have an excellent agreement with the experimental results. Also, with the introduction of the off-line control, the consistency in both the flow rate and the amount of fluid dispensed can be significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|For {{traditional}} electroporation devices, {{there are}} a number of problems associated with these devices such as insufficient understanding of its theoretical mechanism, low cell viability, inadequate electroporation efficiency, excess voltage applied to generate required electric field due to the large size of these devices and sample contamination. Although newly developed microfluidic electroporation devices have solved most of the above existing problems in traditional bulk electroporation devices, they appear to lack the ability to control the precise dose of biomolecules or genes transfecting into cells and, from a manufacturing perspective, the fabrication methods do not enable repeatable production of such devices on the large scale. Here, we introduce a new, repeatable method for fabricating 3 -D Micro/Nanofluidic electroporation platforms and characterize these platforms to demonstrate their ability to electroporate live cells. Some of the new methods developed in this work include a direct-write fiber technique via three-axis robotic dispensing system, dry film resist photolithography, film-to-film bonding and replica molding to create the desired electroporation platform. A robotic dispensing system was utilized to control the fiber diameter, which was determined vii by the: 1) prescribed <b>dispense</b> time; 2) <b>pressure</b> of the <b>dispensing</b> system valve; 3) rate at which the stage traversed; 4) diameter of the dispensing tip; 5) polymer solution viscosity and surface tension; and, 6) programmed drawing length. Thin dry film photoresist was utilized to replace liquid photoresist in order to achieve high-quality film-to-film bonding after drawing nanofibers onto one substrate containing the thin-film structure. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was employed as the bulk material to fabricate the target micro/nano electroporation substrate using replica molding and micro/nanofibers etching. Characterization of the direct-write fiber technique via robotic dispensing system to acquire suspended and complex fibers of the required dimension repeatedly under prescribed conditions were completed. Combining this fiber direct-write method and traditional clean room techniques, a total of 18 micro- to nano-scale electroporation devices (6 for each group of 1 ìm, 500 nm, and 300 nm diameter) were successfully developed and mass produced in two weeks with relatively high repeatability (within 20 % of the design). Finally, metrology and characterization studies were performed on the electroporation platforms to validate the micro/nanochannel’s existence and its connectivity to two micro-chambers. Furthermore, biomolecules and other fluorescent particles were successfully transported through the micro/nanochannel and transferred (via electroporation) into the cells. Preliminary results of electroporation experiment performed on this micro/nano-electroporation platform illustrated that the duration of the entire electroporation process was significantly shorter than times reported previously by other investigator’s nano-electroporation platforms...|$|R
