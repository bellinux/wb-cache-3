5|$|The legume vine Mucuna pruriens {{is used in}} the {{countries}} of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant,</b> witchweed (Striga).|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant</b> dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant</b> yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E

25|$|A <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant</b> derives {{some or all}} of its {{nutritional}} requirements from another living plant. They make up about 1% of angiosperms and are in almost every biome in the world. All parasitic plants have modified roots, named haustoria (singular: haustorium), which penetrate the host plants, connecting them to the conductive system â€“ either the xylem, the phloem, or both. This provides them with the ability to extract water and nutrients from the host. Parasitic plants are classified depending on where the <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant</b> latches onto the host and the amount of nutrients it requires. Some parasitic plants are able to locate their host plants by detecting chemicals in the air or soil given off by host shoots or roots, respectively. About 4,500 species of <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant</b> in approximately 20 families of flowering plants are known.|$|E

50|$|Seed {{germination}} of <b>parasitic</b> <b>plants</b> {{occurs in}} a variety of ways. These means can either be chemical or mechanical and the means used by seeds often depends on whether or not the parasites are root parasites or stem parasites. Most <b>parasitic</b> <b>plants</b> need to germinate in close proximity to their host plants because their seeds are limited in the amount of resources necessary to survive without nutrients from their host plants. Resources are limited {{due in part to the}} fact that most <b>parasitic</b> <b>plants</b> are not able to use autotrophic nutrition to establish the early stages of seeding.|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{municipality}} {{is covered in}} forest of one type or another, and these forests are its main natural resource. These forests have been having problems in recent years between insect and <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant</b> infestations and logging. The infestations have been more severe than usual because of drought conditions weakening trees. While there are strict environmental laws for the area {{as part of the}} biosphere reserve, enforcement is spotty. The forests of this and neighboring municipalities have attracting illegal logging from those outside the area. Pinal de Amoles is one of the Sierra Gorda municipalities where this problem is the most serious.|$|E
25|$|Other major {{problems}} facing the canal system is the damage by introduced species and disease destroying native ones. Water lilies {{were introduced to the}} canals from Brazil in the 1940s. Since then, they have become a serious problem as their overgrowth depletes minerals and oxygen from the water. Up to 400 tons of the plant has been extracted from the canals monthly. In 2006, a Brazilian insect (Anthonomus grandis) was introduced to the canals to help control the plant. However, some need to be maintained because the axolotls are using them for reproduction purposes. Introduced species include carp and tilapia, which were introduced in the 1960s. However, these have been very detrimental to the native ecosystem, especially the axolotl, whose eggs they eat. Despite tons of the fish being caught in the canals, they are still a serious problem. Another major problem is the loss of trees, especially junipers in the ecological zone. Over sixty percent of the area is considered to be serious deforested and eighty percent of the junipers have the <b>parasitic</b> <b>plant</b> mistletoe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Parasitic</b> <b>plants</b> {{are common}} in natural com-munities, but are largely ignored in plant {{community}} the-ory. Interactions between <b>parasitic</b> <b>plants</b> and hosts often parallel those between herbivores and plants: both types of consumers display host preferences, reduce host bio-mass and alter host allocation patterns, modify plant community structure and dynamics, and mediate interac-tions between host plants and other organisms. In other cases, basic differences in mobility, hormonal and ele-mental composition and resource capture between plants and animals lead to different effects: <b>parasitic</b> <b>plants</b> have broad host ranges, affect and are affected by host plant physiology because of similar hormonal pathways between parasite and host, do not alter nutrient cycling as extensively as do herbivores, and may simultaneously parasitize and compete with hosts. Many fundamental aspects of the ecology of <b>parasitic</b> <b>plants</b> remain poorly studied, and research to date {{has been dominated by}} laboratory studies and studies of crop pests, rather than by studies of natural communities...|$|R

We identified the cell surface receptor-like protein CUSCUTA RECEPTOR 1 (CuRe 1) as essential for the perception of this parasite-associated molecular pattern. CuRe 1 is sufficient to confer responsiveness to the Cuscuta factor and increased resistance to parasitic C. reflexa when heterologously expressed in otherwise susceptible host plants.
