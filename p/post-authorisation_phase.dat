They may render FVIII replacement therapy ineffective. They represent {{the most severe}} complication of haemophilia A. At least three mechanisms of FVIII neutralisation activity by anti-FVIII antibodies have been described: (1) steric hindrance; (2) recognition of neo-epitopes and (3) catalytic activity. The Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda is the recommended method for inhibitor surveillance. The occurrence of inhibitors is a relatively frequent and early event in previously untreated patients. Conversely, it is rare in previously treated patients. Therapeutic strategies for managing inhibitors include: inhibitor eradication, haemostatic management of bleeding episodes and/or surgery and supportive care. For high responding inhibitors, immune tolerance induction (ITI) is the strategy for achieving antigen-specific tolerance to FVIII. ITI success rate ranges commonly between 60 % and 80 %. For treatment of patients with high-titre, high-responding inhibitors, 'by-pass' therapy is generally recommended. Activated prothrombin complex concentrates represent the historically primary 'by-pass' treatment. Recombinant factor VIIa has also been widely used as a by-passing agent. Considering the small patient population, {{it has to be}} considered that full immunogenicity data cannot be collected premarketing authorisation. Thus, stringent follow-up of patients in the <b>post-authorisation</b> <b>phase</b> is required...|$|E
40|$|Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) {{is subject}} to {{challenges}} that undermine this process as an effective safeguard to biodiversity. Internationally, effective EIA is hindered by the following issues: a low priority assigned to the consideration of biodiversity and a limited capacity to carry out assessments; a lack of formalised procedures and inconsistent methodologies to address biodiversity within the EIA framework; {{and a lack of}} formal requirements for post-project monitoring of biodiversity aspects. Traditionally effectiveness studies in this regard have focused on evaluating the procedural aspects of EIA, and have focused less on the substantive outcomes of the <b>post-authorisation</b> <b>phase</b> of a proposed project. While South Africa has a considerable body of literature pertaining to the procedural aspects of EIA, there remain two substantial gaps in the literature. Firstly, there is an evident absence of effectiveness studies in South Africa that focus primarily on biodiversity-specific procedure. Secondly, almost no research has been conducted in South Africa which investigates the outcomes of mitigation measures, mandatory monitoring, reporting and compliance with biodiversity aspects of EIA. This research therefore aims to fill these gaps by investigating the quality of information generated in five EIAs in the Western Cape. It also examines the implementation success of mitigation measures aimed at managing unavoidable impacts in the <b>post-authorisation</b> <b>phase</b> of these projects. This research has adopted a case study methodological approach. Five EIAs were selected from a sample of 9. In no order of significance, the variables considered most important in the sampling protocol were: the presence of a biodiversity-related specialist report; availability of environmental assessment documentation; overall cases to represent at least two different local jurisdictions; and the uniqueness of adopted biodiversity-related mitigation measures. The primary method used to evaluate the quality of biodiversity-related information is a Key Performance Indicator analysis, whereby the performance of cases is measured against legal and best-practice reporting principles. The substantive outcomes of EIA have been investigated by means of site inspections and interviews with key stakeholders. This research has found that the five cases performed well with complying with best-practice EIA procedure, indicating a 53 % full compliance, 29 % partial compliance and 18 % of best-practice principles were not complied with at all. This research has shown that direct impacts on biodiversity (such as the physical removal of indigenous vegetation) are adequately identified, and indirect impacts (typically those impacting off-site and on ecological processes) are poorly identified in EIA. Therefore, the information required to avoid impacts on biodiversity is available, but this research has found that it is underutilized in this regard. Notably, avoidance of impacts was undermined inadequate site and layout alternatives and poor decision making in terms of the regular authorisation of irreversible impacts on biodiversity. Conversely, only 18 % of mitigation measures were fully complied with, 36 % were partially complied with, and 45 % of mitigation measures were not complied with. These results indicate a poor performance of EIA in the implementation stage of a project lifecycle. This research has concluded this is most likely due to a poor conversion of recommended mitigation measures into conditions of authorisation and a limited capacity of the competent authority to perform compliance monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Medicines {{receiving}} a conditional marketing authorisation through Medicines Adaptive Pathways to Patients (MAPPs) {{will be a}} challenge for payers. The ‘introduction’ of MAPPs is already seen by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a fait accompli, with payers not consulted or involved. However, once medicines are approved through MAPPs, they will be evaluated for funding by payers through different activities. These include Health Technology Assessment (HTA) with often immature clinical data and high uncertainty, financial considerations, and negotiations through different types of agreements, which can require monitoring post launch. Payers have experience with new medicines approved through conditional approval, {{and the fact that}} MAPPs present additional challenges is a concern from their perspective. There may be some activities where payers can collaborate. The final decisions on whether to reimburse a new medicine via MAPPs will have more variation than for medicines licensed via conventional processes. This is due not only to increasing uncertainty associated with medicines authorised through MAPPs but also differences in legal frameworks between member states. Moreover, if the financial and side-effect burden from the period of conditional approval until granting full marketing authorisation is shifted to the <b>post-authorisation</b> <b>phase,</b> payers may have to bear such burdens. Collection of robust data during routine clinical use is challenging along with high prices for new medicines during data collection. This paper presents the concept of MAPPs and possible challenges. Concerns and potential ways forward are discussed and a number of recommendations are presented from the perspective of payers...|$|E
