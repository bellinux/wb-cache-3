40|$|I {{discuss the}} results of {{simplified}} three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the boundary layer between a disc and a non-rotating, unmagnetized star. Strong magnetic fields, possibly approaching equipartition with the thermal energy, occur in the boundary layer due to the shearing of disc-generated fields. The mean boundary layer magnetic field, which is highly variable on an orbital timescale, is estimated to exceed 50 kG for a CV with an accretion rate of 10 ^(- 9) solar masses per year. However, these fields do not drive efficient angular momentum transport within the boundary layer. As a consequence the radial velocity in the boundary layer is low, and the density high.

40|$|When {{a source}} emits a gravity-wave (GW) pulse over {{a short period}} of time, {{the leading edge of the}} GW signal is redshifted more than the inner {{boundary}} of the pulse. The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the self-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for GW pulses from the final <b>plunge</b> of black <b>hole</b> (BH) binaries, leading to the evolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the source. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration of the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be relevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a radius of <~ 100 M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge between binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated GW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0. 001. Accounting for the wave distortion would significantly decrease the waveform extraction errors in numerical simulations. Comment: accepted for publication in Physical Review...|$|R

40|$|The {{observability}} {{of gravitational}} waves from supermassive and intermediate-mass black holes by the forecoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and the physics {{we can learn}} from the observations, will depend on two basic factors: the event rates for massive black hole mergers occurring in the LISA best sensitivity window, and our theoretical knowledge of the gravitational waveforms. We first provide a concise review of the literature on LISA event rates for massive black hole mergers, as predicted by different formation scenarios. Then we discuss what (in our view) are the most urgent issues to address in terms of waveform modelling. For massive black hole binary inspiral these include spin precession, eccentricity, the effect of high-order Post-Newtonian terms in the amplitude and phase, and an accurate prediction of the transition from inspiral to <b>plunge.</b> For black <b>hole</b> ringdown, numerical relativity will ultimately be required to determine the relative quasinormal mode excitation, and to reduce the dimensionality of the template space in matched filtering.

40|$|Research on extracting {{science from}} binary-black-hole (BBH) {{simulations}} has often adopted a “scattering matrix” perspective: given the binary’s initial parameters, {{what are the}} final hole’s parameters and the emitted gravitational waveform? In contrast, we are using BBH simulations to explore the nonlinear dynamics of curved spacetime. Focusing on the head-on plunge, merger, and ringdown of a BBH with transverse, antiparallel spins, we explore numerically the momentum flow between the holes and the surrounding spacetime. We use the Landau-Lifshitz field-theory-in-flat-spacetime formulation of general relativity to define and compute the density of field energy and field momentum outside horizons and the energy and momentum contained within horizons, and we define the effective velocity of each apparent and event horizon as the ratio of its enclosed momentum to its enclosed mass-energy. We find surprisingly good agreement between the horizons’ effective and coordinate velocities. During the <b>plunge,</b> the <b>holes</b> experience a frame-dragging-induced acceleration orthogonal to the plane of their spins and their infall (“downward”), and they reach downward speeds of order 1000 [*][*]km/s. When the common apparent horizon forms (and when the event horizons merge and their merged neck expands), the horizon swallows upward field momentum that resided between the holes, causing the merged hole to accelerate in the opposite (“upward”) direction. As the merged hole and the field energy and momentum settle down, a pulsational burst of gravitational waves is emitted, and the merged hole has a final effective velocity of about 20 [*][*]km/s upward, which agrees with the recoil velocity obtained by measuring the linear momentum carried to infinity by the emitted gravitational radiation. To investigate the gauge dependence of our results, we compare generalized harmonic and Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura-moving-puncture evolutions of physically similar initial data; although the generalized harmonic and Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura-moving-puncture simulations use different gauge conditions, we find remarkably good agreement for our results in these two cases.

40|$|In {{a binary}} system {{composed}} of a supermassive black hole and a star orbiting the hole in an equatorial, circular orbit, the stellar orbit will shrink due to the action of gravitational radiation, until the star fills its Roche lobe outside the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) of the <b>hole</b> or <b>plunges</b> into the <b>hole.</b> In the former case, gas will flow through the inner Lagrange point (L 1) to the hole. If this tidal stripping process happens on a time scale faster than the thermal time scale but slower than the dynamical time scale, the entropy {{as a function of}} the interior mass is conserved. The star will evolve adiabatically, and, in most cases, will recede from the hole while filling its Roche lobe. We calculate how the stellar equilibrium properties change, which determines how the stellar orbital period and mass-transfer rate change through the “Roche evolution” for various types of stars in the relativistic regime. We envisage that the mass stream eventually hits the accretion disc, where it forms a hot spot orbiting the hole and may ultimately modulate the luminosity with the stellar orbital frequency. The ultimate goal is to probe the mass and spin of the hole and provide a test of general relativity in the strong-field regime from the resultant quasi-periodic signals. The observability of such a modulation is discussed along with a possible interpretation of an intermittent 1 hour period in the X-ray emission of RE J 1034 + 396...|$|R
40|$|The {{stationary}} hydrodynamic equations for the transonic accretion disks {{and flows}} around rotating black holes are presented {{by using the}} Kerr-Schild coordinate {{where there is no}} coordinate singularity at the event horizon. We use two types of the causal viscosity prescription, and the boundary conditions for the transonic accretion flows are given at the sonic point. For one type of the causal viscosity prescription we also add the boundary conditions at the viscous point where the accreting radial velocity is nearly equal to the viscous diffusion velocity. Based on the formalism for the transonic accretion disks, after we present the calculation method of the transonic solutions, the horizon-penetrating transonic solutions which smoothly pass the event horizon are calculated for several types of the accretion flow models: the ideal isothermal flows, the ideal and the viscous polytropic flows, the advection dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) with the relativistic equation of state, the adiabatic accretion disks, the standard accretion disks, the supercritical accretion disks. These solutions are obtained for both non-rotating and rotating black holes. The calculated accretion flows <b>plunge</b> into black <b>hole</b> with finite three velocity smaller than the speed of light even at the event horizon or inside the horizon, and the angular velocities of the accretion flow at the horizon are generally different from the angular velocity of the frame-dragging due to the black hole’s rotation.

40|$|A {{particle}} of mass μ moves, in {{the absence}} of external forces, in the geometry of a nonrotating black hole of mass M. The system (black hole plus particle) emits gravitational waves, and the particle’s orbit evolves under radiation reaction. The aim {{of this paper is to}} calculate this evolution. Our calculations are carried out under the assumptions that μ/M≪ 1, that the orbit is bound, and that radiation reaction takes place over a time scale much longer than the orbital period. The bound orbits of the Schwarzschild spacetime can be fully characterized, apart from initial conditions, by two orbital parameters: the semi-latus rectum p, and the eccentricity e. These parameters are so defined that the turning points of the radial motion (the values of the Schwarzschild radial coordinate at which the radial component of the four-velocity vanishes) are given by r 1 =pM/(1 +e) and r 2 =pM/(1 -e). The units are such that G=c= 1. We use the Teukolsky perturbation formalism to calculate the rates at which the gravitational waves generated by the orbiting particle remove energy and angular momentum from the system. These are then related to the rates of change of p and e, which determine the orbital evolution. We find that the radiation reaction continually decreases p, in such a way that the particle eventually plunges inside the black <b>hole.</b> <b>Plunging</b> occurs when p becomes smaller than 6 + 2 e. (Orbits for which p< 6 + 2 e do not have a turning point at r=r 1). For weak-field, slow-motion orbits (which are characterized by large values of p), the radiation reaction decreases e also. However, for strong-field fast-motion orbits (small values of p), the radiation reaction increases the eccentricity if p is sufficiently close to its minimum value 6 + 2 e. The change of sign of de/dt can be interpreted as a precursor effect to the eventual plunging of the orbit...|$|R
