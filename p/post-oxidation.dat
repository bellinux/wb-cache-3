In the present work, the microstructure resulting by a thermochemical treatment, which comprises nitriding, nitrocarburizing and <b>post-oxidation</b> stages, applied to an industrial 16 MnCr 5 component, has been studied. Both the nitriding and nitrocarburizing temperatures were systematically changed in order to study the resulting phases in the compound layer. The depth of the compound layer have been measured by optical microscopy to evaluate the effect due to the variations in the process variables during the nitrocarburizing process. Moreover, the microstructure has been investigated by means of a scanning electron microscope equipped with a electron backscatter diffraction detector in order to assess the amount and the distribution of Fe-N-C phases. A temperature increase from 510 up to 550 °C during the nitriding process inside a NH 3 atmosphere induces a higher fraction of ε-Fe 2 - 3 (C,N) compounds. On the contrary, nitrocarburizing at 600 °C instead of 580 °C under a gaseous mix of NH 3 (50 %), CO 2 and N 2 favors a greater amount of γ'-Fe 4 (C,N) nitrides.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanisms}} of plasma <b>post-oxidation</b> of plasma nitrided AISI 1045 plain steel were investigated. The influence of plasma <b>post-oxidation</b> temperature and {{time on the}} oxide layer thickness, morphology, and composition were addressed.

The time dependence of the oxide layer thickness, on the other hand, is governed by a diffusion-reaction process.

Indeed, at the highest temperature, 550 °C, the oxide layer is not homogeneous and has a lower hardness than oxide layers obtained at 480 to 500 °C. The latter seem to be more favorable temperatures to grow compact, homogeneous, and harder oxide layers. The oxide–nitride bi-layer produced here contains a mixture of γ′-Fe 4 N and ε-Fe 2 - 3 N and only one iron oxide, Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite).

Growth is performed by means of UHV metal deposition and <b>post-oxidation</b> cycles. Chemical and structural characterisation of the deposits is achieved by means of electron spectroscopy (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS; angle resolved XPS) and electron diffraction techniques (low energy electron diffraction, LEED; X-ray photoelectron diffraction, XPD). Three growth procedures have been investigated, which differ for the particular growth parameters adopted in each case. We demonstrate that <b>post-oxidation</b> is effective {{in order to obtain}} epitaxial NiO only if the initial dose of Ni evaporated on the clean Pd(1 0 0) substrate exceeds a critical value, corresponding approximately to two equivalent monolayers. However, the overlayer thus obtained is strongly understoichiometric in oxygen close to the metal/oxide interface and poorly ordered on the long range. When a Ni dose below this limiting first value is used, the layer evolves toward polycrystalline NiO, due to substantial oxidation of the Pd substrate promoted by the presence of Ni, very likely through a work function decrease upon direct metal/metal interface formation. On the contrary, epitaxial NiO(1 0 0) layers of good structural quality, with limited oxygen deficiency at the interface, with negligible substrate oxidation and with a good degree of long-range order are obtained if deposition and <b>post-oxidation</b> cycles are initiated on an oxygen pre-saturated Pd surface, characterised by the (√ 5 ×√ 5) -R 27 ° O/Pd(1 0 0) LEED pattern.

Unfortunately, corrosion resistance of the obtained nitrided layer is poor as a consequence of its high grade of porosity. In the present work, pulsed plasma <b>post-oxidation</b> process is analyzed as an alternative technique to increase corrosion resistance of plasma nitrided AISI 4340. The effect of <b>post-oxidation</b> process duration (15, 30 and 60 minutes) on the corrosion performance of samples when they are exposed to a rich chloride fog under controlled temperature and pressure conditions was evaluated. Results showed that post-oxidized during 15 minutes samples have the best corrosion performance. After 21 h of exposition to 3. 5 % NaCl fog, the presence of red rust on post-oxidized during 15 minutes samples was reduced to around 1 / 16 part of the only nitrided sample. According with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis, the increase in the corrosion resistance of post-oxidized samples is related to the occurrence of an oxidized thin layer constituted mainly by magnetite kind iron oxide...|$|E
40|$|In-cylinder flow in {{diesel engines}} {{has a large}} impact on {{combustion}} and emission formation. In this work, the flow is characterised with a new measurement method called combustion image velocimetry (CIV). This technique is used to explain how airflow introduced during induction affects soot emissions and interacts with injection pressures up to 2500 bar. The CIV measurements enable flow analysis during the combustion and <b>post-oxidation</b> phases. The flow velocities inside the cylinder of a heavy duty optical engine, was measured with a crank angle (CA) resolution of 0. 17 ° at injection pressures of 200 – 2500 bar and up to nearly full load (20 bar indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP)), were investigated with this method. The flow field results were combined with optical flame temperature and soot measurements, calculated according to Planck’s black body radiation theory. At the high injection pressures typical of today’s production standard engines and with rotational in-cylinder flow about the cylinder axis, large deviations from solid-body rotational flow were observed during combustion and <b>post-oxidation.</b> The rotational flow, called swirl, was varied between swirl number (SN) 0. 4 and 6. 7. The deviation from solid-body rotational flow, which normally is an assumption made in swirling combustion systems, formed much higher angular rotational velocities of {{the air in the}} central region of the piston bowl than in the outer part of the bowl. This deviation {{has been shown to be}} a source for turbulent kinetic energy production, which has the possibility to influence soot burn-out during the <b>post-oxidation</b> period. The measured CIV data was compared to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations, and the two methods produced similar results for the flow behaviour. This thesis describes the CIV method, which is closely related to particle image velocimetry (PIV). It was found in this work that the spatial plane in the cylinder evaluated with CIV corresponds to a mean depth of 3 mm from the piston bowl surface into the combustion chamber during combustion. During the <b>post-oxidation</b> phase of combustion, the measured spatial plane corresponds to a mean value of the total depth of the cylinder. The large bulk flow that contributes to the soot oxidation is thereby captured with the method and can successfully be analysed.

The ratio of the total deuterium to carbon products detected is lower by an order of magnitude than the D/C ratio of the film (0. 04 – 0. 07 to 0. 4), probably associated to the difficulties of measuring water in a vacuum system, and the relatively large quantity of background water found.
