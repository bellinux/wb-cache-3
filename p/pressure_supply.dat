25|$|The {{majority}} {{of problems with}} the valve system occur due to clogged valves. When a valve is clogged it is unable to open, close, or change position. An inoperable valve will prevent the system from modulating the valves and controlling <b>pressure</b> <b>supplied</b> to the brakes.|$|R

5000|$|Pressure {{regulation}} - {{a sleeve}} valve {{can be used}} to reduce pressure from a high <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> to a lower pressure distribution zone, or to discharge into a tank or reservoir as greatly reduced pressure to minimize damage to the tank.

50|$|In {{the case}} of the {{upstream}} check valve passing, the differential <b>pressure</b> (higher <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> compared with the lower chamber pressure) causes any flow to occur only in one direction.

5000|$|Operation {{begins when}} the controller/timer sends {{a signal to}} the pump to start the {{lubrication}} cycle. The pump begins pumping lubricant to build up pressure in the first (the <b>pressure)</b> <b>supply</b> line while simultaneously venting the second (vent) return line. Once the required pressure is reached, a predetermined amount of lubricant is dispensed by the metering devices to half of the lubrication points via feed lines.|$|E
5000|$|Redundant {{bladders}} may be inadvertently filled, {{either by}} unintended {{action of the}} diver, or by malfunction of the filling mechanism, and if the failure is not recognized and dealt with promptly, this {{may result in a}} runaway uncontrolled ascent, with associated risk of decompression sickness. There is a risk that the diver will not recognise which bladder is full and attempt to dump from the wrong one. The risk can be reduced by ensuring that the filling mechanisms are clearly distinguishable by both feel and position, and not connecting a low <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> hose to the reserve until needed, so it is impossible to add gas by accident.|$|E
5000|$|A basic duct {{leakage testing}} system {{includes}} three components: a calibrated fan, a register sealing system, and {{a device to}} measure fan flow and building <b>pressure.</b> <b>Supply</b> registers or return air grills are sealed using adhesive tapes, cardboard, or non-adhesive reusable seals. One register or return is left unsealed, and the calibrated fan is connected to it. Pressure is monitored {{in one of the}} branches of the ductwork while the calibrated fan delivers air into the system. As air is delivered into the ductwork, pressure builds and forces air out of all of the openings in the various ductwork connections or through the seams and joints of the furnace or air-conditioner. The tighter the ductwork system (e.g. fewer holes), the less air is needed from the fan to create a change in the ductwork pressure.|$|E

A simultaneous equation approach with a Almon lag structure is adopted. Two factors of <b>supply</b> <b>pressure,</b> i. e., full-employment capacity and inventory are specified, and positively-sloped export supply functions with these two shift factors are successfully estimated. While capacity is positively correlated with exports, the inventory is often negatively correlated. It is also shown that export <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> is much stronger in Japanâ€™s exports than in the U.

40|$|A hybrid bearing {{designed}} {{for use in a}} next generation turbo-pump is evaluated for the performance of initial lift-off, referred to as start-transient. The radial test rig features a high-speed spindle motor capable of 20, 000 rpm that drives a 718 Inconel rotor attached via a high-speed coupling. The drive end is supported by ceramic ball bearings, while the hybrid bearing supports the opposite end. A magnetic bearing delivers the applied loading along the mid-span of the rotor. Many parameters, including ramp rate [rpm/s] (drive torque), <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> at 15, 000 rpm, magnitude of the applied load, and load orientation, are varied to simulate different start-transient scenarios. The data are recorded in. dat files for future evaluation of transient predictions. Analysis of the data includes an evaluation of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic liftoff, an assessment of rub from passing through a lightly damped critical speed, and observation of pneumatic hammer instability. Hydrodynamic lift-off occurs when the hydrodynamic pressure, resulting from the relative motion of two surfaces, overcomes the forces acting on the rotor; no indication of hydrodynamic lift-off is provided. Hydrostatic lift-off results from the external <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> (which for this test rig is speed dependent) overcoming the forces acting on the rotor as determined from rotor centerline plots. With 0. 263 bar applied unit load in the vertical direction, hydrostatic lift-off occurs at 0 rpm and 2. 08 bar <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> With a much higher load of 1. 53 bar, hydrostatic lift-off is at 12, 337 rpm and 10. 7 bar <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> The required <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> for hydrostatic lift-off is approximately a linear function of the applied unit load. In a turbopump, hydrostatic lift-off depends on the speed because the <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> is proportional to the speed squared. With the load in the horizontal direction, hydrostatic lift-off occurs at lower speeds and pressures. The ramp rate did not affect the required <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> for hydrostatic lift-off. A lower <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> at 15, 000 rpm lowered the required <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> for hydrostatic liftoff as well as the natural frequencies creating a rub. The hydrostatic lift-off speed should be minimized to avoid damage to the rotor/bearing surfaces due to contact...|$|R
50|$|For {{increasing}} or decreasing overall lift, {{the angle}} of attack for all blades is collectively altered by equal amounts {{at the same time}} resulting in ascents, descents.The Fancraft technology on the AirMule employs a Vane Control System (VCS)(US Patents #6,464,166 and 6,817,570) consisting of 200 vanes at the inlet and outlet ducts that can be deflected simultaneously (top and bottom) or differentially to generate side force or a rolling movement. Front and rear ducts are deflected differentially for yaw. The VCS generates six degrees of freedom independent of one another. The VCS is powered by a dual redundant hydraulic system which will allow for uninterrupted rotor pitch control {{in the event of a}} failure to one of the <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> lines. The VCS is engaged in excess of 100 per second. The early VCS was generating more than 2.0 radians/secÂ² of roll acceleration for roll and yaw control. It was planned to double roll acceleration with planned improvements, enabling precise hovering in gusty wind conditions with wind speeds of up to 50 kn (92.5 km/h).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to define the {{relationship}} between the fuel physical properties and the atomization characteristic of biodiesel. The spray atomization behavior was analyzed through spray parameters such as the spray tip penetration, cone angle and droplet size. Besides that, the specific heat capacity, viscosity, specific heat profile and liquid property profile is determined to define the characteristic of palm oil and also to prepare the database of palm oil. These parameters were obtained from an injector tester system and accurate prediction of spray atomization. In addition, the experimental results of biodiesel were compared with the diesel and cooking oil. It was revealed that the increase of the <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> (from 100 bar to 400 bar) little affects the spray liquid tip penetration. The increase of the <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> also increases the complete combustion.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} in a vane pump-pipe line system to obtain performance of vane pumps and to investigate {{the effects of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>supplying</b> devices on performance of vane pumps. ã€€The dimensionless expressions of specific speed, rotary speed, circumferential velocity of a rotor, discharge, rotation frequency, delivery and suction heads, and delivery and suction powers are introduced. ã€€Performance of vane pumps is expressed by the dimensionless parameters. It is possible to make use of predetermination of performance of a new pump. ã€€Several <b>pressure</b> <b>supplying</b> devices are jointed in a suction line to examine their effects on improvement of performance of vane pumps. ã€€In order to smooth the pressure variation from suctiOn port to delivery one along the casing, the delivery pressure of a booster should be effectively increased rather than its discharge. As the product of delivery pressure and discharge works for the pressure variation in the casing, the booster is more available when it has an additional tank. The expansion line close to the suction port of a pump works as same as the booster, and its work becomes more effective as its vertical height increased. ã€€The vane pump without vane pins will be safely operated by effective control of back pressure to the grooves for the vanes...|$|R

However, there are a few main problems with pressurised aerosol spray, which are the production of VOC and the quality of spraying process. Therefore, in this study the development of an internal nozzle has been investigated to analyse the characterictics of spray by using CFD simulation. The analysis is focused on various <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> up to 9 bar, where the n-butane and water are applied as a liquid phases material. The simulation is done based on two types of selected nozzle design. The result shows that, the values of velocity, TKE and Reynolds Number for both liquid phases are increase when the <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> increased. It was observed that, when comparing the two type of nozzle design, it shown that the value of velocity and Reynolds number is relatively similar for both liquid phases, while the TKE value is more difference due to the material properties and nozzle design. Therefore, the use of water is acceptable as an alternative to substitute the n-butane liquid phase in producing an aerosol spray product...|$|E

40|$|This report summarises {{the work}} of WP 4, {{a part of the}} METRO project. It investigates theperformance of various smoke control systems for use in {{underground}} stations having only one exit to ground level. Two different smoke control systems with two different configurations were investigated: A pressurizing (positive <b>pressure)</b> <b>supply</b> air system; a pressurizing supply air system with platform screen doors; a mechanical exhaust air system with extraction fittings above the track area; and a mechanical exhaust air system with platform screen doors. Simulations were performed using Fire Dynamics Simulator, investigating two different heat release rates â€“ 20 MW and 60 MW. The results show that both the pressurizing supply air system and the mechanical exhaust air system provide effective smoke control. The advantages of a positive <b>pressure</b> <b>supply</b> air system are a relatively simple installation and a lower requisite flow capacity of the fans. The disadvantage is that the smoke is not dispelled, but can be spread to other platforms of the station and even to the next station. The advantages of a mecha- nical exhaust system are that the hot smoke is removed, and that the spread of smoke is restricted to the platform directly exposed to the fire. Disadvantages include the needfor a duct system, which requires space, and considerably higher fan capacities. METRO-projekte...|$|E
