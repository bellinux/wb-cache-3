40|$|Exposure to low-dose {{irradiation}} causes transiently elevated {{expression of}} the long ncRNA PARTICLE (gene <b>PARTICLE,</b> promoter of <b>MAT</b> 2 A-antisense radiation-induced circulating lncRNA). PARTICLE affords both a cytosolic scaffold for the tumor suppressor methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT 2 A) and a nuclear genetic platform for transcriptional repression. In situ hybridization discloses that <b>PARTICLE</b> and <b>MAT</b> 2 A associate together following irradiation. Bromouridine tracing and presence in exosomes indicate intercellular transport, and this is supported by ex vivo data from radiotherapy-treated patients. Surface plasmon resonance indicates that PARTICLE forms a DNA-lncRNA triplex upstream of a MAT 2 A promoter CpG island. We show that <b>PARTICLE</b> represses <b>MAT</b> 2 A via methylation and demonstrate that the radiation-induced PARTICLE interacts with the transcription-repressive complex proteins G 9 a and SUZ 12 (subunit of PRC 2). The interplay of <b>PARTICLE</b> with <b>MAT</b> 2 A implicates this lncRNA in intercellular communication and as a recruitment platform for gene-silencing machineries through triplex formation in response to irradiation...|$|R

40|$|A {{process is}} {{described}} for {{the manufacture of}} particle boards and medium-density wood building boards. In the process, wood chips or wood fibre impregnated with a binding agent are made into <b>particle</b> or fibre <b>mats</b> and are then pressed into boards at high temperature. The process {{is characterized by the}} fact that, during the forming process, at least one surface of the <b>particle</b> or fibre <b>mat</b> is provided with a layer consisting of wood chips or wood fibres containing a binding agent which is not thermally curable, and the <b>particle</b> or fibre <b>mats</b> formed in this way are then pressed...|$|R
30|$|In the {{previous}} study [6], the ordinary hot press could not manufacture 10 -mm-thick boards {{with a metal}} frame placed on <b>particle</b> <b>mats</b> because the boards blew out. Conversely, the air-injection press successfully manufactured 10 -mm-thick boards even when the metal frame was used. In this study, 20 -mm boards were manufactured by following the methods in {{the previous}} study [6]. The 20 -mm boards blew out when they were hot pressed using metal frames and no air was injected. In contrast, air injection facilitated the manufacture of 20 -mm boards, even when the metal frames were used, showing that air injection was also effective in preventing blowout of 20 -mm boards.|$|R
30|$|To {{manufacture}} the particleboard, resin {{was applied}} at 9  % based on particle weight in a rotating drum blender {{fitted with a}} pneumatic spray gun. The mat MC before pressing varied from 6 to 28  %. <b>Particle</b> <b>mats</b> were created by hand-forming without orientation. The dimensions of the particleboard were 320  ×  340  ×  10  mm, and the target density of the pressed board was 0.76  g/cm 3. The mats were hot pressed with an initial pressure of 3  MPa until the core temperature reached the platen temperature. To {{examine the effect of}} mat MC and furnish type, HS and RW boards were manufactured with PF resin at a press temperature of 180  °C. To evaluate the effect of press temperature, HS boards were fabricated with three types of resin and mat MC in the range of 12 – 14  %. Press temperatures of 160, 180, 200, and 220  °C were applied.|$|R

The mat moisture content before pressing was controlled to be approximately 12  %. <b>Particle</b> <b>mats</b> were created manually without orientation. Seven board types and three mixed boards were manufactured for experimental PB with three replications. The dimensions of PB were 320  ×  340  ×  10  mm. The target density of pressed board was 0.72  g/cm³. The mat was hot pressed for 5  min at a press temperature of 180  °C and an initial pressure of 3  MPa. After pressing, {{the edges of the}} pressed panels were trimmed to the final size of 280  ×  280  mm and then the actual board density was measured. The actual board density ranged from 0.69 to 0.72  g/cm³.|$|R
30|$|Mat {{consolidation}} {{behavior was}} investigated at various press closing times (PCTs) using hinoki (Japanese cypress) <b>particle</b> <b>mats.</b> The {{temperature in the}} core layer of the mat, press pressure, and platen distance were measured. At the plateau stage during hot pressing, the core temperature decreased with increasing PCT. The core temperature did not increase before the platen distance equaled the target board thickness in the PCT range of 4 – 50 s and rose slightly when the PCT exceeded 100 s. There was a linear relation between the logarithm of PCT and the maximum press pressure. The density profile across board thickness was strongly affected by the PCT. As the PCT increased, {{the position of the}} peak density (PD) moved toward the core layer as the PD itself decreased. The effect of PCT on the linear expansion (LE) of the board is discussed in relation to the density profile. There was no difference in LE after high relative humidity treatment in the PCT range 4 – 50 s. LE appeared {{to be related to the}} low density and the precured region of the board surface. The LE after drying treatment was around − 0.1 %, and the thickness swelling after high relative humidity and drying treatments increased with increasing PCT.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide a set of {{reference}} photographs {{to be used in}} identification studies, electron micrographs, at relatively high magnification (40, 000 to 132 ~ 000 diameters), together with some electron diffraction patterns, have been obtained of a group of (a) kaolinites, (b) halloysites, and (c) South Texas outcrop soil samples. Some o{ the kaolinites consist of well-formed hexagonal crystal plates with edges still sharp at a magnification of 132, 000 diameters. Other kaolinites consist of irregular, rela-tively thin crystal sheets, which may be bent or folded. In one instance it has been possible to demonstrate hat the average thickness of the sheets is only 10 A. At high magnification the halloysite clay minerals exhibit a structure consisting of rolled sheets, rather than hollow rods. In some cases, it is evident hat several separate crystal sheets are coaxially rolled to form multiple concentric hollow tubes. In the South Texas outcrop samples, the morphology is very complex, as the samples do not consist of one uniform type of <b>particle.</b> <b>Matted</b> sheets composed of interlaced bundles of lath-like particles have been observed. These oriented particles exhibit ypical "fiber" type electron diffraction patterns. Kikuchi lines were observed in a thin quartz crystal plate, examined for comparative purposes...|$|R

30|$|This {{study focused}} on the heat {{transfer}} involved in hot pressing. The temperature behaviour inside the mat of wood-based panels according to the manufacturing conditions—such as mat moisture level, furnish material, and press temperature—was characterised. Hinoki strands and ring-flaker recycled wood particles were used for experimental panel production. Temperature behaviour was measured at the surface and {{the centre of the}} mat. The results indicate that the manufacturing condition affected the temperature behaviour of the mat during hot pressing. Plateau time increased with increasing mat moisture content and utilisation of hinoki strands but decreased with increasing press temperature. Use of hinoki strands resulted in a higher plateau temperature than did recycled wood <b>particles.</b> The higher <b>mat</b> moisture content and press temperature resulted in a higher plateau temperature. Furnish type also affected heat conductivity in the mat centre after the completion of the plateau.|$|R

Here we describe, from the fine-grained, tidally influenced shale facies of the Palaeoproterozoic Chaibasa Formation (2. 1 – 1. 6 Ga), a fine, originally {{more or less}} horizontal, wavy to strongly undulating (later locally deformed) lamination. Investigation of these laminae shows {{that they must be}} ascribed to the accumulation of fine <b>particles</b> on microbial <b>mats</b> that covered a sandy substrate. The structures must therefore be considered as stromatolites, features that are accepted as proof of the presence of micro-organisms, in this case most probably cyanobacteria. The interpretation of biogenic activity is supported by microscopic analysis.

30|$|Melanoma is {{the most}} {{aggressive}} type of skin cancer and has very high rates of mortality. An early stage melanoma can be surgically removed, with a survival rate of 99 %. This literature review intends to elucidate the possibilities to treat melanoma skin cancer using hybrid nanofibers developed by advanced electrospinning process. In this review we {{have shown that the}} enhanced permeability and retention is the basis for using nanotechnology, aiming topical drug delivery. The importance of the detection of skin cancer in the early stages is directly related to non-metastatic effects and survival rates of melanoma cells. Inhibitors of protein kinase are already available in the market for melanoma treatment and are approved by the FDA; these agents are cobimetinib, dabrafenib, ipilimumab, nivolumab, trametinib, and vemurafenib. We also report a case study involving two different approaches for targeting melanoma skin cancer therapy, namely, magnetic-based core–shell <b>particles</b> and electrospun <b>mats.</b>|$|R
40|$|A semiempirical {{model of}} the {{acoustic}} behavior of fibrously constructed bulk materials of Hersh and Walker (1979) is generalized {{to take into account}} the filtration or removal of <b>particles</b> by fibrous <b>mats</b> and heat conduction between the material fibers and the surrounding fluid. Equations governing the propagation and attenuation of sound waves in a fibrous material are derived on the basis of a solution of the Navier Stokes equation for momentum conservation and a one-dimensional model of heat transfer between the sound field and the fibers. A comparison of the two propagation constants and material impedance specified by the model and experimental measurements for Kevlar 29 indicates the accuracy of the model over a wide range of sound frequencies, material porosities and specimen thickness. It is also found that heat transfer effects are relatively unimportant, while the attenuation constants and material characteristic impedance are a function of fiber orientation relative to sound field propagation direction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Small {{diameter}} bamboo and bamboo processing residues {{were cut}} into particles; bamboo <b>particles</b> and bamboo <b>mat</b> were constructed into a composite mat; the composite mat was hot-pressed {{to form a}} composite board. A study {{was made of the}} hot-pressing process for bamboo <b>mat</b> bamboo <b>particle</b> composite boards, taking its hot-pressing time, hot-pressing temperature and glue consumption as the process variables. An analysis of the variance and regression of the test results shows that, among the three variables, glue consumption has the largest effect on every quality index of the product, hot-pressing time has less, and hot-pressing temperature has the least. Based on this, the optimal variables have been determined. Hot-pressing time is 70 s/mm, hot-pressing temperature is 170 °C, and glue consumption is 12 %. Prediction and verification of the variables show that these variables are reasonable and helpful in bettering product quality. Advantage of the presented technology was to make full use of character of bamboo <b>mat</b> and bamboo <b>particle,</b> and to raise the rate of bamboo utilization...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{arrangement}} of promoter elements was found upstream of the bacteriophage P 1 <b>particle</b> maturation gene (<b>mat).</b> A P 1 -specific late-promoter sequence with conserved elements located at positions − 22 and − 10 was {{expected from the}} function of the gene in phage morphogenesis. In addition to a late-promoter sequence, a − 35 element and an operator sequence for the major repressor protein, C 1, were found. The − 35 and − 10 elements constituted an active Escherichia coli ς 70 consensus promoter, which was converted into a P 1 -regulated early promoter by the superimposition of a C 1 operator. This combination of early- and late-promoter elements regulates and fine-tunes the expression of the particle maturation gene. During lysogenic growth the gene is turned off by P 1 immunity functions. Upon induction of lytic growth, the expression of mat starts simultaneously with the expression of other C 1 -regulated P 1 early functions. However, while most of the latter functions are downregulated during late stages of lytic growth the expression of mat continues throughout the entire lytic growth cycle of bacteriophage P 1. Thus, the maturation function has a head start on the structural components of the phage particle...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) /polymer composites and novel structured electrospun polymer materials. Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) {{is used as}} polymer matrix. Obtaining SWNT/PMMA composite with enhanced mechanical and electrical properties {{is one of the}} research goals. The first important step is to figure out a method for achieving uniform SWNT dispersion in PMMA. Eight different solvents were used to disperse SWNT in PMMA. It is found that the polar component of the solubility parameter (£_p) of the solvent affects SWNT dispersion in PMMA. SWNT dispersion in PMMA improves with increasing solvent Ôp value, and the most uniform dispersion is obtained in nitromethane, which is the most polar solvent employed in this study. SWNT/PMMA composite films at various SWNT concentrations were processed employing nitromethane as the solvent. Mechanical and electrical property enhancements are observed. Processing, structure, morphology, and properties of these composites are discussed. A comparison between reinforcement efficiency of SWNT, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNT), and vapor grown carbon nano fibers (VGCNF) in PMMA is also discussed. In order to electrospin SWNT/PMMA/nitromethane solution into composite nanofibers successfully, first PMMA was electrospun. With increasing solution concentration, morphology of the electrospun polymer changed from particles to fibers. At relatively low solution concentrations, micro- and nano-structured polymer particles, and at higher solution concentrations, porous and solid nanofibers are observed. SWNT/PMMA/nitromethane solution was electrospun into polymer shell-SWNT core nanofibers. Solvent characteristics play an important role on <b>particle</b> or fiber <b>mat</b> morphology. The qualitative relationship between solvent properties (evaporation rate, dielectric constant, surface tension, and viscosity) and particle morphologies is discussed. By tailoring solution properties and electrospinning conditions, one can produce particles or fibers with controlled morphology for specific applications. Ph. D.

40|$|Road dust {{is caused}} by wind entraining fine {{material}} from the roadway surface and {{the main source of}} Iowa road dust is attrition of carbonate rock used as aggregate. The mechanisms of dust suppression can be considered as two processes: increasing particle size of the surface fines by agglomeration and inhibiting degradation of the coarse material. Agglomeration may occur by capillary tension in the pore water, surfactants that increase bonding between clay particles, and cements that bind the mineral matter together. Hygroscopic dust suppressants such as calcium chloride have short durations of effectiveness because capillary tension is the primary agglomeration mechanism. Somewhat more permanent methods of agglomeration result from chemicals that cement smaller <b>particles</b> into a <b>mat</b> or larger <b>particles.</b> The cements include lignosulfonates, resins, and asphalt products. The duration of the cements depend on their solubility and the climate. The only dust palliative that decreases aggregate degradation is shredded shingles that act as cushions between aggregate particles. It is likely that synthetic polymers also provide some protection against coarse aggregate attrition. Calcium chloride and lignosulfonates are widely used in Iowa. Both palliatives have a useful duration of about 6 months. Calcium chloride is effective with surface soils of moderate fine content and plasticity whereas lignin works best with materials that have high fine content and high plasticity indices. Bentonite appears to be effective for up to two years and works well with surface materials having low fines and plasticity and works well with limestone aggregate. Selection of appropriate dust suppressants should be based on characterization of the road surface material. Estimation of dosage rates for potential palliatives can be based on data from this report, from technical reports, information from reliable vendors, or laboratory screening tests. The selection should include economic analysis of construction and maintenance costs. The effectiveness of the treatment should be evaluated by any of the field performance measuring techniques discussed in this report. Novel dust control agents that need research for potential application in Iowa include; acidulated soybean oil (soapstock), soybean oil, ground up asphalt shingles, and foamed asphalt. New laboratory evaluation protocols to screen additives for potential effectiveness and determine dosage are needed. A modification of ASTM D 560 to estimate the freeze-thaw and wet-dry durability of Portland cement stabilized soils would be a starting point for improved laboratory testing of dust palliatives...|$|R
