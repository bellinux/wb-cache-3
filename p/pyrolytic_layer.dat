40|$|The {{traditional}} ways of developing increasingly energetic materials usually {{lead to an}} increase in shock and impact sensitivities. It is, therefore, of practical and theoretical importance to design model, highly-energetic polycrystalline systems which will clearly indicate, at the molecular level, the interplay between the shock-induced reaction mechanisms and the associated excited lattice states.

40|$|High-temperature {{reactors}} {{make use}} of tri-structural coated fuel particles as basic fuel components. These TRISO particles consist of fissionable uranium dioxide fuel kernels, about 0. 5 mm in diameter, with each kernel individually encased in four distinct coating layers, starting with a porous carbon buffer, then an inner <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (IPyC) <b>layer,</b> followed by a layer of ceramic silicon carbide (SiC) and finally an outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> (OPyC). Collectively, the coating layers provide the primary barrier that prevents release of fission products generated during burn up in the UO 2 fuel kernel. It is crucial {{to understand how the}} fission products contained within the fuel interact with the coating layers and how they are distributed within the fuel. The first step commonly performed to obtain the information on distribution is removal of the coating layers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the possible use of wet chemical etching techniques with the aim of removing the coating layers of ZrO 2 coated fuel particles in a controlled way and to establish experimental parameters for controlled dissolution of irradiated fuel particles. Stepwise dissolution of coated fuel particle coating layers, containing zirconia kernels has been investigated by chemical etching experiments with acidic solutions of different mixtures. The heating methods used include heating by conventional methods, hot plates and a muffle furnace, a reflux-heating system and microwave-assisted digestion. The etching mixtures were prepared from a number of oxidizing acids and other dehydrating agents. The capability of each reagent to etch the layer completely and in a controlled manner was examined. On etching the first layer, the OPyC, the reflux heating method gave the best results in removing the layer, its advantage being that the reaction can be carried out at temperatures of about 130 ºC for a long time without the loss of the acid. The experimental results demonstrated that a mixture composed of equal amounts of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid mixed with chromium trioxide dissolves the OPyC layer completely. The most favourable experimental conditions for removal of OPyC from a single coated fuel particle were identified and found to depend on the etching solution composition and etching temperature. Light microscopy yielded first-hand information on the surface features of the samples. It allowed fast comparison of etched and untreated sample features. The outer surface of particles prior to chemical etching of the outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> appeared black in colour with an even surface compared to the etched surfaces which appeared to have an uneven metallic grey, shiny texture. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination of the chemically treated outer carbon layer samples gave information on the microstructure and it demonstrated that the outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> could be readily removed using a solution of HNO 3 /H 2 SO 4 /CrO 3, leaving the exposed SiC layer. Complete removal of the layer was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) analysis of the particle surface. For etching the second layer, the silicon carbide layer, microwave-assisted chemical etching was the only heating technique found to be useful. However, experimental results demonstrated that this method has limited ability to digest the sample completely. Also common chemical etchants were found to be ineffective for dissolving this layer. Only fluoride containing substances showed the potential to etch the layer. The results show that a mixture consisting of equal amounts of concentrated hydrofluoric and nitric acid under microwave heating at 200 ºC yielded partial removal of the coating and localized attack of the underlying coating layers. The SEM analyses at different intervals of etching showed: partial removal of the layer, attack of the underlying layers and, in some instances, that attack started at grain boundaries and progressed to the intra-granular features. The SEM results provide evidence that etching of the silicon carbide layer is strongly influenced by its microstructure. From these findings, it is concluded that etching of the silicon carbide under the investigated experimental conditions yields undesirable results and that it does not provide complete removal of the layer. This method has the potential to etch the layer to some extent but has limitations. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of the SiC layer {{in the presence of}} free nitrogen will be dependent upon the operating temperatures and resulting nitrogen pressures whether it is at High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) temperatures of 1000 - 1400 C (coolant design dependent) or LWR temperatures that range from 500 - 700 C. Although nitrogen released in fissioning will form fission product nitrides, there will remain an overpressure of nitrogen of some magnitude. The nitrogen can be speculated to transport through the inner <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> and contact the SiC layer. The SiC layer may be envisioned to fail due to resulting nitridation at the elevated temperatures. However, it is believed that these issues are particularly avoided in the LWR application. Lower temperatures will result in significantly lower nitrogen pressures. Lower temperatures will also substantially reduce nitrogen diffusion rates through the layers and nitriding kinetics. Kinetics calculations were performed using an expression for nitriding silicon. In order to further address these concerns, experiments were run with surrogate fuel particles under simulated operating conditions to determine the resulting phase formation at 700 and 1400 C...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) is a non-conventional machining technique {{which can be}} used to machine non-conductive ceramics. This technique removes materials from the workpiece by thermal energy exerted from series of electrical sparks. Using copper foil as assisting electrode (AE), machining of Al 2 O 3 is done successfully. In this investigation, experiments were performed to study the effect of gap voltage and pulse-on time on material removal rate (MRR) for EDM of Al 2 O 3. The results showed that the lowest and the highest values of gap voltage were 12 V and 14 V, respectively, with a fixed peak current of 1. 1 A and pulse-on time of 8 µs. Beyond these two voltage values, material cannot be removed due to insufficient <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> generation. Similarly, pulse-on time is varied from 6 µs to 8 µs when gap voltage is fixed at 14 V and peak current at 1. 1 A.

The related research of the carbon black powder which is the main byproduct generated in the coating process is important, because it relates to the impact of coating process on the surrounding environment and is also helpful to understand the deposit mechanism of PyC (<b>pyrolytic</b> carbon) <b>layer</b> coated on the fuel particle.

TRISO fuel {{is the key}} technology for High Temperature Reactors (HTRs) and the Generation IV Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) variant. TRISO offers unparalleled containment of fission products and is extremely robust during accident conditions. An understanding of the thermal performance and mechanical properties of TRISO fuel requires a detailed knowledge of pore sizes, their distribution and interconnectivity. Here 50 nm, nano-, and 1 μm resolution, micro-computed tomography (CT), {{have been used to}} quantify non-destructively porosity of a surrogate TRISO particle at the 0. 3 – 10 μm and 3 – 100 μm scales respectively. This indicates that pore distributions can reliably be measured down to a size approximately 3 times the pixel size which is consistent with the segmentation process. Direct comparison with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) sections indicates that destructive sectioning can introduce significant levels of coarse damage, especially in the <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layers.</b> Further comparative work is required to identify means of minimizing such damage for SEM studies. Finally since it is non-destructive, multi-scale time-lapse X-ray CT opens the possibility of intermittently tracking the degradation of TRISO structure under thermal cycles or radiation conditions in order to validate models of degradation such as kernel movement.

Many important phenomena leading to limitations of properties of composites may take place at the interface, depending on its structure and local stress field. Present study was carried out in order to obtain better understanding of the role of controllability of the properties of composites via fiber surface treatment and interface modification. Two surface modification methods have been developed and evaluated. These consisted of a chemical vapour deposition technique, used to build up a uniform carbonaceous layer of around 80 nm of pyrolytic carbon on the fiber surface and controlled growth of multiwall carbon nanotubes on fiber surface. The fiber surface modifications were achieved by exposing the fibers to suitable hydrocarbon environment at elevated temperatures. The surface modified fibers were used to fabricate composite specimens with either coal tar pitch or epoxy matrix. The surface modifications are expected to alter damage and microfracture mechanisms occurring at the interface in response to local stress field during loading. Shear properties being amongst the most sensitive to interface behaviour, short beam shear test and flexural tests were conducted on the composite samples made out of carbon fibers with and without surface treatments. A significant increase in the value of these parameters was observed in both the cases of surface modification. Composite specimens made out of PyC coated fibers showed an increase of 300 % in flexural strength and 360 % in shear strength while the composite specimens made out of CNT grown carbon fibers showed 74 % increase in flexural strength and 18 % increase in shear strength.

The Cp, which has a weak shear strength, is introduced to promote adequate debonding at the fiber/matrix interface. In a first step, classical CVD studies are conducted on planar carbon substrates with a parametric investigation {{of the effects of}} temperature, pressure, reactant flow rates on the growth rate and morphology of the coating. For Cp, obtained form thennal decomposition of ethylene, a very high activation energy (310 kJ/mol) and a decrease in coating growth rate with the reactant residence time indicate that the reaction limiting step occurs in the gaseous phase. The carbon coatings exhibit a macroscopic stratified morphology which could promote internal delamination. In a second step, deposition parameters have been optimized to ensure a good infiltration of 6000 filaments yarns. Finally, the influence of carbon underlayer on the mechanical properties of coated fibers is determined by tensile tests on monofilaments and interpreted in terms of Weibull distribution. The results on aluminium composites confirm the beneficial role of mechanical fuse played by the Cp coating. 1...|$|R

To accomplish these functions, they rely on unique interface-binding properties. Using atomic-detail implicit solvent rigid-body Brownian dynamics simulations, we studied the diffusion of HFBI, a class II hydrophobin from Trichoderma reesei, in aqueous solution in the presence and absence of a graphite surface. Results In the simulations, HFBI exists in solution as a mixture of monomers in equilibrium with different types of oligomers. The oligomerization state depends on the conformation of HFBI. When a Highly Ordered <b>Pyrolytic</b> Graphite (HOPG) <b>layer</b> is present in the simulated system, HFBI tends to interact with the HOPG layer through a hydrophobic patch on the protein. Conclusions From the simulations of HFBI solutions, we identify a tetrameric encounter complex stabilized by non-polar interactions between the aliphatic residues in the hydrophobic patch on HFBI. After the formation of the encounter complex, a local structural rearrangement at the protein interfaces is required to obtain the tetrameric arrangement seen in HFBI crystals. Simulations performed with the graphite surface show that, due to a combination of a geometric hindrance and the interaction of the aliphatic sidechains with the graphite layer, HFBI proteins tend to accumulate close to the hydrophobic surface. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConsidering {{the need}} to reduce waste {{production}} and greenhouse emissions by still keeping high energy efficiency, various 4 th generation nuclear energy systems have been proposed. As far as graphite moderated reactors are concerned, {{one of the key}} issues is the large volumes of irradiated graphite encountered (1770 m 3 for fuel elements and 840 m 3 for reflector elements during the lifetime (60 years) of a single reactor module [1]). With the objective to reduce volume of waste in the HTR concept, {{it is very important to}} be able to separate the fuel from low level activity graphite. This requires to separate TRISO particles from the graphite matrix with the sine qua non condition to not break TRISO particles in case of future embedding of particles in a matrix for disposal. According to National Regulatory Systems, in case of limited graphite waste production or of short duration HTR projects (e. g. in Germany), direct disposal without separation is acceptable. Nevertheless, in case of large scale deployment of HTR technology, such approach is not economical and sustainable. Previous attempts in graphite management (furnace, fluidised bed and laser incinerations and encapsulation matrices) dealt with graphite matrix only. These are the reasons why we studied the management of irradiated compact-type fuel element. We simulated the presence of fuel in the particles by using ZrO 2 kernels. Compacts with ZrO 2 TRISO particles were manufactured by AREVA NP. Two original methods have been studied. First, we tested high pressure jet to erode graphite and clean TRISO particles. Best erosion rate reached about 0. 18 kg/h for a single nose ending. Examination of treated graphite showed a mixture of undamaged TRISO particles, particles that have lost the outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> and ZrO 2 kernels. Secondly, we studied the thermal shock method by immerging successively graphite into liquid nitrogen and hot water to cause fracturing of the compact. This produced particles and graphite fragments with diameter ranging from several centimetres to less than 500 µm. This relatively simple and economic method may potentially be considered as a pre-treatment step and be coupled with other method(s) before reprocessing and recycling for example...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{fuel unit}} of the High Temperature Reactor (HTR) of the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a uranium dioxide kernel coated with a buffer <b>layer,</b> an inner <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (IPyC) <b>layer,</b> a silicon carbide (SiC) layer and an outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (OPyC) <b>layer</b> and is {{commonly}} referred to as a TRISO particle. Thousands of these micro-spheres are embedded in a graphite matrix and pressed to form a fuel sphere. During the manufacture of the TRISO particles and the fuel spheres there is a production of TRISO particles with cracked/broken layers, especially the SiC layer. Before the irradiation of the fresh fuel in the nuclear reactor it is of the utmost importance to quantify the failed fractions in fresh fuel as this information is very useful in the general understanding of fuel behaviour, calculation of risk and safety margins, and prediction of long term fuel behaviour. For this reason the burn-leach method has been applied for the quality control of the fresh fuel. In this work, several aspects of the burn-leach method that affect the efficiency of the method were studied. Aspects that were investigated are: qualitative aspects, layer properties, quantitative aspects, variants of the burn-leach method and lastly statistical information from the burn-leach data. The results obtained were as follows: Studies in this dissertation suggest that partial leaching of uranium in TRISO particles with a defective SiC layer was a phenomenon that exists. Although UO 2 kernel equivalents were successfully determined by burn-leach method for particles with fully broken SiC layers, certain particles leached uranium amounts that did not correspond to single UO 2 kernel equivalents; Evidence of occurrences of ‘slow leaching’ in an acidic medium were evident for certain particles. There were remnants of uranium dioxide kernels that had been partially leached after the full 16 hours. This behaviour led to inconclusive results on the absolute number of defective particles in a given population; Investigations suggest that there is at least circumstantial evidence that the BL method combined with X-ray tomography provides information about the integrity of the SiC layer, and why one particle leaches and the other does not. Neither the burn-leach nor the leach-burn-leach analysis is sufficient {{to be used as a}} stand-alone method to quantify the number of particles with defective SiC layers in a given TRISO particle population. The two tests need to be coupled to other techniques such as high resolution tomography for an extensive quantification of the layer defects; Burn-leach has to be designed to test for the layer integrity on a microscopic level as opposed to testing for the broken shells only, as was done by the normal burn-leach based on the German program. The leach time was not sufficient in its present form; Burn-leach results indicated that oxidation times of 96 hours at 750 °C under atmospheric pressure did not negatively affect the mechanical strength of the silicon carbide layer of freshly-manufactured TRISO particles, as these particles did not have a high failure fraction.

40|$|The Fluoride Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor (FHR) is {{a pebble}} bed nuclear reactor concept fueled by tristructural {{isotropic}} (TRISO) fuel particles embedded in graphite spheres and cooled by a liquid fluoride salt known as "flibe" (7 LiF-BeF 2). A system of models was developed which enabled {{analyses of the}} performance of a prototypical pebble bed FHR (PB-FHR) with respect to tritium production and transport, corrosion, TRISO fuel performance, and materials stability during both normal and beyond design-basis accident (BDBA) conditions. A model of TRITium Diffusion EvolutioN and Transport (TRIDENT) was developed and benchmarked with experimental data. TRIDENT integrates the effects of the chemical redox potential, tritium mass transfer, tritium diffusion through pipe walls, and selective Cr attack by tritium fluoride. Systems for capturing tritium from the coolant were proposed and simulated with TRIDENT. A large nickel permeation window reduced the tritium release rate from 2410 to 800 Ci/EFPD. A large gas stripping system reduced tritium release rates from 2410 to 439 Ci/EFPD. A packed bed of graphite located between the reactor core and the heat exchanger reduced peak tritium release rates from 2410 to 7. 5 Ci/EFPD. Increasing the Li- 7 enrichment in flibe from 99. 995 to 99. 999 wt% reduced both the tritium production rate and the necessary sizes of tritium capture systems by a factor of 4. An existing TRISO fuel performance model called TIMCOAT was modified for use with PBFHRs. Low failure rates are predicted for modern uranium oxycarbide (UCO) TRISO fuels in a PBFHR environment. Post-irradiation examinations of surrogate TRISO particles determined that the outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> is susceptible to cracking if flibe were to freeze around the particles. Chemical thermodynamics calculations demonstrated that common constituents of concrete will not be stable in the event they contact liquid flibe. The chemical stability of fission products in reference to the coolant redox potential was determined in the event the TRISO UCO kernel is exposed to flibe during a BDBA. Noble gases (Kr and Xe) will escape the coolant. Cesium, strontium, and iodine are retained in the salt. All other important radionuclides are retained in the kernel or within the coolant system. by John Dennis Stempien. Thesis: Ph.

Approximately 40 to 80 particles within each cross section were exposed near enough to mid-plane for optical microscopy of kernel, buffer, and coating behavior.

TRISOcoated particles for the first AGR experiment, AGR- 1, were produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in a two inch diameter coater. A requirement of the NGNP/AGR Program is to produce coated particles for later experiments in coaters more representative of industrial scale. Toward this end, tests have been performed by Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) in a six-inch diameter coater. These tests are expected to lead to successful fabrication of particles for the second AGR experiment, AGR- 2. While a thorough study of how coating parameters affect particle properties was not the goal of these tests, the test data obtained provides insight into process parameter/coated particle property relationships. Most relationships for the six-inch diameter coater followed trends found with the ORNL two-inch coater, in spite of differences in coater design and bed hydrodynamics. For example the key coating parameters affecting pyrocarbon anisotropy were coater temperature, coating gas fraction, total gas flow rate and kernel charge size. Anisotropy of the outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (OPyC) <b>layer</b> also strongly correlates with coater differential pressure. In {{an effort to reduce}} the total particle fabrication run time, silicon carbide (SiC) was deposited with methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) concentrations up to 3 mol %. Using only hydrogen as the fluidizing gas, the high concentration MTS tests resulted in particles with lower than desired SiC densities. However when hydrogen was partially replaced with argon, high SiC densities were achieved with the high MTS gas fraction...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{published}} research results suggest significant advantages of using nanocrystalline instead of coarse grained SiC for nuclear applications. In this work it was attempted to prepare nanocrystalline SiC coatings on TRISO surrogate kernels using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) process. As a plasma-based {{physical vapor deposition}} process, PLD allows the synthesis of dense and stoichiometric coatings in the amorphous or nanocrystalline phase. Two different types of TRISO surrogate kernels were used with outer diameters of 500 µm and 800 µm, respectively: plain Al 2 O 3 kernels and ZrO 2 kernels coated with TRISO-like buffer and <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (PyC) <b>layers.</b> In a second step, the PLD process {{was used for the}} preparation of multilayer coatings consisting of a Ag layer buried with a SiC layer. The samples were analyzed regarding their morphology, microstructure, crystalline phase and chemical composition using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser scanning microscopy (LSM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The samples will be used in future work for out-of-pile investigations of both thermal stability and Ag retention capability of nanocrystalline SiC layers. X-ray diffraction measurements did not confirm nanocrystallinity of the SiC coatings, but rather indicated that the coatings were mainly amorphous possibly with a little fraction of the nanocrystalline phase. Further analyses showed that some of the SiC coatings had an adequate stoichiometric composition and that Ag/SiC multilayer coatings were successfully produced by PLD. Coatings on TRISO-like buffer and PyC layers exhibited good adhesion to the substrate while coatings on Al 2 O 3 kernels were susceptible to delamination. The results suggest that PLD is generally suitable for SiC coating of TRISO particles. However, further optimization of the process parameters such as the coating temperature is needed to obtain fine-grained non-columnar SiC layers that are stable under the demanding TRISO operating conditions.

40|$|A TRISO-coated fuel thermo-mechanical {{performance}} {{study is}} performed for the hybrid LIFE engine {{to test the}} viability of TRISO particles to achieve ultra-high burnup of a weapons-grade Pu blanket. Our methodology includes full elastic anisotropy, time and temperature varying material properties for all TRISO layers, and a procedure to remap the elastic solutions {{in order to achieve}} fast fluences up to 30 x 10 {sup 25 } n {center_dot} m{sup - 2 } (E > 0. 18 MeV). In order to model fast fluences in the range of {approx} 7 {approx} 30 x 10 {sup 25 } n {center_dot} m{sup - 2 }, for which no data exist, careful scalings and extrapolations of the known TRISO material properties are carried out under a number of potential scenarios. A number of findings can be extracted from our study. First, failure of the internal <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (PyC) <b>layer</b> occurs within the first two months of operation. Then, the particles behave as BISO-coated particles, with the internal pressure being withstood directly by the SiC layer. Later, after 1. 6 years, the remaining PyC crumbles due to void swelling and the fuel particle becomes a single-SiC-layer particle. Unrestrained by the PyC layers, and at the temperatures and fluences in the LIFE engine, the SiC layer maintains reasonably-low tensile stresses until the end-of-life. Second, the PyC creep constant, K, has a striking influence on the fuel performance of TRISO-coated particles, whose stresses scale almost inversely proportional to K. Obtaining more reliable measurements, especially at higher fluences, is an imperative for the fidelity of our models. Finally, varying the geometry of the TRISO-coated fuel particles results in little differences in the scope of fuel performance. The mechanical integrity of 2 -cm graphite pebbles that act as fuel matrix has also been studied and it is concluded that they can reliable serve the entire LIFE burnup cycle without failure...|$|R
40|$|The high-density, {{isotropic}} <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon <b>layer</b> {{beneath the}} silicon carbide (IPyC) {{plays a key}} role in the irradiation performance of coated particle fuel. The IPyC layer protects the kernel from reactions with chlorine during deposition of the SiC layer, provides structural support for the SiC layer, and protects the SiC from fission products and carbon monoxide. The process conditions used by the Germans to deposit the IPyC coating produced a highly isotropic, but somewhat permeable IPyC coating. The permeability of the IPyC coating was acceptable for use with the dense German UO{sub 2 } kernels, but may not be suitable when coating UCO kernels. The UCO kernels are typically more porous and thus have a larger surface area than UO{sub 2 } kernels. The lower density and the higher surface area of UCO kernels could make them more susceptible to attack by HCl gas during the silicon carbide (SiC) coating process, which could result in heavy metal dispersion into the buffer and IPyC coatings and a higher level of as-manufactured SiC defects. The relationship between IPyC deposition conditions, permeability, and anisotropy must be understood and the appropriate combination of anisotropy and permeability for particle fuel containing UCO kernels selected. A reference set of processing conditions have been determined from review of historical information and results of earlier coating experiments employing 350 and 500 {micro}m UO{sub 2 } kernels. It was decided that a limited study would be conducted, in which only coating gas fraction (CGF) and temperature would be varied. Coatings would be deposited at different rates and with a range of microstructures. Thickness, density, porosity and anisotropy would be measured and permeability evaluated using a chlorine leach test. The results would be used to select the best IPyC coating conditions for use with the available natural enrichment uranium carbide/uranium oxide (NUCO) kernels. The response plots from the investigation of the deposition of pyrolytic carbon in a fluidized bed graphically depict the relationships between processing parameters and coating properties. The additional figures present optical, scanning electron microscopy, and other images to highlight microstructural details. For the study, only two parameters (factors), coating gas fraction and deposition temperature, were varied. The plots reveal obvious trends and links between factors and responses. The dominant relationships determined by this study for this range of coating conditions are: (1) rate is dependent upon coating gas fraction or in other terms, reactant concentration; (2) density is controlled by deposition temperature; (3) efficiency is influenced by both CGF and temperature; (4) anisotropy is affect by CGF and temperature, however, the relationship is more complex than for other properties; (5) permeability is dependent upon deposition temperature (thus density); and (6) open porosity is affect by CGF thus is influenced by coating rate. The response plots can be used as 'maps' for the deposition process and are thus valuable for selecting coating conditions necessary to produce desired combinations of properties. The information is useful in predicting the effects of changes to processing on properties and is beneficial in optimizing the process and product properties. Although the study was limited to only two parameters, the information provides a foundation from which other aspects of the coating process can be more easily investigated...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} work aims {{to characterize the}} SiC layer of various Tri-Structural Isotropic (TRISO) coated fuel particles. In {{the first part of}} the work, Raman spectroscopy is used to qualitatively characterize the SiC TRISO layer and to identify the presence of silicon from peak positions. Free silicon poses a significant threat to the integrity of the SiC layer because it melts at 1414 oC, significantly lower than the maximum operating temperature of 1550 oC. Crystalline silicon is characterized with qualitative Raman spectroscopy by a 520 cm- 1 peak. Silicon is found to be preferentially concentrated along the SiC layer close to the inner <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (IPyC) <b>layer.</b> Samples that were only mounted and polished are compared with those that have in addition also been etched. Disordering of the crystals and peak splitting necessitated the use of peak de-convolution. The 3 C, 6 H and 15 R polytypes of SiC were identified. The second part of the Raman spectroscopy work involves the development of calibration curves using peak areas from known binary mixtures (5 %, 25 %, 50 % and 75 % Si) to quantify the amount of silicon found relative to SiC. Initially the SiC polytypes used in these mixtures are 3 C, 4 H and 6 H. Reasonably good logarithmic calibration fits were obtained with R 2 values of 0. 996, 0. 966 and 0. 988 respectively. However some error accompanied the calibration values and an average of ten analyses yielded a more reliable average. The calibration curve results made it possible to estimate the silicon content throughout the SiC layer for each sample, when combining the results of the qualitative and quantitative Raman spectroscopic study. Samples PO 6 and PO 8 revealed high peaks of crystalline silicon. When peak areas were quantified and related to the 3 C calibration curve, as much as 60 % silicon was calculated for both samples. Etching was found to slightly lower the silicon to SiC ratio. The calibration accuracy for the binary mixtures was checked by plotting calculated values against weighed-off values, yielding 3 C, 4 H and 6 H straight-line fits with R 2 values of 0. 983, 0. 941 and 0. 981 respectively. These binary mixtures were analyzed with the SEM, which revealed variable particle size and segregation of silicon and SiC. Quantitative Raman spectroscopy is however known to be affected by a significant number of variables that are difficult to control. Attempts were made to decrease the scatter of the results from the calibration curve to yield more precise results. Two pure samples of silicon and SiC were studied separately, in attempts to better understand particle size and distortion effects. Distortion was found to have a greater impact on the scatter of peak area values than particle size. The scatter associated with pure sample peak areas casts doubt on the accuracy of the binary calibration curves. Rietveld analysis using X-ray powder diffraction is used to further support the Raman spectroscopy work by qualitatively and quantitatively characterizing the phases involved in each TRISO particle, to a greater degree of accuracy than the Raman spectroscopy. Refinement components include 2 H graphite, quartz, SiC (3 C, 6 H, 8 H and 15 R), silicon and tetragonal ZrO 2. Oxidized samples were compared with unoxidized samples. The outer <b>pyrolytic</b> carbon (OPyC) <b>layer</b> was oxidized (to improve the accuracy of quantitative measurements). Graphite percentages dominated the refinements with values ranging from 57 % to 90 % for unoxidized samples and 28 % to 83 % for oxidized samples. The 3 C SiC polytype is the most abundant polytype and constitutes 78 % to 83 % of the SiC (unoxidized samples) and 82 % to 90 % (oxidized samples). Trace percentages of silicon were detected for PO 6 (0. 4 %), PO 8 (0. 6 %) and PO 10 (0. 1 %) Quantitative XRD results are known to be accurate to around 1 % at the 3 ó level. Calibration curves were also subsequently constructed from the same samples as those used for quantitative Raman spectroscopy by comparing the weighed-off values to the measured ones. The 3 C, 4 H and 6 H R 2 -fits are 0. 991, 0. 978 and 0. 984 respectively. All the milled samples contained significant α-Fe which contaminated the samples from the grinding process. After dissolving the α-Fe in HCl a sample was tested to check the effect of the α-Fe specifically on microabsorption. Microabsorption was found to be an insignificant effect. The second part of the XRD work focused on the high-temperature stability of SiC up to 1400 oC. Al 2 O 3 was used as the standard and the instrument was calibrated using its two independent lattice parameter values along the a-axis and c-axis to make temperature corrections. Temperature corrected curves (of SiC and graphite) were constructed, which superimposed the theoretical Al 2 O 3 curve along the a-axis and c-axis. The linear thermal expansion coefficients of SiC and graphite could then be determined from corrected lattice parameter values. The thermal expansion coefficients of G 102 SiC had similar values to the literature values up to 800 oC. Thereafter the experimental values had significantly higher thermal expansivity when compared to literature values. PO 4 and PO 9 thermal expansion coefficient values were higher below 500 oC, but much closer as temperatures approached 1400 oC. There was little correlation between G 102, PO 4 and PO 9 graphite c-axis thermal expansion coefficient curves and literature values. The third section of the work involves the characterization of the SiC layers of three of the samples by transmission electron microscopy using their selected area electron diffraction patterns. This facilitates the unequivocal characterization of the SiC polytypes. The 3 C and 6 H polytypes were identified. There is substantial disorder in the crystals. Planar defects of differing periodicity are seen along the [111] direction of the 3 C polytype. CopyrightDissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.
