25|$|Alito joined {{fully in}} the {{majority}} as did Chief Justice Roberts.

Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ginsburg, Souter, Breyer, and Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.|$|E
25|$|In later {{abortion}} decisions, {{it became}} apparent that Kennedy thought Casey had narrowed Roe and allowed more restrictions.

Hence, O'Connor became the justice who defined the meaning of Casey in subsequent cases, while Kennedy was relegated to dissents in which he sought to explain what he thought Casey meant. For example, Kennedy dissented in the 2000 decision in Stenberg v. Carhart, which struck down laws criminalizing <b>partial-birth</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Kennedy has {{supported}} adding substance to the [...] "liberty" [...] interest {{protected by the}} Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which means he supports {{a constitutional right to}} abortion in principle, though he has voted to uphold several restrictions on that right, including laws to prohibit <b>partial-birth</b> <b>abortions.</b> He is [...] "tough on crime" [...] and opposes creating constitutional restrictions on the police, especially in Fourth Amendment cases involving searches for illegal drugs, although there are some exceptions, such as his concurrence in Ferguson v. City of Charleston. He also takes a very broad view of constitutional protection for speech under the First Amendment, invalidating a congressional law prohibiting [...] "virtual" [...] child pornography in the 2002 decision, Ashcroft v. ACLU.|$|R
5000|$|The {{group has}} also been {{involved}} in legislative and judicial actions to prevent late-term abortions. Between 1997 and 2000, AUL worked with state attorneys general across the U.S. on partial birth abortion legislation. The group supported the passage of legislation in Virginia, banning a late-term abortion procedure. In 2006, the organization supported legislation that was proposed in 21 states, which aimed to require that doctors who perform late-term abortions inform their patients that the fetus might feel pain during the procedure. AUL vice president Daniel McConchie stated that {{the aim of the}} proposals was [...] "humanizing the unborn". [...] In 2007, the organization was involved in a Supreme Court case in which it helped to uphold the 2003 federal ban on <b>partial-birth</b> <b>abortions.</b>|$|R
