500|$|Beauregard {{served as}} {{adjutant}} general for the Louisiana state militia, 1879–88. In 1888, {{he was elected}} as commissioner of public works in New Orleans. When John Bell Hood and his wife died in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence to get Hood's memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the cornerstone of Robert E. Lee's statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral procession, saying [...] "We have always been enemies. I cannot <b>pretend</b> <b>I</b> am sorry he is gone. I am no hypocrite." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band has}} {{completed}} seven national tours, played at countless venues including Minneapolis' notable First Avenue. [...] Smith described {{the experience of}} selling out the hometown venue: [...] "When I was in high school, I used to sit in my bathroom and sing with my guitar and <b>pretend</b> <b>I</b> was on the main stage of First Avenue...I was totally transported back to that moment as soon as I started playing and I got all giddy." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to <b>pretend</b> <b>I</b> wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E

2500|$|AXS writer Terrance Pryor {{considers}} What to Do When You Are Dead {{a concept}} album [...] "based around the main character's suicide and his {{journey through the}} afterlife". Some observers have noted the character going through the Kübler-Ross 5-stage model of grief management. Jorgensen {{grew up in a}} [...] "very scientific environment," [...] which caused him to be influenced by British writer Craig Hamilton-Parker. The album's title comes from a Hamilton-Parker book. Jorgensen explained that since he was [...] "already writing an album in that way, and when I saw that book, I thought, 'It would be really cool to make a whole album out of this." [...] Jorgensen later remarked that placing himself in that perspective helped him [...] "face a lot of things I probably would've been too much of a wuss to face, if I didn't <b>pretend</b> <b>I</b> wasn't alive". The band were initially hesitant working on a concept album until they were persuaded by Jorgensen.|$|E
2500|$|Jemison {{graduated}} from Chicago's Morgan Park High School in 1973 and entered Stanford University {{at the age}} of 16. [...] "I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me," [...] Jemison said. [...] "It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [...] go that far away from home." [...] Jemison {{graduated from}} Stanford in 1977, receiving a B.S. in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a B.A. in African and Afro-American Studies. At Stanford, she choreographed a musical and dance production called Out of the Shadows. She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the Black Students Union in college. Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States. [...] "Some professors would just <b>pretend</b> <b>I</b> wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'" [...] In an interview with the Des Moines Register in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her. [...] "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" [...] She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of the album, the band toured {{extensively}} in Europe, receiving a major covering by MTV. In July, Suede gave a benefit concert for Red Hot Organization at [...] "The Grand" [...] in London, inviting Siouxsie Sioux to perform a version of Lou Reed's [...] "Carolyne Says" [...] with Butler. Suede then prepared for an American tour in summer 1993. During the tours, tensions began to develop between Butler {{and the rest of the}} band. On the first American tour tensions peaked in Los Angeles, when Butler disappeared during a soundcheck. The gig went ahead, but for the rest of the tour the two parties barely spoke. The tensions grew worse on the second American tour mainly because Butler's father had died, which forced Suede to cancel the tour prematurely. Butler disliked the band's indulgence on the tour during his bereavement, in which he became so alienated from the band that he even travelled separately. Suede's American success was limited as they had already begun to be upstaged by their opening act, The Cranberries, who received the support from MTV that Suede lacked. At times, Butler left the stage while Suede were performing and persuaded a member of The Cranberries to fill in for him. Moreover, a lounge singer's lawsuit forced the band to stop using the trademarked American name [...] "Suede". For their subsequent releases and shows in the United States, the band used the name [...] "The London Suede". Anderson was not happy about having to change the band's name for the US market, saying, [...] "The London Suede is not the name I chose for the band, I didn't change it happily, and I'm not going to <b>pretend</b> <b>I</b> did." ...|$|E
