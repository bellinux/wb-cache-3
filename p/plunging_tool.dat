The concept: a disk of weld metal seized to and rotating with the bottom of the pin is squeezed out laterally by the plunge force and extruded upwards in a hollow cylinder around the tool. As the shear surface separating rotating disk from stationary weld metal engulfs fresh metal, the fresh metal is subjected to severe shear deformation, which results in its recrystallization.

In particular, CNC controllers can no longer restrain their tasks at the execution of inflexible orders and choices made at earlier stages of the numerical chain.

40|$|AbstractA new {{joining method}} using plastic flow has been developed. In this method, a tool with a {{shoulder}} and drill-shaped tip is used. This tip rotates and plunges into the workpieces until {{the shoulder of}} the tool touches the plate surface. The rotating tool drills a hole through the workpieces and deforms into a rivet shape, so the two plates are joined without preprocessing such as drilling a rivet hole. Therefore, this method is considered to have a decreased number of processes. However, it is difficult to drill a pilot hole with a tool made of metal that is easy to deform, such as aluminum alloy. Therefore, in this study, a pilot hole was drilled into the workpieces before using the tool. This method was used to make lap joints, and the joint strength of the joined aluminum alloy plates was investigated using a tensile shear test. In all cases, the <b>tool</b> <b>plunge</b> rate was kept constant at 1. 2 mm/min, and the tool rotational speed was set to 766 r/min.

This investigation analyzed the effect of process parameters on temperature distribution, microstructure evolution, and final mechanical properties of 6061 -T 651 SR-FS welds. A factorial experiment was carried out, in which three-process parameters were analyzed—rotational speed, travel speed, and <b>tool</b> <b>plunge</b> force— three levels were analyzed for each parameter, except for a <b>tool</b> <b>plunge</b> force where four levels were investigated. A total of 36 welds were fabricated with one replicate for each set of parameters. ^ The self-reacting friction stir welded joints revealed the same microstructural zones as conventional FSW; however, during SR-FSW a more symmetric microstructure between the crown and root of the weld was observed. The hardness of the weld was uniform through the thickness of the plate, apparently as a result of this microstructure symmetry. In contrast, during conventional FSW, the weld zone exhibits an inverted bell shape, with slightly higher hardness values on the root of the weld. During this investigation, the main microstrucural defects encountered were the lazy S defect and voids. Tensile properties such as yield strength, tensile strength and elongation were evaluated. High rotational speed was found to have a significant effect on defect formation and final mechanical properties. During tensile tests, failure occurred in the region that corresponds to the heat-affected zone for defect-free samples. The samples that exhibited the lowest ductility and tensile strength, exhibited severe internal voids and fracture occurred in the nugget region.

With the aim of developing a process model to optimise the diamond turning of silicon optics, a series of experimental trials were devised using two ultra-precision diamond turning machines. Single crystal silicon specimens (1 1 1) were repeatedly machined using diamond tools of the same specification until the onset of surface brittle fracture. Two cutting fluids were tested.

40|$|The many {{advantages}} of Friction Stir Welding {{have led to}} a relatively rapid acceptance in the often conservative welding community. Because the process is so different from traditional fusion welding, with which most investigators are most familiar, there remain many aspects of FSW {{for which there is no}} clear consensus. For example, the well known onion rings seen in transverse sections have been variously interpreted as grain size variations, variation in density of second phase particles and parts of the carousel of material rotating with the pin that have been shed from the carousel. Using Orientation Imaging Microscopy, Schneider has recently noted that the onion rings have a different orientation (and hence etch differently) than the surrounding material, and this orientation is consistent with slip plane orientations at the edge of the carousel. Likewise, the forces and torque exerted by the FSW tool on the work piece largely remain unaccounted for.

This paper will introduce a model based on a carousel or disk of material that rotates with the tool to estimate the torque and plunge force required to <b>plunge</b> a <b>tool</b> into the work piece.

Optimizing the process parameters for a defect free process is one of the challenging aspects of FSP to mark its commercial use. For the commercial aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 plate of 6 mm thickness, a bottom-up approach has been attempted to optimize major independent parameters of the process such as <b>plunge</b> depth, <b>tool</b> rotation speed and traverse speed. Tensile properties of the optimum friction stir processed sample were correlated with the microstructural characterization done using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD). Optimum parameters from the bottom-up approach have led to a defect free FSP having a maximum strength of 93 % the base material strength. Micro tensile testing of the samples taken from the center of processed zone has shown an increased strength of 1. 3 times the base material. Measured maximum longitudinal residual stress on the processed surface was only 30 MPa which was attributed to the solid state nature of FSP. Microstructural observation reveals significant grain refinement with less variation in the grain size across the thickness and a large amount of grain boundary precipitation compared to the base metal. The proposed experimental bottom-up approach can be applied as an effective method for optimizing parameters during FSP of aluminium alloys, which is otherwise difficult through analytical methods due to the complex interactions between work-piece, tool and process parameters. Precipitation mechanisms during FSP were responsible for the fine grained microstructure in the nugget zone that provided better mechanical properties than the base metal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Friction stir welding {{has been}} shown by {{previous}} investigators to have many advantages over traditional metal joining practices. Friction stir lap welds and friction stir spot welds {{have been shown to}} be stronger than rivets when joining materials of the same thickness. Substructures containing continuous lap welded joints have demonstrated increased load carrying capabilities over their riveted counterparts. In full-scale structures, however, continuous welds are not always an option. Welds may be interrupted by fixturing limitations, tooling restrictions, or stiffening members that cross the weld path. In these situations, a discontinuous lap weld would be necessary. The principal problem with a discontinuous weld is that the <b>tool</b> <b>plunge</b> and exit locations cannot be eliminated with a run-off tab, as in continuous welded structures.

40|$|Abstract Friction stir {{spot welding}} is the energy efficiency, {{environment}} friendly and relatively new low energy technology adopted from Friction stir welding (FSW) with many potential applications in joining light alloys in the automotive industry. In 2001, Friction stir spot welding (FSSW) {{was developed in}} the automotive industry to substitute resistance spot welding for aluminum sheets. FSSW process has some advantages such as ease of joining materials, low distortion, excellent mechanical properties, low power consumption, low cost and more economical than RSW. The strength of welds is critical when applying FSSW to load bearing components. This strength is affected mainly by process parameters and tool geometry. Tool geometry, such as shoulder diameter and shape, pin shape, length, diameter and feature is a key parameter to affect heat generation and material flow. The objective {{of this paper is to}} review open literature sources to assess the current state-of-the-art developments in Friction Stir Spot Welding, effect of various welding variables like tool rotation, transverse speed, dwell time, <b>tool</b> tilt, <b>plunge</b> depth and <b>tool</b> design on mechanical properties in the welding of aluminium alloys or various dissimilar alloys. However the Literature review indicates that there is need to identify the effect of different process parameters on Mechanical properties in FSSW...|$|R

The <b>plunging</b> of the <b>tool</b> into the material is done at different rotating speeds. A three-dimensional finite element (FE) model for thermomechanical simulation is developed. It is based on arbitrary Lagrangian– Eulerian formulation, and Johnson–Cook material law is used for modelling of material behaviour. From comparison of the numerical results for alloys 2024 T 3 and 2024 T 351, {{it can be seen}} that the former has more intensive heat generation from the plastic deformation, due to its higher strength. Friction heat generation is only slightly different for the two alloys. Therefore, temperatures in the working plate are higher in the alloy 2024 T 3 for the same parameters of the plunge stage. Equivalent plastic strain is higher for 2024 T 351 alloy, and the highest values are determined under the tool shoulder and around the tool pin. For the alloy 2024 T 3, equivalent plastic strain is the highest in the influence zone of the tool pin. Key words: friction stir welding, numerical simulation, temperature fields, hea...|$|R
40|$|Using microbeams {{from high}} {{brilliance}} third generation synchrotron X-ray sources and advanced X-ray optics, an emerging differential-aperture X-ray microscopy (DAXM) technique {{is used to}} investigate friction stir welded aluminum 6061. The process of friction stir welding uses a cylindrical tool piece with a projecting threaded nib. This tool piece is rotated and the nib is plunged into the joint line of the metal to be welded. As the tool piece is rotated, it also traverses {{the length of the}} joint line. With a constant downward force driving the <b>plunge</b> of the <b>tool</b> piece, the nib and the shoulder contact the work piece interface and surface creating frictional and deformational heat. The result is a solid state weld which involves the plastic flow of metal along the interface of the metals to be joined. ^ By employing polychromatic X-ray microbeams and a virtual pinhole camera method, called differential aperture microscopy, crystallographic orientation with submicron resolution in three-dimensions is attained. In an effort to characterize the local texture in the polycrystalline material, analysis of the [100] direction is performed with respect to the advancing direction of the friction stir welds. Emphasis is placed on the analysis of the Laue patterns and Laue spots from the diffraction experiments in an effort to characterize the local distortion at various points in the weld. Analysis is provided for the advancing and retreating sides of the welds. ...|$|R
40|$|Lockheed Martin Michoud Space Systems, under {{contract}} to NASA/MSFC, has developed and implemented a friction stir weld tool that uses {{the magnitude of the}} spindle axial load to control the weld process. This tool was used during the process development phase and the assembly of a full-scale External Tank barrel section. Both position and load transducers are incorporated into the welder. The control algorithm allows either the position or load transducer to provide the command variable in a closed loop system. Initially, the position transducer was used to actively control the weld process and the axial load on the spindle was monitored and collected via data acquisition hardware. As part of the process development, the axial load was implemented as the command variable in the closed loop. The spindle position is monitored and used to set limits on spindle travel. A zero set point algorithm has also been developed for establishing the spindle position {{at the start of the}} weld process. In its current state, the welder operates in a dual mode in which the position control is used to <b>plunge</b> the pin <b>tool</b> to a specified depth at the initiation of the weld. The load control is then used to control the weld process. This control algorithm has been used to assemble a 27. 5 -ft diameter, 2195 -T 8 barrel using hardware designed for NASA's Space Transportation System External Tank...|$|R
