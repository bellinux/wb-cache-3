5000|$|On 1 May 1873, Hugo {{switched}} {{production on}} one of the furnaces to decorated hollow glass as the demand for glass jewellery was declining while the demand for decorated glass was increasing internationally. Josef had never decorated his glassware in his factories himself before, choosing to concentrate on the base products, including hollow glass, which he would send to be decorated elsewhere - or simply let his customers do it. From that moment on, in 1873, Riedel began to produce luxury glass items. This initial move into glass decoration was not without difficulties but success came relatively quickly. In 1873 the Riedels participated in the World Exhibition in Vienna, where they won a gold medal for their wares, including the all-new hollow decorative glass. This was their first award at such a <b>prestigious</b> <b>and</b> internationally <b>famous</b> event. The new hollow glass was sold through Riedel’s own distributors abroad, directly to foreign partners in Germany, Great Britain and France and to domestic merchants from Böhmisch Leipa region and Vienna. Soon after 1873, Hugo installed a chemical lab and a two-pot experimental kiln in Polaun. It was here that new, coloured glass and other technological innovations were created. The Riedels had these patented. Hugo initiated the production of ruby glass coloured with Dukat Gold, added fine turbid and wound cones used to layer glass, invented Rozalin, came up with new processes to decorating glass with enamel and even designed some of the decorative glass. In 1876, the Polaun glassworks completely switched to coal in its kilns. [...] Wilhelm Riedel (1849-1929) ...|$|R

Since Velázquez was so much lighter than Gaona he requested a further condition before he would sign the contract: Octavio Gaona would have to put his hair on the line as well, creating the first match in Mexico where a two wrestlers [...] "bet" [...] either their hair or their mask. On July 14, 1940, Octavio Gaona defeated Murciélago Velázquez, forcing him to unmask after the match in what would become a Lucha Libre tradition. Since then Apuesta matches have become headliners all over Mexico; winning the mask of an opponent is seen as <b>prestigious,</b> <b>and</b> the more <b>famous</b> the masked man is, the bigger the victory. In 1942 Velázquez would get his revenge on Gaona when he defeated him to win the vacant Mexican National Middleweight Championship, although the victory could never equal the loss of the mask.|$|R
