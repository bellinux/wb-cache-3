The valuation premium in an NLP reserve is a premium such {{that the value of}} the reserve at time zero is equal to zero. The net level <b>premium</b> <b>reserve</b> is found by taking the expected value of the loss random variable defined above. They can be formulated prospectively or retrospectively. The amount of prospective reserves at a point in time is derived by subtracting the actuarial present value of future valuation premiums from the actuarial present value of the future insurance benefits. Retrospective reserving subtracts accumulated value of benefits from accumulated value of valuation premiums as of a point in time.

40|$|It {{is common}} actuarial {{practice}} to calculate <b>premiums</b> and <b>reserves</b> under {{a set of}} biometric assumptions that represent a worst-case scenario for the insurer. The new solvency regime of the European Union (Solvency II) also uses worst-case scenarios for the calculation of solvency capital requirements for life insurance business. Surprisingly, the actuarial literature so far offers no exact method {{for the construction of}} biometric scenarios that let <b>premiums</b> and <b>reserves</b> be always on the safe side with respect to a given confidence band for the biometric second-order basis. The present paper partly fills this gap by introducing a general method that allows one to construct such scenarios for homogenous portfolios of life insurance policies. The results are especially informative for life insurance policies with mixed character (e. g.  survival and occurrence character). Two examples are given that illustrate the new method, demonstrate its usefulness for the calculation of <b>premiums</b> and <b>reserves,</b> and show how the new approach could improve the calculation of biometric solvency reserves for Solvency II.

This paper aims at clarifying the one-year risk concept and describing simulation approaches, in particular for the one-year reserve risk. We also discuss the one-year premium risk and its relation to the <b>premium</b> <b>reserve.</b> Finally, we initiate a discussion on the role of risk margins and discounting for the reserve and premium risk, with focus on the Cost-of-Capital method.

40|$|In life insurance, actuaries have {{traditionally}} calculated <b>premiums</b> and <b>reserves</b> using a deterministic mortality intensity, {{which is a}} function of the age of the insured only. Over the course of the 20 th century, the population of the industrialized world underwent a major mortality transition, with a dramatic decline in mortality rates. The mortality decline has been dominated by two major trends: a reduction in mortality due to infectious diseases affecting mainly young ages, and a decrease in mortality at old ages. These mortality improvements have to be taken into account to price long-term life insurance products and to analyse the sustainability of social security systems. In this paper, we argue that pricing and reserving for pension and life insurance products requires dynamic (or prospective) lifetables. We briefly review classic and recent projection methods and adopt a Poisson log-bilinear approach to estimate Portuguese Prospective Lifetables. The advantages of using dynamic lifetables are twofold. Firstly, it provides more realistic <b>premiums</b> and <b>reserves,</b> and secondly, it quantifies the risk of the insurance companies associated with the underlying longevity risks. Finally, we discuss possible ways of transferring the systematic mortality risk to other parties. ...|$|R
