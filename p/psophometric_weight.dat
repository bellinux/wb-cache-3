5000|$|... dBrnC: dBrnC {{represents}} an audio level measurement, typically {{in a telephone}} circuit, relative to the circuit noise level, with the measurement of this level frequency-weighted by a standard C-message weighting filter. The C-message weighting filter was chiefly used in North America. The Psophometric filter is {{used for this purpose}} on international circuits. See <b>Psophometric</b> <b>weighting</b> to see a comparison of frequency response curves for the C-message <b>weighting</b> and <b>Psophometric</b> <b>weighting</b> filters.|$|R
25|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 <b>weighting</b> uses a <b>psophometric</b> <b>weighting</b> curve and a quasi-peak detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. <b>Psophometric</b> <b>weighting</b> is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.|$|R

50|$|<b>Psophometric</b> <b>{{weighting}}</b> {{refers to}} any weighting curve {{used in the}} measurement of noise. In the field of audio engineering it has a more specific meaning, referring to noise weightings used especially in measuring noise on telecommunications circuits. Key standards are ITU-T O.41 and C-message weighting as shown here.|$|R
50|$|Usually, noise means audible noise, in audio systems, {{broadcast}} {{systems or}} telephone circuits. In {{this case the}} weighting is {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>Psophometric</b> <b>weighting,</b> though this term is best avoided because, although strictly a general term, the word Psophometric is sometimes assumed to refer to a particular weighting used in telecommunications.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of telecommunications, {{weighting}} filters are widely used in the measurement of electrical noise on telephone circuits, and {{in the assessment of}} noise as perceived through the acoustic response of different types of instrument (handset). Other noise-weighting curves have existed, e.g. DIN standards. The term <b>psophometric</b> <b>weighting,</b> though referring in principle to any weighting curve intended for noise measurement, is often used to refer to a particular weighting curve, used in telephony for narrow-bandwidth voiceband speech circuits.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22 Hz to 22 kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special quasi-peak rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses RMS detection for no particular reason). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating tone-bursts of various durations. This ensures that measurements on impulsive noise take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This quasi-peak measurement is also called <b>psophometric</b> <b>weighting.</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction This {{specification}} provides {{basic requirements}} for psophometers {{to be used}} for the measurement of noise and other interfering signals on international telephone circuits and circuit sections. 2 General To accomplish the measurements as stated above, a psophometer should have the following significant characteristics: a) The relative sensitivity of the instrument, at various frequencies, should be as specified by the <b>psophometric</b> <b>weighting</b> characteristics. b) The reference point for the sensitivity of the instrument should be 0 dBm (one milliwatt) at 800 Hz. c) The r. m. s. (root mean square) value of the weighted noise signal should be detected and displayed. d) The dynamics of the detector and display device should meet requirements given in 3. e) The overall accuracy of the instrument when being used in its normal range and environmental conditions should be Â± |. 0 dB or better.
