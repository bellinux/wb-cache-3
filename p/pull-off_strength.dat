The modified test method was validated using two case studies (i. e., delaminated vs. non-delaminated pavements on I- 65 and intelligent compacted vs. non-intelligent compacted pavements on US- 52) and used for developing a correlation model for estimating a probability of delamination failure at a given <b>pull-off</b> bonding <b>strength.</b> In addition, methodologies for probabilistic interpretations with pull-off test results were explored. ^ The results demonstrated that the modified pull-off test showed its applicability in measurement of interface bonding condition with both weak and strong conditions.

40|$|In this work, the {{adhesion}} of biomimetic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pillar arrays with mushroom-shaped tips was studied on nano- and micro-rough {{surfaces and}} compared to unpatterned controls. The adhesion strength on nano-rough surfaces invariably decreased with increasing roughness, but pillar arrays retained higher adhesion strengths than unpatterned controls in all cases. The results were analyzed {{with a model}} {{that focuses on the}} effect on adhesion of depressions in a rough surface. The model fits the data very well, suggesting that the <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> for patterned PDMS is controlled by the deepest dimple-like feature on the rough surface. The lower <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> for unpatterned PDMS may be explained by the initiation of the pull-off process {{at the edge of the}} probe, where significant stress concentrates. With micro-rough surfaces, pillar arrays showed maximum adhesion with a certain intermediate roughness, while unpatterned controls did not show any measurable adhesion.

40|$|PS 304, a plasma spray {{deposited}} {{solid lubricant}} coating developed for high temperature sliding contacts was deposited on nine different substrate metals, heat treated at 650 C in either air or argon and subsequently tested for strength using a commercially available pull-off adhesion test. Some samples were examined metallographically to help elucidate {{and explain the}} results. As deposited coatings exhibit <b>pull-off</b> <b>strengths</b> typically between 16 and 20 MPa with failure occuring (cohesively) within the coating. Heat treatment in argon at 650 C results in {{a slight increase in}} coating (cohesive) strength of about 30 percent to 21 to 27 MPa. Heat treatment in air at 650 C results in a dramatic increase in strength to over 30 MPa, exceeding the strength of the epoxy used in the pull test. Cross section metallographic analyses show that no microstructural coating changes occur following the argon heat treatments, however, exposure to air at 650 C gives rise to the formation of a second chromium-rich phase precipitate within the PS 304 NiCr constituent which provides a strengthening effect and a slight (approximately 5 percent) coating thickness increase. Subsequent heat treatments do not result in any further coating changes.

The microscopic adhesion measurements using the AFM provided an opportunity to juxtapose these results with values predicted by wellestablished thermodynamic theory. Good correlation was found when probing lowenergy interactions. Interactions measured on high-energy surfaces were lower than theory predicts, however, these results are consistent with other AFM results. Several limitations of the AFM as a microscopic adhesion tester were elucidated - in particular the necessity for the accurate evaluation of the tip radius and cantilever spring constant. Scan rate an applied load also appeared to play a minor role in the measured adhesion -low loads and low scan rates appearing to produce more accurate data. Macroscopic adhesion tests performed on polyester and fluorocarbon paint coated sheet steel, found the white polyester in question to be significantly poorer than all other paint combinations evaluated in terms of <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength,</b> and environmental durability, irrespective of ageing environment.

The design of these gecko-inspired structures were aimed to maximize the ratio between <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> and peel strength. They were fabricated using the laser cutting technology which is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications. Several kinds of PDMS specimens in triangular, square and hexagonal patterns, as well as triangular, square, diamond and circular cross-sections were made. The wetting properties of the gecko-inspired surfaces were evaluated by contact angle measurements. <b>Pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> and peel strength measurements were performed against a silicon skin substitute. Multiple attachments were achieved {{on a range of}} preloads. The averaged <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> under a preload 10  N for 10  s can reach up to approximately five times of peel strength when the peel angle is 30 degree. Also compared with conventional Band-Aids, a slight enhancement in attachment ability and a significant decrease in peel strength between the skin and the adhesives were consistently observed. Therefore, the fabrication of the gecko-inspired structures on the micro-molding of PDMS appeared to offer a near-practical way for manufacturing an easy-removal skin adhesives, albeit in its present form with a comparable adhesion strength and a decreased peel strength. The originality of this work is the reverse de-molding approach based on the combination of the cost- and time-efficient laser cutting methods and the Teflon film as the mold material, which avoid the limitation caused by taking PDMS structure out of the molds, so that provide more variations of the tip geometry. As such, a further development of this fabrication method might be of significant interest in a number of practical applications in skin tissue industrial design...|$|E

The HPM development included three major steps. 1. Development of the mortar mixture proportion based on the optimal hydration of binder and particle packing of the mortar system. In this step of the study, all mortar materials were systematically proportioned, and the obtained mixtures were tested for flowability, rate of hydration, set time, and strength development. The optimal mixture proportion was then selected as the HPM, as it displayed good self-consolidating ability and achieved 1 -day compressive strengths greater than 6, 000 psi. 2. Investigation of the mechanical properties of the new HPM, including compressive and flexural strength, elastic modulus, and slant shear and <b>pull-off</b> <b>strengths</b> of patch-substrate bonds tested at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days. In this step, the properties of the HPM were evaluated in comparison with those of a commercial repair material: the rapid-set concrete (RSC). Two types of substrates representing old concrete were used for patching repair. One was made of a typical pavement mixture (C- 3 WR-C 20), and the other was a high-strength pavement concrete mixture (O- 4 WR). 3. Investigation of the durability properties of the newly developed HPM compared to those of the RSC. Durability properties included cyclic freeze-thaw (F-T) resistance, permeability, and shrinkage behavior. The results indicated that the newly developed HPM possesses excellent self-consolidating ability: highly flowable and non-segregating. Although there was delayed setting, the compressive strength of the HPM exceeded 6, 000 psi at 1 day, approximately 25 percent higher than that of the RSC. At 28 days, the HPM reached 10, 000 psi, while the RSC was about 7, 000 psi. The HPM also displayed extremely low chloride permeability (18 coulombs) compared to the RSC (2, 550 coulombs) and excellent F-T durability without the requirement for air entrainment. The F-T durability factor of HPM was kept around 100 % throughout the standard F-T test, while the F-T durability factor of RSC reduced to 80 % {{at the end of the}} F-T test.

Performance changes and fundamental material characteristics associated with moisture damage due to various anti-stripping additives in asphalt mixtures are studied through various experimental approaches and a numerical simulation. Three additives (i. e., one reference additive, hydrated lime, and two alternative additives: fly ash and cement) are investigated by adding them into two types of mixes (SP 2 for low-traffic-volume roadways and SP 5 for high-traffic-volume roadways) where two different asphalt binders (PG 64 - 22 for the SP 2 mix and PG 70 - 28 for the SP 5) are used. Two asphalt concrete mixture scale performance tests, the AASHTO T- 283 and the APA under water, and two local-scale mixture constituent tests, the boiling water test (ASTM D 3625) and the pull-off test, are conducted to characterize the effects of binderspecific anti-stripping additives on the binder-aggregate bonding potential in mixtures. The <b>pull-off</b> tensile <b>strength</b> tests are then numerically modeled through the finite element technique incorporated with the cohesive zone modeling approach to seek more fundamental scientific insights into the effect of each anti-stripping additive on the overall moisture damage resistance. Results from laboratory tests and numerical simulations indicate that the SP 5 mixtures, where high-quality aggregates and polymermodified binder are used, are fairly self-resistant to moisture damage without treating any anti-stripping additive and do not show any visible sensitivity among additives, whereas the effects of additives and their sensitivity are significant in the SP 2 mixes that use the unmodified binder PG 64 - 22 and low-quality aggregates.

Adhesive and cohesive damages are the two major types of damages occur inside the AC. Adhesive damage is a separation between aggregate and coated mastic or matrix materials and cohesive damage is the degradation of strength of matrix materials within the AC samples. In this study, Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling technique is used to identify initiation and progression of adhesive and cohesive damage. In addition, the effects of moisture in the mastic materials (i. e. mixture of fines passing no. 200 sieve and asphalt binder) are determined by laboratory investigations since mastic materials govern the mechanical properties of AC. The asphalt mastic-aggregate interface damage is quantified using FEM and traction separation law. Model parameters are determined from laboratory <b>pull-off</b> and <b>strength</b> testing of mastic materials. The contact stress is significantly higher in dry conditioned mastic-aggregate interface than in the wet conditioned interface for all load magnitudes and patterns. Lower contact stresses are {{one of the reasons for}} higher mastic-aggregate interface damage under wet condition. That is, Lower contact stresses are responsible for de-bonding at the interface. It is shown that 6. 8 % (% perimeter) interface de-bonding occurs in dry sample. On the other hand, about 49. 1 % interface de-bonding occurs in wet conditioned sample. Adhesive damage is significantly higher under the wet condition, since interface region is the weakest considering the whole domain. Cohesive damage is determined by maximum stress criteria, which indicates that a material is damaged when it reaches the maximum strength. Cohesive damage initiates at the top of matrix and then damage propagates towards the bottom of matrix and matrix-aggregate interface. Moisture causes 62. 8 % more damage in the matrix materials when considering only the matrix materials under the applied deformation region. In addition, pull-off test and shear tests are conducted on the mastic film under different Relative Humidity (RH%) conditions. Mastic films show flexible behavior due to high RH% conditioning and brittle behavior due to low RH% conditioning in pull-off tests. Increase in elasticity at high RH% conditioning causes a decrease in viscosity in mastic films. Decrease in viscosity of mastic materials causes binding inefficiency between aggregates due to lack of bonding forces. Damage causes due to binding inefficiency, which results in lack of bonding within asphalt binder and between asphalt binder and aggregates. To support this argument, nanoindentation tests are performed on the mastic materials. It is observed that, dry mastic follows linear Burgers and wet mastic follows Maxwell or modified Maxwell viscoelastic mechanical model. Wet mastic shows high viscous depth (i. e. low viscosity) compare to the dry mastic. In addition, Maxwell model does not show any retardation strain. Hence, it is proved that moisture takes away viscous effects from the AC and causes damage. National Science FoundationEngineeringDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

The systems included organic coatings and duplex (spray metal and organic system) coatings. Special exposure specimens were designed and manufactured and exposed to an offshore environment for three years in order to evaluate their protection performance. The adhesion in terms of <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> and fracture mode was measured on coatings in the underwater zone and in the intermediate zone. All samples met the requirements for offshore ageing in terms of adhesion. An adhesion-based “corrosion protection effect” (CE) is introduced and calculated for the coating systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the composite repair system is usually evaluated through semi-destructive test: pull-off test. But some difficulties can also be induced by the eccentricity of the load application, due to incorrect placement of the test device. The paper {{presents the results of}} a research project and the impact of incorrect design on tensile strength values. According to results of laboratory experiments and modelling, it can be observed that, if there is an influence of 2 o and 4 o angle of inclination on pull-off bond strength, it is however not statistically significant: the decrease of <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> is usually no larger than 8 % for 2 oPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} a concrete repair system is often evaluated through pull-off testing. For such in-situ quality control (QC) testing, the inherent risk of misalignment might affect the recorded value and eventually {{make a difference in}} the acceptance of the work. So far, the issue of eccentricity in pull-off testing has been ignored in field practice, because it is seen as an academic issue. This paper presents the results of a project intended to quantify the effect of misalignment on pull-off tensile strength evaluation and provide a basis for improving QC specifications if necessary. The test program consisted first in an analytical evaluation of the problem through 2 -D FEM simulations and, in a second phase, in laboratory experiments in which the test variables were the misalignment angle (0 °, 2 ° and 4 °) and the coring depth (15 mm [1. 18 in. ], 30 mm [2. 36 in. ]). It was found that calculations provide a conservative but realistic lower bound limit for evaluation the influence of misalignment upon pull-off test results: a 2 ° misalignment can be expect to yield a <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> reduction of 7 to 9 % respectively for 15 -mm [1. 18 -in. ] and 30 -mm [2. 36 -in. ] coring depths, and the corresponding decrease resulting from a 4 ° misalignment reach between 13 and 16 %; From a practical standpoint, the results generated in this study indicate that when specifying a <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> limit in the field, the value should be increased (probable order of magnitude: 15 %) to take into account the potential reduction due to testing misalignment.

30|$|A lot of {{research}} {{was conducted on the}} use of various biomaterials in orthopedic surgery. Our study investigated the effects of nanostructured calcium–phosphate coating on metallic implants introduced into the bone marrow canal. Stainless steel or titanium 2 -mm wires (groups 1 and 2, respectively), and hydroxyapatite-coated stainless steel or titanium wires of the same diameter (groups 3 and 4, respectively) were introduced into the tibial bone marrow canal of 20 dogs (each group =  5 dogs). Hydroxyapatite coating was deposited on the wires with the method of microarc oxidation. Light microscopy to study histological diaphyseal transverse sections, scanning electron microscopy to study the bone marrow area around the implant and an X-ray electron probe analyzer to study the content of calcium and phosphorus were used to investigate bioactivity and osteointegration after a four weeks period. Osteointegration was also assessed by measuring wires’ <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> with a sensor dynamometer. Bone formation was observed round the wires in the bone marrow canal in all the groups. Its intensity depended upon the features of wire surfaces and implant materials. Maximum percentage volume of trabecular bone was present in the bone marrow canals of group 4 dogs that corresponded to a mean of 27.1  ±  0.14 %, while it was only 6.7 % in group 1. The coating in groups 3 and 4 provided better bioactivity and osteointegration. Hydroxyapatite-coated titanium wires showed the highest degree of bone formation around them and greater <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength.</b> Nanostructured hydroxyapatite coating of metallic wires induces an expressed bone formation and provides osteointegration. Hydroxyapatite-coated wires could be used along with external fixation for bone repair enhancement in diaphyseal fractures, management of osteogenesis imperfecta and correction of bone deformities in phosphate diabetes.|$|E
40|$|One major {{characteristic}} of bonded structures is the highly localised nature of deformation near sharp corners, ply-terminations, and ends of joints where load transfer occurs. This paper presents {{an investigation of}} the use of a cohesive zone model in predicting the strong effects of stress concentration due to varying adherend thickness on the <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> measured by the Pneumatic Adhesion Tensile Testing Instrument. A comparison is made with the point-strain-at-a-distance criterion, where the plastic deformation of the adhesive is analysed using a modified Drucker-Prager/cap plasticity material model. The fracture properties of the cohesive zone model were determined using double-cantilever and end-notch flexural specimens, and the cohesive strengths were measured using tensile and lap shear tests. Comparisons with experimental results reveal that the cohesive zone model with perfectly plastic (or non-strain-softening) cohesive law provides accurate predictions of joint strengths...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of six test methods for composite materials intended for civil engineering infrastructure applications. These test methods have been transitioned from model test methods published by the American Concrete Institute to approved ASTM standard test methods {{under the jurisdiction of}} ASTM Committee D 30, Composite Materials. The test methods focus on two of the most widespread uses of composite materials in civil infrastructure applications: internal composite material reinforcements for concrete and externally bonded composites for repair of concrete and other structures. The methods establish standard material properties such as strength and modulus and also address application-specific information such as <b>pull-off</b> <b>strength</b> and {{the development of}} lap splices and goes on to describe the scope, application, and interferences for each of the test methods.
