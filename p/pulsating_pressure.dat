30|$|In the literature, an {{analytic}} {{solution of}} an electroosmotic flow in microchannels {{has been studied}} under a constant pressure gradient. Goswami and Chakraborty [10] investigated the semi-analytic solution of a steady electroosmotic flow with the interfacial slip condition in microchannels of various complex cross-sectional shapes under the constant pressure gradient assumption. Na et al. [18], Chinyoka and Makinde [19], and Reshad et al. [20] found the analytic solution of transient electroosmotic and pressure-driven flows with a constant pressure gradient through a microannulus, a slip microchannel, and rectangular microchannels, respectively. However, some microfluidic systems are driven by a pulsatile pressure gradient {{due to the nature}} of some systems such as blood flow or the integrated micropump of displacement type. Moreover, a report of Bandopadhyay and Chakraborty [21] on the investigation of electroosmotic flow in a slip microchannel shows that the overestimation result can be obtained under the avoidance of a <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient. As a result, a microfluidic investigation combined with a <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient is a key to keeping the problem suitable in many situations. Recently, the solution of combined <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient and electroosmotic flow was found by Chakraborty et al. [22], but the pressure gradient was simplified to just a sinusoidal function.|$|E

Such systems usually require the stabilization of <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressures</b> for desalination purposes. The key challenge is to convert a fluctuating pressure flow into a constant pressure flow. To address this task, stub-filters, accumulators, and radially elastic-pipes are considered for smoothing the pressure fluctuations in the flow.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of non-linear multi-objective optimization is conducted {{in order to}} define a set of process parameters (i. e. load paths) for defect-free tube hydroforming. A generalized forming severity indicator that combines both the conventional forming limit diagram (FLD) and the forming limit stress diagram (FLSD) was adopted to detect excessive thinning, necking/splitting and wrinkling in the numerical simulation of formed parts. In order to rapidly explore and capture the Pareto frontier for multiple objectives, two optimization strategies were developed: normal boundary intersection (NBI) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based {{on the concept of}} 2 ̆ 2 dominated solutions 2 ̆ 2. The NBI method produced a uniformly distributed set of solutions. For the MOGA method, a stochastic Kriging model was used as a surrogate model. Furthermore, the MOGA constraint-handling technique was improved, Kriging model updating was automated and a hybrid global-local search was implemented in order to rapidly explore the Pareto frontier. Both piece-wise linear and <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressure</b> paths were investigated for several case studies, including straight tube, pre-bent tube and industrial tube hydroforming. For straight tube hydroforming, the optimal load path was obtained using the NBI method and it showed a smaller corner radius compared to that predicted by the commercial program LS-OPT 4. 0. Moreover, the hybrid method coupling global search (MOGA) and local search (sequential quadratic programming: SQP) was applied for straight tube hydroforming, and the results showed a significant improvement in terms of the stress safety margin and reduced local thinning. For a commercial refrigerator door handle, the MOGA method was utilized to inversely analyze the loading path and the calculated path correlated well with the production path.

In this process, a small wrinkle occurs near the die corner in the former stage, and then the wrinkle is eliminated in the latter stage because the flat bulge appears in the former stage due to the oscillation of internal pressure. A hydroforming process of steel tubes with a box die was performed in both three dimensional finite element simulation and experiment. The filling of the die corner for the mean linear pressure was not sufficient due to large wrinkles appearing in the former stage, whereas bursting occurs for the peak linear pressure due to round bulging.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} wind-tunnel {{investigation has}} been conducted on a 20 -percent-thick single-wedge airfoil section. Steady-state forces and moments were determined from pressure measurements at Mach numbers from 0. 70 to about 1. 25. Additional information on the flows about the single wedge is provided by means of instantaneous pressure measurements at Mach numbers up to unity. Pressure distributions were also obtained on a symmetrical double-wedge or diamond-shaped profile which had the same leading-edge included angle as the single-wedge airfoil. A comparison of the data on the two profiles to provide information {{on the effects of}} the afterbody showed that with the exception of drag, the single-wedge profile proved to be aerodynamically superior to the diamond profile in all respects. The lift effectiveness of the single-wedge airfoil section far exceeded that of conventional thin airfoil sections over the speed range of the investigation. Pitching-moment irregularities, caused by negative loadings near the trailing edge, generally associated with conventional airfoils of equivalent thicknesses were not exhibited by the single-wedge profile. Moderately high <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressures</b> existing over the base of the single-wedge airfoil section were significantly reduced as the Mach number was increased beyond 0. 92 and the boundaries of the dead airspace {{at the base of the}} model converged to eliminate the vortex street in the wake.

The present tests were conducted with a double layer of mattress, placed one on top the other so that the interstices between adjacent blocks were symmetrically staggered.

Turbulence was induced into the flow stream to simulate the random pressure pulsations which have been measured in revetted areas in the Lower Mississippi River. Pressure measurements indicated that the pressures at the bottom surface of the lower layer of blocks and in the sand beneath them remained essentially constant and that the differential pressures across the double mattress essentially followed the <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressures</b> above the top layer.

40|$|Abstract — An {{adaptive}} Helmholtz resonator {{was designed}} and adapted to hydraulics. The resonator was controlled by open- and closed-loop controls so that 20 dB attenuation of the peak-to-peak value of the <b>pulsating</b> <b>pressure</b> was maintained. The closed-loop control was noted to be better, albeit it was slower because of its low pressure and temperature variation, which caused variation in the effective bulk modulus of the hydraulic system. Low-pressure hydraulics contains air, which affects the stiffness of the hydraulics, and temperature variation changes the viscosity of the oil. Thus, an open-loop control loses its efficiency if a condition such as temperature or the amount of air changes after calibration. The instability of the low-pressure hydraulic system reduced the operational frequency range of the Helmholtz resonator {{when compared with the}} results of an analytical model. Different dampers for hydraulics are presented. Then analytical models of a hydraulic pipe and a hydraulic pipe with a Helmholtz resonator are presented.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{statistical}} structure of temporal distribution of the turbulent pressure fluctuations {{at the bottom of}} the hydraulic jump, in order to define their influence on the stability of the linings in stilling basins. The researches into the statistical characteristic of the fluctuating pressure have been mainly limited to the study of the instantaneous spatial structure; recently, moving from these results, a design criterion for suitable floor slabs was presented. This criterion was made neglecting the inertia force in the instantaneous equilibrium of the forces acting on the slab. This assumption is corrected if the stability of the slab is assured by its weight only. In the case of slabs anchored with steel bars the inertial force must be considered in the instantaneous equilibrium of the slab since the force acting on the steel bars is proportional to the displacement of the slab. This force depends on the temporal distribution of the turbulent pressure also.

These materials can withstand <b>pulsating</b> physiological <b>pressures</b> and allow the culturing of smooth muscle cells under dynamic conditions. This should allow the constructs to be successfully implanted...|$|R
