40|$|Radiosondes {{provide the}} longest time series of {{meteorological}} measurements above the surface, but discontinuities from frequent instrument changes at all stations contaminate atmospheric climate trends. As sensors have become more sensitive and better protected from radiative errors over time, the erroneous trend is hypothesized {{to be in the}} direction of artificial cooling and drying (although individual discontinuities can differ). Metadata describing upper air stations, instru-ments, and dates of changes, is incomplete and sometimes inaccurate, Trends adjusted for instru-ment discontinuities are questioned because re-searchers make adjustments while many instru-ment transitions and their dates are not known. This study is part of a longer-term project to develop complete radiosonde metadata and instrument adjustments based on the completed <b>station</b> <b>instrument</b> histories (Schroeder 2009). The main finding from histories developed so far is that many <b>station</b> <b>instrument</b> histories are very complex, with dozens of transitions including many alterna-tions between 2 to 8 instrument types, and few long periods with the same instrument type. The complex station histories have implications for data adjustment methods. First, frequent alternations of instruments blur the discontinuity from a transition, sometimes for up to several years. Second, some adjustment methods are not designed to handle transitions less than about 2 years apart. Third, many of the instrument discon-tinuities are real but small and {{are not likely to be}} detected by automated discontinuity detection methods, but still have a noticeable cumulative effect on trends. Finally, the usual adjustment method, which equalizes the mean value of a variable for a specified averaging period before and after a discontinuity (so it can be called the "segment mean matching " method), inevitably removes a portion of the real trend, so when sta...|$|R

We present a simple model to explain the allocation of public spending across jurisdictions contingent on media activity. An incumbent seeking to maximize the probability of reelection will shift more money to jurisdictions where an extra dollar gains more votes because a larger share of the electorate is informed about his policy.

30|$|To gain a {{qualitative}} {{understanding of the}} various mechanisms, let us consider a generic description of micromechanical and nanomechanical resonators. Typically, the resonators are attached to relatively large supporting frames to facilitate handling and interconnection, and then packaged by mounting the supporting frame inside test <b>stations,</b> <b>instruments,</b> or customized packages. Illustrative examples include commercial silicon microcantilevers (1 to 10  μm thick and 0.1 to 0.5  mm long) used for atomic force microscopy (AFM), and silicon nitride nanomembranes (30 to 200  nm thick with lateral dimensions ranging from 10  μm to 1  mm) used in optomechanical systems [85, 86]. In both cases, the devices are attached to silicon frames with thickness {{of a few hundred}} microns and lateral dimensions of a few millimeters. The attachment can be monolithic (exemplified by bulk-micromachined silicon resonators) or engendered by the adhesion of thin films to the supporting frame in the case of surface-micromachined devices [16].|$|R
