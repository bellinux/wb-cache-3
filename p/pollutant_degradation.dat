5000|$|Anaerobic {{microbial}} mineralization of recalcitrant {{organic pollutants}} {{is of great}} environmental significance and involves intriguing novel biochemical reactions. In particular, hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds have long been doubted to be degradable {{in the absence of}} oxygen, but the isolation of hitherto unknown anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading and reductively dehalogenating bacteria during the last decades provided ultimate proof for these processes in nature. While such research involved mostly chlorinated compounds initially, recent studies have revealed reductive dehalogenation of bromine and iodine moieties in aromatic pesticides. [...] Other reactions, such as biologically induced abiotic reduction by soil minerals, has been shown to deactivate relatively persistent aniline-based herbicides far more rapidly than observed in aerobic environments. Many novel biochemical reactions were discovered enabling the respective metabolic pathways, but progress in the molecular understanding of these bacteria was rather slow, since genetic systems are not readily applicable for most of them. However, with the increasing application of genomics in the field of environmental microbiology, a new and promising perspective is now at hand to obtain molecular insights into these new metabolic properties. Several complete genome sequences were determined during the last few years from bacteria capable of anaerobic organic <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation.</b> The ~4.7 Mb genome of the facultative denitrifying Aromatoleum aromaticum strain EbN1 was the first to be determined for an anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader (using toluene or ethylbenzene as substrates). The genome sequence revealed about two dozen gene clusters (including several paralogs) coding for a complex catabolic network for anaerobic and aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. The genome sequence forms the basis for current detailed studies on regulation of pathways and enzyme structures. Further genomes of anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were recently completed for the iron-reducing species Geobacter metallireducens (accession nr. NC_007517) and the perchlorate-reducing Dechloromonas aromatica (accession nr. NC_007298), but these are not yet evaluated in formal publications. Complete genomes were also determined for bacteria capable of anaerobic degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons by halorespiration: the ~1.4 Mb genomes of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 and Dehalococcoides sp. strain CBDB1 and the ~5.7 Mb genome of Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51. Characteristic for all these bacteria is the presence of multiple paralogous genes for reductive dehalogenases, implicating a wider dehalogenating spectrum of the organisms than previously known. Moreover, genome sequences provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of reductive dehalogenation and differing strategies for niche adaptation.|$|E

Bacteria that are living on plant leaf surfaces, the so-called phyllosphere, are also capable of organic <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation.</b> However, their relative contribution and the factors that influence their degradative capacity are largely unknown.

Transition from current fossil fuels to green fuels and building of cleaner environment to lead sustainable life is at enormous task. Hydrogen gas {{is recognized as}} a clean fuel and may be a sustainable solution. Hydrogen can be directly used as clean fuel in fuel cells with no harmful by-products. Chemical hydrides with high hydrogen storage capacity in terms of gravimetric and volumetric efficiencies are the most promising candidates to supply pure hydrogen at room temperature. Among them, Ammonia Borane (NH 3 BH 3, AB) and Sodium borohydride (NaBH 4, SBH) have drawn {{a lot of interest}} as they are stable, non-flammable, and nontoxic. Large amount of pure hydrogen gas is released during the hydrolysis of these hydrides in presence of certain catalysts and the by-products are non-toxic, environmentally safe and can be recycled. Co based catalysts are considered as good candidates for catalyzed hydrolysis owing to their good catalytic activity, low cost and effortless synthesis. In favor of environmental concern, especially the air pollution (conversion of CO to CO 2) and water pollutions (organic pollutants) are vital problems and there is a serious need to mitigate these problems. Cobalt (Co) based materials are with high catalytic activity for hydrolysis, organic <b>pollutants</b> <b>degradation</b> and CO oxidation. So, a single Co based catalysts as powders and as immobilized coatings prepared by chemical reduction method and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) were studied for hydrogen production by hydrolysis of AB and SBH and thin film coatings Co 3 O 4 were studied for CO oxidation and organic <b>pollutants</b> <b>degradation.</b> On the basis of characterization results, the role of catalyst to enhance catalytic activity is discussed in hydrolysis, CO oxidation and <b>pollutants</b> <b>degradation</b> reactions.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this review}} we depict how fibers can be {{obtained}} by combining sol-gel and polymer chemistry with extrusion processes acting as an external shaping mode. Thanks to this Integrative Chemistry-based synthetic path, it was possible to organize nano-building blocks such as V 2 O 5 ribbons and ZnO nanorods on a greater length scale yielding highly anisotropic fibers. It has been demonstrated that when aligning a whole population of nano-building block objects along a single main axis, collective properties were obtained, thereby enhancing their sensing, mechanical or photonic properties. This method can be extended toward fiber morphogenesis by using isotropic nanoparticles such as TiO 2, and can be scaled-up toward the one-step generation of several hundred meter long fibers with both high surface to volume ratio and high surface roughness. Specifically, when addressing photocatalytic-based VOC <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation,</b> these TiO 2 fibers appear to be outstanding candidates regarding both <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation</b> and associated mineralization (production of water and carbon dioxide) ...|$|E
40|$|Methanotrophs {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} for in situ bioremediation due to their ubiquity {{and their ability to}} degrade halogenated hydrocarbons through the activity of methane monooxygenase (MMO). It has been speculated that cells expressing the soluble form of MMO (sMMO) are more efficient in cleaning up sites polluted with halogenated hydrocarbons due to its broader substrate range and relatively fast degradation rates compared cells expressing the other form of MMO, the particulate MMO (pMMO). To examine this issue, the biodegradation of mixtures of chlorinated solvents, i. e., trichloroethylene (TCE), trans-dichloroethylene (t-DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC), by Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b in the presence of methane using either form of MMO was investigated over longer time frames than those commonly used, i. e., days instead of hours. Growth of M. trichosporium OB 3 b along with <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation</b> were monitored and analyzed using a simple comparative model developed from the Ω model created for analysis of the competitive binding of oxygen and carbon dioxide by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. From these findings, it appears that at concentrations of VC, t-DCE, and TCE greater than 10 μM each, methanotrophs expressing pMMO have a competitive advantage over cells expressing sMMO due to higher growth rates. Despite such an apparent growth advantage, pMMO-expressing cells degraded less of these substrates at these concentrations than sMMO-expressing cells during active growth. If the concentrations were increased to 100 μM, however, not only did pMMO-expressing cells grow faster, they degraded more of these pollutants and did so in a shorter amount of time. These findings suggest that the relative rates of growth substrate and <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation</b> are important factors in determining which form of MMO should be considered for <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Improvement of the {{stability}} of functional microbial communities in wastewater treatment system is critical to accelerate pollutants detoxification in cold regions. Although biocathode communities could accelerate environmental <b>pollutants</b> <b>degradation,</b> how to acclimate the cold stress and to improve the catalytic stability of functional microbial communities are remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the structural and functional responses of antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) reducing biocathode communities to constant low temperature 10 degrees C (10 -biocathode) and temperature elevation from 10 degrees C to 25 degrees C (S 25 -biocathode). Our {{results indicated that the}} low temperature acclimation with electrical stimulation obviously enhanced the CAP nitro group reduction efficiency when comparing the aromatic amine product AMCl(2) formation efficiency with the 10 -biocathode and S 25 -biocathode under the opened and closed circuit conditions. The 10 -biocathode generated comparative AMCl maximum as the S 25 -biocathode but showed significant lower dehalogenation rate of AMCl(2) to AMCl. The continuous low temperature and temperature elevation both enriched core functional community in the 10 -biocathode and S 25 -biocathode, respectively. The 10 -biocathode functioning stability maintained mainly through selectively enriching cold-adapted functional species, coexisting metabolically similar nitroaromatics reducers and maintaining the relative abundance of key electrons transfer genes. This study provides new insights into biocathode functioning stability for accelerating environmental <b>pollutants</b> <b>degradation</b> in cold wastewater system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Organic {{pollutant}} degrading biofilms {{in natural}} ecosystems and water treatment systems are often exposed to other carbon sources {{in addition to}} the pollutant. The availability of auxilliary carbon sources can lead to surplus biomass growth, changes in biofilm structure and carbon catabolite repression (CCR) which together will affect <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation</b> rate and efficiency of the system. To understand the interplay between these processes, continuous biofilms of the 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) degrading Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 -RFP were grown in single- and dual-substrate conditions with 3, 4 -DCA and/or citrate and reciprocal effects on 3, 4 -DCA/citrate degradation, biofilm biomass and biofilm structure were examined. The main mechanism affecting 3, 4 -DCA degradation in biofilms in dual-substrate conditions was citrate-mediated CCR as reflected by a decrease in specific 3, 4 -DCA degrading activity. Growth on citrate partially compensated for the lowered specific 3, 4 -DCA degradation activity under dual substrate conditions but not to the extent expected from growth observed under single-substrate conditions with citrate. This was explained by higher residual 3, 4 -DCA concentrations in the presence of citrate that increased cell dispersal in the biofilms. Our results show hampered pollutant removal in biofilms due to a complex interplay of auxiliary organic C source utilization for growth affecting specific <b>pollutant</b> <b>degradation</b> rate and changes in cell physiology due to incomplete pollutant removal. status: publishe...|$|E

Mechanistic study revealed that the different photodecomposition behaviors of rhodamine B on laponite and montmorillonite were attributed to the oxidation by different reactive oxygen species, with laponite involving 				HO 2 /O 2 - while montmorillonite involving OH. It was also found that the degradation pathway of rhodamine B on laponite switched from N-deethylation to chromophore destruction when solution pH was changed from 7. 0 to 3. 0, which was attributed to a much higher fraction of 				HO 2 relative to 				O 2 - under pH 3. 0 than under pH 7. 0.
