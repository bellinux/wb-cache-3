5|$|The game {{is set in}} the Lylat system, using {{a similar}} map as Star Fox 64 to switch between each area. However, two planets, Zoness and Macbeth, did not appear in the game, unlike Star Fox 64. Command has the largest number of playable {{characters}} in any Star Fox game, with a total of fourteen, including Fox McCloud, Falco Lombardi, Krystal, Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare, Wolf O'Donnell, Panther Caroso, Leon Powalski, Slippy's fianceé Amanda, Peppy's daughter Lucy Hare, Bill Grey, Katt Monroe, Andross' grandson Dash Bowman and James McCloud.Andrew Oikonny is one of the game's bosses. Beltino Toad makes an appearance during a mission briefing. ROB 64 is not playable, but pilots the Great Fox when on the map screen. <b>Pigma</b> Dengar appears as a boss in two of Falco's stories. The ghost of Andross, possessing a different bioweapon (Monarch Dodra, Grunner, Killer Bee, or Dune Worm) depending on the mission, appears as a boss on Titania. Octoman, an F-Zero racer, appears as a boss in certain Aquas and Venom missions.|$|E
25|$|Star Fox 64 {{is set on}} a {{group of}} planets in the Lylat system. Ingenious {{scientist}} Andross, a native of the fourth planet Corneria, is driven to madness and nearly destroys the planet using biological weapons. General Pepper exiles Andross to the remote planet Venom. Five years later, Pepper detects suspicious activity on Venom. Pepper hires the Star Fox team (including James McCloud, Peppy Hare and <b>Pigma</b> Dengar) to investigate. After <b>Pigma</b> betrays the team and Andross captures James, Peppy escapes from Venom and informs Fox McCloud about James' fate.|$|E
25|$|Andross' henchmen {{include the}} Star Wolf {{mercenary}} team, consisting of: Wolf O'Donnell; Leon Powalski; <b>Pigma</b> Dengar, {{a former member}} of the Star Fox team with James McCloud; and Andrew Oikonny, Andross's nephew.|$|E
25|$|Other artists show {{scenes of}} debauchery or, like the Italian A. <b>Pigma</b> in When Claudius is away, Messalina will play (1911), hint {{that it will}} soon follow. What was to follow is {{depicted}} in Federico Faruffini's The orgies of Messalina (18671868). A more private liaison is treated in Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida's Messalina in the Arms of the Gladiator (1886). This takes place in an interior, with the empress reclining bare breasted against the knees of a naked gladiator.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew {{assumes the}} {{leadership}} of the Venomian rebellion, but Fox and his allies arrive to help the Cornerian Army. After a strange insect-like creature destroys the flagship emulating Andross, Fox does to it and takes a partial [...] "core memory" [...] for research. Fox learns from Beltino that the enemy creature was an Aparoid, one of the powerful species that destroyed the fleet seventeen years ago. After <b>Pigma</b> steals another Core Memory, Fox convinces Wolf to help the team. As Fox destroys Pigma's infected ship and retrieve the core memory, General Pepper reveals the location of the Aparoid Homeworld. Discovering that the Aparoids are vulnerable to apoptosis, Beltino creates the self-destruct program. The team reaches the Aparoid Homeworld through the large warping space station, only to discover the planet's core blocked by a base and the regenerative shield. The destructive and infested Great Fox opens the shield wide enough for the team to get through inside the planet. Fox and his allies enter the lair of the planet, where the Aparoid Queen uses the voices of Peppy, Pepper, <b>Pigma</b> and James to deceive them into joining her. The team ignores her and Fox shoots the program on the queen, killing her. After the team escapes from the planet's destruction, Fox mentions the survival possibilities for the others.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{features}} the Star Fox team members, including Fox McCloud, Falco Lombardi and Krystal, while Peppy Hare and ROB {{stay at the}} Great Fox to observe missions. It also {{features the}} return of the Star Wolf team, including Wolf O'Donnell, Leon Powalski and Panther Caroso (the new member), with <b>Pigma</b> Dengar and Andrew Oikonny not siding with the team. Slippy Toad's father, Beltino is the scientist. The Aparoids are villainous insect-like creatures. They are capable of infecting machines and life forms, and transforming themselves into Aparoidedation. The large ones have a core memory containing information on contacting their planet. They are led by the Aparoid Queen (Aparoid Mother in the Japanese version), who believes that all things in the universe exist for the infestation, and that becoming one of them does not, but rather a form of evolution. All Aparoids are controlled [...] by the Queen, until Fox destroys her.|$|E

Ingenious {{scientist}} Andross, a native of the fourth planet Corneria, is driven to madness and nearly destroys the planet using biological weapons. For Andross' treason, General Pepper exiles the scientist to the remote planet Venom. Five years after Andross' exile, Pepper detects unknown activity on Venom. Pepper hires the Star Fox team (consisting of James McCloud, Peppy Hare, and <b>Pigma</b> Dengar) to investigate. Upon arriving, <b>Pigma</b> betrays the team, and as a result James ends up missing and is presumed dead, while Peppy barely escapes. Several years later, Andross again invades the Lylat system, causing Pepper to call on the new Star Fox team, led by Fox McCloud, to battle Andross.|$|E
50|$|In Star Fox: Assault, another GameCube game set after Star Fox Adventures, Fox and {{his team}} are hired to defeat Andrew Oikonny, Andross's nephew and ex-Star Wolf member, who has started a {{rebellion}} against Corneria with the remnants of Andross's forces. The team confronts Oikonny on the planet Fortuna, where the flagship is shot down by a creature known as an Aparoid; strange, bug-like organisms {{with the ability to}} assimilate things, living and nonliving. On planet Katina, Fox confronts <b>Pigma</b> Dengar, who sent out an S.O.S. signal to lure them and steals the core memory of a defeated Aparoid, which the team needs in order to locate the homeworld of the race and destroy the Aparoid Queen; the Aparoid leader. Star Fox then encounters and gets into a brief skirmish with the Star Wolf team while searching for <b>Pigma.</b> After defeating <b>Pigma,</b> the stolen core memory is obtained. After freeing Dinosaur Planet, now called Sauria, from the Aparoids, Fox then learns that Corneria has been heavily assaulted by the enemy. But, to the amazement of the Star Fox team, Star Wolf arrive on the scene and destroy the Aparoid army. Fox finally reaches Aparoid world, where the Queen is destroyed along with the home planet itself, once again with help from Star Wolf.|$|E
50|$|Nintendo of Europe {{released}} a Star Fox 64 comic drawn manga-style to retell the game's storyline. The comic showed some scenes {{that were not}} present in the game—for instance, Wolf kicking Andrew and <b>Pigma</b> out of Star Wolf because they acted against his orders (and thus saving Star Fox from {{the plot of the}} two). The comic ends with a robotic Andross being defeated.|$|E

5000|$|Wolf {{makes his}} next {{appearance}} in Star Fox: Assault, {{with a new}} costume and an advanced eye patch. At first he is angered {{at the fact that}} Fox McCloud raided the Sargasso Space Hideout while looking for <b>Pigma</b> Dengar. But fighting an enemy (the Aparoids) that means to conquer (or destroy) the entire Lylat System and all of its inhabitants (Cornerian or otherwise) brought out the good in Wolf, and he actually saved Fox's life when Fox was ambushed by Aparoids on top of the Persimmon's Building in Corneria City. Wolf explained that he only saved Fox because he wanted to be the only one to [...] "tan his hide." ...|$|E

50|$|Various {{elements}} {{return from}} previous games, including Fox's teammates, Falco, Peppy, and Slippy, who can assist the player if they {{protect them from}} enemy attacks, as well as Star Wolf team rivals Wolf O'Donnell, Leon Powalski, <b>Pigma</b> Dengar, and Andrew Oikonny. Several level locations have also returned, including Corneria, Zoness, and Titania, while two new locations, Sector Alpha and Area 3, have been added. Gameplay footage suggests that the snowy planet Fichina (known as Fortuna in Star Fox 64), the asteroid belt Meteo, and the missile-wrought Sector Z may also appear, while a mystical Fortuna returns completely revamped from Star Fox: Assault. Players can scan the Fox and Falco Amiibo figurines to unlock the Retro Arwing, {{which is based on}} the model used in the original Star Fox game, and the Black Arwing, which sports a black and red color scheme, is stronger and faster but takes more damage, respectively.|$|E

50|$|I {{start out}} feeding my brain with newspapers, books, TV news, Internet news, {{listening}} to conversations. Then I write, {{usually in the}} morning. Gags comes out of nowhere. Even if it's silly or stupid or unusable, I write it down. I can edit it later. I let the writing simmer. After a day, a week, sometimes years, I go back, fix the writing and pick out some gags to draw. Occasionally I have brainstormed via email with other cartoonists. It works great, and I can't ever remember when either of us wanted the other one's ideas; so we never really stepped on each other's toes... I make a primitive, rough outline of the people, main characters, in a basic setting on crummy copy paper with a regular pencil. Then I put a nice piece of smooth HP laser paper over the sketch and ink over it on a light table. For crowd, bar, vegetation, beach and laboratory scenes, I draw directly on the finished paper with no sketches because I draw fast, and background scenes are loosely lined. I use <b>Pigma</b> pens and a brush, sometimes a Sharpie or a black calligraphy pen. Then I scan the drawings into Photoshop. If a company wants an original, I ink on good watercolor paper and add a gray wash or watercolor. But in Photoshop I shade/color the drawing using a Wacom tablet. If I'm on vacation, I can draw on tracing paper and save that to scan later, or photocopy the cartoons, send by mail to various companies, then scan them when I get home. I like to have every single cartoon scanned, so I can pull them up at a moment's notice and either print hard copies or send PDFs. I've been sending stuff via PDF for years worldwide, and I think it's given me an edge over a lot of cartoonists who concentrate on the regular major markets here in the U.S.|$|E
