30|$|Designed {{software}} {{is able to}} consider both axial tension and stress simultaneously in entire length of drill string, and identifies the allowed drill string stability region in very small n-elements of drill string length. All used mathematical equations in this software are coded using MATLAB software {{in a way that}} all dependent and independent parameters compute simultaneously in the n-point. So the user will be able to observe the all parameters changing as point by point so that be recognized if there is a problem through the drilled depths in the drill string length in order to take the necessary treatments for removing the problem. In fact mathematical consideration of issues related to stability region determination of drill string that contains the <b>pipes</b> and <b>collars</b> in a way that drilled depths are divided into very small n-element causes increasing in precision of the proper pipes selections. When the user receives the predicted allowed stability region by software as digital and graphical outputs, {{he will be able to}} choose <b>pipes</b> and <b>collars</b> with more accuracy, because in many drilling cases around the world, particularly in Iran, it has been observed that the drilling costs have increased due to improper selection of <b>pipes</b> or <b>collars.</b> These costs are due to various factors. One of these is poor design of drill strings with selection of pipes with too much resistance that are more expensive (Jahromi 1986). While drilling the same wells could be perform with respect to different conditions by selection of the pipes with less weight and cost. So one of the best advantages of having a predicted drill string stability region is more appropriate drill string designs and also can significantly reduce the costs of the drilling.|$|R

50|$|A {{drill string}} on a {{drilling}} rig is a column, or string, of drill pipe that transmits drilling fluid (via the mud pumps) and torque (via the kelly drive or top drive) to the drill bit. The term is loosely {{applied to the}} assembled collection of the drill <b>pipe,</b> drill <b>collars,</b> tools and drill bit.

30|$|Knowledge of the allowed {{stability}} {{region of}} drill <b>pipes</b> and <b>collars</b> {{is the first}} step to having an optimal design of drill string in specified conditions of wellbore. With lack of sufficient knowledge of drill string stability region may be used pipes with more resistance for more safety. Hence drilling cost will increase. This paper describes software designed to predict the drill string stability region across {{the entire length of the}} drill string. All mathematical equations have coded by using MATLAB software. Drilling depths have classified to n-elements in this MATLAB code. Calculations perform for the elements from surface to a certain depth or from a certain point to the next desired depth. Then the number of n-functions of axial stress and compression force create versus depth. Then the software substitutes the desired depths and gives to the user graphical and digital form of outputs. Data statistical analysis method has been used for programming this software to remove unwanted members. The user will be able to observe string stability region as point-to-point. So the users will have more accurate in choosing the appropriate size and type of <b>pipes</b> and <b>collars.</b> Also the field studies have done for several wells of southwestern Iranian fields. We have shown that in drilling some of them could be used proper lighter pipes to decrease drilling costs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In rotary {{drilling}} operation, the hydraulic circuit typically consists of stand pipe, rotary hose, swivel, Kelly, drill <b>pipe,</b> drill <b>collar,</b> drill bit, and the annulus between the drillstring {{and the open}} hole or the casing. Stand Pipe Pressure, abbreviated as SPP, {{is defined as the}} total frictional pressure drop in the hydraulic circuit. SPP, an important drilling parameter in selecting proper mud weight, can be calculated using different rheological models. In this paper, the results obtained using the four widely used rheological models namely the Newtonian model, the Bingham plastic model, the Power law model and the Herschel-Bulkley model are presented. The rheological data used are collected by performing circulation test while drilling a vertical well in the Po valley, Italy. The rheological constants associated with each of the four models are calculated using regression analysis, For the three flow rates used during the circulation test, SPP has been predicted with a maximum error of 1. 2 % when compared with the measured values. The Bingham plastic model produces best SPP estimates for all the three flow rates for the drilling condition considered...|$|R
5000|$|Slow pump {{pressure}} is the circulating pressure (pressure used to pump fluid {{through the whole}} active fluid system, including the borehole and all the surface tanks that constitute the primary system during drilling) at a reduced rate. SPP is very important during a well kill operation in which circulation (a process in which drilling fluid is circulated out of the suction pit, down the drill <b>pipe</b> and drill <b>collars,</b> out the bit, up the annulus, {{and back to the}} pits while drilling proceeds) is done at a reduced rate to allow better control of circulating pressures and to enable the mud properties (density and viscosity) to be kept at desired values. The slow {{pump pressure}} can also be referred to as [...] "kill rate pressure" [...] or [...] "slow circulating pressure" [...] or [...] "kill speed pressure" [...] and so on.|$|R
40|$|When the {{drilling}} fluid leaves the mud pump, it circulates through the stand pipe, rotary hose, swivel, Kelly, drill <b>pipe,</b> drill <b>collar,</b> bit and the annulus between the drill string {{and the open}} hole or the casing. During drilling fluid circulation, frictional pressure drop occurs in the hydraulic circuit consisting of the elements mentioned earlier. The total pressure drop in the hydraulic circuit {{is known as the}} stand pipe pressure, abbreviated as SPP. Calculation of the SPP is strongly depended on the rheological models and the assumption of their rheological constants. A number of the rheological models are available. Among them, three most widely used in petroleum industry as Bingham Plastic model, Power low model and the Herschel-Bulkely model have been chosen. For predication of SPP we have to consider the rheological constants of drilling fluid because SPP predication is strongly depends on rheological constants. There are two suggestions to determine these rheological constants named as two point regression or field approach and six points’ regression approaches. Most theoretical principles have been reviewed in the earlier chapter of this work. Then our suggestion based on predication of SPP using two and six points regression have been presented at the rest of the chapters. At the end it has been presented weaknesses and conclusions of this work. This project includes 9 main chapters and a large numbers of tables and figures which have been calculated by hydraulic programming in Excel. All these tables and figures have been putted in Appendixes. </p...|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from <b>piped</b> or taped <b>collars,</b> cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|R
40|$|The goal of jet-assisted {{drilling}} is {{to increase}} the rate of penetration (ROP) in deeper gas and oil wells, where the rocks become harder and more difficult to drill. Increasing the ROP can result in fewer drilling days, and therefore, lower drilling cost. In late 1993, FlowDril and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) began a three-year development of a down hole pump (DHP{reg_sign}) capable of producing 30, 000 psi out pressure to provide the high-pressure flow for high-pressure jet-assist of the drill bit. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) through its Morgantown, WV (DOE-Morgantown) field office, joined with GRI and FlowDril to develop and test a second prototype designed for drilling in 7 - 7 / 8 inch holes. This project, {open_quotes}Development and Testing of a High-Pressure Down Hole Pump for Jet-Assist Drilling,{close_quotes} is for the development and testing of the second prototype. It was planned in two phases. Phase I included an update of a market analysis, a design, fabrication, and an initial laboratory test of the second prototype. Phase II is continued iterative laboratory and field developmental testing. This report summarizes the results of Phase II. In the downhole pump approach shown in the following figure, conventional drill <b>pipe</b> and drill <b>collars</b> are used, with the DHP as the last component of the bottom hole assembly next to the bit. The DHP is a reciprocating double ended, intensifier style positive displacement, high-pressure pump. The drive fluid and the high-pressure output fluid are both derived from the same source, the abrasive drilling mud pumped downhole through the drill string. Approximately seven percent of the stream is pressurized to 30, 000 psi and directed through a high-pressure nozzle on the drill bit to produce the high speed jet and assist the mechanical action of the bit to make it drill faster...|$|R

Drilling {{process of}} deep {{borehole}} consists of different drilling operations. Each {{of them can}} cause numerous different drilling problems especially when a borehole is performed. While drilling the most dangerous problems can occur once the drilling fluids (oil, gas or water) spontaneously flow out from the drilled formations into the borehole {{and then to the}} surface. It can also happen that the pressures in the borehole are not balanced and an influx of fluid into the borehole (a kick) will occur. If no action is taken to stop a kick once it begins, then the fluids will be pushed out of the borehole and will be flowing uncontrollably to surface (blow-out). Blow-out is prevented by closing off the well at the surface with special kind of valves (Blow-out Preventers - BOPs). When pressure control over the well is lost, swift action must be taken to avert the severe consequences. These consequences may include: — endangering of human life, — loss of rig and equipment, — negative influence on the environment, — additional costs of bringing the well under control again, — loss of reservoir production. In the case of kick or blow-out will occur in the practical use are different procedures and methods to control a borehole. These procedures and methods depend on the actual drilling operation scenario. One of them can be a tripping operation when the drill string is pulled out or run back again.
