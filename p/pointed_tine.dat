40|$|What we are {{now facing}} is the dilemma {{when we try to}} {{integrate}} Digital Cartographic Model (DCM), which is symbol-oriented model, and Digital Landscape Model (DLM), which is the geographical entity and topology oriented model. Basic theory of map modeling method of geographical data is researched. A new type of digital map data model is raised out and designed, including four levels as conceptual, logical, and physical model to satisfy visualization and spatial analysis at the same time. The formation of the digital map logic model relies on abstracting and summarizing the world by means of the object-oriented method, putting forward the conceptual model of the object-oriented digital map according to the OGC abstract norm, dwelling on all the kinds of objects in the model and logical design in which spatial data, attribute data, symbols, and topology are all stored in relational database, in form of various but inter-linked relational tabulations as <b>point,</b> <b>tine,</b> area, label, symbol, etc. And meanwhile, the author develops the data-modeling tool which turns the storage of the digital map in the relational database management system into realities, thus realizes digital map storage and manages in Microsoft SQL Server...|$|R
50|$|The {{branched}} antlers {{are unique}} in that the long <b>tines</b> <b>point</b> backward, while the main beam extends almost directly upward. There may be two pairs per year. The summer antlers are the larger set, and are dropped in November, after the summer rut. The second set—if they appear—are fully grown by January, and fall off a few weeks later.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{its large}} and sharp head, the McLeod is an awkward tool to {{transport}} and store, {{and is often}} considered undesirable by most. Some McLeod [...] tools are made with a removable blade to partially mitigate this problem. Ideally it is carried with the <b>tines</b> <b>pointing</b> toward the ground for safety, with a sheath over the cutting edge. However, the mass distribution {{makes it difficult to}} carry in this orientation consistently.|$|R

2500|$|Bulls grow antlers {{annually}} {{from the time}} they are nearly one year old. When mature, a bull’s [...] "rack" [...] may have 6 to 8 <b>points</b> or <b>tines</b> on each side and weigh more than 30 pounds. The antlers are usually shed in March or April, and begin regrowing in May, when the bony growth is nourished by blood vessels and covered by furry-looking [...] "velvet." [...] Antler growth ceases each year by August, when the velvet dries up and bulls begin to scrape it off by rubbing against trees, in preparation for the autumn mating season or rut. A bull may gather 20-30 cows into his harem during the mating season, often clashing or locking antlers with another mature male for the privilege of dominating the herd group. By November, mating season ends and elk generally move to their winter ranges. Calves weighing 25-40 pounds are born in late May or early June.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} quantum {{criticality}} {{is proving to}} be central to attempts to understand the physics of strongly correlated electrons. Here, we argue that observations on the itinerant metamagnet Sr 3 Ru 2 O 7 represent good evidence for a new class of quantum critical point, arising when the critical end <b>point</b> terminating a <b>tine</b> of first-order transitions is depressed toward zero temperature. This is of interest both in its own right and because of the convenience of having a quantum critical point for which the tuning parameter is the magnetic field. The relationship between the resultant critical fluctuations and novel behavior very near the critical field is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Cultures in the Midwest {{such as the}} Mississippian and Oneota crafted {{projectiles}} from {{raw materials}} ranging from local stone to exotic materials, bone and antler. This thesis is a study of differences {{in the nature of}} raw materials, as well as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each. Methods were employed to measure time invested in manufacturing and hafting each projectile point, as well as how each point performed when used against a target. As a result, this thesis was able to better understand the properties of each type, possibly determining the use of each. In general, stone points had the lowest cost of time to create, however, organic points required less skill. In terms of performance, the wounds caused by lithic points and distal phalanges are suitable for harvesting medium and large game, while antler <b>tine</b> <b>points</b> are effective against both medium and small game...|$|R
40|$|Ethiopian {{farmers have}} been using an ox-drawn {{breaking}} plough, known as ard plough - maresha, for thousands of years. Maresha is a <b>pointed,</b> steel-tipped <b>tine</b> attached to a draught pole at an adjustable shallow angle. It has narrow side-wings, attached {{to the left and}} right side of it, to push soil to either side without inverting. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the effect of side-wings on draught using a field soil bin test facility. To this end, a mobile and an in-situ soil bin test system, for online measurements of draught, was designed and developed. This research considered tool geometry (maresha plough with and without side-wings) and rake angle (shallow - 8 °, medium deep - 15 °, and deep - 24 °, representing primary, secondary and tertiary tillage processes in Ethiopia, respectively). Maresha plough with side-wings has greater contact area, between the moving soil and tool, than its wingless counterpart. When the ploughshare surface and soil slide relative to one another, the draught expected to increase with contact area, as adhesion and friction resistance increases with area. However, experimental analysis indicated that the maresha with side-wings required less draught compared to maresha without side-wings (ρ < 0. 001). This might be attributed to the effect of side-wings on crack propagation by a wedging effect to enhance and facilitate subsequent ploughing. This paper also dealt with the effect of rake angle on draught. Though the depth setup was getting smaller d 1 < d 2 < d 3 for the successive tillage runs, analysis showed increment in draught force (ρ < 0. 001) with rake angle. This might be attributed to higher soil compaction that comes with depth and downward force resulting from repeated use of maresha every season to the same depth for thousand years. Although more and rigorous studies should be undertaken considering soil, tool, and operational parameters to arrive at conclusive results, this paper gave some insights regarding effect of side-wings on maresha plough and rake angle on draught. This shows that there is still room for improvement of maresha plough geometry for minimum draught requirement and optimum soil manipulation...|$|R
