5|$|The {{economic}} {{policies of the}} New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E

5|$|A {{spacecraft}} crashes at Wiekamp Air Force base in West Virginia, and {{the surviving}} Rebel passenger is {{captured by the}} military. Mulder shows Scully more <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims and, having found more implants in them, believes the implant in Scully {{may be able to}} answer all of their questions. The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E

Meanwhile, the invisible occupant of the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the crash site, escaping into the outside world.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of <b>photos</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
