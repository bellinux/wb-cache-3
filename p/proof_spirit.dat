There is nothing concerning which the African traveller {{should be so}} particular as water; bitter with nitre, and full of organic matter, it causes all those dysenteric diseases which have made research {{in this part of}} the world a Upas tree to the discoverer. Pocket filters are invaluable. The water of wells should be boiled and passed through charcoal; and even then it might be mixed to a good purpose with a few drops of <b>proof</b> <b>spirit.</b> The Somal generally carry their store in large wickerwork pails. I preferred skins, as more portable and less likely to taint the water.|$|E

50|$|Earlier, another size {{of whiskey}} barrel {{was the most}} common size; this was the 40 gal barrel for <b>proof</b> <b>spirits,</b> which was of the same volume as 5 US bushels. However, by 1866, the oil barrel was {{standardized}} at 42 US gallons.|$|R
50|$|Some of the distillery's labels {{included}} Eagle Gin, <b>Proof</b> <b>Spirits,</b> Pure Malt Whiskies, East India Bitters, Buck Bourbon Blend Whiskey, Willow Springs Sour Mash Whiskies, and Golden Sheaf Rye Whiskey. Each {{of these}} particular products won awards at Omaha's Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Dean Long {{applied for}} a license {{from the state of}} Massachusetts to {{manufacture}} high <b>proofed</b> <b>spirits</b> with the hope to produce grappa and fruit brandies at a point in the future.  As whiskey can be distilled from beer, Dean Long, Randy Hudson, and Jay Harman saw a potential for a distillery making whiskey.|$|R

6000|$|The actual amount {{reached by}} {{taxation}} {{is very much}} less than that [...] known to be actually used by from ten to fifteen millions of [...] gallons, or nearly one half the product. The openness of the [...] frauds can {{be judged by the}} fact that <b>proof</b> <b>spirits</b> were “openly [...] sold in the market, and even quoted in price-currents, at from [...] five to fifteen cents less per gallon than the rate of tax and the [...] average cost of manufacture.”(348) ...|$|R

50|$|Rinquinquin is a peach apéritif {{produced}} {{in the south of}} France. It is made by infusing sweet peaches and delicate peach in a 100 <b>proof</b> neutral <b>spirit.</b> The results are mixed with white wine, essential oils of citrus and sugar.|$|R
50|$|The wine is {{produced}} {{from a single}} variety, the small berried Muscat which {{is also known as}} the Muscat de Frontignan, and must contain a minimum alcohol level of 15%. Mutage is carried out during the fermentation by the addition of 95° (minimum) <b>proof</b> <b>spirit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polar Ice is a Canadian vodka {{produced}} by Corby Distilleries Ltd. Produced from Canadian wheat, it is quadruple distilled, which its vendors claim rids the vodka of microscopic impurities.

50|$|In the United States, the {{standard}} drink contains 0.6 fl oz of alcohol. This is approximately {{the amount of}} alcohol in a 12 fl oz glass of beer, a 5 fl oz glass of wine, or a 1.5 fl oz glass of a 40% ABV (80 US <b>proof)</b> <b>spirit.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to create change for the {{industry}} in Ohio as a whole, Greg Lehman of Watershed Distillery, Ryan Lang of Middle West Spirits and Tom Herbruck of Tom's Foolery Distillery (Cleveland, Ohio), founded the Ohio Distiller's Guild to provide a legislative voice for the state's craft distillers {{as well as a}} professional organization that would allow for easier access and sharing of resources and information. Through the guild, legislation was passed in December 2011 that freed up all micro distillers in the state of Ohio producing less than 10,000 proof gallons of high <b>proof</b> <b>spirits</b> annually to qualify for an A3-a permit which allowed them to not only sell bottles on site but also to offer samplings.|$|R
50|$|To {{produce the}} Lemon liqueur {{requires}} sugar, water, lemon zest, liquor, {{and time to}} mature. Lemon zest is soaked in high <b>proof</b> neutral <b>spirits</b> to extract from it the lemon oil (an essential oil). The extraction is then diluted with simple syrup.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{alcoholic beverages}} {{of this region}} are beer (strong pale lager) and Jenever, a high <b>proof</b> juniper-flavored <b>spirit,</b> {{that came to be}} known in England as gin. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, Advocaat, a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.|$|R
50|$|Sinfire Cinnamon Whisky is a brand {{made with}} blended Canadian whisky and all natural {{cinnamon}} flavors. It is imported, bottled, and distributed exclusively by Hood River Distillers, located in Hood River, Oregon, United States. Launched in February 2012, the whisky has a flavor reminiscent of Red Hots candy. The 70 <b>proof</b> <b>spirit</b> {{is available in}} 1.75 L, 1.0 L, 750 ml, 375 ml and 50 ml sizes.|$|E
5000|$|American Spirit Whiskey was {{the first}} {{commercial}} offering from ASW Distillery, introduced to the Atlanta market in late 2011. American Spirit Whiskey is not distilled in Atlanta, but is an 80 <b>proof</b> <b>spirit</b> whiskey distilled in Charleston, South Carolina using a recipe created by the founders of ASW Distillery in 2010. It is described as having [...] "a soft minerality to it and, like the nose, a slight fruitiness." ...|$|E
5000|$|The value 57.15% is {{very close}} to the {{fraction}} [...] = 0.5714. This leads to the definition amounts to declaring that 100° <b>proof</b> <b>spirit</b> has an ABV of [...] From this it follows that, to convert the ABV (expressed as a percentage standard rather than as a fraction) to degrees proof, it is only necessary to multiply the ABV by [...] Thus pure, 100% alcohol will have 100× (...) = 175° proof, and a spirit containing 40% ABV will have 40× (...) = 70° proof.|$|E

50|$|Higher <b>proof,</b> less aged <b>spirits</b> {{are usually}} much less {{expensive}} to produce than straight whiskey or single malt whisky, and are thus used as the primary spirits in most blends, with the more premium whiskies and other ingredients added for flavoring.|$|R
5000|$|Gooderham and Worts {{was founded}} by James Worts, a British immigrant, in 1832. The company {{became one of the}} world's largest distilleries, and in 1859 it {{constructed}} the largest distillery in Canada, also {{one of the largest in}} North America. This distillery is what remains today of the ‘Distillery District’ at the bottom of Trinity Street in Toronto, Ontario. In the first year of the new distillery, G&W produced 849,700 U.S. gallons of <b>proof</b> <b>spirits,</b> a value equivalent to one quarter of the entire Canadian production at that time. [...] What is now known as the Young Center For the Performing Arts was originally built as tank house 9 and tank house 10, part of the Gooderham and Worts Distillery. The buildings were constructed in 1888 following the 1885 passage of the Canadian law which required that all whisky must be aged for two years before being consumed. Prior to this law change, whisky was often consumed quickly after it was distilled; the law change meant that Gooderham and Worts needed to increase storage space for their product. Both structures were designed by David Roberts Jr., who designed many of the Distillery’s buildings.|$|R
50|$|However, {{straight}} whiskey {{is also an}} important component of American blended whiskey. Blended whiskey made in the United States must contain at least 20% {{straight whiskey}}. The remaining portion is higher-proof spirit, often unaged neutral grain spirits, which are less expensive to produce. The straight whiskey component adds characteristic whiskey flavor to the blend, as the higher <b>proof</b> <b>spirit</b> loses most flavoring compounds during the distillation process, and does not gain flavors from barrel aging. Blended whiskey may also contain additives for coloring and flavoring.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} to be {{improved}} and patented by an Irishman, Aeneas Coffey. Educated at Dublin's Trinity College, Coffey had ample opportunities to observe all manner of still designs because he had worked {{for a quarter of}} a century as an excise tax collector. He knew how much could be produced in a given period of time. He also knew that the new continuous stills had a flaw. To obtain a higher <b>proof</b> <b>spirit,</b> receiving vessels had to be changed so multiple distillations could take place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{need for}} finding better {{accommodation}} for the department’s rapidly increasing collections became urgent and imperative. By 1964, the Fire <b>Proof</b> <b>Spirit</b> building (FPSB) in the Indian Museum, solely constructed for ZSI, became a reality {{and ready for}} occupation. But {{only three of the}} six floors of the newly built FPSB, Kolkata, were occupied by the Zoological Survey of India in 1965. The Freshwater and Marine Fish Sections, Amphibia Section, Reptilia Section, Crustacea Section, General Non-Chordata Section, and Museum and Taxidermy Section of the Survey were shifted to FPSB. The Fire <b>Proof</b> <b>Spirit</b> Building, as its name indicates, was constructed exclusively for the Zoological Survey of India with the idea of protecting the invaluable, registered “National Zoological Collection” preserved in rectified spirit/alcohol. The building was made fire-proof, acting as a fire-resisting unit, so that all the spirit-preserved specimens would remain safe and protected. [...] In the post independence period, in April 1955 the Govt. of India called a conference of eminent zoologists to suggest a programme {{for the development of the}} Zoological Survey of India under the Second Five-Year Plan. The necessity for having the headquarters of the Survey in a suitable central place in India was also realized and the recommendation was taken up for consideration.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, psychic {{investigator}} Andrija Puharich and Tom O'Neill, {{publisher of}} the Spiritualist magazine Psychic Observer, arranged to film two seances at Camp Chesterfield using infrared film, intending to procure scientific <b>proof</b> of <b>spirit</b> materializations. The medium was shown the camera beforehand, and was aware {{that she was being}} filmed. However, the film revealed obvious fraud {{on the part of the}} medium and her cabinet assistant. The expose was published in the 10 July 1960 issue of the Psychic Observer.|$|R
5000|$|Sensing Murder psychic Sue Nicholson {{spoke at}} the 2013 Wellington conference about her 21 years of {{experiences}} as a psychic medium. Organiser Vicki Hyde applauded Nicholson's willingness {{to speak at the}} conference, saying [...] "many people working in this profession are very reluctant to expose themselves to any critical scrutiny.” Hyde is quick to add that “critical” in this case [...] "involves a spirit of genuine interest and inquiry", even if <b>proof</b> of <b>spirits</b> from the after-life continues to be elusive.|$|R
5000|$|There is a surjection for [...] {{large enough}} the kernel of [...] must be non-congruence (one {{way to see}} {{this is that the}} Cheeger {{constant}} of the Schreier graph goes to 0; there is also a simple algebraic <b>proof</b> in the <b>spirit</b> of the previous item).|$|R
50|$|He {{assisted}} {{the government in}} the drafting of the 1823 Excise Act which made it easier to distil legally. It sanctioned the distilling of whiskey in return for a licence fee of £10, and a set payment per gallon of <b>proof</b> <b>spirit.</b> It also provided for the appointment of a single Board of Excise, under Treasury control, for the whole of the United Kingdom, replacing the separate Excise boards for England, Scotland and Ireland. The 1823 Excise Act also provided for not more than four assistant commissioners of excise to transact current business in Scotland and Ireland, {{under the control of the}} board in London.|$|E
