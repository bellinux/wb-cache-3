40|$|Following {{both the}} {{balance-sheet}} approach to currency crises {{and the financial}} fragility literature, the paper presents an open economy macrodynamical monetary growth model {{with the aim of}} giving an endogenous characterisation to the process that, over time, leads an emerging economy to accumulate dangerously high levels of debt and to be vulnerable to macroeconomic instability. The model explores the nonlinear real and financial interaction at work, with the endogenously generated liquidity feeding back dynamically to firms ’ investment, the level of output, the interest rate and the expected rate of return. The paper shows that the system may display instability if lenders and borrowers are not too concerned with firms ’ degree of leverage, <b>profitability</b> <b>expectations</b> do not take adequately into account firms’ financial structure, and destabilising feedback mechanisms dominate, which go from debt accumulation and <b>profitability</b> <b>expectations</b> onto the rate of profit and the interest rate. As a result, the economy may incur in excessive foreign borrowing. The consequent worsening in firms ’ balance sheets may turn into financial fragility, and over time bring about a fall in external lending. A prolonged recession may thus follow, possibly calling into question the currency arrangements; hence, a financial crisis may turn into a currency crisis...|$|E

40|$|Investment {{cycles and}} their {{modelling}} {{have been under}} the interest of system dynamics since long ago. Most often these cycles are caused by the uncertain <b>profitability</b> <b>expectations</b> involved in long-term capital investments, {{as well as the}} long manufacturing processes of the needed buildings, machines and/or equipment. This paper concentrates on the investment decisions of class I A ice-strengthened oil tankers. In the European oil transport market, these tankers are required only in the Baltic Sea region, and especially in the oil terminals of the Gulf of Finland. The demand for these special class tankers can be derived from the handling capacity available in the most important Russian oil export terminal, Primorsk. However, in the near future, planned capacity enlargements in Primorsk will create additional dynamics. Based on the simulation results, we argue that terminal capacity could not be used in full scale in the near future, if the use of appropriate ice-strengthened tanker capacity is favoured. However, if oil exports are aimed to be completed with I A class vessels, this class of tankers will face a newbuilding boom, which is expected to last at least for the next 10 years.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an open-economy macrodynamical growth model {{with the aim}} of giving an endogenous characterisation to the process that leads a small country with a currency-board arrangement to accumulate dangerously high levels of external debt and become vulnerable to macroeconomic instability. The macrodynamics of the model results from the combination of the commitment to maintain the peg - that makes liquidity closely dependent on the dynamics of foreign reserves – and the non-linear real and financial interactions that drives the pro-cyclical behaviour of the economy. Within this context, the external finance ease during an economic upswing leads to debt-supported growth and financial fragility; the consequent deterioration of <b>profitability</b> <b>expectations</b> brings about a capital reversal that, in the absence of monetary stabilization tools, makes the currency arrangement unsustainable. A financial crisis may thus turn into a currency crisis. We run a continuous-time estimation of a non-linear differential equations system for Argentina during the years of the currency-board arrangement. We find that two steady-state solutions exist. The local stability and sensitivity analysis show that both equilibria are unstable and that the qualitative nature of the equilibria depends in particular on lenders’ responsiveness to the degree of leverage. On the contrary, when considering a different currency arrangement with an autonomous monetary policy, the system becomes stable.

40|$|A new EU {{directive}} on used vehicles {{has recently}} been introduced. It demands that for every scrapped car, at least 85 % by weight must be recycled by the year 2006 and 95 % by 2015. The current level is about 80 %. The car disassembly industry {{was chosen as the}} study object of this thesis. Due to the increased demands on recycling, the disassembly industry may undergo comprehensive rationalizations and expand into a modern mass-type production. Rationalized car disassembly systems may be an alternative to shredding processes. The general aim of this thesis is to study the connections between expected rationalizations and ergonomics based on the case of the car disassembly industry. The studies in this thesis aim to collect empirical data on present production system performance and ergonomics (physical workloads) and possible future development. Car dismantlers, manufacturers and authority stakeholders described current disassembly systems as ?craft-type?, i. e. containing a rich variety of tasks and considerable periods of set-up time. The dismantling companies reported good <b>profitability.</b> <b>Expectations</b> about production systems in the future were that the amount of non-profit work per car would increase and more parts and materials than at present will have to be dismantled. These materials lack market value today. For production to stay profitable in spite of increased time in non-value-adding tasks, comprehensive rationalizations were anticipated. Design for Disassembly/Recycling was not fully applied at the manufacturing. However, the need for this strategy was expressed by both dismantlers and manufacturers, as was the need of cooperation between these two groups. The ?craft-type? disassembly workers reported a high physical workload for the arm and for the low back. Pain levels were highest for the low back, with 29. 5 % of operators reporting pain to occur ?often? during the last 12 months. Disassembly workers had higher pain scores than a general male population in Sweden. The psychosocial working conditions, i. e. demands, influence and social support were lower than the corresponding data for the Danish working population. Technical measurements of physical workloads and time consumption in the current ?craft-type? Swedish car disassembly were made. Disassembly work implied high circulatory loads, much walking and high peak low back loads. Value-adding, ?direct?, work comprised only 30 % of the total working time, and implied more awkward postures and higher movement velocities for the head, arm, upper back and wrist than non-value adding tasks, as well as less time in rest. The physical workloads and operators? utilization of time were also assessed in a serial-flow ?industrialized? production system for car disassembly in the Netherlands. Time proportions of direct work as well as body postures were similar in the serial-flow car disassembly and in the Swedish craft-type. Peak low back load tended to be smaller in the serial-flow system, while the upper limb movement velocities appeared to be higher in this system. The serial-flow disassembly system showed production deficits due to factors such as system losses, worker inexperience and teamwork deficits. A novel combination of flow and biomechanical simulation was presented in order to assess the physical loading consequences of alternative system configurations. A smaller variation in cycle times implied higher output in number of cars per week and larger operator cumulative loading on the low back. Reducing cycle times, on the other hand, resulted in higher output without significant change in utilization rates and thus unchanged cumulative load. Combined human and flow simulations may allow an integrated consideration of productivity and human factors in the early system development. Reliability of the video-based tool for work task analysis was assessed. Task analysis was one of the core methods used in this research, and it may be more frequently used in ?rationalization? studies. In general, there was good agreement between observers both on overall task proportions and on the mean duration of sequences in most task categories. The variance between filmed subjects was larger than that between observers in most combinations of parameter and task category. The residual variance, interpreted as mainly being due to within-observer (test-retest) variability, was generally larger than the between-observer variability. This thesis included transfer of research to practice through close cooperation with stakeholders in car disassembly and assembly, their branch organizations and authority stakeholders. The collaboration also included the serial-flow system developer and practitioners through a Reference Group.

30|$|Using {{the same}} dataset, Crimmann et al. (2010) {{turn to the}} {{question}} of firm selection into short-time work, or the extensive margin of participation. They find that, unlike in 2003, firms taking up short-time work in 2009 were less likely to have high shares of qualified or university-trained employees. They point to the specific nature of the 2008 – 2009 recession as a possible explanation, since it hit exporting manufacturing firms particularly hard and presumably these had large shares of non-specialised, blue-collar workers. Most of their other evidence also confirms Boeri and Bruecker’s (2011) findings on the intensive margin of take-up. These include a positive effect of establishment size and deteriorating performance (past <b>profitability,</b> future <b>expectations)</b> on the likelihood of using short-time work. In addition, flexible arrangements, such as part-time, fixed-term and agency contracts, tend to reduce the probability of participation. Exporting establishments {{are also more likely to}} participate in short-time work, even after controlling for other factors. Finally, they find no significant impact from the application of collective pay agreements.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the underlying structural imbalances {{leading up to}} the Great Recession of 2007 - 2009 {{from the vantage point of}} Hyman Minsky’s theory of the liquidity trap. The traditional approach to the liquidity trap focuses on the zero interest rate boundary while Minsky’s theory focuses on three conditions that make investment spending unresponsive to monetary policy: low underlying ex post profitability of capital, weak <b>expectations</b> about future <b>profitability,</b> and uncertainty about prospective yields. The paper structures an empirical investigation of profitability and accumulation around these three factors. The Great Recession was preceded by an unbalanced recovery in which residential investment led demand while business fixed investment was structurally weak, given the strong ex post profitability of capital and the low interest rate environment. It is hypothesized that increased import penetration and concerns about the sustainability of <b>profitability</b> eroded both <b>expectations</b> and confidence about prospective yields.

40|$|This paper raises {{several issues}} {{concerning}} productivity analysis. An attempt {{is made to}} demonstrate the usefulness of a micro-based approach to productivity analysis which challenges some basic assumptions of conventional analyses based on aggregate production functions. With {{the help of a}} micro- (firm-) based macro simulation model it is shown if there are important differences among firms in economic competence, here represented by efficiency and investment behavior, the relationships between investment, productivity, and economic growth are much more complex and unpredictable than commonly assumed. The rate of technological progress as measured by the rate of change in best-practice technology seems to be less important than the elimination of inefficiency by closure of firms and/or by firms moving closer to their respective production frontiers. It is also shown that the conditions which determine firm borrowing for investment (involving their interpretation of past <b>profitability</b> and <b>expectations</b> based on current capacity utilization) are more important for productivity and economic growth than the total amount invested. In other words, it matters less how much is invested than who does the investing, and under what incentives. The implication for productivity analysis is that unless diversity among economic units is taken into account, the results are likely to continue to be inconclusive. What is needed is much more of an integration of micro and macro theory than has been accomplished thus far. In particular, economic competence must be included. The paper also tries to put productivity in the proper perspective, not as an object in and of itself but rather as a partial measure, at best, of economic performance at any level within the economy...|$|R

This paper shows how a knowledge community {{may be necessary to}} support the legitimacy of new products that undergo performance evaluation before purchase. Using historical and ethnographic data covering half a century, we review the growth of the art investment field through an epistemic cultures lens. Technical knowledge about the financial characteristics of art has been developed alongside practical knowledge about how best to structure investment ventures. Investment venture success has been determined by legitimacy as much as by <b>profitability,</b> given durable <b>expectations</b> about the evaluation and monitoring of investments. The growth of knowledge, practices and tools was thus a necessary condition for the recognition of artwork as an asset class. Crucially, the epistemic cultures approach highlights deepening knowledge, resources and professional expertise, and their development through experimentation, failures and negative knowledge. This shows accounting issues contributing to technical field legitimacy and emergence, such as the role of knowledge production, valuation practices and receptive environments, and the distinction between legitimate investments that can be valued and investment venture profitability.

Today this level is about 80 %. The growing car disassembly industry {{was chosen as the}} study object of this thesis. Due to the increased demands on recycling, the disassembly industry is expected to undergo comprehensive rationalizations and expand into a modern mass-type production. Thus, this thesis investigates the current status of the car disassembly industry with special focus on production systems and ergonomics issues in this context. Paper 1 incorporated the initial efforts, which aimed to explore the current status of the car disassembly industry. The purpose was to obtain knowledge about ergonomics and production systems, as well as to obtain knowledge about ideas, plans and views on the future situation of the industry and production systems. Qualitative methods were utilized. Dismantlers, manufacturers and authority stakeholders described current production systems as ‘craft-type’, i. e. containing a rich variety of tasks as well as considerable periods of set-up time. The dismantling companies faced modest competition and reported good <b>profitability.</b> Future <b>expectations</b> about production systems were that the amount of non-profit work per car would increase. Due to the new legislative demands, disassembly of more parts and materials than today is expected. Today these materials lack market value. For production to stay profitable in spite of increased time in non-value-adding tasks, comprehensive rationalizations are anticipated. Paper 2 was a follow-up study to further investigate the hypotheses generated in Paper 1 with quantitative assessments of mechanical exposures in disassembly. New parameters were utilized for documenting changes in exposures due to rationalizations. Disassembly work was divided into four task groups. These were: direct work (value-adding tasks), and material/tool handling, casual tasks and unplanned breaks (all three non-value-adding). The study shows that disassembly implied high circulatory loads, more walking and higher lumbar peak loads as compared to assembly work. Value-adding tasks comprised only 30 % of the total working time, and implied more awkward postures and higher velocities for the head, arm, upper back and wrist than non-value-adding tasks, as well as less time in rest. It is concluded that the ‘craft-type’ disassembly work of today offers a considerable potential for rationalizations. Rationalizations are expected to increase ergonomic exposures. This gives a reason to act proactively in the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders. Due to the legislation, the time span until the year 2015 gives an opportunity to work proactively to obtain future sustainable production systems for car disassembly...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. college {{textbook}} {{market is}} in the midst of a seismic shift: publishers are creating new products, students are demanding more sophisticated digital content and instructors are just beginning to experiment with easily customizable, low-cost "open" textbooks. Although this industry has been picking up digital content in various forms for decades, their main revenue driver has always been print titles, a basic business fact that is poised to change permanently by 2020. The ongoing changes in product, <b>profitability</b> and market <b>expectations</b> drive home the importance of digital asset pricing in the textbook market. Textbook publishers are now grappling with the challenge of developing untested products at uncertain costs in ambiguous markets while their bread-and-butter print sales are expected to decline, and overall profit margins rapidly shifting below their feet. Changes in this market-both at the supplier and consumer level-can affect educational quality worldwide. Recognizing this fact, this thesis explores the conditions of the textbook market, both historically and in the present day, and the implications of certain market changes over the course of time. It also examines current pricing trends for digital assets based around single "source" textbook products (complete e-textbooks compared to their print-version counterparts). Using this information, with an eye on changing adoption trends and a focus on revenue management, it offers pricing and product recommendations to help publishers think ahead about how to maximize revenue over a product's life cycle as digital goods approach and eventually usurp new print sales. by Katherine Molina.

50|$|Capitalist firms {{typically}} face coordination {{problems in}} their productive operations. While firms in LMEs turn to market institutions to solve these problems, firms in CMEs turn to non-market institutions. The term 'coordinated' is thus stated {{with respect to the}} strategic interaction between capitalist firms and non-market institutions. For instance, firms in CMEs typically coordinate with labour unions to bargain wages at the industry or national level, rather than at the firm or plant level as is typical in LMEs. There is also stronger inter-firm relations in CMEs, with dense networks of interaction (for example, through employer associations) and greater inter-firm collaboration (e.g. greater collaborative research and development). Additionally, CMEs generally have specific skills regimes, as opposed to general skills regimes of their LME counterparts - {{as a result of a}} greater emphasis on vocational education and training (and complementary state social policy targeted at facilitating individual investment in specific skills). For CMEs, employee relations are more oriented towards long-term employment contracting, as opposed to the high degrees of labour 'flexibility' associated with LMEs that enable employers to fire workers more easily than in CMEs. Lastly, the corporate governance structure in CMEs is different to that of LMEs. While LME firms rely more on equity-financing (and thus LMEs have relatively larger stock markets in proportion to their economies) which is associated with more focus on current firm <b>profitability</b> and shorter-term <b>expectations,</b> CME firms rely more on credit-financing through dense professional and business networks with strong trust levels that have a more long-term focus. This enables CME firms to be able to keep labour costs stable during economic shocks by sacrificing some profitability; whereas LME firms tend to suppress labour costs to maintain current profitability so as not to lose finance from short-term focused financiers.|$|R
40|$|Public notion usually {{attributes}} superior {{qualities to}} foreign direct investments in transition economies. According {{to a common}} belief they are equipped with modern technology, possess up-to-date managerial capacities, use state-of-the-art management practices, are more effective than local companies and show better financial performances. These qualities clearly distinguish foreign ventures from domestic ones. There is an empirical evidence that proves existence of these differences. Still, what applies to foreign investments in general is not necessarily applicable to all ventures, to all types and groups of foreign-owned companies. Up till now {{little attention has been}} paid to FDI in small business. A question automatically rises: are small foreign ventures in the same advantageous position as their large multinational counterparts? Obviously, there must be substantial differences, since small companies do not possess those scale and scope advantages that multinational companies do. The single most important result of this research was the discovery of similarities between domestic and foreign-owned small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in five transition economies. General hypotheses (based on surveys of primarily big business) of FDIs operation were not supported. Performance measures, capitalization, the evaluation of obstacles of growth and business environment, possibilities of obtaining bank loans were in most cases very similar for domestic and foreign SMEs. A possible explanation of this is that foreign SMEs behave more like domestic SMEs than like big foreign (multinational) businesses. Registration and licensing as a barrier to entry affected domestic and foreign firms similarly, basically posing no serious problem for them. Those areas where business was negatively affected were identical for domestic and foreign firms: high taxes and social security payments, lack of transparency and frequent changes of economic regulations. Capitalization of foreign ventures was not usually higher than that of domestic ones. Major differences were found only in the source structure of capital. Not surprisingly, foreign suppliers' commercial credits as well as mother companies' capital transfers played a significant role in the case of FDIs. Interestingly, the share of bank credits was very low in all countries in the finance of all types of capital needs. <b>Profitability</b> and growth <b>expectations</b> of FDIs were not especially outstanding compared to expectations, either.
