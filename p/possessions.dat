40|$|<b>Possession</b> is {{prima facie}} {{evidence}} of ownership. <b>Possession</b> is ninetents of the law, means that <b>possession</b> is good against all other, except the true owner. The <b>possession</b> ripens into ownership if it is qualified and by effluxion of time. In Serbian law {{there are two kinds}} of adverse <b>possession</b> ripens into ownership. The first one is named ordinary and second one extraordinary adverse <b>possession.</b> Ordinary <b>possession</b> need to be legal, conscientious and genuine. Extraordinary <b>possession</b> is only conscientious, but in a wide sense. Adverse <b>possession</b> destroys the title of the owner and vests it in possessor. An occupation of land inconsistent with the right of the true owner: the <b>possession</b> of those against whom a right action has accured to the true owner. It is actual <b>possession</b> in the absence of <b>possession</b> by the rightful owner and without lawful title. If the adverse <b>possession</b> continues, the effect at the expiration of the prescribed period is that not only the remedy but the title of former owner is extinguished. The person in adverse <b>possession</b> gains a new possessory title which cannot, normally exceed in extent of duration the interest of the former owner...|$|R
40|$|<b>Possession</b> is {{a notion}} which seems simple at first, but is semantically complex at closer inspection. At its simplest, <b>possession</b> is the {{relation}} between a possessor and a possessed item, the possessum. The central type of relation {{seems to be one}} of ownership (permanent <b>possession),</b> but part-whole (inalienable <b>possession),</b> abstract <b>possession,</b> and other relations also fall under the domain of <b>possession</b> (Herslund & Baron 2001 : 11) ...|$|R
5000|$|In certain cases, the <b>possession</b> {{does not}} need to be actual <b>possession,</b> but may be {{constructive}} <b>possession.</b> For example, <b>possession</b> of a document of title will often suffice where it is not possible to possess the goods. [...] In many legal systems, there may also be constructive <b>possession</b> by attornment.|$|R

50|$|Obligatory <b>possession</b> is {{sometimes}} called inalienable <b>possession.</b> Inalienable <b>possession</b> is a semantic notion, i.e., largely dependent on the way a culture structures the world, while obligatory <b>possession</b> is a property of morphemes. In general, nouns with the property of requiring obligatorily <b>possession</b> are notionally inalienably possessed, but the fit is rarely, if ever perfect.|$|R
25|$|Alienability {{can only}} be {{expressed}} in attributive <b>possession</b> constructions, not in predicative <b>possession.</b> Attributive <b>possession</b> {{is a type of}} <b>possession</b> in which the possessor and possessee form a phrase. This contrasts to predicative <b>possession</b> constructions, in which the possessor and possessee are part of a clause and the verb affirms the possessive relationship. The examples in (21) express the same alienable relationship between possessor and possessee, but illustrate the difference between attributive and predicative <b>possession.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{common law}} countries, <b>possession</b> {{is itself a}} {{property}} right. The owner of a property has the right of <b>possession</b> and may assign that right wholly or partially to another who may then also assign the right of <b>possession</b> to a third party. For example, an owner of residential property may assign the right of <b>possession</b> to a property manager under a property management contract who may then assign the right of <b>possession</b> to a tenant under a rental agreement. There is a rebuttable presumption that the possessor of property also has the right of <b>possession,</b> and {{evidence to the contrary}} may be offered to establish who has the legal right of <b>possession</b> to determine who should have actual <b>possession,</b> which may include evidence of ownership (without assignment of the right of <b>possession)</b> or evidence of a superior right of <b>possession</b> without ownership. <b>Possession</b> of a thing for long enough can become ownership by termination of the previous owner's right of <b>possession</b> and ownership rights. In the same way, the passage of time can bring to an end the owner's right to recover exclusive <b>possession</b> of a property without losing the ownership of it, as when an adverse easement for use is granted by a court.|$|R

25|$|In {{inalienable}} <b>possession</b> constructions, {{the relationship}} between the possessor and possesee is stronger than in alienable <b>possession</b> constructions. Johanna Nichols characterizes this through the tendency of inalienable <b>possession</b> to be head-marked but alienable <b>possession</b> to be dependent-marked. In head-marking, the head of an inalienable <b>possession</b> construction (the possessed noun) is marked, whereas in dependent-marking, the dependent (the possessor noun) is marked.|$|R

Illegal <b>possession</b> of lock picks is generally prosecuted as a felony under the category of <b>possession</b> of burglary tools or similar statutes. In many states, simple <b>possession</b> is completely legal as their statutes require proof of intent.|$|R

5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's <b>possessions,</b> and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and <b>possessions</b> of the abbey was useful if those <b>possessions</b> needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it will be}} {{discussed}} the legal significance and protection of <b>possession</b> in the Republic of Macedonia. Below it will be listed the kinds of <b>possession,</b> and finally the rules for <b>possession</b> termination will be explained. The <b>possession</b> is an indicator {{that the person who}} rules one item is also a right holder of that item. The <b>possession</b> itself occurs in two types specially authorized by a law and pure factual power behind which stands no right. The <b>possession</b> enjoys legal protection. Below in the paper it is processed the judicial protection of the <b>possession</b> which is given based on complaint for disturbance of <b>possession</b> and action to recover the <b>possession.</b> The important thing at the judicial protection is that the rulers’ protection is given to the last actual <b>possession</b> of the item, but it is not disputed the right of <b>possession.</b> Further in this paper it is included the protection of indirect <b>possession</b> where a complaint can be made by the indirect holder of the item, the judicial protection of possessory, <b>possession</b> protection of the heirs and permitted self – help for unauthorized harassment and revoking of the <b>possession.</b> With respect to the termination of the actual power of the item, listed and processed are the ways when the item failed, when the item was lost, when it is obvious that it won’t be returned, when the ruler had freely left it and when the item is not taken from him and the ruler hasn’t realized the right to <b>possession.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Possession</b> can be {{obtained}} by a one-sided act by which factual control is established. This can take the form of apprehension (taking an object not in someone's <b>possession)</b> or seizure (taking an object in someone's <b>possession).</b> It can also {{be obtained}} through a two-sided process of handing over the <b>possession</b> from one party to another. The party handing over <b>possession</b> must intend to do so.|$|R
50|$|<b>Possession</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} concepts in property law. There are three related and overlapping but not identical legal concepts: <b>possession,</b> right of <b>possession</b> and ownership.|$|R
