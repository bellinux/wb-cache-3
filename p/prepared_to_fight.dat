5|$|At the time, when {{almost all}} parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory {{position}} toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS {{was the only}} political force that was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence {{in order to achieve}} that goal.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that they were <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
5|$|Dunsterforce {{fought in}} Mesopotamia {{in an attempt}} to keep the Turks and the Bolsheviks out of Persia and Transcaucasia by {{rearming}} and leading those elements of the old Russian imperial army that were still <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> following its collapse. The mission was set up by Major General Lionel Dunsterville in 1918 with the purpose of organising the forces of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic comprising—Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia—to enable them to withstand a Turkish attack. Their task was often impeded by civil war, however, and in May 1918, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia separately declared their independence. Dunsterforce assumed a more direct military role when Baku was threatened by Turkish attack at the Battle of Baku. In August 1918 it was reinforced by about 1,000 British infantry and occupied the town to prevent the port and nearby oil-fields from falling. Despite initial success Baku was evacuated the following month, due to the vastly superior numbers of the Turkish force. The British returned after the armistice, however, and remained as an occupying force until September 1919. 48 Australian officers and NCOs were attached to Dunsterforce.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 1944, American, British and Canadian forces {{established}} a western front with the D-Day landings in Normandy. On 20 July 1944, Hitler narrowly survived a bomb attack. He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000arrests and {{the execution of}} more than 4,900people. The failed Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944– 25 January 1945) was the last major German campaign of the war as Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his repeated insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the closing months of the war. Through his Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack, Hitler ordered that anyone who was not <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> should be summarily court-martialed {{and thousands of people}} were put to death. In many areas, people looked for ways to surrender to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue the struggle. Hitler also ordered the intentional destruction of transport, bridges, industries and other infrastructure—a scorched earth decree—but Armaments Minister Albert Speer was able to keep this order from being fully carried out.|$|E
5|$|The French force left Castellfollit 9 March on the evening, passed at some {{distance}} from Olot and {{spent the night at}} the palanca de Cudella, a ford on the Fluvià river. At dawn, some peasants and miquelets discovered them and sent a warning to Sant Esteve d'en Bas. Women and children sought shelter in the surrounding mountains, while the men <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> off the French column. They also called for help Ramon de Sala i Saçala, who was at the nearby village of Sant Feliu de Pallerols, with Captains Josep Mas de Roda and Pere Baliart i Teula, recruiting men to raise three new companies of miquelets. In the meantime, Juigné reached la Vall d'en Bas–the Bas valley–, leaving a rearguard at El Mallol, and took positions on the hill of Puigpardines. From there, he dispatched a third of his force to burn Sant Esteve. The French troops had burned 16 buildings when Ramon de Sala ahead 8 companies of miquelets and Pere Baliart leading 8 others arrived to the village and forced them to flee to Juigné's position.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} ravine, <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight.</b> Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E

5|$|When William Rufus became king of England {{after his}} father's death, Malcolm did not {{intervene}} in the rebellions by supporters of Robert Curthose which followed. In 1091, William Rufus confiscated Edgar Ætheling's lands in England, and Edgar fled north to Scotland. In May, Malcolm marched south, not to raid and take slaves and plunder, but to besiege Newcastle, built by Robert Curthose in 1080. This {{appears to have been}} an attempt to advance the frontier south from the River Tweed to the River Tees. The threat was enough to bring the English king back from Normandy, where he had been fighting Robert Curthose. In September, learning of William Rufus's approaching army, Malcolm withdrew north and the English followed. Unlike in 1072, Malcolm was <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight,</b> but a peace was arranged by Edgar Ætheling and Robert Curthose whereby Malcolm again acknowledged the overlordship of the English king.|$|E
5|$|In {{the return}} game at Hampden Park, Scotland {{had found the}} {{physical}} presence of Welsh striker Mark Hughes difficult to contain – {{it had been a}} challenge from Hughes on defender Alex McLeish that had allowed Ian Rush to score the winner in that game. So, Stein had set his team up with a line of five defenders at the back; this allowed Richard Gough to remain close to Hughes, with McLeish, Roy Aitken, Maurice Malpas and Willie Miller providing defensive cover. The game began at a furious pace, with both teams <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> hard; after only two minutes, Hughes made a heavy tackle on McLeish that incensed the Scotland players, while only a minute later McLeish was booked for a challenge on Rush. However, despite the defensive line employed by Scotland, they were unable to prevent Wales taking the lead after thirteen minutes, when Peter Nicholas made a low cross, despite the attention of both Aitken and Steve Nicol, for Hughes to score past goalkeeper Jim Leighton. Wales almost scored again in the twentieth minute when Joey Jones crossed for Robbie James, whose header went just over the bar. In the 38th minute, a Welsh free kick was blocked twice by Leighton, with the second falling at the feet of Hughes, whose shot went just wide. Then, just before half-time, Leighton misjudged the flight of a cross that caused the ball to drop again to Hughes; the Scottish keeper prevented Wales scoring a second by diving at Hughes' feet.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III {{had tried}} to secure {{territorial}} concessions from both sides {{before and after the}} Austro-Prussian War, but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations, he ended up with nothing. He then hoped that Austria would join in a war of revenge and that its former allies—particularly the southern German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria—would join in the cause. This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily—if not happily—to fight against France. Instead of a war of revenge against Prussia, supported by various German allies, France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own. The reorganization of the military by von Roon and the operational strategy of Moltke combined against France to great effect. The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French, and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points—reminiscent of Napoleon I's strategies seventy years earlier—overwhelmed French mobilization. Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid, Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight,</b> whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones. After a number of battles, notably Spicheren, Wörth, Mars la Tour, and Gravelotte, the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of Metz and the French capital of Paris. They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at Sedan on 1 September 1870.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival in}} Scotland much {{time was spent}} {{gathering}} Scottish troops together for the campaign on England and the French were delayed for some months collecting supplies. The army thus did not move south until July, ravaging villages and farms {{in the region of}} the River Tweed before besieging Wark Castle and burning it to the ground. The allied army then continued south through Northumberland and there burnt villages, towns, farms and castles across their line of advance in a large chevauchée. The English responded with an army led by King Richard II which advanced against the allied force and offered battle. The French <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> but their Scots allies retreated, leaving the French exposed, and they were consequently forced to retreat as well. Outside Edinburgh the Scottish army dispersed and the inhabitants of the city fled north, leaving the French alone in the city. Realising that his force was outnumbered and without food or help, Vienne took the army south, rounding the English {{on the night of the}} 10 August and reentering Northumberland for further looting, attacking Carlisle but being unable to break through its walls. As the Franco-Scottish army returned northwards it was attacked by an army under Henry Percy which destroyed the army's wagon train and took many prisoners. When the defeated French returned to Edinburgh the Scots refused to provision the French army and many men died of disease or starvation. Late in the year the French army boarded ship and returned to Flanders, bankrupt and defeated.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{believed}} that by pressing ahead to Lake Petén Itzá they would {{link up with}} a simultaneous expedition headed by President Barrios himself, unaware that Barrios had not reached the region. Díaz de Velasco sent out a scouting party of 50 musketeers accompanied by native archers on 6 April. They soon found evidence of recent Itza camps in the area, estimated to be a month old. The scouts found a clear road heading north to the Itza kingdom, and the army set off along it. The main force camped about ten leagues (26miles or 42km) south of the lake, while a smaller scouting party was sent off ahead; this consisted of two Spanish soldiers, two archers and two muleteers from Verapaz, with two Ch'ol-speaking native interpreters. The scouting party advanced to the savannah just {{to the south of}} Lake Petén Itzá, where they encountered about 30 Itza hunters armed with spears, shields and bows, accompanied by hunting dogs. The hunters drew their weapons and <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight,</b> but the Mopan interpreter was instructed to explain that the Spanish party were traders who came in peace, accompanied by missionaries. The Spanish began to suspect that the interpreter was plotting against them with the Itza hunters, and one of the Verapaz archers dragged him out from among the hunters. The encounter degenerated into a scuffle, and the Itzas once again drew weapons. The Spanish fired their muskets, fatally wounding two hunters, and a Verapaz Indian charged the Itzas with a machete. The hunters fled, leaving the scouting party in possession of the food and arrows at the hunting camp.|$|E
5|$|With only 30 minutes {{remaining}} {{before the}} ship is destroyed, Kirk considers transporting the entire crew to Caliban so they can survive. Scotty discovers Sulu's original transporter pattern, from when the warbird was destroyed. He theorizes that he could re-integrate it into the older version, resetting his memories {{so that he could}} remember the Romulan information and allowing him to pilot the Enterprise to safety but causing him to forget his 30 years on Caliban. Alana reassures him that she'll remind him of the man he became, but McCoy and Spock agree that leaving the rift will cause the death of Alana. Sulu draws his sword and is <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> to save his daughter, but she talks him down. He strides onto the transporter pad and demands they reintegrate his pattern. As he is merged once again, Alana quotes The Tempest. The younger version of Sulu is taken to the bridge and pilots the Enterprise from the anomaly with seconds to spare, with Alana ceasing to exist as he does so. Back on the Excelsior, Captain Sulu meets with the shuttle passengers in his ready room; his daughter Demora (Mimi Chong) and is introduced to his baby granddaughter, Alana.|$|E
