40|$|The Eocene {{sequence}} {{along the}} central part of the SE margin of the Tertiary Ebro Basin (Igualada area) consists of alternating marine and non-marine deposits up to 2000 m thick. Non-marine conditions persisted through the Cuisian-early Bartonian (early-middle Eocene) and resulted in the deposition of the <b>Pontils</b> Group (up to 900 m thick). During the late Bartonian-early Priabonian (late Eocene), marine environments prevailed in this area, leading to the deposition of the Santa Maria Group. Paleoenvironmental interpretations of the <b>Pontils</b> Group were obtained from sedimentology data of an earlier study. The nonmarine environments recorded in this group are: alluvial fans, flood plains, mudflats, playa-lakes, and shallow freshwater lakes. X-ray diffraction, TEM, SEM, EDX, and chemical analyses of mudstones and marls from the <b>Pontils</b> Group indicate that the diverse environments also can be distinguished from one another on the basis of the clay-mineral content. Illite is present in all samples of the <b>Pontils</b> Group. Palygorskite, with minor amounts of illite and sometimes chlorite, is the dominant clay mineral in flood plain and mud flat sediments. Palygorskite is also predominant in sabkha, playa-lake and carbonate lagoonal sediments. This clay mineral is absent in sediments from fresh, organic-rich lakes. Kaolinite is relatively abundant in mudstones from the organic-rich lakes. Smectite is relatively abundant in the sediments from subaqueous environments but is almost always absent from the sediments which were subjected to subaerial exposure and water-table oscillations such as flood plain and mudflat deposits. According to these clay-mineral distribution trends, the organic-rich lacustrine, lagoonal, and marine sediments preserve the detrital clay-minerals. The original detrital assemblages were mostly formed by illite, associated with chlorite, kaolinite and subordinate smectite. In the environments which underwent repeated flooding and desiccation, chlorite and smectite were eventually eliminated and palygorskite was formed. Microscopic observation suggests that palygorskite was formed in mudflats and floodplains mainly by the transformation of smectite and/or illite in a Mg-rich environment. In the sabkha facies, the abundance of palygorskite, frequently associated with smectite, dolomite, and chert, suggests palygorskite neoformation in a Si- and Mg-rich environment. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Paleogene {{sedimentary}} {{record in}} the <b>Pontils</b> area (SE sector of the Ebro Basin) consists of a ~ 2000 -m-thick sequence formed by the Mediona Fm, the Orpí Fm, the <b>Pontils</b> Gp, the Santa Maria Gp and the Sant Miquel de Montclar Conglomerates. The age of these materials is loosely constrained based on stratigraphic relationships with marine sediments and punctual mammal fossils and charophyte assemblages within the continental materials. In order to precise their chronology, a magnetostratigraphic section up to 1500 -m-thick in the Pontils-Sant Miquel de Montclar area has been studied and correlated to the Global Polarity Time Scale. From this correlation {{the age of the}} <b>Pontils</b> Gp is established in Lutetian to middle Bartonian, the Collbàs Fm would be middle Bartonian and the overlying Sant Miquel Conglomerates would range from Bartonian to Priabonian. This new chronology has been integrated with recent magneto- and biostratigraphic studies in more northeasterly sectors of the SE margin of the Ebro Basin (Igualada and Montserrat areas). This new and continuous chronological framework is essential to unravel and quantify the rates of change in the Ebro Basin-Catalan Coastal Ranges system.

50|$|Peire was {{descended from}} a Raymond Pelet {{who took part}} in the First Crusade. His father was Bernard Pelet, who died in September 1252, leaving his entire {{heritage}} to his eldest son, William, under the tutelage of Bernard de Barre, Guillaume de <b>Pontils,</b> and Jean de Bossoles. In 1253 William, with his tutors and his younger brothers, including Peire, received the homage of their father's vassals: Hugues de Melet, Pierre de Spinasson, and many others, in the presence of Pierre Gaucelin, Bérenger de la Fare, Arnaud d'Arsac, and Pierre Gaucelin de Follaquier. On the death of William without heirs Peire succeeded him. He married Delfina sometime before April 1276, when her brother released a sum of money left her by their father, Henry I: a hundred marks of silver or 5,000 sols tournois.|$|R

This tomb would become a symbol for his dynastic claims as the last legacy of the Merovingians on the territory of Razès, left to remind the select few who have been initiated into these mysteries that the [...] "lost king", Dagobert II, would figuratively come back {{in the form of a}} hereditary pretender.|$|R

5000|$|Whether mold blown or free blown (both {{forms of}} mouth-blowing and {{considered}} hand made), most bottles produced before 1860-65 have a distinct scar on their base. This mark {{is the result}} of removing the <b>pontil</b> rod. Something which was temporarily fused to the base in order to handle them effectively while they were still exceedingly hot, as their necks and lips were being tooled at the glassworks. [...] The decades just prior to the absence of <b>pontil</b> rods from bottle-glass making were a time when endless variations pertaining to shape, size, style, color and embossing were being produced regularly in an unprecedented quantity.

5000|$|In glassblowing, {{the term}} {{blowpipe}} {{refers to a}} pipe used to blow a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass, {{as the first step}} in the creation of hand-blown glass bottles and bowls. By the end of the first century, the two primary glassblowing tools were the iron blowpipe and <b>pontil.</b> [...] Glassblowing blowpipes are long enough to keep the gather of molten glass at a safe distance from the glassblower, and rigid enough to support the weight of the glass when the pipe is held horizontally.|$|E

These are known as smooth base bottles and are sometimes found in privies which were in use after the 1860s and {{as late as the}} 1880s. Visually, the difference between an early smooth base and a pontiled example of exactly the same bottle is insignificant but to a collector it often means everything. Rare early smooth base bottles can occasionally be as valuable as rare pontiled bottles but statistically they are unlikely to be discovered with any regularity on average privy digs.|$|E

50|$|Art Nouveau, {{also known}} as New Art, was a trend in Europe and the United States that lasted around 20 years {{beginning}} around 1890, inspiring applied arts, crafts, and design in particular.

Nancy artists advanced the technique of glass crafts from the pipe blowing craft work (<b>Pontil)</b> to more sophisticated artistic methods of color-glass layering, in-laying, sculpting, engraving, and etching. The innovative styles and techniques enabled them to express their advocating of nature as the primary source of inspiration. The Yumin Art Nouveau Collection exhibits the works of leading French Art Nouveau artists including Emile Gallé, Daum, Eugène Michel, René and Lalique.|$|E
5000|$|Mercury glass (or silvered glass) is {{glass that}} was blown double walled, then silvered between the layers with a liquid {{silvering}} solution, and sealed. Although mercury was originally {{used to provide}} the reflective coating for mirrors, elemental mercury was never used to create tableware. Silvered glass was free-blown, then silvered with a solution containing silver nitrate and grape sugar in solution, heated, then closed. Sealing methods include metal discs covered with a glass round or a cork inserted into the unpolished <b>pontil</b> scar. [...] "Mercury" [...] silvered glass was produced originally from around 1840 until at least 1930 in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), Germany and also manufactured in England from 1849 to 1855.

The English examples were often cased {{with a layer of}} colored glass then cut to silver as illustrated in the photograph.|$|E
30|$|The {{decorated}} blank {{was fired}} to adhere the gilding and fuse the enamels. Although the softening temperatures of the enamels differ {{due to their}} varying lead contents, Mamluk glassmakers likely applied all colors together, affixing them with a single firing. The complex <b>pontil</b> mark visible {{on the bottom of}} the vessel indicates that a <b>pontil</b> was reattached to the decorated vessel to reintroduce the object into the furnace, technology consistent with Mamluk manufacture, as opposed to stationary kiln firing not practiced until the 19 th century. The apparent double, but not triple or quadruple, <b>pontil</b> mark on the Brooklyn Museum lamp supports the hypothesis that all decorative materials were simultaneously fired. Evidenced in the enamel samples analyzed, the lamp’s red and white enamels are intimately mixed despite their differing lead contents, suggesting that these “hard” and “soft” enamels were fired together. The occurrences of decorative material contaminants in the enamels, such as the tin-rich and iron-rich inclusions identified in the blue enamel and the lazurite particle in the white enamel, also suggest simultaneous application and firing of the various decorative materials.|$|E

30|$|Measuring {{approximately}} 29  cm {{in height}} and 19  cm in diameter at its maximum dimensions, the lamp in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection (Fig.  1 a) is of relatively small size {{as compared to}} many Mamluk mosque lamps [1].

The bulk glass of the lamp’s body comprises many small bubbles and granular inclusions, as well as large and elongated bubbles. Subtle concentric circular ridges mark the vessel’s underside, intimating the object’s free-blown manufacture.

30|$|Current {{observations}} also {{inform the}} discussion regarding the lamp’s production date, {{as well as}} the relationship of the foot {{to the rest of the}} vessel. The double <b>pontil</b> mark visible on the base of this lamp is characteristic of vessels reintroduced into the furnace on a <b>pontil</b> rod to fuse gilding and enamels, a technology consistent with Mamluk production, as opposed to kiln-firing of enamels, a technique not practiced until the 19 th century [19]. Although both edges have been partially ground down, the broken edges of the body do not meet or match those of the foot; the diameter of the body’s broken edge fits entirely within that of the foot. As compared to other Mamluk era lamps, the foot seems disproportionate to the body. Additionally as opposed to the enamels decorating the lamp’s body, red and gold-colored paints, cold-applied and unfired, decorate the top edge of the foot, perhaps an attempt to visually integrate these two sections of the object and to cover an adhesive repair. The date of the paint application is, however, unknown.|$|E

Our methods provide {{a natural extension of}} Manifold Regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) algorithms to also exploit output inter-dependencies while enforcing smoothness with respect to input data geometry. We propose a class of matrix-valued kernels which allow efficient implementations of our algorithms via the use of numerical solvers for Sylvester matrix equations. On multilabel image annotation and text classification problems, we find favorable empirical comparisons against several competing alternatives. 1...|$|E
