5|$|In 1991, {{two people}} were {{interested}} in buying the track: Fred Weisman, a California businessman, and former National Football League player Mark May. Weisman out-bid May and purchased Rosecroft out of bankruptcy for $18.2 million. On November 23 of the same year, the grandstand caught fire {{a few hours before}} live racing began. In Weisman's first full season of operations, Rosecroft experienced a 10.5 <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> handle and an 8.3 <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> attendance. In 1992, Western Hanover, the richest horse of that year, won two of the three Triple Crown races, including the Messenger Stakes at Rosecroft. Rosecroft Raceway went into the record books on October 10, 1992, when a three-horse dead heat occurred in the seventh race. It was the 17th time in harness-racing history and the first time in Maryland history.|$|E

40|$|Two {{numerical}} {{cloud seeding}} simulation experiments of 5 -, 8 - and 10 -years duration, {{with a double}} area cross-over design and area randomization, were performed using historic rainfall data for the Deccan plateau region in Maharashtra state. The first numerical experiment (EXP-TR) used the simulation technique of Twomey and Roberstson (1973), second (EXP-MMM) used different simulation technique proposed in the present study. The results of the two numerical experiments have agreed closely. The EXP-MMM technique not only reduces com-putational time by {{an order of magnitude}} but also defines the exact lower limit for the double ration value which can be detected at 5 per cent level of significance.

40|$|Objective(s) In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} aqueous-ethanolic extract from Rosa damascena on heart rate and {{contractility}} were examined. Materials and Methods Isolated guinea-pig hearts were perfused through aorta in a Langendorff mode. Heart rate (HR) and contractility were determined {{in the presence of}} four concentrations of the extract (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 and 1. 0 mg %) and isoprenaline (1, 10, 100 nM and 1 µM) in comparison with baseline values in the presence and absence of propranolol (n = 10 for each group).

The <b>percent</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> HR due to the final concentration of isoprenaline in the absence of propranolol was significantly greater than that of the extract (P< 0. 01).

The approach is to introduce the vibration of received video quality into the QoS metric and make the receivers more negative in subscribing higher layers when bandwidth increases.

Simulated experiments on NS- 2 {{have been carried out}} to validate the algorithm. The result shows an improvement of 6. 8 <b>percents</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> received data rate and 6. 0 percents decrease in data loss rate. ...|$|R

5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> admissions, but a large reduction in revenues.

5|$|Weapons {{upgrades}} {{include the}} 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU), which gives a 66 <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> weapons payload using a digital interface and rotary launcher. IWBU {{is expected to}} cost roughly $313 million. The 1760 IWBU will allow the B-52 to carry the AGM-158B JASSM-ER cruise missile and the ADM-160C MALD-J decoy missile. All 1760 IWBUs should be operational by October 2017. Two bombers will {{have the ability to}} carry 40 weapons in place of the 36 that three B-52s can carry. The 1760 IWBU allows precision-guided missiles or bombs to be deployed from inside the weapons bay; previous aircraft carried these munitions externally on wing hardpoints. This increases the number of guided weapons a B-52 can carry and reduces the need for guided bombs to be carried on the wings. The first phase will allow a B-52 to carry twenty-four 500-pound guided JDAM bombs or twenty 2,000-pound JDAMs, with later phases accommodating the JASSM and MALD family of missiles. In addition to carrying more smart bombs, moving them internally from the wings reduces drag and achieves a 15 percent reduction in fuel consumption.|$|E
