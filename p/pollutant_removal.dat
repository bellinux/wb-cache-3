One {{of the core}} objectives of Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) is to reduce quantity and pollutants from stormwater runoff. To ensure ESD several stormwater treatment systems have been proposed. Stormwater runoff quality (i. e. pollutants transport associated with stormwater) can be estimated with acceptable accuracy provided pollutants transport equations are established through extensive field measurements. MUSIC (Model of Urban Stormwater Improvement Conceptualisation) developed and widely used in Australia, estimates pollutant transport from catchments and stormwater treatment through different systems. MUSIC also provides life-cycle costing estimates for different treatment systems. This paper presents {{a study on the}} calibration of MUSIC for a controlled stormwater treatment facility in Melbourne. Calibrated model was then used for the cost optimisation of three different types of treatment systems: grass swale, bioretention system and porous pavement. For each treatment system, cost verses expected <b>pollutants</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency curves are presented for the treatments of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Phosphorus (TP) and Total Nitrogen (TN).

50|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Berkeley, Cottrell began consulting for the DuPont Company at its explosives- and acids-producing facility near Pinole, California, 20 {{miles north of the}} University. DuPont wanted {{to address the problem of}} precipitating the acid mists which form when sulfur trioxide is bubbled through water or dilute sulfuric acid. Using an electrical method similar to one envisioned by Sir Oliver Lodge in England, Cottrell began experimenting with electrostatic precipitation as a means of collecting sulfuric acid mists. The result of Cottrell’s work was the electrostatic precipitator, a device which could collect fly ash, dust and fumes, acid mists and fogs that spewed from turn-of-the century plants, and which became a primary means for controlling industrial air pollution. Cottrell made it work by developing a reliable high-voltage power supply and electrodes that permitted electrical energy to leak across a gas-filled chamber from many small points. In 1906, electric current was applied to a small laboratory device emitting sulfuric acid mist, and the concept became a reality. The first patent, No. 895,729, was issued on August 11, 1908. The electrostatic precipitator remains a principal technology for <b>pollutant</b> <b>removal</b> from industrial waste flows to this day.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is {{a dynamic}} rainfall-runoff-subsurface runoff {{simulation}} model used for single-event to long-term (continuous) simulation of the surface/subsurface hydrology quantity and quality from primarily urban/suburban areas. It can simulate the Rainfall- runoff, runoff, evaporation, infiltration and groundwater connection for roots, streets, grassed areas, rain gardens and ditches and pipes, for example. The hydrology component of SWMM operates on a collection of subcatchment areas divided into impervious and pervious areas with and without depression storage to predict runoff and pollutant loads from precipitation, evaporation and infiltration losses {{from each of the}} subcatchment. Besides, low impact development (LID) and best management practice areas on the subcatchment can be modeled to reduce the impervious and pervious runoff. The routing or hydraulics section of SWMM transports this water and possible associated water quality constituents through a system of closed pipes, open channels, storage/treatment devices, ponds, storages, pumps, orifices, weirs, outlets, outfalls and other regulators. SWMM tracks {{the quantity and quality of}} the flow generated within each subcatchment, and the flow rate, flow depth, and quality of water in each pipe and channel during a simulation period composed of multiple fixed or variable time steps. The water quality constituents such as water quality constituents can be simulated from buildup on the subcatchments through washoff to a hydraulic network with optional first order decay and linked <b>pollutant</b> <b>removal,</b> best management practice and low-impact development (LID) removal and treatment can be simulated at selected storage nodes.
