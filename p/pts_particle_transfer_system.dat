In the first method, the alumina support {{was added to}} the particle suspension and the microemulsion was subsequently destabilized by addition of tetrahydrofurane, whereby the particles were deposited on the alumina support. In the other method, the platinum nanoparticles were transferred to an aqueous solution were they were redispersed by a stabilizing surfactant prior to addition of the alumina support. The size of the microemulsion droplets and of the unsupported platinum particles was in the range of a few nanometers as measured by a dynamic light scattering technique (photon correlation spectroscopy). The size of the unsupported platinum nanoparticles and of the particles deposited on alumina was studied by transmission electron microscopy. Both methods for platinum particle deposition resulted in some degree of particle agglomeration, the first probably because of too-fast destabilization of the microemulsion and the second due to inefficient redispersion of the <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> when <b>transferred</b> to the aqueous phase.

The anodic current for the ethanol oxidation (iEtOH) that provides the electrocatalytic activity of the <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> was remarkably enhanced when the particles were dispersed on PANI films. The activity strongly depended on the morphology and the electrical conductivity of the five PANI films with different dopant anions: SO 42 -, NO 3 - and Cl-.

To reduce the dispersed amount of the expensive <b>Pt</b> <b>particles,</b> inexpensive base metal particles were pre-dispersed on the PANI film, and the <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> were then dispersed on the film.

On the other hand, <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> are easily redeposited at reverse current conditions {{created by the}} SU/SD [30]. Due to high equilibrium potential of dissolution, Pt ions tend to redeposit onto larger <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> in the cathode and thus undergo Ostwald ripening to minimize surface energy [37]. Hence, the increased average particle size from 4.71 to 6.41  nm (Fig.  9) and HR-TEM micrographs (Fig.  7) suggest that the particles experienced Ostwald ripening, migration/dissolution and redeposition. Zhao et al. noted that narrower XRD peaks indicate larger <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> [35]. The particle growth corresponds {{to the loss of}} ECSA (Fig.  6) and narrower XRD peaks (Fig.  8).

Among possible applications are catalytic materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. In the present review, recent efforts towards the fabrication of single atom catalysts on nanostructured ceria and their reactivity are discussed in the prospect of their employment as anode catalysts. The remarkable performance and the durability of the ceria-based anode catalysts with ultra-low Pt loading result from the interplay between two states associated with supported atomically dispersed Pt and sub-nanometer <b>Pt</b> <b>particles.</b> The occurrence of these two states is a consequence of strong interactions between Pt and nanostructured ceria that yield atomically dispersed species under oxidizing conditions and sub-nanometer <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> under reducing conditions. The square-planar arrangement of four O atoms on { 100 } nanoterraces has been identified as the key structural element {{on the surface of the}} nanostructured ceria where Pt is anchored in the form of Pt 2 + species. The conversion of Pt 2 + species to sub-nanometer <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> is triggered by a redox process involving Ce 3 + centers. The latter emerge due to either oxygen vacancies or adsorption of reducing agents. The unique properties of the sub-nanometer <b>Pt</b> <b>particles</b> arise from metal-support interactions involving charge transfer, structural flexibility, and spillover phenomena. The abundance of specific adsorption sites similar to those on { 100 } nanoterraces determines the ideal (maximum) Pt loading in Pt-CeOx films that still allows reversible switching between the atomically dispersed <b>Pt</b> and sub-nanometer <b>particles</b> yielding high activity and durability during fuel cell operation...|$|R
