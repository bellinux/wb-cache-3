40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, an {{open-source}} code called OpenFOAM has been becoming a promising CFD tool for multi-dimensional numerical simulations of internal combustion engines. The primary goal {{of the present study}} is to assess the feasibility of the code for computations of hollow-cone sprays discharged by an outward-opening <b>pintle-type</b> <b>injector</b> by simulating the experiments performed recently by Hemdal et al. (SAE 2009 - 01 - 1496) with gasoline and ethanol sprays under the following conditions: air temperature Tair= 295 or 350 K, air pressure pair= 6 bar, fuel temperature Tfuel= 243, or 295, or 320 K, and fuel injection pressure pinj= 50, or 125, or 200 bar. To simulate the experiments, a pintle injector model and the physical properties of gasoline were implemented in OpenFOAM. The flow field calculated using the pintle injector model is more realistic than that yielded by the default unit injector model normally used in OpenFOAM. Moreover, a number of modifications were made to the standard implementation of several spray models in OpenFOAM, with modifications in the implementation of the KHRT model having noticeable effects on the accuracy of the simulated liquid penetration and Sauter mean diameter (SMD). Results of numerous simulations performed by running OpenFOAM and activating various spray models indicate that (i) a combination of the Rosin-Rammler distribution with Reitz-Diwakar secondary breakup model and (ii) the KHRT model yield the best agreement between the measured and computed spray penetration length, with the latter model showing the best performance as far as the SMD obtained from high-pressure (200 bar) sprays is concerned...|$|E
40|$|Stringent {{regulations}} on the emission of pollutants, especially carbon dioxide (CO 2), necessitate {{the development of}} advanced combustion technologies. Gasoline direct injection (GDI) into the combustion chamber of a Spark Ignition (SI) engine is a combustion strategy that is widely recognized as having the potential to improve fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines for passenger cars. In particular, the CO 2 emissions of GDI engines could be 20 - 26 % {{lower than those of}} equivalent port-fuel injected (PFI) SI engines. Unfortunately, the development of combustion systems for GDI engines is very challenging because the creation of an appropriate combustion system is a major challenge because they require very precise formation of an ignitable fuel-air mixture with a steep stratification gradient right between the ignition electrodes to permit efficient operation under a wide range of operating conditions. CFD simulations are widely used to increase the efficiency of engine R&D. This thesis aimed at development of a tool for numerically modelling of working process in a GDI engine. The work had two main objectives. First, an available CFD code should be applied to multidimensional GDI engine simulations. Second, the code should be developed by implementing advanced models of stratified turbulent combustion, followed by validation against experimental data. As far as a code is concerned, although there are several mature commercial CFD packages on the market, there is also a need for less expensive software. Consequently, there is growing interests from both industry and academia in the OpenFOAM open source CFD code, whose source code is freely available so that users can implement and test new models without paying licence fees. However, it had not been used to simulate combustion in a GDI engine when the work reported herein was begun. This thesis presents an assessment of OpenFOAM as a tool for the numerically modelling of fuel injection, spray breakup, evaporation, mixture formation, and stratified turbulent burning in the combustion chamber of a GDI engine. OpenFOAM was used to simulate hollow-cone sprays of gasoline and ethanol discharged by a piezo-controlled <b>pintle-type</b> <b>injector.</b> The liquid properties of gasoline were implemented in the code to enable the simulation of gasoline sprays. In addition, the implementations of various spray breakup models such as LISA, TAB, Reitz-Diwakar, and KHRT into the standard OpenFOAM package were checked and modified in order to more closely reflect their descriptions in the original papers. Liquid penetration and SMD calculated by simulations using the revised model implementations were compared to experimental data provided by my colleagues. These comparisons showed that the best agreement between the experimental data and simulations was achieved when using a combination of the uniform droplet size and KHRT models. This model was therefore used in all subsequent engine simulations. As far as modelling is concerned, the code’s modelling capabilities were enhanced by implementing and developing models relevant to the turbulent burning of stratified gasoline-air mixtures at the elevated temperatures and pressures associated with combustion in a GDI engine. More specifically, two relevant issues were addressed. First, a semi-detailed chemical mechanism for the combustion of a gasoline surrogate in air was developed and validated. The gasoline surrogate consisted of iso-octane, toluene, and n-heptane in volumetric proportions of 55 %: 35 %: 10 %, respectively. The mechanism includes 120 species participating in 677 reactions. It was validated against experimental data on the ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds of different mixtures at a range of pressures and temperatures. The mechanism was then used to compute laminar flame speeds for gasoline-air mixtures at equivalence ratios of 0. 2 ≤ϕ≤ 2. 0, unburned gas temperatures of 298 ≤T_u≤ 800 K, and pressures of 1 ≤P≤ 30 atm. The results of these calculations were approximated and the approximations were implemented into OpenFOAM for subsequent CFD modelling of stratified turbulent combustion in a GDI engine. In order to study stratified burning in a GDI engine, the Flame Speed Closure (FSC) model of premixed turbulent combustion was combined with a so-called presumed Probability Density Function (PDF) method that made it possible to account for the influence of turbulent fluctuations in local mixture composition on the local burning rate. The combined model based on the FSC and presumed PDF approach was implemented into OpenFOAM and the roles played by its various submodels were investigated in a step-wise fashion. Finally, the so-extended code was used to simulate a GDI engine burning a globally lean mixture. Good agreement between results computed by me and experimental data provided by my colleagues was obtained. In addition, the model’s sensitivity was investigated...|$|E
40|$|The spray {{characteristics}} and spray stability from three prototype piezoelectric <b>pintle-type</b> <b>injectors</b> were investigated under different operating conditions in an optical direct injection engine designed for stratified combustion. The <b>pintle-type</b> outwards opening <b>injector</b> {{has the potential}} to address and overcome many of the typical problems related to close-spacing, spray-guided configurations owing to its hollow cone spray, exhibiting better air utilization than multihole sprays, with good penetration during early injection, and a spray angle almost independent of cylinder backpressure. The three prototype injectors have different nozzle exit geometries for optimization of spray stability under all engine operating conditions. The emerging fuel sprays for both single- and double-injection operation were visualized using Mie scattering and a high-speed CCD camera. The performance of the injectors was assessed by constructing mean and RMS images at different operating conditions of injection pressure, backpressure, injector needle lift, and engine speed. From these images, a spray angle analysis was performed by comparing the mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum cone angle under different operating conditions; the spray stability was quantified by analysing the mean and RMS images and the mean and RMS spray cone angles. Evaluation of the three prototypes has revealed that the positive-step inward seal band design produces the most robust spray angle ideally suited for stratified fuel/air mixture formation and combustion in spray-guided direct injection spark ignition (DISI) gasoline engines...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and {{introduction of new}} engine technologies are primarily motivated {{by the need to}} comply with increasingly stringent emissions legislation and to reduce fuel consumption. One of {{the most important of these}} new engine technologies is direct gasoline injection, which is considered to be an important and cost-effective measure to meet both targets. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and optical methods are important tools in the development of direct injection gasoline engines. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to develop models, methods, and a numerical platform for simulating the behavior of Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) engines using a variety of fuels, including gasoline-ethanol blends. One of the most important goals of this work was to devise improvements to OpenFOAM (a free, open source CFD package) that would increase its utility as a tool for studying SIDI engines, as there is strong industrial demand for inexpensive software. The work described in this thesis addressed two important problems relevant to modeling combustion in a DISI engine. First, to facilitate the simulation of turbulent burning and pollutant formation, a chemical mechanism for the combustion of gasoline-ethanol blends was refined and thoroughly validated under various conditions (equivalence ratios Φ, initial temperatures Tu, and pressures p). The gasoline surrogate used in this project was composed of iso-octane, toluene, and n-heptane in volumetric ratios of 55 %: 35 %: 10 %, respectively. The hydrogen to carbon ratio (the H/C ratio) of this blend is similar to that of gasoline, which is around 1. 87, as is its equivalence ratio; this is particularly important when studying DISI engines. The integrated mechanism for gasoline-ethanol blends features 120 species participating in 677 reactions and is suitable for use in CFD engine modeling. The mechanism was tested against experimental data on ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds, obtained for various n-heptane/iso-octane/toluene/ethanol-air mixtures under various equivalence ratios, initial temperatures, and pressures. Second, the gasoline and ethanol hollow cone sprays released by an outward-opening <b>pintle-type</b> piezo-controlled <b>injector</b> commonly associated with GDI engines were studied numerically, since accurate simulation of fuel-air mixing and the flow field is critical for subsequent combustion modeling. A pintle injector model was implemented into OpenFOAM in order to simulate the spray discharged by an outward-opening piezo injector. The flow field calculated using the pintle injector model is more realistic than that predicted by the default unit injector model normally used in OpenFOAM. A number of modifications were made to the standard spray submodels in OpenFOAM, including the LISA, TAB and Reitz-KHRT breakup models and the O'Rourke and Trajectory collision models. For instance, three different modified Reitz-KHRT models were implemented into OpenFOAM; these modifications were found to have noticeable effects on the accuracy of the simulated liquid penetration and SMD. Extensive sensitivity studies were carried out on the hollow cone sprays, focusing on the effects of varying the initial and boundary conditions, spray model constants, and other parameters. Validation studies showed that several combinations of spray submodels yield acceptable results in liquid penetration and SMD, including the combination of the Rosin-Rammler + Reitz-Diwakar models and that of the uniform droplet size + Reitz-KHRT models; the latter combination offered the best performance under the studied conditions...|$|R
