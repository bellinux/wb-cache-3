Atom then tells {{everyone that}} she <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> in Kahndaq, {{and that it was}} this that has been causing Superman's illness and loss of control of his powers. The Outsider comes out of the shadows to pick up the box. He tells the heroes that the box is not magic, but science, that was created on his world and can only be opened by someone from his world. He explains that the box opens a gateway to his homeworld, and that he and Atom arrived following the weakening of the barriers between the universes resulting from the Justice League's battle with Darkseid.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} with any {{certainty}} whether this symbol {{was placed in the}} marble floor at Wewelsburg before or during the National Socialist Regime. There remains speculation as to whether the symbol was placed in the hall by the Nazis or whether it was there previously but there is no definitive proof either way. The book sold by the Wewelsburg museum {{on the history of the}} castle from 1933 to 1945 makes no mention of who <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> The plans for the North Tower by SS architect Hermann Bartels make no mention of it. Scholars today are reluctant to say with any certainty why it was put there, or by whom.|$|E
25|$|From 1850 to 1854, Lee {{attended}} West Point. During {{his first}} year, Lee excelled both academically and militarily. Toward {{the end of}} his first year he was almost expelled, when alcohol was found in his room. He claimed that he did not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>there,</b> and got away with only minor punishments. He did well in his second year also. At the beginning of his third year, his father became the Superintendent of West Point. Lee graduated first in his class of forty-six, in 1854. Other members of his class included Major General J.E.B. Stuart, Major General William Dorsey Pender, Brigadier General John Pegram, Brigadier General James Deshler, Colonel and Acting Brigadier General Horace Randal, and Brigadier General John Villepigue.|$|E

500|$|Several {{weeks before}} the gold {{certification}} of Fillmore East and their rehabilitation, the band headed to Miami's Criteria Studios with producer Tom Dowd {{to work on their}} third studio album. The band first began recording the album one month prior, when they laid down the initial tracks for [...] "Blue Sky". The band saved money on studio time by writing and debuting songs on the road. The band worked on three songs: [...] "Blue Sky", an instrumental titled [...] "The Road to Calico" [...] (which would eventually develop into [...] "Stand Back", with added vocals) and [...] "Little Martha", the only song solely credited to Duane Allman. The band laid down these three songs and went back on the road for a short run of shows, and at this point several checked into rehab. After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road. Drummer Butch Trucks later said, [...] "We all had this thing in us and Duane <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>there.</b> He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out".|$|E

The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album. Completing the recording of Eat a Peach raised each member's spirits; [...] "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach," [...] said Allman. [...] "Those last three songs [...] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy—it was still the Allman Brothers Band." [...] Released in February 1972, Eat a Peach was the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. [...] "We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever," [...] said Gregg Allman.|$|E

2500|$|Few African {{states in}} the late nineteenth century were capable of fielding armies even {{remotely}} as large as those routinely assembled for war in Europe, and the same conditions that kept African populations small also militated against deployment of large European armies in Africa.

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} fools enter the synagogue, and seeing people occupying {{themselves}} with the law, ask how a person learns the law. They answer that first a person reads from children’s materials, then from the Torah, then from the Prophets ( [...] , Nevi'im), and then from the Writings ( [...] , Ketuvim). Then the person learns the Talmud, then the law ( [...] , halachah), and then the Midrash ( [...] , haggadot). Hearing this, fools ask themselves when they can learn all that, and turn to leave. Rabbi Jannai compared this to a loaf suspended in the air. The fool exclaims {{that no one can}} bring it down. But the wise person says that someone <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>there</b> and takes a ladder or stick and brings it down. So fools complain that they are unable to read all the law. But wise people learn a chapter every day until they read all the law. God said in [...] "it is not too hard for you," [...] but if you find it too hard, it is your own fault, because you do not study it.|$|E

So why not? We're going with our gut and <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> out <b>there.</b> <b>It's</b> just music, you know?" [...] Fairchild also stated that the band were working on a country album with Jay Joyce.|$|R

Ed Weatherby, son of Roy Weatherby says that the [...]270 Weatherby is his {{favorite}} caliber. As he <b>puts</b> <b>it,</b> <b>there</b> just isn't a better long-range deer caliber.
