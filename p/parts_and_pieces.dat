500|$|Several {{external}} features were redesigned for the movie, including {{the introduction of}} a movable mouth to allow for a more human character, and a four-pronged mechanical tongue to make them look less like dolls. Other characters used lights behind their masks to form mouth movement. Particular emphasis was placed on the eyebrows and lips of characters. The main change from the original models was the inclusion of hands, which was a necessity if the character performances were to be made realistic. Custom texture maps were created for each character so they would appear unique. In addition to reinventing old characters, the team created original character designs with Lego staff. Makuta, who had only been briefly glimpsed in the comics and web animations, was created through a [...] "Frankenstein principle", taking <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> from multiple Bionicle sets to create the ultimate Bionicle villain. Other original creations included Takua's pet crab Pewku, and a Gukko Bird designed to transport two Matoran. The Rahkshi are described by Bob Thompson as [...] "like hounds hunting down the [...] ". They were created by Swinnerton, and comic writer Alan Grant helped develop their characters. They were designed to appear more machine-like {{than the rest of the}} cast, and their design were strongly inspired by the bio-mechanical artworks of H. R. Giger.|$|E

2500|$|Today, many {{products}} are {{an outcome of}} a large number of <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> that come from many different countries, and that may then be assembled together in a third country. In these cases, it's hard to know exactly what is the country of origin, and different rules apply as to how to determine their [...] "correct" [...] country of origin. Generally, articles only change their country of origin if the work or material added to an article in the second country constitutes a substantial transformation, or, the article changes its name, tariff code, character or use (for instance from wheel to car). Value added in the second country may also be an issue.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the songs}} began as piano improvisations by Van Vliet. He would record {{extended}} improvisation sessions on a cassette recorder.

6000|$|Of course, this {{treatment}} {{in and of}} itself would appear too transparent, and would fail to inspire the patient with a proper confidence. But nowadays this element is supplied by the work of the analytical laboratory. Whatever is wrong with the patient, the doctor insists on snipping off <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> and extracts of him and sending them mysteriously away to be analysed. He cuts off a lock of the patient's hair, marks it, [...] "Mr. Smith's Hair, October, 1910." [...] Then he clips off {{the lower part of the}} ear, and wraps it in paper, and labels it, [...] "Part of Mr. Smith's Ear, October, 1910." [...] Then he looks the patient up and down, with the scissors in his hand, and if he sees any likely part of him he clips it off and wraps it up. Now this, oddly enough, is the very thing that fills the patient up with that sense of personal importance which is worth paying for. [...] "Yes," [...] says the bandaged patient, later in the day to a group of friends much impressed, [...] "the doctor thinks there may be a slight anaesthesia of the prognosis, but he's sent my ear to New York and my appendix to Baltimore and a lock of my hair to the editors of all the medical journals, and meantime I am to keep very quiet and not exert myself beyond drinking a hot Scotch with lemon and nutmeg every half-hour." [...] With that he sinks back faintly on his cushions, luxuriously happy.|$|E

By this, I say, must the soul, spirit, or life of Antichrist be taken away. But how shall Christ by this rod, sword, or spirit of his mouth, consume this wicked, this mystery of iniquity? Not by himself immediately, but by his spirit and word in his church; the which he will use, and so manage in this work, that they shall not rest till he by them has brought this beast to his grave. This beast is compared to the wild boar, and the beast {{that comes out of}} the wood to devour the church of God, (as we read in the book of Psalms: 80:13) But Christ, with the dogs that eat the crumbs of his table, will so hunt and scour him about, that albeit he may let out some of their bowels with the tushes of his chaps, yet they will not let him alone till they have his life: For the church shall single him out from all beasts, and so follow him with cries, and pinch him with their voices, that he alone shall perish by their means.4 Thus shall Christ consume and wear him out {{by the spirit}} of his mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of his coming ...|$|E

30|$|What is more, {{the future}} {{direction}} {{of this work}} includes the studies of discontinuous fractional-order systems due to the unique nature of these systems and effect of fractional parameter. On the other hand, these systems are usually used to model various problems in biological and engineering research. For instance, it was shown that the fractional-order systems occur as models in many applications, see [1, 2, 11, 20, 24]. The mathematical formulation of these examples leads naturally to theoretical and numerical analysis of fractional-order systems. Therefore, we will begin to develop a numerical method for integrating discontinuous fractional-order systems. This method {{is based on the}} integration of non-smooth <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>piecing</b> these <b>parts</b> together with appropriate transition conditions, also taking into account that phenomena of bifurcations between these parts can also occur.|$|R

50|$|Private <b>Parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pieces</b> is {{the third}} solo album from guitarist Anthony Phillips.

Although the album itself came at an awkward time for Phillips, whose contract with Arista had run its course, the non-commercial Private <b>Parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pieces</b> format proved successful or useful enough to him to become a series of albums in its own right.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Open {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) {{networks are}} being grossly abused by illegal distribution of copyrighted music, games, video streams, and popular software. These abuses are resulted {{from lack of}} proper peer authentication, modifiable file indices, and unauthorized file access in a P 2 P network. Peer collusion is {{a major source of}} illegal sharing of content files among clients and pirates. We propose a new copyright-protection scheme for P 2 P networks using enhanced chunking and hashing protocols. The idea is to use proactive content poisoning with token-based authorization to prevent pirates from downloading copyrighted files easily. Using identity-based signatures, our system distinguishes pirates from legitimate clients. The system distributes clean contents only to authorized clients. Pirates are detected with miss-matched keys and time-stamped tokens. Detected pirates receive only poisoned chunks, which corrupt the entire file. Detecting pirates or colluders produces some identity evidences against piracy. This will deter colluders from sharing clean contents with potential pirates. The pirates are penalized with intolerably long download time without success. This paper presents system architecture and enabling mechanisms for copyright protection on such trusted P 2 P networks. New detection and prevention techniques are presented. We test them in simulated P 2 P network families using hashing at the file, <b>part,</b> <b>and</b> <b>piece</b> levels. We developed a new peer authorization protocol (PAP) for this purpose. The system performs rather satisfactorily in P 2 P delivery of large content files. For an example to distribute a 700 -MB file, the system protects the Gnutella, KaZaA, and Lime Wire with above 99. 9 % success rate. The system secures the eMule network family including Shareaza o...|$|R

The setting features (i) ambiguity and ambiguity averse preferences, (ii) discontinuities in the asset price processes, with a general and possibly infinite activity jump part next to a continuous diffusion <b>part,</b> <b>and</b> (iii) general and possibly non-convex trading constraints. We characterize our solutions as solutions to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs). We prove existence and uniqueness of {{the solution to the}} general class of BSDEs with jumps having a drift (or driver) that grows at most quadratically, encompassing the solutions to our portfolio choice and valuation problems as special cases. We provide an explicit decomposition of the excess return on an asset into a risk premium and an ambiguity premium, and a further decomposition into a piece stemming from the diffusion <b>part</b> <b>and</b> a <b>piece</b> stemming from the jump part. We further compute our solutions in a few examples by numerically solving the corresponding BSDEs using regression techniques...|$|R
