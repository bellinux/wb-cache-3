Hunter, had quarreled with Davis and resigned and in March 1862, Benjamin was appointed as his replacement. Varina Davis noted that some in Congress had sought Benjamin's ouster [...] "because of reverses which {{no one could have}} averted, [...] the President promoted him to the State Department with a personal and aggrieved sense of injustice done to the man who had now become his friend and right hand." [...] Richmond diarist Sallie Ann Brock Putnam wrote, [...] "Mr. Benjamin was not forgiven... this act on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> , in defiance of public opinion, was considered as unwise, arbitrary, and a reckless risking of [...] his reputation and popularity... was ever afterwards unpopular in the Confederacy, and particularly in Virginia". Despite the promotion, the committee reported that any blame for the defeat at Roanoke Island should attach to Wise's superior, Major General Benjamin Huger, [...] "and the late secretary of war, J.P. Benjamin".|$|E

The House Republican Leader John Jacob Rhodes agreed with Scott, and Rhodes recommended that if Nixon’s position continued to deteriorate, he “ought to consider resigning as a possible option.” ...|$|E

Yekhanurov immediately denied the accusations and told journalists [...] "Decisions must be made every day. But, not to be busy with budget problems, they organize such shows as today". on May 26, 2009 President Yushchenko stated he had no intend to dismiss Yekhanurov claiming “there {{is nothing but a}} political attack and a staff war”. According to Yushchenko similar political attacks had been launched against the foreign minister, State Property Fund head, and the National Bank of Ukraine governor. The same day Yekhanurov threatened to sue Prime Minister Tymoshenko [...] "to defend his honor and dignity", if she did not apologize, and if Supervision and Revision Department head Mykola Syvulskiy did not resign. June 5, 2009 the Ukrainian parliament dismissed Yuriy Yekhanurov as defense minister. 363 MPs out of the 398 registered in the parliament's session hall voted for his dismissal, includeding 161 MPs of the Party of Regions, 152 MPs of the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko, four MPs of the Our Ukraine-People's Self-Defense Bloc, 27 MPs of the Communist Party, and 19 MPs of the Bloc of Lytvyn.

6000|$|But, my Lords, {{this was}} not the private opinion of Mr. Shore only, a man of great abilities, and intimately acquainted with the revenue, who must know when he was in a {{situation}} to do good and when not. The other gentleman whom I have mentioned, Mr. Hastings's confidant in everything but his bribes, and supposed to be in his closest secrets, is Mr. Anderson. I should remark to your Lordships, that Mr. Anderson is a man apparently of weak nerves, of modest and very guarded demeanor, as we have seen him in the House of Commons; it is in that way only I have the honor of knowing him. Mr. Anderson being asked whether he agreed in the opinion and admitted the truth of his friend Mr. Shore's statement relative to the dewan of the Committee, his answer was this: [...] "I do not think that I should have written it quite so strong, but I do in a great measure agree to it: that is, I think {{there is a great deal}} of truth in the observation; I think, in particular, that it would require great exertion in the Committee, and great abilities on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> to restrain effectually the conduct of the dewan; I think it would be difficult for the Committee to interpose a sufficient control to guard against all the abuses of the dewan." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{system of}} {{committees}} {{appears to me}} to be good as regards the work of legislation. It seems well adapted to effect economy of time and the application of special men to special services. But I am driven to think that that connection between the chairmen of the committees and the ministers which I have attempted to describe is an arrangement very imperfect in itself, but plainly indicating the necessity of some such close relation between the executive and the legislature of the United States as does exist in the political system of Great Britain. With us the Queen's minister has a greater weight in Parliament than the President's minister could hold in Congress, because the Queen is bound to employ a minister in whom the Parliament has confidence. As soon as such confidence ceases, the minister ceases to be minister. As the Crown has no politics of its own, it is simply necessary that the minister of the day should hold the politics of the people as testified by their representatives. The machinery of the President's government cannot be made to work after this fashion. The President himself is a political officer, and the country is bound to bear with his politics for four years, whatever those politics may be. The ministry which he selects, on coming to his seat, will probably represent a majority in Congress, seeing that the same suffrages which have elected the President will also have elected the Congress. But there exists no necessity on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> to employ ministers who shall carry with them the support of Congress. If, however, the minister sat in Congress--if it were required of each minister that he should have a seat either in one House or in the other--the President would, I think, find himself constrained to change a ministry in which Congress should decline to confide. It might not be so at first, but there would be a tendency in that direction.|$|E

6000|$|MR CHAIRMAN:--Some {{if not all}} {{the gentlemen}} {{on the other side}} of the House who have {{addressed}} the committee within the last two days have spoken rather complainingly, if I have rightly understood them, of the vote given a week or ten days ago declaring that the war with Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President. I admit that such a vote should not be given in mere party wantonness, and that the one given is justly censurable if it have no other or better foundation. I am one of those who joined in that vote; and I did so under my best impression of the truth of the case. How I got this impression, and how it may possibly be remedied, I will now try to show. When the war began, it was my opinion that all those who because of knowing too little, or because of knowing too much, could not conscientiously approve the conduct of the President in the beginning of it should nevertheless, as good citizens and patriots, remain silent on that point, at least till the war should be ended. Some leading Democrats, including ex-President Van Buren, have taken this same view, as I understand them; and I adhered to it and acted upon it, until since I took my seat here; and I think I should still adhere to it were it not that the President and his friends will not allow it to be so. Besides the continual effort of the President to argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement of the justice and wisdom of his conduct; besides that singularly candid paragraph in his late message in which he tells us that Congress with great unanimity had declared that [...] "by the act of the Republic of Mexico, a state of war exists between that government and the United States," [...] when the same journals that informed him of this also informed him that when that declaration stood disconnected from the question of supplies sixty-seven in the House, and not fourteen merely, voted against it; besides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could not prove by telling the whole truth-demanding of all who will not submit to be misrepresented, in justice to themselves, to speak out, besides all this, one of my colleagues [Mr. Richardson] at a very early day in the session brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the original justice of the war on the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> Upon these resolutions when they shall be put on their passage I shall be compelled to vote; so that I cannot be silent if I would. Seeing this, I went about preparing myself to give the vote understandingly when it should come. I carefully examined the President's message, to ascertain what he himself had said and proved upon the point. The result of this examination was to make the impression that, taking for true all the President states as facts, he falls far short of proving his justification; and that the President would have gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matter that the truth would not permit him. Under the impression thus made I gave the vote before mentioned. I propose now to give concisely the process of the examination I made, and how I reached the conclusion I did. The President, in his first war message of May, 1846, declares that the soil was ours on which hostilities were commenced by Mexico, and he repeats that declaration almost in the same language in each successive annual message, thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one. In the importance of that point I entirely agree with the President. To my judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified, or condemned. In his message of December, 1846, it seems to have occurred to him, as is certainly true, that title-ownership-to soil or anything else is not a simple fact, but is a conclusion following on one or more simple facts; and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from which he concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war was shed.|$|E
