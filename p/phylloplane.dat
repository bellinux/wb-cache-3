Bt isolates, which showed presence of highly conserved 16 S- 23 S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region, were screened by PCR for cry gene families. The cry 1 gene family was found to be most abundant, followed by cry 2 gene family, while none of isolates showed presence of cry 3, 4, 7 and 8 gene families. Bt isolates were further screened for presence of specific genes of cry 1 gene family. Four isolates-SK- 222, SK- 223, SK- 229 and SK- 232, were found to have cry 1 Aa, cry 1 Ab, cry 1 Ac and cry 1 D genes. Isolate SK- 222 was found to contain maximum types of genes followed by SK- 223, SK- 229 and SK- 232. Protein profiles of isolates by SDS-PAGE showed 130 kDa band corresponding to cry 1 protein.

Methods and Results: Three hundred and ninety-three groundnut-associated bacteria, representing the geocarposphere, <b>phylloplane</b> and rhizosphere, and endophytes were applied as seed treatment in greenhouse. Maximum increase in plant biomass (up to 26 %) was observed following treatment with a rhizosphere isolate identified as Bacillus firmis GRS 123, and two <b>phylloplane</b> isolates Bacillus megaterium GPS 55 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa GPS 21. There was {{no correlation between}} the production of L-tryptophan-derived auxins and growth promotion by the test isolates. Actively growing cells and peat formulations of GRS 123 and GPS 55, and actively growing cells of GPS 21, significantly increased the plant growth and pod yield (up to 19 %) in field.

The disease index in plants under drip irrigation was reduced by approximately 30 % compared with plants under sprinkler irrigation prior to inoculation. Leaf water wash (LWW) of the cacao inhibited the germination of spores by up to 98 %. Proteins from the LWW of CCN 51 were analyzed by 2 D SDS-PAGE followed by ms/ms. The gel showed 71 spots and identified a total of 42 proteins; 28 from the plant and 14 from bacteria.

Group A (Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium hordei, P. janczewskii, P. spinulosum and P. purpurogenum) were sensitive to UV-B, with the predicted effects of a 15 % ozone depletion resulting in 22 – 44 % reductions in spore germination. Mycelial extension rate on the agar surface was similarly affected, with reductions ranging from 15 to 25 %. In contrast group B (Mucor hiemalis, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Leptosphaeria coniothyrium, Trichoderma viride, Ulocladium consortiale, the Verticillium state of Nectria inventa and Marasmius androsaceus) were relatively insensitive to UV-B, with significant, but small, reductions in mycelial extension rate (< 5 %) and spore germination (0 – 22 %). Spore production in response to UV-B in the litter species was very variable, reductions ranging from 5 % to complete inhibition. Only P. hordei showed a significant increase in spore production in response to UV-B dose. In contrast, in all seven <b>phylloplane</b> species, spore germination was unaffected by increasing dose.

This study was designed to understand the main factors responsible for the assembly of nectar yeast communities, by combining field experiments with laboratory tests characterizing the physiological abilities of all yeast species forming the pool of potential colonizers for two Spanish flowering plants (Digitalis obscura and Atropa baetica). Yeast frequency and species rich- ness were assessed in external sources (bee glossae, air, plant <b>phylloplane)</b> as well as in pollinator rewards (pollen, nectar).

40|$|The rise {{in demand}} for fresh fruits and {{vegetables}} has seen an increase in the risk of gastrointestinal disease, by pathogens such as E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella enterica, since such produce is eaten uncooked. Although most produce is washed in chlorinated water, this processing may not be sufficient and can result in the formation of hazardous compounds. Classical cell culture techniques as well as novel episcopic differential contrast and epifluorescence microscopy (EDIC/EF) combined with the BacLightTM kit (to distinguish live and dead bacteria), the DAPI assay (to distinguish bacterial colonists and inorganic debris) and GFP-Salmonella strains were combined {{for the first time to}} study the complex leaf surface (<b>phylloplane).</b> EDIC/EF microscopy was shown to be advantageous compared to other methodologies; as well as being able to visualize GFP-labelled Salmonella inoculated onto the <b>phylloplane</b> it was possible to observe the naturally residing microflora on this difficult matrix. The viable pathogens and microflora were shown to colonize by four strategies: they form clusters on the phylloplane; or single cells integrate into pre-existing aggregates of biofilm microcolonies; they become entrapped in niches such as stomata; or they actively swim into the stomata and become subsurface (confirmed using laser scanning confocal microscopy, LSCM). The clusters were sometimes surrounded by slime, suggesting the formation of biofilm on the <b>phylloplane.</b> The effects of treatments to the <b>phylloplane</b> were not directly comparable, due to large biological variations in each field of view; smaller treated sample areas should allow for qualitative and quantitative comparisons. The Stomacher is at present used worldwide for the mechanical release of microorganisms from various matrices; here it was compared to the Pulsifier, which was shown to be more efficient in terms of cell recovery and causing less damage to the watercress <b>phylloplane.</b> Surface attachment was investigated by use of the Pulsifier release principle and refinements in its protocol were made. Pulsifier recovery techniques showed the inefficiencies of potential disinfectants in killing attached microorganisms, since they were not susceptible to attack until released into aqueous suspension. It is these ‘protected’ cells that then subsequently go on to produce foodborne illnesses. Further study showed the molecular signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO), to be an important physiological release agent, for enhanced recovery of coliforms, but not Salmonella, from the <b>phylloplane.</b> Chemical methods of decontamination such as the use of ozone were shown to be efficient at reducing the numbers of viable cells, particularly when combined with pulsification mechanical release of cells into aqueous suspension, resulting in between 1 - and 2 -log reductions. However, this procedure is not ideal, due to chemical damage to the <b>phylloplane</b> and problems in maintaining constant ozone concentrations, both in the laboratory and at the factory. It was shown that chlorine levels could be reduced to 20 ppm compared to the industry standard of 90 - 120 ppm, this producing similar log reductions of between 1 - and 2 -log. The Pulsifier and NO were shown in combination to provide effective mechanical and physiological detachment strategies, releasing almost 4 -log cells. It was found that 20 or 500 nM of NO, produced a 3 -log dispersion of bacterial cells, including biofilm aggregates off the surface of watercress leaves.

Roads form the main system of transportation and communication owing to the hilly topography of the region. Automobiles discharge a number of gaseous and trace metal contaminants. Human activities like stone grinding, road construction and sand milling also increase the atmospheric dust and heavy metal contaminant level. These contaminants get settled on leaf surfaces at roadsides and enter in contact with <b>phylloplane</b> microorganisms. This study compares microorganisms on leaf surfaces of alder (Alnus nepalensis (Betulaceae)) on roadside and non-roadside environments. Two sites dominated by alder were selected. One at a busy road intersection on the National Highway no. 44 in Shillong with high traffic density (8000 - 9000 heavy vehicles/day), taken as the polluted site and the other one in a forest approximately 500 m away from the roadside considered as the unpolluted site. Analysis of <b>phylloplane</b> microorganisms, lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and sulphur was carried out from leaves. The bacterial population was higher at the unpolluted site. Bacterial population showed a significant negative correlation with lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and sulphur. Similarly, fungal population was higher at the unpolluted site. A total of 29 fungal species were isolated from the <b>phylloplane</b> of A. nepalensis (polluted site 16 species; unpolluted site 28 species). Some fungal forms like Mortierella sp., Fusarium oxysporum and Aureobasidium pollulans were dominant in the polluted site. Numbers of <b>phylloplane</b> fungi and bacteria were significantly reduced in the polluted site. The correlation coefficient indicated a detrimental effect of metals like lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and sulphur on the microbial community of leaf surfaces. The specificity of certain fungi to the unpolluted site may be attributed to their sensitivity to pollution. The predominance of Aureobasidium pollulans, Fusarium oxysporum and Mortierella sp. in the polluted site may be due to their resistance to pollutants in roadside conditions...|$|E

Fast-growing organisms that did not produce resting structures (for example, fluorescent pseudomonads and yeasts) seemed to be most sensitive to perturbation. In terms of hazard and risk to the environment, the observed microbial perturbations that resulted from this GMM release may be considered minor for several reasons.

40|$|AbstractSpecies of Acanthamoeba are {{frequently}} isolated from distinct environmental {{sources such as}} water, soil, dust and air. They are responsible to cause infections and disease in humans and animals. In addition, Acanthamoeba sp. are considered an important reservoir of bacteria, virus and fungi, which act as “Trojan horses” to protect these microorganisms of harsh environmental conditions. In this study, nine Acanthamoeba isolates from bromeliads <b>phylloplane</b> were identified based on the morphology of cyst and trophozoite forms. The genotype level was accessed by the sequence analysis of Acanthamoeba small-subunit rRNA gene. Genotypic characterization grouped five isolates in the genotype T 2 /T 6, three in the T 4 genotype {{and one in the}} genotype T 16. The results obtained indicate that the genotype T 2 /T 6 is common on <b>phylloplane.</b> To predict the pathogenic potential of the Acanthamoeba isolates, thermo and osmotolerance assays were employed, although all isolates were capable of surviving at temperatures of 37 °C, other tests will be conducted in the future to determine the potential pathogenic of the isolates. Altogether, our results revealed the importance of the presence of Acanthamoeba associated with bromeliads in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and the necessity for further studies to determine the environmental distribution and the role of these species...|$|E
40|$|Two {{selective}} media which specifically {{allow the}} cultivation of Bacillus thuringiensis while {{it is in the}} vegetative as opposed to the spore form were developed. Using these media it was conclusively proved {{for the first time that}} B. thuringiensis can reside on the <b>phylloplane</b> in a metabolically active form. This was corroborated by evidence, also for the first time, that conjugation can take place on the <b>phylloplane</b> between such endemic strains. A new bacteriophage, infecting one of the endemic stains, which was activated by the process of genetic recombination, was isolated and characterized. The appearance of naturally occurring strains of B. thuringiensis in vegetative and spore form was followed over a growing season on clover (Trifolium hybridum) in the field. Simultaneous and sudden rises and declines of both spore and vegetative cell densities were observed. These could not be correlated with weather conditions. A genetically stable population of strains seemed to be maintained throughout the growing season. The most common other spore-former on these leaves was Bacillus cereus but the fluctuations in appearance of these two very closely related species were not co-incident. Using specific PCR primers, a considerably diversity of toxin types was found with the majority of isolates possessing multiple d-endotoxin genes. Bioassays against a lepidopteran insect (Pieris brassicae) of purified d-endotoxins showed that they were not more potent than those from a laboratory-adapted strain. A high percentage, however, of the endemic isolates (82 %) possessed the ‘Vegetative insecticidal protein’ (Vip) gene, vip 3. This might indicate an involvement of Vips in the establishment of these strains on the <b>phylloplane.</b> A mechanism for colonization of annual plants by B. thuringiensis was demonstrated for the first time. It was shown that spores added to seeds, even in non-sterile soil, can germinate and replicate on the resulting seedlings. The level of colonization achieved did not have a consistent influence on the feeding behaviour of third instar larvae of P. brassicae which were present on the plants for three days. Nevertheless, the fact that the number of CFU of B. thuringiensis recovered per gram of insect increased with time is evidence of proliferation of the bacterium inside the insects. Four isolates of B. thuringiensis that had been recovered in the vegetative phase from the <b>phylloplane</b> of T. hybridum were grown for 500 generations in a rich medium. Changes were observed in all of the strains but one isolate changed remarkably in all of the characteristics assessed which included: structure; plasmid profile; fatty acid composition; and d-endotoxin production. Moreover, the sequence of the Vip 3 protein harboured by the evolved strain showed changes when compared with that of the parental strain.

40|$|Leaf {{surfaces}} {{provide the}} ecologically relevant landscapes to those organisms that encounter or colonize the leaf surface. Leaf surface topography directly affects microhabitat availability for colonizing microbes, microhabitat quality and acceptability for insects, and {{the efficacy of}} agricultural spray applications. Prior detailed mechanistic studies that examined particular fungi-plant and pollinator-plant interactions have demonstrated the importance of plant surface topography or roughness in determining {{the outcome of the}} interactions. Until now, however, it has not been possible to measure accurately the topography [...] i. e., the three-dimensional structure [...] of such leaf surfaces or to record precise changes in patterns of leaf surface elevation over time. Using contact mode atomic force microscopy, we measured three-dimensional coordinates of upper leaf surfaces of Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), a perennial plant, on leaves of two age classes. We then produced topographic maps of these leaf surfaces, which revealed striking differences between age classes of leaves: old leaves have much rougher surfaces than those of young leaves. Atomic force microscope measurements were analyzed by lag (1) autocorrelation estimates of leaf surfaces by age class. We suggest that the changes in topography result from removal of epicuticular lipids and that the changes in leaf surface topography influence <b>phylloplane</b> ecology. Visualizing and mapping leaf surfaces permit detailed investigations into leaf surface-mediated phenomena, improving our understanding of <b>phylloplane</b> interactions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>phylloplane</b> is a {{term for}} the {{aboveground}} surface of plants and usually refers to the external surface of plant leaves, a dominant aerial part of plant. It {{is known to be}} colonized by a large number of microorganisms including bacteria, yeasts and fungi. Yeasts in <b>phylloplane</b> belong to either phylum Ascomycota or phylum Basidiomycota. In this study diversity of yeasts in the external surface of vetiver grass leaf in Thailand was investigated by culture dependent method and yeast strains were investigated for their capability to produce indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), a plant growth promoter. Thirty-four samples of vetiver leaf were collected from eight provinces viz. Ratchaburi, Kanchanaburi, Uthai Thani, Chiang Mai, Phayao, Uttaradit, Trat and Udon Thani. Yeasts were isolated from surface of leaf by an enrichment technique using yeast extract-malt extract broth supplemented with 0. 025 % sodium propionate and 0. 02 % chloramphenicol. A total of 40 yeast strains were obtained from 29 leaf samples (85. 3 %). Yeasts were identified on the basis of molecular taxonomy by analysis of the D 1 /D 2 region of the large subunit rRNA gene sequence similarity and phylogeny. Thirty-nine strains were identified to be 13 known species belong to Ascomycota viz.
