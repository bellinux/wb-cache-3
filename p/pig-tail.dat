Between 1900 and 1906 {{a number of}} spiral queues de cochon or <b>pig-tail</b> infantry shelters were constructed around the fort. From 1907 to 1914 the fort was extensively reinforced, including {{the replacement of the}} caponiers guarding the ditch with more effective counterscarps, while a second reinforced barracks was added, along with a casemate de Bourges covering the ground {{in the direction of the}} ouvrage de Deyvillers.Between 1907 and 1909, armored observation positions and a 75mm gun turret were added. A third observation cupola and a machine gun turret were added in 1909-1910. Finally, the fort was connected to the electrical grid in 1913. [...] The fort's garrison was by this time 400 troops.|$|E

60|$|He {{is like an}} old Chinaman {{who should}} laugh at Europeans for wearing ludicrous top-hats and curling up their <b>pig-tails</b> inside them; because {{obviously}} all men have <b>pig-tails,</b> as all monkeys have tails. Or he is like an old Chinese lady who should justly deride the high-heeled shoes of the West, considering them a needless addition to the sufficiently tight and secure bandaging of the foot; for, of course, all women bind up their feet, as all women bind up their hair. What these Celestial thinkers would not think of, or allow for, is the wild possibility {{that we do not}} have <b>pig-tails</b> although we do have top-hats, or that our ladies are not silly enough to have Chinese feet, though they are silly enough to have high-heeled shoes. Nor should we necessarily have come an inch nearer to the Chinese extravagances even if the chimney-pot hat rose higher than a factory chimney or the high heels had evolved into a sort of stilts. By the same fallacy the Englishman will not only curse the French peasant as a miser, but will also try to tip him as a beggar. That is, he will first complain of the man having the surliness of an independent man, and then accuse him of having the servility of a dependent one. Just as the hypothetical Chinaman cannot believe that we have top-hats but not <b>pig-tails,</b> so the Englishman cannot believe that peasants are not snobs even when they are savages. Or he sees that a Paris paper is violent and sensational; and then supposes that some millionaire owns twenty such papers and runs them as a newspaper trust. Surely the Yellow Press is present everywhere to paint the map yellow, as the British Empire to paint it red. It never occurs to such a critic that the French paper is violent because it is personal, and personal because it belongs to a real and responsible person, and not to a ring of nameless millionaires. It is a pamphlet, and not an anonymous pamphlet. In a hundred other cases the same truth could be illustrated; the situation in which the black man first assumes that all mankind is black, and then accuses the rest of the artificial vice of painting their faces red and yellow, or the hypocrisy of white-washing themselves after the fashion of whited sepulchres. The particular case of it now before us is that of the English misunderstanding of America; and it is based, as in all these cases, on the English misunderstanding of England.|$|R
50|$|However, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) {{currently}} only recommends two {{alternatives for}} a permanent repair using the <b>pig-tailing</b> method. The more extensively tested method uses special crimp-on connectors called COPALUM connectors. As of April 2011, the CPSC has also recognized miniature lug-type connectors called AlumiConn connectors. The CPSC considers the use of pigtails with wire nuts a temporary repair, and even as a temporary repair recommends special installation procedures, and notes that there can still be hazards with attempting the repairs.|$|R

The rich perfume the skin with rose and cinnamon-scented oils, and adorn the hair with Al-Shayh (Absinthium), sweetest herb of the Desert; their ornaments are bracelets, collars, ear and nose-rings of gold, silver, or silver-gilt.

Neither would labor any more. A burly Negro, with crinkly, bullet-shaped head, leaned against a post; a brawny spiker, naked to the waist, his wonderful shoulders and arms brown, shiny, knotted, scarred, stood near, sledge in hand; a group of Irishmen, red-and blue-shirted, puffed their black pipes and argued; swarthy, sloe-eyed Mexicans, with huge sombreros on their knees, lolled {{in the shade of a}} tree, talking low in their mellow tones and fingering cigarettes; Chinamen, with long <b>pig-tails</b> and foreign dress, added strangeness and colorful contrast.|$|R

Met and embraced by Cousin Jenny at the station and driven to the house in the squeaky surrey, the moment we arrived she and my mother would put on the dressing-sacks I associated with hot weather, and sit sewing all day long in rocking-chairs at the coolest end of the piazza. The women of that day scorned lying down, except at night, and as evening came on they donned starched dresses; I recall in particular one my mother wore, with little vertical stripes of black and white, and a full skirt. And how they talked, {{from the beginning of the}} visit until the end! I have often since wondered where the topics came from.|$|R
5000|$|Mirim Ixus {{is a young}} {{member of}} the Ten Pillar Swords Guild and a wielder {{of one of the}} ten legendary crimson blades forged by the gods to vanquish evil.

She wears her hair in two <b>pig-tails</b> usually, and is noted to have a large amount of cleavage. She is also hinted to like Ash.

She is the monster that is noted to be the one that scouted the union agent, Hustle Monkey. She appears {{in the form of a}} young woman with green hair held in <b>pig-tails</b> by bowling ball shaped hair clips. She is always accompanied by a ferocious looking black dog that acts like her guardian. This dog is probably a part of her true form. As her hair clips may indicate, she is fond of bowling and prefers to play in a bowling alley of her own creation that is made out of hearses. People who view her balls and pins are assaulted by visions of the people they have wronged. It is shown that she turns her sacrifices into bowling balls (she actually orders her sacrifices based on their weight, so that the ball's weight is more comfortable for her to throw), but it is unknown as to whether or not this also applies to the pins. The monster, Pan, called her, Hecate, when they met up at the Parthenon. This goes along with her dog since black dogs were regularly sacrificed to the Witch-Goddess.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not only}} women who were at risk. It was said that during the 18th century, the demand for hair in England {{was so great that}} in some places {{children}} were forbidden to venture out alone lest they fall victim to hair thieves. The Jacksonville Weekly Sentinel reported on 3 September 1869 that on their arrival at San Francisco, [...] "eighty arrived Chinamen had their handsome <b>pig-tails</b> cut off by hair thieves." [...] The Evening Independent of St Petersburg, Florida reported in September 1913: hair thieves have appeared in the west. They enter homes in the night and cut the hair from the heads of sleeping women and children. They do not attempt to move their victims but cut only such hair as can be conveniently reached without awakening the sleepers. There seems to be an organized gang of these thieves. No attempt is made at any other form of robbery, the thieves leaving even watches and jewelry untouched. Women in Wellington, New Zealand were targeted on the streets by an opportunist hair thief in 1914. According to a victim interviewed by the Grey River Argus, [...] "For the life of me I couldn't tell you exactly when or where I lost my hair. I didn't feel anything at all ... when opposite Te Aro House, my friend said: 'Oh, someone's cut your hair off!' I laughed and said it was nonsense, but I found it was only too true." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{national}} [...] "tire-valiant" [...] is a galeated crest {{not unlike}} the cuirassier's helmet, and the hair, trained from the sides into a high ridge running along the cranium, not unfrequently projects far beyond the forehead. Taste and caprice produce endless modifications. Sometimes the crest is double, disposed in parallel ridges, with a deep hollow between; or it is treble, when the two lines of parting running along the mastoids make it remarkably like bears' ears, the central prism rises high, and the side hair is plaited into little <b>pig-tails.</b> Others again train four parallel lines from nape to forehead, forming two cushions along the parietals. The crest is heightened by padding, and {{the whole of the}} hair is devoted to magnifying it,--at a distance, some of the bushwomen look as if they wore cocked hats. When dreaded baldness appears, rosettes of false hair patch the temples, and plaits of purchased wigs are interwoven to increase the bulk: the last resources of all are wigs and toupets of stained pine-apple fibre. The comb is unknown, its succedaneum being a huge bodkin, like that which the Trasteverina has so often used as a stiletto. This instrument of castigation is made of ivory or metal, with a lozenge often neatly carved and ornamented at the handle. The hair, always somewhat [...] "kinky," [...] is anointed every morning with palm-oil, or the tallow-like produce of a jungle-nut; and, in full dress, it is copiously powdered with light red or bright yellow dust of pounded camwood, redwood, and various barks.|$|R
