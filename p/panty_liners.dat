40|$|The {{influence}} of skin environmental factors {{has been investigated}} in five studies. In the first study, the microbial growth and rash development in diaper dermatitis were studied in order to evaluate a UVB radiation therapy in comparison with a combined antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. The effect of reducing skin environmental pH in experimentally induced Candida lesions was investigated in the second study. The effect of occlusion on vulvar skin temperature, humidity and surface pH, with and {{without the use of}} <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> was investigated in study III and IV, with study IV also including measurements of the skin microflora. In the fifth study, string panties equipped with string <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> were compared with regular panties with standard <b>panty</b> <b>liners,</b> to evaluate whether there was any difference in their impact on the vulvar skin microenvironment. Diaper dermatitis was susceptible to treatment with UVB therapy, the improvement effect in this study was comparable to the use of antifungal-hydrocortisone cream. Experimentally induced skin reactions caused by C. albicans, were significantly reduced when skin environmental pH was changed from 5. 7 to 5. 1 (study II). The results were not caused by reduced growth of C. albicans, but might be due to a pH dependence of the virulence of the yeast and/or a modulation of the host s defence capability. The results in study III indicated that vapour-impermeable <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> increased vulvar temperature, humidity and pH, compared with the use of no liners. However, the use of vapour-permeable (breathable) <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> kept the microclimate basically at an undisturbed level. Study IV showed that vulvar microclimate and microflora levels were significantly higher during use of a non-breathable panty liner, compared to the use of no liner. The use of a breathable and acidic panty liner resulted in a microclimate and microflora close to the situation without panty liner. However, the numbers of microorganisms were low for all three circumstances (with or without the use of both <b>panty</b> <b>liners)</b> implying no significant microbial risk. The differences in panty and panty liner design in study V (string vs normal), seem to have negligible impact on the vulvar skin microclimate, skin surface pH and microflora. No support was found for the fear that a string panty system would result in higher contamination of vulvar skin with anorectal microflora. It is concluded that changes in skin environmental pH and occlusion are important for changes in skin microflora. A well-balanced skin microenvironment, with respect to temperature, humidity and pH, could be a good preventive approach to avoid skin infections and irritations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{goals of}} this study were 1) to better define the labial {{microflora}} and 2) to evaluate whether extended non-menstrual use of <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> would increase genital carriage of undesirable bacteria and predispose to infection. Methods: Healthy female volunteers (224) were prospectively randomized into panty liner wear groups A (Always (R) deodorant) and B (Always (R) non-deodorant) and into a control group C (no panty liner wear) with instructions for non-menstrual menstrual use> 5 h daily for 6 months. Selected aerobic bacteria were semiquantitatively cultured from the inner labial groove, the posterior fornix of the vagina, and the cervix pre-study and post-study. Used <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> were quantitatively cultured, and vaginal secretions were examined by gas chromatography for fatty acid ratios as a measure of microbial flora shifts. Results: At the pre-study, labial microflora in this study population contained significantly higher frequencies of Staphylococcus, coliforms, other gram-negative rods, and enterococci, and a decreased frequency of Gardnerella vaginalis relative to the vaginal microflora. After 6 months use of <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> the frequencies (and densities) of the selected microorganisms in these two sites had not changed compared to controls, and fatty acid analyses of vaginal secretions gave no evidence of shifts in the microbial flora. Conclusions: Frequencies of selected,genital microflora were different for the labia compared to the vagina.

40|$|Background/Aim. Recurrent vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} is relatively frequent condition, {{and may have}} serious health consequences, like chronic vulvovaginal pain syndrome. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} possible risk factors for recurrent {{vulvovaginal candidiasis}} in non-pregnant females within the reproductive age. Methods. The design of our study was of a case-control type. Case and control patients were selected from the gynecological patients at six primary care facilities in Serbia and in Montenegro. The data on the patients' health condition, concomitant therapy and diseases were taken from their records, and the data on habits were obtained by unstructured interview. For potential risk factors crude odds ratios were calculated, and then adjusted by logistic regression. Results. A total of fifty-one patients had four or more episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis during the last year (cases), and 132 patients with one to three episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis were sampled as controls, matched by age. The only two significant associations were found between recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and continual wearing of <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> during the last year (Odds ratio - ORadjusted: 3. 97; confidence interval - CI: 1. 57 - 10. 02; p = 0. 004), and between recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and predominant use of vaginal tampons during menstruation in the last year (ORadjusted: 4. 25; CI: 1. 11 - 16. 27; p = 0. 035). The synergistic effect was observed for the concurrent continual wearing of <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> during the last year and selfmedication with antimycotics. Conclusions. Local factors, like wearing of <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> or use of tampons during menstruation, may promote recurrence of vulvovaginal candidiasis, especially in patients who practice selfmedication with antimycotics...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{validate}} {{the reliability and}} stability of the AL-SENSE panty-liner for detection of amniotic fluid in the second trimester. Study design: Amniotic fluid drawn during amniocentesis between 16 to 23 weeks of gestation {{was used for the}} study. 100 µl and 400 µl of amniotic fluid, were dripped onto two <b>panty</b> <b>liners,</b> respectively. After 5 minutes the indicator strip was removed from the AL-SENSE, dried and examined. The color was recorded at time 0 and 5 minutes, and then every 10 minutes for the first 30 minutes, then at 1, 2, 6 and 12 hours. Results: 50 women were enrolled and 49 completed the study. 100 % of both volume samples changed color from yellow to blue during the first 5 minutes and remained stable after twelve hours of follow-up. In the 100 μl subgroup, seven of the 49 samples (14. 3 %) had a delayed color change and in the 400 μl subgroup one of 49 (2. 04 %) had a delay in change of color. Conclusion: Amniotic fluid drawn during amniocentesis at weeks 16 - 23 of gestation have a positive, stable staining effect on the AL-SENSE panty liner. Hence, AL-SENSE may be reliable for detection of amniotic fluid leakage during the second trimester...|$|E

SCA has about 50, 000 employees in some 50 countries. At the beginning of June 2005 two students, Karolina Andersson and Johanna Sahlstedt, began their thesis work at SCA in Mölndal. The path began with the mission to investigate public washrooms to find a visiting frequency for a “high traffic washroom” and based on the investigation define proper size and design criteria for a new series dispensers. After an extensive information-gathering phase all of the information that was found was gathered to get a straight description of the products function. The key was to describe needs and functions without specifying them too much to avoid narrowing the product at that point of the thesis work. The next step along the path was to generate different concepts for evaluation. The concepts advantage and disadvantages were discussed. During concept selection the concept that best satisfied the needs, product specifications and Tork brand values was chosen: HT single. The HT single series is a well-designed and reliable dispenser series. For decades, Tork has pioneered the development of dispensers. Today’s range reduces over-consumption, ensures hygiene, prevents theft and adds to interior design. The basic work of today’s brand Tork is illustrated in the HT single series.

40|$|For {{sporadic}} acute Candida vaginitis, any oral {{or local}} antifungal therapy can be used. For women with recurrent vulvo-vaginal candidosis (RVC), {{on the other}} hand, such simple approaches are insufficient, regardless of the product chosen. Instead, RVC should be managed as any other chronic disease and requires long-term, prophylactic, suppressive antifungal treatment. A regimen using individualized, decreasing doses of oral fluconazole (the ReCiDiF regimen) was proven to be highly efficient and offered great comfort to the patients. During this regimen, {{it is crucial that}} patients are carefully examined by anamnestic, clinical, microscopic and culture-proven absence of Candida. If a relapse occurs, the medication is adjusted and efforts are taken to find a possible triggering factor for the reactivation of the infection. Care has to be taken not to accumulate 'don't do's', unless the efficiency of a measure has been proven, by trying to eliminate one risk factor at a time for 2 months. Known possible triggers to be kept in mind are (1) antibiotic use, (2) use of specific contraceptives, especially combined contraceptive pills, (3) disturbed glucose metabolism, (4) the use of personal hygienic products, and (5) tight clothing or plastic <b>panty</b> <b>liners.</b> In therapy-resistant cases, non-albicans infection must be ruled out, and alternative therapies should be tried. Boric acid is proven to be efficient in most of these resistant cases, but other non-azoles like amphotericin B, flucytosine, gentian violet, and even caspofungin may have to be tried. As a final remark it has to be said that many patients feel poorly understood and inefficiently managed by many care-givers, increasing their feelings of guilt and sexual inferiority. Therefore, attention has to be given to take the disease seriously, follow strict treatment regimens, and advise precisely and based on individual evidence concerning any possible risk factors for recurrence. In case of therapy-resistant vulvo-vaginitis, reconsider your diagnosis and/or consider referral to specialized therapists. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the prevalence, typology, {{and experience of}} urinary incontinence, {{as well as the}} available therapeutic modalities and information sources among people living at home in Belgium. Methods: A representative population sample of 5269 adults completed a questionnaire in their own homes. There were 2499 men and 2770 women aged 30 years and over. Results: 130 men (5. 2 %) and 442 women (16. 30 %) had urinary incontinence {{at the time of the}} survey. Of 1426 women aged over 50 years, 300 (21. 0 %) had urinary incontinence. 17. 4 % of the incontinent people experience several episodes daily. In women, incontinence increases with parity. Stress incontinence is by far the most common form of the disease (42 %); 53 % of incontinent women (9. 9 % of the female population) experience this kind of disorder. Overall, 95 % of stress incontinent people are women. The relative frequency of urge incontinence is similar in both sexes (males 45 %; females 55 %). Urinary incontinence is considered as bothersome by about 30 % of the affected subjects; 7 of 10 subjects with daily incontinence episodes consider the disorder as more or less bothersome. 29. 9 % of affected people report that they discuss the problem with their general practitioner, 11. 4 % with a specialist, 25. 3 % with their spouse or partner, and 17. 4 % with a family member. Of course, people who consider the disease as bothersome score higher on these items. On the other hand, 32. 1 % do not reveal the problem. Although 72. 5 % of incontinent people are aware of protection systems, the main therapeutic modalities are not very well known (drugs 33. 9 %; surgery 24. 7 %). Most people with incontinence (70 - 75 %) take no specific measures, 20 % use pads, <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> or nappies, and only 9 % look for a curative measure. The preferred information source is the family physician for 50 %, the specialist physician for 11 %, and the pharmacist for 9 %. The role of the mass media is equivalent to that of specialist physicians and pharmacists. Conclusions: Incontinence has a profound effect on daily life, and is still considered by many as 'taboo'. An appropriate information system, in which the general practitioner plays a key role, is obviously desirable. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) {{are essential}} {{components of the}} defence system spanning virtually every kingdom of life. The peptides are relatively small, amphipathic molecules of variable length, sequence, charge and structure. AMPs {{have been shown to}} possess activity against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, and kill their targets by multiple mechanisms mostly through membrane disruption. The field of AMPs has lately received an increased attention, much due to the serious issue of resistance development of microorganism strains against current antibiotics. However, because of the extensive range of microorganism related problems, the field of AMPs is also of interest in other areas such as hygiene applications, which is the main focus of this thesis. The use of AMPs in hygiene products could prevent common pathogen related problems involved in hygiene. Conditions such as fungal and bacterial infections are related to diapers and <b>panty</b> <b>liners,</b> also it is of importance to keep skin and surfaces hygienic. The suggested AMP applications in hygiene products are, AMP expressing probiotics, AMPs in various materials and substances that induce the body’s production of AMPs. The main purpose of this thesis is to provide an understanding of the field of antimicrobial peptides and to evaluate the potential in hygiene applications. Both a practical and theoretical approach was applied for this purpose. The theoretical part included an extensive literature study as well as interviews with active scientists and companies. Besides the possibilities of AMPs, there are several challenges involved such as specificity, resistance, cost and stability. However, {{it should be noted that}} there are AMPs in commercial products such as pharmaceuticals, food preservatives and wipes, suggesting a possibility for use in hygiene products. The practical part of the thesis involved the testing of Nisin A, Lactoferricin B, Magainin 2, Buforin II and Histatin- 5 to evaluate their antimicrobial activity against three relevant pathogens: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial activity was measured by an agar diffusion assay named inhibition zone assay. It was examined how the antimicrobial activity varied between microorganisms, different concentrations of sodium chloride and also between different strains. From the practical results it could be concluded that with the right conditions, most of the peptides showed activity depending on the microorganisms. It was also demonstrated that many peptides are salt sensitive, and finally, when tested against different strains of the same microorganism the peptides did not show much difference in activity. To sum up, there is a potential for AMPs in hygiene products but many challenges needs to be considered...|$|E
40|$|The human vaginal {{ecosystem}} {{is dominated}} by Lactobacillus species. An altered vaginal flora can result in symptomatic conditions such as bacterial vaginosis and vulvo-vaginal candidiasis, and urogenital colonisation by uropathogenic bacteria can cause urinary tract infection. The protective role of lactobacilli is gradually being accepted and clinical studies {{have been carried out}} in order to evaluate the use of promising probiotic bacteria, which are defined as “live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host”. This thesis includes an investigation into the ecological role of lactobacilli in the genital tract in healthy women, with respect to the relationship to other species and vaginal pH. Furthermore, in order to find different probiotic strains with promising probiotic qualities, Lactobacillus strains were screened in two diverse screening processes. The selected strains were further evaluated in clinical trials. The prevalence of group B streptococci (GBS) and yeast was significantly dependent on the number of vaginal lactobacilli among healthy women. GBS were less frequently found in women with high numbers of vaginal lactobacilli than in women with low numbers and the prevalence of yeast was significantly higher in women with 3 - 6. 99 log 10 lactobacilli sample- 1 than in women with less than 3 or ≥ 7 log 10 lactobacilli sample- 1. Furthermore, the first screening made on 511 strains isolated from the female genital tract resulted in the final selection of a Lactobacillus plantarum, designated LB 931. The screening showed that LB 931 had a strong technical growth, survived through freeze-thawing, produced substances bactericidal to uropathogenic bacteria and was a rapid and strong producer of hydrogen peroxide. Further characterisation showed that LB 931 possessed the properties required for probiotics with the capability to prevent urogenital infections. LB 931 could be supplied to the genital tract through the usage of <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> impregnated with the strain. In the second screening, Lactobacillus fermentum, designated Ess- 1, was the only one out of 126 Lactobacillus strains with strong capacity to inhibit Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Additional characterisation showed that L. fermentum Ess- 1 had the properties that are needed to prevent over-growth of Candida in the vulvo-vaginal tract. The result of the case study showed that a high and frequent dosage of Ess- 1 is needed and that improved vulvo-vaginal candidiasis specific diagnostic criteria are required. In conclusion, L. plantarum LB 931 and L. fermentum Ess- 1 are promising probiotic strains {{to be used in the}} prevention of recurrent urogenital infections in women and to enhance the normal flora in healthy women...|$|E
40|$|In {{the market}} today, {{there is a}} great need of {{trademark}} protection for packaging, since design is important and valuable for manufacturers to distinguish their goods. It is, however, not easy to obtain such trademark protection. The purpose behind my master thesis is to examine how a packaging should be designed to obtain trademark registration in Sweden and in the EC. My starting point is SCA Hygiene’s egg-shaped plastic packaging for <b>panty</b> <b>liners</b> (the egg). The egg was refused registration by PRV due to lack of distinctiveness but was allowed registration as an EC trademark by OHIM. The question I have asked myself is why the assessment of distinctiveness differs between Sweden and the EC although Sweden has changed its law after the EC directive on harmonisation of the member states´ trademark law. To answer the question, in my thesis I have examined the conditions for registration stated in the EC directive {{as well as in the}} Swedish law and how courts and authorities have interpreted them. My intention is that the thesis shall be suitable for using as guidance for companies wanting to protect packaging with the help of intellectual property laws and especially the Trademark Act. The guidelines can be used both when wanting to design a packaging, to make it possible to register it as trademark as well as to assess whether an already existing packaging is possible to register. To decide whether a packaging is possible to register the first step is to determine whether it is possible to reproduce graphically. The next step is to decide whether it is distinctive. The authorities and courts assess distinctiveness first in relation to the goods for which registration has been requested and secondly in the relation to the perception of the public. Therefore the relevant market for the goods must be analysed as well as what competitors’ packaging look like. It is also necessary to consider who the product is directed towards. Finally the packaging itself must be studied to assess whether it is only an ordinary fundamental form or if it has any special elements and the total impression of it. The packaging cannot be banal to obtain protection. The last thing to examine before an application for trademark registration is whether the exceptions in CTMR Article 7 (1) (e) are applicable. However, I have not found any cases where trademark applications have been refused because of these exceptions. I have noticed a tendency that it is easier to obtain trademark protection for packaging in the EC. However, the examiners both in PRV and in OHIM use almost the same principles and follow the case law from ECJ and CFI. The differences in assessing distinctiveness are probably because the examiners are different persons with different opinions and experience. I have reached the purpose behind my thesis through studying literature; books and articles as well as studying case law from PRV, PBR, RegR, OHIM, the Court of First Instance and the ECJ. To obtain a practical view and see whether my conclusions are true in practice, I have made two interviews...|$|E
