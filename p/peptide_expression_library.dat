40|$|The MPM 2 {{monoclonal}} antibody binds to a phospho amino acid-containing epitope present {{on more than}} 40 proteins of M-phase eukaryotic cells. We have developed a technique for cloning cDNAs encoding MPM 2 -reactive phosphoproteins from bacteriophage lambda expression libraries. Proteins from phage plaques were absorbed to nitrocellulose filters, phosphorylated by M-phase kinases, and screened for MPM 2 binding. Partial-length cDNAs encoding two MPM 2 -reactive proteins termed MPM 2 -reactive phosphoproteins 1 and 2 (MPP 1 and MPP 2) were isolated. The deduced MPP 1 and MPP 2 amino acid sequences are not closely related to any previously described proteins. To determine which amino acid stretches contained the MPM 2 epitope, sequences from a 15 amino acid <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> <b>library</b> were selected for binding to MPM 2 after phosphorylation by M-phase kinases. A string of five amino acids was similar among all selected peptides, and the sequence reflecting the most frequent amino acid at each position was Leu-Thr-Pro-Leu-Lys (LTPLK). MPP 1 and MPP 2 proteins, respectively, contained five and nine sites closely related to LTPLK, including two that were common to both proteins, (F/T) TPLQ and SSP(I/S) D. Peptides containing LTPLK and FTPLQ were strongly phosphorylated by M-phase, but not interphase, cytosolic kinases, and the phosphorylated peptides were bound by MPM 2. Thus, we have identified M-phase-specific phosphorylation sites bound by MPM 2 and two putative M-phase phosphoproteins containing these sites...|$|E
40|$|The UL 84 open {{reading frame}} of human {{cytomegalovirus}} encodes an essential multifunctional regulatory protein that is thought {{to act in the}} nucleus as an initiator of lytic viral replication. Nuclear trafficking of pUL 84 is facilitated by a complex nonconventional nuclear localization signal (NLS) that mediates its interaction with the cellular importin-α/β pathway. Since binding of pUL 84 to importin-α proteins mechanistically differs from that of cellular proteins containing a classical NLS, we assumed that specific interference with the nuclear import of pUL 84 might be possible and that this could constitute a novel principle for antiviral therapy. In order to test this hypothesis, we employed peptide aptamer technology and isolated several peptide aptamers from a randomized <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> <b>library</b> that specifically bind with high affinity to the unconventional pUL 84 NLS under intracellular conditions. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed these interactions in mammalian cells, and the antiviral potential of the identified peptide aptamers was determined using three independent experimental approaches. (i) Infection experiments with a recombinant human cytomegalovirus expressing green fluorescent protein demonstrated 50 to 60 % decreased viral replication in primary human fibroblasts stably expressing pUL 84 -specific aptamers. (ii) A 50 to 70 % reduction of viral plaque formation, as well as a 70 to 90 % inhibition of virus release in the presence of pUL 84 -specific aptamers, was observed. (iii) Immunofluorescence analyses revealed a shift from an almost exclusively nuclear pUL 84 staining pattern to a nucleocytoplasmic distribution upon coexpression of the identified molecules, indicating that interference with the nuclear import of pUL 84 contributes to the observed antiviral activity of the identified pUL 84 -binding aptamer molecules...|$|E
40|$|In rodents, kisspeptin expressing neurons are {{localized}} in two hypothalamic brain nuclei [anteroventral periventricular nucleus/periventricular nucleus continuum (AVPv/PeN) and {{arcuate nucleus}} (ARC) ] and modulated by sex steroids. By using wild-type (WT) and aromatase knockout mice (ArKO, which cannot convert testosterone into estradiol) and immunohistochemistry, we observed that WT females showed a continuous increase in kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> in the ARC across postnatal ages (P 5 to P 25), whereas WT males {{did not show}} any expression before P 25. Kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> was also present in ArKO females but did not increase over this early postnatal period, suggesting that kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> in the ARC is organized by estradiol-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We also compared kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> between groups of adult male and female mice which were left gonadally intact or gonadectomized and treated or not with estradiol (E 2) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT). In the ARC, kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> decreased after gonadectomy but was completely rescued by either E 2 or DHT treatment in each sex/genotype. However, kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> was lower in ArKO compared to WT subjects. In the AVPv/PeN, ArKO females showed a male-typical kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression,</b> and adult E 2 treatment partially restored kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression.</b> Finally, we showed that, after E 2 treatment of WT and ArKO mice between either P 5 and P 15 or P 15 and P 25, AVPv/PeN kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> could be still masculinized at P 5, but was feminized from P 15 onwards.

The CF antibody response is directed against a heat-labile antigen that has chitinase activity, hereafter {{referred to as the}} CF/chitinase protein. To identify and clone this immunoreactive enzyme, we constructed a Coccidioides immitis cDNA lambda ZAP <b>expression</b> <b>library</b> from spherule RNA and detected fusion peptides expressing CF epitopes by immunoscreening. A cDNA clone consisting of 1, 623 bp was identified, sequenced, and found to contain a single open reading frame that encodes a protein of 47 kDa with 427 amino acids. Deduced amino acid sequence analyses showed that the cloned CF/chitinase cDNA contains a 35 -amino-acid region, beginning at Ser- 18 and ending at and ending at Arg- 52 which has 92 % homology with the reported N-terminal amino acid sequence of authentic CF/chitinase protein.

A plasmid-based, GAL 1 promoter-driven yeast cDNA <b>expression</b> <b>library</b> was introduced into a yeast genotype {{susceptible to the}} antimicrobial peptide MiAMP 1 purified from Macadamia integrifolia. Following a screen of 20, 000 cDNAs, three yeast cDNAs were identified that reproducibly provided transformants with galactose-dependent resistance to MiAMP 1. These cDNAs encoded a protein of unknown function, a component (VMA 11) of the vacuolar H+-ATPase and a component (cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIa) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, respectively. To identify genes that increased sensitivity to MiAMP 1, the yeast cDNA <b>expression</b> <b>library</b> was introduced into a yeast mutant with increased resistance to MiAMP 1. From 11, 000 cDNAs screened, two cDNA clones corresponding to a ser/thr kinase and a ser/thr phosphatase reproducibly increased MiAMP 1 susceptibility in the mutant in a galactose-dependent manner.

We evaluate whether activin A and follistatin mRNA and <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> {{as well as}} protein secretion from human endometrium change throughout the menstrual cycle. METHODS: In 25 healthy fertile patients, uterine washing fluid was retrieved by hydrosonography. In a subgroup (n = 13), endometrial tissue samples were collected by hysteroscopy during the proliferative (n = 6) or secretory (n = 7) phase of the menstrual cycle. Activin and follistatin mRNA and <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> were evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Activin A and follistatin levels were assayed in uterine washing fluids by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and evaluated according to the endometrial thickness and menstrual cycle days. RESULTS: Both activin A and follistatin mRNAs were expressed by human endometrium, and their peptides immunolocalized both in proliferative and secretory endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. A significant increase in immunoreactive activin betaA but not in follistatin was observed in glandular epithelium during the secretory phase. Activin A but not follistatin was significantly (P <. 0001) higher in the washing fluids collected during the secretory than proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. In addition, a significant correlation was found between activin A, but not follistatin, and menstrual cycle days (P <. 0001) or endometrial thickness (P <. 0001).

40|$|The {{regulation}} of GnRH neurons by kisspeptin {{is critical for}} normal puberty onset in mammals. In the rodent the kisspeptin neurons innervating GnRH neurons are thought to reside in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP 3 V). Using kisspeptin immunocytochemistry we show that kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> in the RP 3 V of female mice begins around postnatal d 15 (P 15) and rapidly increases to achieve adult-like levels by P 30, the time of puberty onset. Ovariectomy of female pups at P 15 resulted in a 70 – 90 % reduction (P < 0. 01) in kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> within the RP 3 V of P 30 or P 60 mice. Replacement of 17 -β-estradiol (E 2) in P 15 -ovariectomized mice from P 15 – 30 or P 22 – 30 resulted in a complete restoration of kisspeptin <b>peptide</b> <b>expression</b> in the RP 3 V (P < 0. 01). Kisspeptin-immunoreactive fibers throughout the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus, followed {{the same pattern of}} estrogen-dependent expression.

Kisspeptin-immunoreactive cells were detected in the arcuate nucleus, but there was a complete absence of kisspeptin peptide in RP 3 V neurons of aromatase knockout adult females. These results demonstrate that E 2 is essential for the prepubertal development of kisspeptin peptide within RP 3 V neurons and suggest that an E 2 -kisspeptin positive feedback mechanism exists before puberty. This implies that RP 3 V kisspeptin neurons are E 2 -dependent amplifiers of GnRH neuron activity in the prepubertal period...|$|R
