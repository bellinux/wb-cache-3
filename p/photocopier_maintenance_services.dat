40|$|The {{field of}} {{industrial}} maintenance management is evolving constantly, as {{the trend of}} servitization and outsourcing of support <b>services</b> affect <b>maintenance</b> operations. In-house maintenance organizations have moved at least partly towards inter-organizational relationships in different company networks (consisting of customer companies, service providers and equipment providers). Hand in hand with structural change, new valuecreating opportunities have emerged. Equipment providers enter the service market {{more and more often}} to level out cyclical changes in equipment sales. In addition, an increasing number of companies that focus primarily on <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> have entered the market (often as a result of outsourced in-house operations). The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value and capture the different value creation strategies in service networks. First, the study identifies what the value creating elements and features in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> are. Second, the study explores how <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> operations are currently managed. Thirdly, the thesis studies what the prerequisites for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are. The thesis employs the mixed methods approach where both quantitative and qualitative methods are used in the empirical part of the research. The survey method is utilized for quantitative data collection in order to decipher the complex nature of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> value. After quantitative analysis, a qualitative case study is used to explain the identified value creation strategies and the role of networks in value creation further. The findings of this thesis indicate that successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are created stagewise by utilizing comprehensive value creation capabilities. The thesis offers three main contributions to the field. First, it presents a framework for successful <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks where different value creation strategies at different relationship and offering levels in <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks are identified. Second, it provides a multidimensional value construct where the comprehensive value of <b>maintenance</b> <b>services</b> is presented. Thirdly, the findings highlight that non-financial value elements become critical when aiming at more collaborative <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> networks...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMaintenance {{service is}} the most {{important}} part in industrial product-service system (iPSS). To enhance the proactiveness of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service,</b> the failure time of product need to be predicted. This study provides insight into how the maintenance time can be predicted accurately for the service decision-making of IPSS based on the historical failure time data, avoiding the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring. An improved grey prediction model is introduced to obtain a predictive interval of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> time which is used as basis for making a decision of proactive <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> The method is applied in an instance of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> for agricultural machinery. In three examples of different types of agricultural machinery, the predicted intervals of maintenance time are given and the fitted values have high accordance with the real ones. The result shows that this approach can be used effectively to predict production failure time. Moreover, the output results of this approach can provide the necessary support to make a decision for proactive <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> without the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring in a reliable way...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of working capital {{management}} on profitability in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> companies. Design/methodology/approach – Analytical modeling has been used as the research method. Finnish industrial maintenance companies have been analyzed on the basis of their financial statements. Findings – We reveal a significant negative correlation between the cycle times of operational working capital and the return on investment of industrial maintenance companies. Light fixed assets and good profitability of the maintenance sector emphasize the importance of working capital management. Large <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> companies seem to achieve competitive advantage over small and medium sized <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> providers through both fixed assets- and working capital-related economies of scale, and through the fact that large <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> providers often focus on providing services mostly for their host companies. Research limitations – The scarcity of large enterprises in the market in question precludes the use of a more extensive sample in the analysis. Practical implications – In the industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> business, more attention should be paid to active management of working capital. We can conclude that this holds true especially in large industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> enterprises. Originality/value – We contribute to the unexplored perspective of industrial maintenance companies. Previous studies of industrial maintenance companies have not addressed working capital management, which gains more and more attention under the volatile economic circumstances of the present day.

40|$|Maintenance is {{the main}} part of product {{lifecycle}} management (PLM). Thus, the solution suitable for equipment maintenance can be easily extended to other industry equipment maintenance processes. While most of the current <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> management only rely on empirical experience, ignoring the dynamic information uncertainties and lacking flexible reactions hinder the effectiveness of the maintenance task assignment. Moreover, without a systematic and dynamic consideration of various related parameters, more limitations are exposed to current approaches. As such, it is of great importance to automate the maintenance process, consider all related parameters and cope with the dynamic uncertainties to endow equipment maintenance processes with smart and fast reaction capability, flexibility, and robustness. Among the first to address this problem, {{with the help of the}} Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud technologies, this thesis systematically proposes the real-time Cloud-enabled equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> (CEMS). These new technologies can enable real-time equipment status data collection, advanced and proactive response maintenance as well as improved process visibility. By using the proposed CEMS, it results in a significant improvement in processing the equipment fault report, making a quick response, and dynamically assigning the maintenance tasks, enhancing the task management ability of the maintenance center. To achieve the overall aim of this research, three typical scenarios are examined as follows: Scenario Ⅰ: In this scenario, an overview of equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> is studied and analyzed. Equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> process is an important part of after-sales service, this study has taken a broad view at <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> and the corresponding research issues emerging in this field. ScenarioⅡ: In this scenario, a cloud-enabled platform for EMS assignment and control is developed, inspired by an industrial case of lift after-sales <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> The presented cloud-based equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> (CEMS) platform integrates various methods and techniques into a suite of applications for EMS assignment and control management, including intelligent inspection, equipment fault information processing, maintenance assignment and <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> execution control. Through the cloud computing and IoT technologies, a real-time <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> assignment and execution control platform is established. Heterogeneous physical equipment and manpower can be easily traced, tracked, and managed. Scenario Ⅲ: This scenario considers a <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> area where the <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> department operator needs to designate different kinds of maintenance task to corresponding <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> staff/agent. As the volume of maintenance demand increases quickly, the quality, efficiency, and robustness of such task assignment process require comprehensive study and analysis. Therefore, the major challenges of this work are how to the assign the maintenance task to the most suitable maintenance team. We propose an efficient assignment mechanism to minimize the total maintenance cost by dynamically assigning each task with most appropriate maintenance team. In this dissertation, the cloud enables and real-time advanced receiving, assignment and control problems in equipment maintenance are investigated and related maintenance assign task mechanisms and platform technologies are developed as well. This study of equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> shall be of great value not only to researchers who desire to extend their research into this new area but also to practitioners who are interested in equipment fault prognosis by using the real-time equipment operation information. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
