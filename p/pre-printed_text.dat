This, increasingly, results in unsafe abortions. FP in Zimbabwe is overwhelmingly based on the pill (little effort of health workers needed) with huge failure rates. In South Africa injectables are the mainstay of FP with less failures but with many discontinuations because of side effects. Furthermore women between 40 - 50 years of age using this method do not know when they can safely stop. The dissertation discusses the role of the Roman Catholic Church in sabotaging proper access to and information about FP. Also teenagers do not get the proper education they need to protect themselves against HIV, another result of the attitude of the above church that only believes in the abstinence message and not in factual information. Another chapter is about bourgeois women from the First World who succeed in undermining trust in injections and implants and hence adding to the problems of their African sisters by limiting their choice. FP and HIV is discussed extensively. The author demonstrates with fake patients that health workers are unfriendly and incompetent when the "morning-after pill" is needed. The author presents two studies the results of which will make it easier in view of the restraints in staff availability to offer women a sterilisation. One study shows that at follow up months later women do not remember a sterilisation under local anaesthesia as much more painful than an operation under GA. Another study shows that it is ethically acceptable to ask if a sterilisation is wanted together with a (emergency) caesarean section (CS) in high parity women. Those asked are 6 x as often satisfied as those not asked. Regret is seen 22 times as often in those not sterilised in this situation as those who are. It is claimed that for some women {{it is more likely that}} they will die of the next pregnancy (with a scar in the uterus) than that they will regret giving permission for a sterilisation in a stressed situation. Of course it would be even better to discuss the possibility of a CS and the inherent option of a sterilisation with all higher parity women during the antenatal period and document their wish. A <b>pre-printed</b> <b>text</b> on the antenatal card would be best. One other large study follows-up with success 2000 sterilised women and 1000 controls. The regret rate is very low in those sterilised and high in the other group. The same applies to depression and loss of libido. If the facilities, staff and motivation would be available voluntary sterilisation would be an excellent option for many woman in Africa. For example in the Netherlands in 1970 there were an estimated combined total of 1700 women and men sterilised (the total of all sterilisations in the past 20 years) in the year 1983 there were 63. 000 of such operations performed in one year. In the US 50 % of women between 40 - 45 are sterilised in Zimbabwe 6. 9 % while Zimbabwe has the highest figures for southern-Africa excluding South Africa...|$|E

40|$|We present {{photometric}} and {{morphological analysis}} {{of the behavior of}} sungrazing comet C/ 2012 S 1 ISON in SOHO and STEREO images around its perihelion on 2013 November 28. 779 UT. ISON brightened gradually November 20 - 26 with a superimposed outburst on November 21. 3 - 23. 5. The slope of brightening changed about November 26. 7 and was significantly steeper in SOHO's orange and clear filter images until November 27. 9 when it began to flatten out, reaching a peak about November 28. 1 (r_H∼ 17 R_), then fading before brightening again from November 28. 6 (r_H∼ 5 R_) until disappearing behind the occulting disc. ISON brightened continuously as it approached perihelion while visible in all other telescopes/filters. The central condensation disappeared about November 28. 5 and the leading edge became progressively more elongated until perihelion. These photometric and morphological behaviors are reminiscent of the tens of meter sized Kreutz comets regularly observed by SOHO and STEREO and strongly suggest that the nucleus of ISON was destroyed prior to perihelion. This is much too small to support published gas production rates and implies significant mass loss and/or disruption {{in the days and weeks}} leading up to perihelion. No central condensation was seen post-perihelion. The post-perihelion lightcurve was nearly identical in all telescopes/filters and fell slightly steeper than r_H^- 2. This implies that the brightness was dominated by reflected solar continuum off of remnant dust in the coma/tail and that any remaining active nucleus was < 10 m in radius.

40|$|We {{observed}} dynamically new sungrazing comet ISON (C/ 2012 S 1) extensively at Lowell Observatory throughout 2013 {{in order}} to characterize its behavior prior to perihelion. ISON had "typical" abundances for an Oort Cloud comet. Its dust production, as measured by Afrho, remained nearly constant during the apparition but its CN gas production increased by ~ 50 x. The minimum active area necessary to support observed water production rates exceeded the likely surface area of the nucleus and suggests a population of icy grains in the coma. Together with the flattening of the dust radial profile over time, {{this is consistent with}} ejection of a large quantity of slow moving dust and icy grains in the coma at large heliocentric distance. The dust morphology was dominated by the tail, but a faint sunward dust fan was detected in March, April, May, and September. We imaged multiple gas species in September, October, and November. Excess CN signal was observed in the sunward hemisphere in September and early October. In November the excess CN signal was in the tailward hemisphere and two faint CN features appeared approximately orthogonal to the tail with position angles varying by about +/- 20 degrees from night to night. Using numerical modeling, we best reproduced the orientation and shape of these features as well as the bulk brightness with a pole oriented approximately towards the Sun and a single source located within ~ 35 degrees of the equator. The production rates and coma morphology suggest a nucleus that was active over nearly its entire sunward facing hemisphere in September and October but which underwent a significant mass loss event, potentially including fragmentation, shortly before November 1. Significant mass loss likely continued at the same site over subsequent days/weeks and may have catastrophically weakened the nucleus prior to perihelion.
