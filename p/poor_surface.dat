5|$|The club {{decided on}} 4 October 2013 to lay {{artificial}} turf on the field, which it {{hoped would be}} in place ahead of the 2014 season. The club was especially concerned with the <b>poor</b> <b>surface</b> during March, April, October and November. It also cited the possibility of hosting all trainings at the stadium and that the field could be used 2,000 instead of 130 hours per year. The stadium hosted its second international match on 19 November 2013, when Norway was defeated 0–1 Scotland in a friendly match watched by 9,750 spectators. It {{was the first time}} since 2002 that a home Norway game was not played at the national stadium, Ullevaal Stadion.|$|E

50|$|Ride {{quality is}} {{also related to}} good braking and {{acceleration}} on <b>poor</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It protects the car itself, {{as well as its}} passengers and cargo, from vibration that might eventually damage or loosen components of the car.|$|R
50|$|The DS was {{successful}} in motorsports like rallying, where sustained speeds on <b>poor</b> <b>surfaces</b> are paramount, and won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1959. In the 1000 Lakes Rally, Pauli Toivonen drove a DS19 to victory in 1962.|$|R
25|$|Bicycle {{suspensions}} {{are used}} primarily on mountain bicycles, {{but are also}} common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from <b>poor</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some {{of the benefits of}} suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.|$|R
25|$|Although the BMA {{has created}} thirty signed bicycle routes along several roads totalling , cycling is still largely impractical, {{especially}} in the city centre. Most of these bicycle lanes share the pavement with pedestrians. <b>Poor</b> <b>surface</b> maintenance, encroachment by hawkers and street vendors, and a hostile environment for cyclists and pedestrians, make cycling and walking unpopular methods of getting around in Bangkok.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconfiguration}} of {{the venue}} into a geometric stadium shape (a rectangle with semicircles at either end) {{rather than a}} true rectangle shape to allow for use by Aussie rules and cricket has drawn criticism from fans of both rugby codes and soccer. Many are critical that {{the ends of the}} stadium are too far away from the rectangle shaped pitches used for the three sports and that viewing from those sections has been compromised as a result. It has also drawn criticism from Sydney Swans fans and players as well as commentators for its distance from the Sydney CBD, <b>poor</b> <b>surface</b> due to the frequent use of movable seating and poor attendances.|$|E
25|$|The Viastra was envisaged as a one or three-engined {{commercial}} aircraft {{capable of carrying}} ten passengers and designed {{with an eye to}} operations in countries with <b>poor</b> <b>surface</b> transport facilities. Vickers built several variants, largely similar apart from the engines: ultimately, there were Viastras with one, two and three engines. They were high-wing monoplanes, the wings having constant chord, square tips and a thick Raf 24 section. The wings, {{like the rest of the}} aircraft were covered with the corrugated skin and carried balanced ailerons and outboard slots. There was a biplane tail unit with a pair of narrow chord planes, the lower attached to the fuselage underside and the upper mounted clear above. The outboard vertical tail surfaces were again very narrow and served as the main rudders; the single-engined and tri-motor variants also had a small triangular central fin, carrying an auxiliary rudder and supporting the upper horizontal plane. With one exception, the twin-engined Viastras had the central fin and rudder replaced by tubular bracing.|$|E
2500|$|Author Turnock {{claims that}} {{transport}} in the Eastern Bloc was characterised by poor infrastructural maintenance. [...] The road network suffered from inadequate load capacity, <b>poor</b> <b>surfacing</b> and deficient roadside servicing. [...] While roads were resurfaced, few new roads were built {{and there were}} very few divided highway roads, urban ring roads or bypasses. [...] Private car ownership remained low by Western standards.|$|R

50|$|In general, softer rubber, higher {{hysteresis}} {{rubber and}} stiffer cord configurations increase road holding and improve handling. On most types of <b>poor</b> <b>surfaces,</b> large diameter wheels perform better than lower wider wheels. The depth of tread remaining greatly affects aquaplaning (riding over deep water without reaching the road surface). Increasing tire pressures reduces their slip angle, but lessening the contact area is detrimental in usual surface conditions {{and should be}} used with caution.|$|R
500|$|In 1899, as a 13-year-old schoolboy, Collins {{scored the}} highest ever {{recorded}} cricket score of 628 not out. This feat {{took place during}} a junior school house cricket match between Clarke's House and North Town House. Such matches were timeless, played to a finish however long they took. The match was played on an outfield off Guthrie Road, Bristol, now named Collins Piece. The ground had both a <b>poor</b> <b>surface</b> and a very unusual shape: it was very short (only [...] long), with a wall only [...] away forming the boundary on one side, while {{the other side was}} a gentle slope falling away towards the school sanatorium in the distance. The pitch occupied the central [...] of the narrow field, with the boundary only [...] behind each set of stumps. Hits to the long boundary, down the slope, had to be all-run, but the three short boundaries only counted for two runs.|$|E
500|$|Hassett’s {{winning run}} looked {{at an end}} when Australia was exposed to a sticky wicket in the Third Test. The hosts had reached 2/240 {{at the end of}} the first day before rain hit and made the pitch {{extremely}} difficult for batting. The next day, Hassett had to waste time to keep South Africa batting on the <b>poor</b> <b>surface</b> so that Australia’s batsmen would not be exposed to the worst conditions. He then told his bowlers to perform badly so that the hosts would not realise how difficult the pitch was and declare so that Australia would have to face the sticky wicket. Despite Hassett’s subterfuge, the pitch was so poor that South Africa fell to be 311 all out, but Australia had gained extra time. The tourists made only 75, but then dismissed the hosts for 99, Hassett using defensive tactics to slow the scoring and keep South Africa batting as the pitch slowly improved. Australia chased down the target of 336 with five wickets in hand to secure a highly unlikely win. The local newspaper, The Natal Mercury said that [...] "Renowned for their fighting qualities as a cricketers, the occasion brought the best out of the Australians ... That indomitable spirit to win through, no matter what the circumstances may be, was in most marked evidence." ...|$|E

25|$|Considerably {{heavier than}} its {{predecessor}} Soviet-built airliner the Ilyushin Il-18, the Tu-154 was equipped with an oversized landing gear to reduce ground load, enabling it to operate from the same runways. The aircraft has two six-wheel main bogies fitted with large low-pressure tires that retract into pods extending from the trailing edges of the wings (a common Tupolev feature), plus a two-wheel nosegear unit. Soft oleo struts (shock absorbers) provide a much smoother ride on bumpy airfields than most airliners, which very rarely operate on such <b>poor</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|The revolutionary Y-shaped steel chassis had a {{backbone}} {{that divided}} around {{the engine and}} gearbox, and was very light. The suspension was independent all round, making a first for MG and possibly the British motor industry, and used wishbones and longitudinal torsion bars allowing {{a large amount of}} wheel travel to allow for the <b>poor</b> <b>surfaces</b> on many of the contemporary racing circuits, especially Brooklands. Lever arm hydraulic shock absorbers were used. The brakes were cable-operated using 12-inch (305 mm) drums and the wheels were wire spoked and secured by a centre lock nut.|$|R
50|$|This {{suspension}} achieved {{its initial}} design brief, fast travel on <b>poor</b> road <b>surfaces.</b> This advantage is still noted today, especially in applications where ride quality is important, like ambulance design.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kemble has {{returned}} to town for the winter--an event in which I always take pleasure, as she {{is certainly one of}} the women I know whom I like best. I confess I find people in general very vulgar-minded and superficial--and it is only by a pious fiction, to keep myself going, and keep on the social harness, that I succeed in postulating them as anything else or better. It is therefore a kind of rest and refreshment to see a woman who (extremely annoying as she sometimes is) gives one a positive sense of having a deep, rich, human nature and having cast off all vulgarities. The people of this world seem to me for the most part nothing but surface, and sometimes--oh ye gods! such desperately <b>poor</b> <b>surface!</b> Mrs. Kemble has no organized surface at all; she is like a straight deep cistern without a cover, or even, sometimes, a bucket, into which, as a mode of intercourse, one must tumble with a splash. You mustn't judge her by her indifferent book, which is no more a part of her than a pudding she might make.... Please tell William and Alice that I received a short time since their kind note, written on the eve of their going to Newport, and complimenting me on {{the first part of the}} International Episode. You will have read the second part by this time, and I hope that you won't, like many of my friends here (as I partly know and partly suspect,) take it ill of me as against my 'British entertainers.' It seems to me myself that I have been very delicate; but I shall keep off dangerous ground in future. It is an entirely new sensation for them (the people here) to be (at all delicately) ironised or satirised, from the American point of view, and they don't at all relish it. Their conception of the normal in such a relation is that the satire should be all on their side against the Americans; and I suspect that if one were to push this a little further one would find that they are extremely sensitive. But I like them too much and feel too kindly to them to go into the satire-business or even the light-ironical in any case in which it would wound them--even if in such a case I should see my way to it very clearly. Macmillan is just on the point of bringing out Daisy Miller, The International Episode, and Four Meetings in two little big-printed volumes, like those of the Europeans. There is every reason to expect for them a very good success, as Daisy M. has been, as I have told you before, a really quite extraordinary hit. I will send you the new volumes.... Farewell, dearest Mother. I send my filial duty to father, who I hope is worrying comfortably through the winter (I am afraid that since you wrote you have had severe weather)--and looking and listening always for a letter, remain your very lovingest ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{influence}} of selected deep rolling parameters (rolling pressure and number of passes) on the surface integrity of fully annealed AISI 1060 high carbon steel. In addition to the mechanical properties, a comprehensive investigation on surface integrity is carried out. The findings indicate that despite the increase in surface hardness and ultimate tensile stress, deep rolling can negatively affect the yield strength. The amplitude and functional roughness parameters show a considerable reduction after deep rolling,however, increasing rolling pressure and number of passes leads to <b>poorer</b> <b>surface</b> finish. Finally, the tensile residual stress generated by turning shifts to compressive values after deep rolling and the microhardness and microstructure analyses indicate that {{the depth of the}} layer affected by deep rolling depends on both the rolling pressure and number of passes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{study how}} {{different}} oxidants in {{atomic layer deposition}} of aluminium oxide (ALD Al 2 O 3) affect the surface passivation of black silicon. Here we show that processes using ozone cause higher fixed charge but surprisingly lead to lower lifetimes in black silicon samples as compared to water-based samples. In planar samples however, the best surface passivation is reached with O 3 -based processes. In case of water as oxidant, the planar wafers suffer from severe blistering and <b>poorer</b> <b>surface</b> passivation, while {{this seems to be}} the best process for black silicon. To find a reason for the lifetime differences we also study different Al 2 O 3 stacks where both H 2 O and O 3 are used as oxidants. In conclusion, surface texture seems to affect the optimal oxidant in the ALD process...|$|R
