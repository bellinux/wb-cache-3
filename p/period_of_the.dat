5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp's {{activity}} and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets.

5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an {{eccentric}} orbit. Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion resonances with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.|$|E
5|$|During the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new {{telescope}} to discover spots and colorful bands on Jupiter and {{observed that the}} planet appeared oblate; that is, flattened at the poles. He was also able to estimate the rotation <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. In 1690 Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes differential rotation.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} ejects {{streams of}} high-energy electrons and ions (energy up to tens megaelectronvolts), which travel {{as far as}} Earth's orbit. These streams are highly collimated and vary with the rotational <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet like the radio emissions. In this respect as well, Jupiter shows similarity to a pulsar.|$|E
