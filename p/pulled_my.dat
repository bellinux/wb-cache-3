[...] I {{thought it was a}} forward pass and I was looking at the ball being thrown and I was {{signaling}} for a grounding penalty. Then, when I realized the ball was in play, I <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> hands back… The guys played a great game.

2500|$|While {{performing}} {{her song}} [...] "Human Nature" [...] in her concert in Istanbul on June 7, 2012, Madonna briefly exposed her right breast to the audience, before covering it up again. The Sun notes, [...] "Her actions {{may have been}} offensive to some members of her audience, as Turkey is a traditionally Islamic country, with a largely Muslim population" [...] before noting that [...] "Perhaps fans shouldn't have been surprised - as she did warn them, writing No Fear on her back. [...] Amy Odell from BuzzFeed said that criticizing the gesture based on her age sends [...] "a very archaic message", adding that [...] "Women who are 53 still have breasts and... sex drives!". Three days later, The Sun published an article entitled, [...] "Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53." [...] Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna [...] "as a positive role model for older women." [...] While some initially claimed Madonna as [...] "clingy" [...] and [...] "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, [...] "I felt nervous when I <b>pulled</b> <b>my</b> bra down but that’s only natural— Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, {{it was an incredible}} feeling." [...] She goes on to say about Madonna, [...] "She looks incredible now— better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" [...] before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, [...] "If she is a good mother that’s all that matters." [...] Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna [...] "will not change" [...] despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, [...] "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that [...] "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake".|$|E
