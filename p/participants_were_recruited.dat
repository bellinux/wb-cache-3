Michael Bailey used penile plethysmography to measure the arousal of self-identified bisexual men to pornography involving only men and pornography involving only women. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> via advertisements in gay-oriented magazines and an alternative paper. They found that the self-identified bisexual men in their sample had genital arousal patterns similar to either homosexual or heterosexual men. The authors concluded that [...] "in terms of behavior and identity, bisexual men clearly exist", but that male bisexuality had not been shown to exist with respect to arousal or attraction. The assertion of Bailey that [...] "for men arousal is orientation" [...] was criticized by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) as a simplification which neglects to account for behavior and self-identification. [...] Further, some researchers hold that the technique {{used in the study}} to measure genital arousal is too crude to capture the richness (erotic sensations, affection, admiration) that constitutes sexual attraction.

5000|$|Judith Kleinfeld {{argues that}} Milgram's study suffers from {{selection}} and non-response bias {{due to the}} way <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> and high non-completion rates. First, the [...] "starters" [...] were not chosen at random, as they were recruited through an advertisement that specifically sought people who considered themselves well-connected. Another problem {{has to do with}} the attrition rate. If one assumes a constant portion of non-response for each person in the chain, longer chains will be under-represented because it is more likely that they will encounter an unwilling participant. Hence, Milgram's experiment should underestimate the true average path length. Several methods have been suggested to correct these estimates; one uses a variant of survival analysis in order to account for the length information of interrupted chains, and thus reduce the bias in the estimation of average degrees of separation.|$|E
50|$|The trial {{typically}} {{goes through}} stages of: initial registration, ongoing record updates, and basic summary result submission. Each trial record {{is administered by}} trial record manager. A trial record manager typically provides initial trial registration prior the study enrolls the first participant. This also facilitates informing potential participants that the trial is no longer recruiting participants. Once all <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited,</b> the trial record may be updated to indicate that is closed to recruitment. Once all measurements are collected (the trial formally completes), the trial status is updated to 'complete'. If the trial terminates for some reason (e.g., lack of enrollment, evidence of initial adverse outcomes), the status may be updated to 'terminated'. Once final trial results are known or legal deadlines are met, the trial record manager may upload basic summary results to the registry either by filling a complex web-based form or submitting a compliant XML file.|$|E

5000|$|Three {{conditions}} {{must be met}} {{in order}} to confirm the presence of mirror touch synesthesia. The first condition is that the synaesthetic response, which {{is defined as the}} sensation synesthetes feel after observing someone else being touched, should feel like conscious experiences. The second condition is that synesthetic responses are induced by a stimulus that normally does not induce that response. The third condition is that the synesthetic experiences must occur automatically, without conscious thought. In order to examine the prevalence of this condition, a study was conducted at the University College London and University of Sussex. 567 undergraduate <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> and given a questionnaire. From the questionnaire, it was determined that approximately 2.5% of the population experienced mirror-touch synesthesia symptoms. Further studies have shown the prevalence to be 1.6%, meaning that this condition {{is one of the more}} common types of synesthesia, along with grapheme-color synesthesia (1.4%) and day-color synesthesia (2.8%). [...] At the moment it is believed that there are two subtypes of the condition. The first type causes a person to feel sensations on the part of their body that mirrors the observed touch. The second type causes a person to feel sensations on the same side of their body as the observed touch.|$|E

50|$|While most initial {{research}} {{focused on}} OGM in adults, current research {{is looking at}} this phenomenon in children. It is hypothesized that childhood trauma could lead to future OGM. Indeed, Williams originally predicted that childhood trauma was necessary {{for the development of}} OGM. In 1995, a study looked at the relationship between childhood abuse and current OGM. Participants in the study took the autobiographical memory test and were asked about past sexual and physical abuse. This was the first study that showed a correlation between childhood trauma, specifically sexual abuse, and OGM. A similar study in 2003 corroborated these findings. In a study examining inpatient adolescents, it was found that self-reported abuse was significantly correlated with OGM, especially for positively valenced cues.In effort to avoid retrospective reports on abuse, recent research has been examining OGM in families currently involved with social services. Valentino, Toth, and Cicchetti published a study in 2009 that examined the type of maltreatment a child experienced and current OGM. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited</b> via the local Department of Human Services and included families with a substantiated report of abuse or neglect. Compared to both a nonmaltreated group and the neglected group, children who experienced abuse displayed more OGM. In addition to being the first study to look at current maltreatment and OGM, the idea of trauma as a pathway to OGM is significantly supported here, as depression did not mediate the relationship between abuse and OGM. Additionally, neglected children may not have a specific trauma that they attempt to avoid, thus their memory search may not be affected.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{study found}} that [...] "Forty-six percent of the {{homosexual}} men in contrast to 7% of the heterosexual men reported homosexual molestation. Twenty-two percent of lesbian women in contrast to 1% of heterosexual women reported homosexual molestation". However, the study {{has been criticized for}} being non-clinical, for using un-representative samples of homosexuals and heterosexuals, for not reporting how homosexual <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>recruited,</b> for contradictions between the results and their interpretation in the dissertation, for contradictions in the original study and the conclusions drawn in the dissertation and journal, and for implying that the frequency of homosexual self-identification was a consequence of the abuse even though it reports that 68% of men and 62% of women identified as homosexual before their molestation experience. The study is also criticized as some people are aware of their same-sex attraction at very early ages and people usually become aware of their same-sex attractions before they start self-identifying as homosexual; however, the study asked participants about the age at which they regarded themselves as homosexual, not the age at which they became aware of their same-sex attraction, thus rendering it impossible [...] "to be certain about when the abuse occurred - before or after awareness of same-sex attraction." [...] Causation between sexual abuse and homosexuality cannot be inferred by this study. The study itself states that its [...] "homosexual participants may not be representative of all homosexual persons" [...] and that molestation [...] "may not, however, be a causal factor non-heterosexual orientation in either gender." [...] The study has been further criticized for not mentioning the word [...] "molestation" [...] in the questionnaires distributed to participants, using the subjective term [...] "sexual contact" [...] instead, and then switching to using the word [...] "molestation" [...] in the analysis of the data." [...] The study has also come under criticism for relying on the work of Paul Cameron, who was expelled by the American Psychological Association and has been condemned by the American Sociological Association, Canadian Psychological Association and the Nebraska Psychological Association for consistently misinterpreting and misrepresenting scientific research on sexuality, male homosexuality and lesbianism.|$|E

Method: A first sample of 204 cognitively normal <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> <b>recruited</b> in the memory clinic of Broca hospital between 1991 and 1997. A second sample of 177 cognitively normal <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> <b>recruited</b> in 2008 – 2009 in the same institution. Both samples were from the same districts of Paris and were assessed with the same neuropsychological test battery.
