40|$|OBJECTIVE: At {{the time}} of {{licensing}} by regulatory agencies, {{the full range of}} risks and possible adverse drug reactions associated with a medication is rarely fully realized. This commentary aims to describe the role of registries as useful components of postmarketing <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> for monitoring highly specialized medications associated with significant financial costs. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We consider the limitations of traditional pharmacovigilance programs and discuss the strengths, limitations, and uses of registries in postmarketing <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems.</b> RESULTS: Registries have become increasingly appealing in postmarketing surveillance of medications; however, their exact role continues to evolve. Key registry projects, including the Prospective Immunogenicity Surveillance Registry, British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register, Australian Rheumatology Association Database, the Haemostasis Registry, and the Bosentan Patient Registry highlight the value of registries for monitoring the incidence of rare adverse events. CONCLUSION: Although often limited by lack of a control group and the need for complete case ascertainment to maintain data integrity, registries are a useful component of postmarketing <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> for monitoring highly specialized medications associated with significant financial costs.

40|$|Abstract Background Pharmacovigilance {{programmes}} {{can monitor}} and help ensure the safe use of medicines {{that are critical}} to the success of global public health programmes. The widespread deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) by national malaria control programmes as part of the overall Global Malaria Action Plan for malaria control to elimination and eradication makes ACT an excellent candidate for pharmacovigilance activities. In 2008, The Roll Back Malaria partnership issued guidelines for inclusion of pharmacovigilance in Global Fund and other related proposals. In light of this recommendation and the rapid scale-up of ACT worldwide, an analysis of Global Fund Round 8 proposals and the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) 2009 Malaria Operational Plans was conducted to assess if and how pharmacovigilance has been incorporated into countries' national malaria plans and donor budget requests. Methods The Global Fund - Malaria Round 8 proposals for the 26 countries and the PMI Malaria Operational Plans (MOPs) for fiscal year 2009 for the 15 countries that were approved and received funding from either the Global Fund - Malaria Round 8 or PMI were accessed through the programme websites. The analysis consisted of conducting word counts and key word in context analyses of each proposal and plan. Results Twelve out of 26 (46 %) of the Global Fund proposals mentioned that established <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> were present in their countries. Four of the fifteen PMI MOPs (27 %) mentioned that established <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> were present in their countries. Only seven of the 26 (27 %) Global Fund proposals included a request for funding for new or current pharmacovigilance activities. Seven of 15 (47 %) MOPs included a request for funding for pharmacovigilance activities. Conclusions There were relatively few requests for funding for pharmacovigilance activities, demonstrating a lack of emphasis placed on <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> in recipient countries. The findings stress the need for more active direction to strengthen active surveillance and passive adverse event reporting systems to augment the issuance of guidance documents. </p...|$|R

Aim: To {{assess the impact of}} a <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>system</b> carried out by a pharmacist. Material and Methods: In an internal medicine service, the spontaneous report of ADRs was compared blindly with an active <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>system</b> in which a pharmacist detected, monitored and prevented ADRs. Results: A total of 1, 196 patients was included. Of these 604 were hospitalized in intervened wards, where 50 suspected ADRs in 47 patients were reported. In non-intervened wards, only three ADRs were spontaneously reported. Therefore, the <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>system</b> significantly improved the detection and report of ADRs with a risk ratio of 15. 4 (95 % confidence intervals 4. 8 - 49. 1). Sixty six percent of ADRs were classified as severe. Antimicrobials were the main group of medications causing ADRs in 44 % of reports.

METHODS: A retrospective population-based study was carried out in Southwest France in five institutions: three main hospitals, one private clinic and one cardiac emergency unit, searched from 1 January 1999 to 1 January 2005 (population coverage of 614 000). The study population consisted of 861 cases with International Classification of Diseases- 10 diagnostic codes for ventricular tachycardia (I 147. 2), ventricular fibrillation (I 149. 0) and sudden cardiac death (I 146. 1) from hospital discharge summaries, supplemented by cases reported to national or regional <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems,</b> and voluntary reporting by physicians, validated according to internationally defined criteria for drug-induced LQTS. RESULTS: Of 861 patients coded with arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death, there were 40 confirmed surviving acquired cases of drug-induced LQTS. We estimated that the incidence of those who survive to reach hospital drug-induced LQTS is approximately 10. 9 per million annually in France (95 % confidence interval 7. 8, 14. 8). CONCLUSIONS: Many cases of drug-induced LQTS may not survive before they reach hospital, as the reporting rate for drug-induced LQTS identified through the cardiology records and also reported to <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> for the Midi-Pyrenees area is 3 / 40 (7. 5 %).

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the knowledge and awareness of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reporting and <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>system</b> among healthcare professionals in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah hospitals, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was designed addressing; awareness of ADRs, knowledge of <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>system,</b> availability of ADRs reporting system, patient counseling about ADRs and documentation of ADRs. The questionnaire was distributed to randomly selected healthcare professionals (n= 585) such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and pharmacists’ technicians of hospitals. Completed questionnaires were collected and data were analyzed. Data were expressed in number as well as percentage. Of the 585 questionnaires circulated, a total of 384 healthcare professionals responded. Healthcare professional categories involved in the study were 148 physicians, 37 pharmacists, 158 nurses and 41 pharmacist technicians. The percent of the respondents who accepted to enroll in the study was 65. 64 %. Most of the respondents were unable to correctly define the pharmacovigilance term, but they were aware of ADRs. The awareness among healthcare professionals of the national <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>system</b> was 39. 6 %. Pharmacists had a good knowledge of pharmacovigilance and ADRs terminology and showed a more positive attitude to report ADRs. A greater number of the healthcare professionals were aware of ADRs reporting, but practically it is not implemented in hospitals. Most hospitals had follow-up documentation systems, but did not include ADRs reporting. There was no distinct <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>system</b> in place.

Prompt ADR reporting is crucial in ensuring drug safety. The aim of this narrative review was to highlight the role of pharmacists in pharmacovigilance and to identify barriers and facilitators toward ADR reporting documented in the literature. The perspective of pharmacy students on pharmacovigilance and ADR reporting has also been discussed with an aim to highlight the need to improve content related to ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance in undergraduate pharmacy curriculum. Globally, although the role of pharmacists within national <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> varies, it is very well recognized. In general, pharmacists acknowledge that ADR reporting is part of their professional responsibility and have a positive attitude toward reporting ADRs. However, current research evidence suggests that there are still critical knowledge gaps with regard to ADR reporting among pharmacists, especially in countries where the role of pharmacists within the health care system is limited. These knowledge gaps can be fulfilled through continuous professional development programs and reinforcing theoretical and practical knowledge in undergraduate pharmacy curriculums. Without adequately identifying and fulfilling training needs of pharmacists and other health care professionals, the efficiency of national <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> is unlikely to improve which may compromise patient’s safety.

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Globally, national <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> rely on spontaneous reporting in which suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{are reported to}} a national coordi-nating centre by health professionals, manufacturers or patients. Spontaneous reporting systems are the easiest to establish and the cheapest to run but suffer from poor-quality reports and underreporting. It is difficult to estimate rates and frequencies of ADRs through spontaneous reporting. Public health programmes need to quantify and characterize risks to individuals and communities from their medicines, to minimize harm and improve use, to sustain {{public confidence in the}} programmes, and to track problems due to medication errors and poor quality medi-cines. Additional methods are therefore needed to monitor the quantitative aspects of medicine safety, to better iden-tify specific risk factors and high-risk groups, and to characterize ADRs associated with specific medicines and in specific populations. The present paper introduces two methods, cohort event monitoring and targeted spontane-ous reporting, that are being implemented by the WHO, in its public health programmes, to complement spontaneous reporting.

For this reason public health protection is not guaranteed. Purpose: To identify the various systems employed in different regions to monitor/manage the risks and benefits of off-label use; and to ascertain their extent of implementation. Method/search strategy: Electronic and manual literature search was done. Articles referring to off-label medicine use were reviewed. The literature included journal articles, national MRA guidelines, international guidelines, etc. The articles were sourced from databases such as Pubmed and Google Scholar. Data was collected from both developed and emerging markets. There was no limit to publication date. Findings: <b>Pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> for off-label use do exist although the degree of commitment and advancement differs per country. Explicit off-label laws are present in the developed countries but not in the developing ones. Implications of findings: Stakeholder involvement is very important in monitoring off-label use. Reporting of ADRs can be improved by asserting the role of off-label PV in drug repositioning. The regulator is under pressure to maintain public trust through efficient control of off-label use...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacovigilance, {{defined as}} "the science and {{activities}} {{relating to the}} detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drug related problem", is increasingly being recognized in Africa. Many African countries have simultaneously adopted artemisinin derivative based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, offering an opportunity to assess the safety of these drugs when used widely. While ACTs appear {{to be safe and}} well-tolerated, there is little experience with these medicines in Africa, outside clinical trials. Pharmacovigilance for ACTs and other combination treatments in Africa is essential. Malaria transmission intensity is high and antimalarial medicines are used frequently. Presumptive treatment of fever with antimalarials is common, often {{in the absence of a}} confirmed diagnosis, using drugs obtained without a prescription. Informal use of antimalarial drugs may increase the risk of incorrect dosing, inappropriate treatment, and drug interactions, which may impact negatively on drug safety. Furthermore, the administration of antimalarial treatments in patients with a concomitant illness, including HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis and malnutrition, is a concern. African countries are being encouraged to establish <b>pharmacovigilance</b> <b>systems</b> as ACTs are rolled out. However, pharmacovigilance is difficult, even in countries with a well-developed health care system. The rationale for pharmacovigilance of antimalarial drugs is discussed here, outlining the practical challenges and proposing approaches that could be adopted in Africa...|$|R
