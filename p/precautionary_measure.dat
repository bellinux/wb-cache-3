5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached Texas, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings for potentially affected areas beginning on July18. Ships and ports were also continuously notified on the oncoming storm, which helped to keep offshore shipping accidents to a minimum.

5|$|Exports {{from the}} Hovensa oil {{refinery}} in St. Croix, with a daily production of roughly , were canceled as ports across the island were closed. All businesses {{were shut down}} in Dominica on September3 due to the storm. In Antigua and Barbuda, all schools and the local airport were closed as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure.</b> Two cruise ships, the Carnival Glory and a Royal Caribbean ship postponed their docking dates and stayed at sea for a few additional days. The islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy were placed under an orange alert, the second-lowest alert level, and Guadeloupe was placed under a yellow alert, the lowest alert level. In Puerto Rico, officials closed schools and government offices on September4 and opened 433 shelters across the island. Officials in the Dominican Republic placed nine provinces under warnings as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure.</b> Nearby Haiti was also alerted {{of the possibility of}} heavy rains.|$|E
30|$|Precautionary costs, {{operational}} costs and stock-out costs are closely related. When determining {{the level of}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures,</b> the operational and stock-out costs due to delays are taken into account. The more <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> that are taken, the fewer the {{operational costs}} will be later on. However, once <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> are fixed, operational and stock-out costs arise for every delay that occurs (for the part of delay costs {{not covered by the}} <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures).</b>|$|R
30|$|As the firms’ {{expected}} {{marginal costs}} of variability {{are difficult to}} estimate, we think that a more promising approach is to estimate the marginal cost of <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> for a given variability in the transport system. The marginal cost of <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> might be computed from a theoretical model for buffer stocks or buffer time with appropriately estimated parameter values; here, however, we take {{as a proxy for}} marginal costs the average costs for <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> and relate the average costs to different measures of variability. Assuming that average costs can approximate marginal costs, the marginal cost for <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> is observable given appropriate company data, since firms are investing in their logistic systems to handle the variability in transportation times they are facing.|$|R
40|$|Building {{houses in}} {{inundation}} areas {{is always a}} risk, since absolute flood protection is impossible. Where settlements already exist, flood damage must be kept as small as possible. Suitable means are <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> such as elevated building configuration or flood adapted use. However, data {{about the effects of}} such measures are rare, and consequently, the efficiency of different <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> is unclear. To improve the knowledge about efficient <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures,</b> approximately 1200 private households, which were affected by the 2002 flood at the river Elbe and its tributaries, were interviewed about the flood damage of their buildings and contents as well as about their <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures.</b> The affected households had little flood experience, i. e. only 15 % had experienced a flood before. 59 % of the households stated that they did not know, that they live in a flood prone area. Thus, people were not well prepared, e. g. just 11 % had used and furnished their house in a flood adapted way and only 6 % had a flood adapted building structure. Building <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> are mainly effective in areas with frequent small floods. But also during the extreme flood event in 2002 building measures reduced the flood loss. From the six different building <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures</b> under study, flood adapted use and adapted interior fitting were the most effective ones. They reduced the damage ratio for buildings by 46 % and 53 %, respectively. The damage ratio for contents was reduced by 48 % due to flood adapted use and by 53 % due to flood adapted interior fitting. The 2002 flood motivated a relatively large number of people to implement private <b>precautionary</b> <b>measures,</b> but still much more could be done.

5|$|In Guadeloupe, {{damage from}} the storm was limited; potent gusts uprooted {{numerous}} trees and blew debris onto streets throughout Basse-Terre. One road was blocked off to traffic during its passage as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure,</b> but was reopened soon thereafter. Gale-force winds downed some electricity lines in Saint Kitts and Nevis, causing two island-wide outages. The storm enhanced moisture to produce intermittent torrents over the Virgin Islands, with localized totals {{of no more than}} 1inch (25mm). Winds in the area were also limited; the highest gust was experienced on Buck Island, measuring 52mph (83km/h).|$|E
5|$|The Sutton Wick air crash {{occurred}} on 5 March 1957 when a Blackburn Beverley C Mk 1 heavy transport aircraft, serial number XH117, of 53 Squadron Royal Air Force crashed at Sutton Wick, Drayton, Berkshire, England, following a shut-down of one engine and partial {{loss of power}} on another. Shortly after take-off, No. 1 engine was shut down as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> then whilst on final approach back to RAF Abingdon, No. 2 engine {{failed to respond to}} throttle inputs.

5|$|Ahead of the storm, all {{ports in}} Gujarat, {{including}} Kandla, {{one of the}} largest in the country, were closed as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure.</b> On May25, over 10,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in the threatened region. Throughout India, a total of 118,800 people were evacuated and 100,000 more were evacuated in Pakistan. The Indian military was placed on standby to undertake search-and-rescue missions immediately after the storms' passage. Fourteen districts of Gujarat were placed on red alert, the highest level of preparedness. Seven emergency control centers were set up across the country and officials alerted hospitals and fire crews about the approaching storm.|$|E

On December1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm. As a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure,</b> the nations electric grid was shut down at 6:00p.m. local time on December2.

5|$|Hannibal {{served with}} the Channel Fleet (later reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet) after {{commissioning}} in 1898. In 1906 she underwent a refit, which included a conversion from a coal burner to using oil. She was placed in reserve from 1907, only to be mobilised in July 1914 as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> prior to the outbreak of World War I. From August 1914 to February 1915 Hannibal was a guard ship at Scapa Flow. Later that year, her main armament was removed and she was converted to a troopship, serving in this capacity during the Dardanelles campaign. From November 1915 {{to the end of}} the war, she served as a depot ship based in Alexandria, Egypt. She was disposed of in 1920 and scrapped later that year.|$|E

5|$|Nanda and Hiranandani {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure,</b> to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 knots.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the storm's first {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings beginning on August29 for areas of Florida's east coast from Palm Beach south to Key West, while storm warnings were issued from Key West to Boca Grande on the peninsula's western coast. Electrical power was purposely stopped in Miami as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> {{prior to the}} storm's landfall.

5|$|When {{the motion}} of Juliette turned to the northeast, some {{computer}} models predicted it to continue northeastward and strike Baja California Sur. As a result, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch as a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> for portions of the state.

Juliette remained away from land masses for its lifetime, {{and as a result}} there were no reports of damage or deaths. In southern California, however, the hurricane produced high waves that created dangerous surfing conditions. These waves wiped out a fishing derby. The remnants of Hurricane Juliette moved into New Mexico and western Texas, producing scattered showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a <b>precautionary</b> <b>measure</b> and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
