These positions disclosed {{themselves by}} firing at Australian patrols, which now went out nightly, mapping the antitank ditch and {{the barbed wire}} obstacles. Aerial photographs of the <b>positions</b> <b>were</b> taken by Westland Lysander aircraft of No. 208 Squadron RAF, escorted by Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters of No. 3 Squadron RAAF. British Intelligence estimated {{the strength of the}} Italian garrison at 20 to 23,000 with 100 guns, and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated—a serious intelligence failure.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between them. It was realised that prepared <b>positions</b> <b>were</b> needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called fästen, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other <b>positions</b> <b>were</b> concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.|$|E

5000|$|Chargaff's second rule {{appears to}} be the {{consequence}} of a more complex parity rule: within a single strand of DNA any oligonucleotide is present in equal numbers to its reverse complementary nucleotide. Because of the computational requirements this has not been verified in all genomes for all oligonucleotides. It has been verified for triplet oligonucleotides for a large data set. Albrecht-Buehler has suggested that this rule is the consequence of genomes evolving by a process of inversion and transposition. This process {{does not appear to have}} acted on the mitochondrial genomes. Chargaff's second parity rule {{appears to be}} extended from the nucleotide-level to populations of codon triplets, in the case of whole single-stranded Human genome DNA. A kind of [...] "codon-level second Chargaff's parity rule" [...] is proposed as follows: Codon populations where 1st base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> T are identical to codon populations where 3rd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> A: [...] « % codons Twx ~ % codons yzA » (where Twx and yzA are mirror codons, e.g. TCG and CGA).

Codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> T are identical to codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> A: [...] « % codons wTx ~ % codons yAz » (where wTx and yAz are mirror codons, e.g. CTG and CAG). Codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> C are identical to codon populations where 2nd base <b>position</b> <b>is</b> G: « % codons wCx ~ % codons yGz » (where wCx and yGz are mirror codons, e.g. TCT and AGA).
