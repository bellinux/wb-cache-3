The defendant has but a limited number of remedies and procedural tactics to react upon the claimant’s forum shopping or anticipate it – which requires imagination and skilful reflection of all the conceivable steps to be taken by the plaintiff: ADR, anti-suit injunctions (only rarely available in continental Europe, however), declaratory actions for denial, torpedo suits, and, sometimes, the forum-non-conveniens objection. In order to keep undue excesses in forum shopping under control, it seems necessary that the international community, too, in conventions and treaties, agrees on reducing the choices and on banning exorbitant jurisdictions in national laws...|$|R
40|$|Building on the {{historic}} work of Huffman (Demaine et al. 2011), {{there has been}} increasing recent interest in the digital design and architectural application of curved-crease folded (CCF) geometries. This is particularly timely, given the new possibilities of producing curved surfaces from flat sheet material afforded by developments in robotic technology. However there are difficulties in interactively modelling such geometries, which stem {{from the lack of}} both appropriate geometric descriptions and constructive tools available in commercial CAD software. The author’s initial survey of methods included both the iterative optimization-based methods and simple constructive methods. Most methods presented difficulties for incorporation within an intuitive, real-time, edit-and-observe exploratory method. This research overcomes attempts to overcome these difficulties through the use of Dynamic Relaxation (DR) (Day 1965) for the interactive modelling of CCF geometries. It applies discrete differential operators and their gradients(Meyer et al. 2003), within a DR framework, to perturb meshes to satisfy the geometric criteria of CCF geometries outlined in Kilian et al. (2008). This research also outlines <b>procedural</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> generating appropriate topologies of an initial mesh, and a novel method for applying boundary conditions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates two complementary {{ideas in}} the literature on machine learning and robotics those of embodiment and intrinsic motivation|to address a unied framework for skill learning and knowledge acquisition. Embodied systems make use of structure derived directly from sensory and motor congurations for learning behavior. Intrinsically motivated systems learn by searching for native, hedonic value through interaction with the world. Psychological theories of intrinsic motivation suggest that there exist internal drives favoring open-ended cognitive development and exploration. I argue that intrinsically motivated, embodied systems can learn generalizable skills, acquire control knowledge, and form an epistemological understanding of {{the world in terms of}} behavioral aordances. I propose that the development of behavior results from the assembly of an agent 2 ̆ 7 s sensory and motor resources into state and action spaces that can be explored autonomously. I introduce an intrinsic reward function that can lead to the open-ended learning of hierarchical behavior. This behavior is factored into declarative recipes for patterned activity and common sense <b>procedural</b> <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> implementing them in a variety of run-time contexts. These skills form a categorical basis for the robot to interpret and model its world in terms of the behavior it aords. Experiments conducted on a bimanual robot illustrate a progression of cumulative manipulation behavior addressing manual and visual skills. Such accumulation of skill over the long-term by a single robot is a novel contribution that has yet to be demonstrated in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{political}} {{transition in}} May 1998 {{set the stage}} for the passing of Indonesia's framework decentralisation laws (numbers 22 and 25 of 1999). These laws include both political and technocratic efforts to devolve authority from the centre (Jakarta) to the peripheries. Contrary to expectations, enhanced public participation often takes the form of indigenous (adat) revivalism, a highly contested and contingent process linked to intensified political struggles and conflicts throughout the archipelago. This thesis considers the ways in which decentralisation and adat revivalism intersect by foregrounding specific, localised struggles for rights and recognition in Sulawesi,, eastern Indonesia. Year-long research for this thesis was conducted at national, provincial, and local levels, with an emphasis on case studies from the districts of Bulukumba, East Luwu, Gowa, Majene, North Luwu, Palopo, and Tana Toraja. The core chapters of this thesis suggest that the innate, primordial givens of indigenous communities are being selectively drawn upon, finely-tuned, and exemplified in the search for political rights and recognition. It is argued, therefore, that village communities are increasingly engaged in a process of "becoming indigenous, " a process largely driven, instrumentalised, and distorted by external actors such as NGO activists and legal advocates. Local disputes increasingly derive from the primary, exigent right of recognition, and then extend to remedial rights including customary tenure, resource entitlement, and the right to return to antedated systems of governance. In the era of decentralisation there is no unified, grand <b>procedural</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> dealing with the political challenges posed by adat revivalism. In response to the devolution of authority from Jakarta to the peripheries, however, the political contours of conflict mediation and dispute resolution are being reconfigured, and the roles of all protagonists are evolving (or regressing) accordingly. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Strategy-focussed writing {{instruction}} trains students both to set explicit product {{goals and}} to adopt specific <b>procedural</b> <b>strategies,</b> particularly <b>for</b> planning text. A {{number of studies}} have demonstrated that strategy-focussed writing instruction is effective in developing writing performance. Aim: The present study aimed to determine whether teaching process strategies provides additional benefit over teaching students to set product goals. Sample: 94 typically developing Spanish sixth-grade (upper primary) students. Method: Students received 10 hours of instruction in one of three conditions: Strategy-focussed training in setting product goals and in writing procedures (planning and revision; Product-and-Process), strategy-focussed training in setting product goals (Product-Only), and product-focussed instruction (Control). Students' writing performance was assessed before, during, and after intervention with process measures based on probed self-report and holistic and text-analytic measures of text quality. Results: Training that included process instruction was successful in changing students' writing processes, with no equivalent process changes in the Product-Only or control conditions. Both Process-and-Product and Product-Only conditions resulted in substantial improvements in the quality of students' texts relative to controls, but with no evidence of benefits of process instruction over those provided by the Product-Only condition. Teaching process substantially increased time-on-task. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the value of strategy-focussed writing instruction, but question the value of training specific process strategies...|$|R

Method Participants were 23 typically developing 4 th graders (9 - to 10 -year-olds). In a behavioral session, they were asked to solve 100 subtraction and multiplication items, and to verbally report how they solved them. In the fMRI scanning session, the children were presented with 80 of those items.

Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the anatom-ical characteristics complicating cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation {{and the effectiveness of}} various <b>procedural</b> <b>strategies.</b> Methods and Results: This study included 446 consecutive patients (362 males; mean age 60. 5 ± 10. 4 years) in whom CTI ablation was performed. A total of 80 consecutive patients were evaluated in a preliminary study. The anatomy of the CTI was evaluated by multidetector row-computed tomography (MDCT) prior to the procedure. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the angle and mean wall thickness of the CTI, a concave CTI morphology, and a prominent Eustachian ridge, were associated with a difficult CTI ablation (P < 0. 01). In the main study, 366 consecutive patients were divided into 2 groups: a modulation group (catheter inversion technique for a concave aspect, prominent Eustachian ridge, and steep angle of the CTI or increased output for a thicker CTI) and nonmodulation group (conventional strategy). The duration and total amount of radiofrequency energy delivered were significantly shorter and smaller in the modulation group than those in the nonmodulation group (162. 2 ± 153. 5 vs 222. 7 ± 191. 9 seconds, P < 0. 01, and 16, 962. 4 ± 11, 545. 6 vs 24, 908. 5 ± 22, 804. 2 J, P < 0. 01, respectively).

BackgroundThe surgical strategy of conventional aortic valve replacement does not accept paraprosthetic leakage and requires immediate action to eliminate it. However, paravalvular leakage is the major concern after TAVI. MethodsA total of 358 patients underwent transapical TAVI with balloon-expandable prostheses. The modified <b>procedural</b> <b>strategy</b> consisted of precise positioning of the prosthesis using a modified TAVI technique and immediate additional intraprocedural treatment to eliminate relevant paravalvular leakage. ResultsBalloon redilation of the transcatheter valve was performed in 18 patients (5 %), and additional second valves were implanted in 13 (4 %). At the end of the procedure, 186 patients (52 %) had no paravalvular or transvalvular regurgitation. In the remaining 172 patients, paravalvular leakage was observed in 113 (32 %), transvalvular leakage in 47 (13 %), and both in 12 (3 %). Leakage was trace in 88 patients (25 %), mild in 82 (23 %), and moderate in 2 (0. 6 %). Multivariate analysis identified male sex, New York Heart Association functional class IV, and no previous aortic valve replacement as predictors of post-procedural leakage. Cumulative survival was not dependent on post-procedural regurgitation rate. Overall mortality was 5 ± 1 % at 30 days, 14 ± 2 % at 6 months, 17 ± 2 % at 1 year, and 33 ± 4 % at 2 years.

40|$|Introduction Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that a fronto-parietal network is consistently activated during arithmetic in adults, {{and that it is}} modulated by strategy use. In children, some studies have suggested such alternate activation, but never checked the children’s actual strategy use on a trial-by-trial basis. The current study is the first to investigate neural activation while taking individual differences in children’s arithmetic strategy use into account, which is crucial considering the large developmental changes in strategies. Method Participants were 26 typically developing 4 th graders. In a behavioral session, all children were asked to verbally report how they had solved 100 subtraction and multiplication items, which were subsequently presented during fMRI. By implementing an event-related design, we have analyzed the brain responses during retrieval and <b>procedural</b> <b>strategy</b> use trials, based on the children’s verbal reports.

The current study is thus the first in children to identify the brain networks underlying specific arithmetic strategies and to reveal that previously found operation differences are explained by the used strategy. status: accepte...|$|R

Different arithmetical strategies rely on working memory to different extents-for example, verbal working memory has been found to be more important <b>for</b> <b>procedural</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as counting and decomposition, than <b>for</b> retrieval <b>strategies.</b> Surprisingly, given the close connection between spatial and mathematical skills, the role of visuospatial working memory has received less attention and is poorly understood. This study used a dual-task methodology to investigate the impact of a dynamic spatial n-back task (Experiment 1) and tasks loading the visuospatial sketchpad and central executive (Experiment 2) on adults' use of counting, decomposition, and direct retrieval <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> addition. While Experiment 1 suggested that visuospatial working memory plays an important role in arithmetic, especially when counting, the results of Experiment 2 suggested this was primarily due to the domain-general executive demands of the n-back task. Taken together, these results suggest that maintaining visuospatial information in mind is required when adults solve addition arithmetic problems by any strategy but the role of domain-general executive resources is much greater than that of the visuospatial sketchpad. © 2013 The Author(s).

40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} {{principle}} {{and the main}} steps of a new method for the visuo-spatial analysis of geometrical sketches recorded online. Visuo-spatial analysis is a necessary step for multi-level analysis. Multi-level analysis simultaneously allows classification, comparison or clustering of the constituent parts of a pattern according to their visuo-spatial properties, their <b>procedural</b> <b>strategies,</b> their structural or temporal parameters, or any combination {{of two or more}} of those parameters. The first results provided by this method concern the comparison of sketches to some perfect patterns of simple geometrical figures and the measure of dissimilarity between real sketches. The mean rates of good decision higher than 95 % obtained are promising in both cases...|$|R
