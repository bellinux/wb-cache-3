5|$|Early in {{the second}} period, the game was <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence in memory of four Swift Current Broncos players who were killed when their team bus crashed in Saskatchewan five days previous. There was a drop in {{intensity}} in the five minutes of play that followed. However, just after the six-minute mark, following a minor scuffle that sent two players from each team to the penalty box, the teams resumed shoving and slashing at each other. Each team also scored a goal, giving Canada a 4–2 lead halfway through the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{show had}} an expandable, five-platform stage which {{displayed}} the album's cover art. Madonna, wearing a skintight black {{suit and a}} lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne with a golden walking stick, as the music of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking {{the back of the}} stage. Madonna, along with her six dancers, gyrated in choreographed dance moves. Next, Madonna strapped on an acoustic guitar, took a swig from a champagne bottle and started singing [...] "Miles Away", as images of planes taking off and landing, airports and various locations around the globe were projected across the screens behind her. After that [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was performed, which mimicked its video with a flashing countdown clock. Then Madonna <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to thank her collaborators, including Timberlake, West, Timbaland and others. [...] "I feel like the luckiest girl in the world", she said, before dedicating the next song, [...] "Hung Up" [...] from 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, to her fans. The song was mixed with The Rolling Stones track [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It was followed by [...] "Give It 2 Me", during which pink and green disco beams pulsated across the crowd. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Music" [...] (2000), during which her dancers emerged from a false, silver subway car door. Madonna danced across the stage, touching the hands of the audience and ended the show by racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|Faith Cole MacLean and her husband, actor Douglas MacLean, were Taylor's neighbors, and Faith {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have seen Taylor's killer. The couple was startled by a loud noise at 8pm. MacLean went to her front door and saw someone emerging {{from the front door}} of Taylor’s home who she said was dressed, [...] "like my idea of a motion picture burglar". She recalled this person <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before turning and walking back through the door, as if having forgotten something, then re-emerged and flashed a smile at her before disappearing between the buildings. MacLean decided she had heard a car back-fire. She also told police interviewers this person looked [...] "funny" [...] (like movie actors in makeup) and may have been a woman disguised as a man.|$|E

2500|$|Gan Ning {{was unhappy}} with Huang Zu and wanted to leave him, but was worried that Huang would not allow it, so he felt very frustrated. Su Fei was aware of Gan Ning's intention, so he invited him for drinks and said, [...] "I {{recommended}} you to Huang Zu many times, but he doesn't {{want to give you}} important responsibilities. Days pass by and people become older. You should make plans for the future and find someone who truly appreciates your talents." [...] Gan Ning <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before replying, [...] "That's what I've in mind, but I can't find an excuse to leave." [...] Su Fei then said, [...] "I'll suggest to Huang Zu to appoint you as the Chief (長) of Zhu County (邾縣; northwest of present-day Huanggang, Hubei). The initial phase is difficult, but after you reach it, it'll be much easier for you to decide where to go from there." [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Great." [...] Huang Zu approved Su Fei's suggestion. Gan Ning managed to gather a few hundred men who were willing to follow him, and they headed towards Zhu.|$|E
2500|$|Courtney's {{first loss}} came on October 3, 1878, {{when he lost}} to Canadian {{champion}} Ned Hanlan in a very close [...] single scull race near Lachine, Quebec with about 20,000 spectators for a $10,000 prize. Hanlan had won the professional single scull title at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia when Courtney had won the amateur title, and {{was considered one of}} the best professional rowers of the time. For the first four miles (6km) the lead changed hands several times, but as they entered the last mile, Hanlan slowly but surely went to the front and was leading by three lengths at the 4-mile mark. Near the finish, both Hanlan and Courtney had to deal with a group of boats that had wandered inside the racing lane. Both rowers <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then Hanlan shot around them and over the finish line. Before the race there were rumors that Courtney had agreed to throw the race for a guaranteed percentage of the prize. The New York Times investigated and could not find any truth to the rumors, calling him the [...] "most unjustly accused man in the country today." [...] Courtney reported that he lost $1,350 of his own money betting on the race. Because of the effect of the rumors on his reputation and family, Courtney stated he didn’t know if he would row again.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, the Jinwu {{guards were}} in Hanyuan Hall, {{along with the}} Jingzhao Municipal {{government}} police under Luo Liyan and office of imperial censors' guards under Li Xiaoben, attacking the eunuchs. [...] More than 10 eunuchs were killed or injured, but this attack was unable to prevent the eunuchs from carrying Emperor Wenzong's litter through Xuanzheng Gate (...) , into the palace. [...] Li Xun, who was still {{holding on to the}} litter, urged Emperor Wenzong to stop, but Emperor Wenzong yelled at him to stop yelling. [...] The eunuch Chi Zhirong (...) battered Li Xun's chest, and Li Xun fell onto the ground. [...] The litter then entered Xuanzheng Gate, and the gate was closed. [...] The eunuchs were cheering. [...] The officers lined up at Hanyuan Hall <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then fled. [...] Li Xun, knowing that he had failed, put on a green uniform belonging to his staff members, got onto a horse, and fled, stating loudly on the road, [...] "What crime did I commit that I am exiled?" [...] No one on the road suspected him of being Li Xun. [...] Meanwhile, Shu Yuanyu, along with other chancellors Wang Ya and Jia Su returned {{to the office of the}} chancellors, and believed that soon Emperor Wenzong would summon them to deal with the aftermath. [...] When the officials under them came to inquire what had occurred, they told those subordinates to keep working and not to worry.|$|E
