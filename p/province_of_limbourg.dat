After a long controversy, the Campine became a separate breed with its own breed standard on 28 August 1904. After further controversy, the two breeds were reunited under a single standard in 1925 or 1926, with the name Kempisch-Braekel. In 1962 it was decided that the Campine type had entirely disappeared, {{and the name of the}} Belgian breed was changed to Brakelhoen.|$|E

50|$|Dolhain is the {{industrial}} {{centre of the}} city <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg,</b> in the Belgian <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Liege.

The Gothic church of St George of the 13th century has been restored. At a short distance from Dolhain is the famous dam of the Gileppe, the vast reservoir constructed to supply Verviers with water free from lime for its cloth manufactures.

40|$|Since 2000 three Ponto-Caspian invaders {{have been}} found in canals in the {{province}} of Antwerp (N. E. -Belgium) : the freshwater polychaete Hypania invalida (Grube, 1860), the triclad Dendrocoelum romanodanubiale (Codreanu, 1949) and the freshwater isopod Jaera istri Veuille, 1979. Staff members of the 'Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij (Flemish Environmental Agency) collected these species on artificial substrates (nets filled with broken bricks). H. invalida had been discovered before in Belgium in the river Meuse in 2000 (Vanden Bossche et. al., 2001). D. romanodanubiale and J. istri were never recorded before in Belgium. Before its discovery in the Belgian Meuse in August-September 2000, H. invalida had already been found in May 2000 in the Albert Canal at Genk in the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg.</b> Between 2001 and 2003, the polychaete was sampled at several stations of the Albert Canal and its adjacent canals in the provinces of Antwerp and Limbourg. Here, it often is accompanied by D. romanodanubiale and J. istri. In 2003 the polychaet had also been encountered in the Sea canal Brussels - Scheldt in the province of Antwerp. The discontinuous distribution indicates that navigation {{plays an important role in}} the dispersal of the species. Other Ponto-Caspian species such as Dikerogammarus villosus (Sovinskij, 1894) are either already present in the canals or soon to be expected there. Some of these species will probably also invade the Scheldt basin...|$|E

5000|$|The name Limburgish (and {{variants}} of it) derives only indirectly from the now Belgian town <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg</b> (Laeboer in Limburgish, IPA: [...] ), {{which was the}} capital of the Duchy of Limburg during the Middle Ages.

5000|$|The Belgian <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Limburg in Flanders (Dutch {{speaking}} Belgium) is {{a region}} {{which has had}} many names and border changes over its long recorded history. Its modern name is a name shared with the neighbouring <b>province</b> <b>of</b> the Netherlands, with which {{it was for a}} while politically united (under French and then Dutch rule from 1794 until 1839). And in turn both <b>of</b> these <b>provinces</b> received their modern name only in the 19th century, based upon the name of the medieval Duchy of Limburg which was actually based in neighbouring Wallonia, in the town <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg</b> on the Vesdre.For much of its recorded history, most of what is now called Belgian Limburg was known as Loon (French Looz). Loon was a medieval county, and when the line of the Counts died the area became part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège but was still {{often referred to as the}} [...] "land of Loon" [...] (land van Loon in Dutch).

50|$|The colours of {{the flag}} of Luxembourg were first adopted around 1830 during the Belgian Revolution.

5000|$|Even {{before the}} actual {{incorporation}} of all of Wallonia, the Germans also seriously considered annexing, in addition to Luxembourg, the small German-speaking (Lëtzebuergesh) area centered on Arlon to a [...] "bordering region of the Reich", presumably under the civil administrator of Gau Koblenz-Trier (from 1942 Moselland). In the May and June 1940, the German occupiers also discussed annexing, [...] "according {{to the principle of}} national traditions", the Low Dietsch-speaking region west of Eupen (so called Platdietse streek) centered on the town <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg,</b> which was the historic core of the Duchy of Limburg.|$|R

5000|$|By late Roman times, a new {{immigration}} of Germanic {{people from the}} north and east, the Franks, came to dominate the whole of Germania Secunda, but the region of the Duchy of Limburg, being south of the military Bavay-Tongeren-Heerlen-Cologne route remained relatively Romanized at first, as reflected still in the modern linguistic situation. The region {{to the north of the}} Duchy was dominated by Salian Franks, and the area to the east came under the Ripuarian Franks. Under the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties, Frankish rule expanded from the region around Limbourg to cover larger areas, and eventually began to replace Roman imperial rule. By the time of Charlemagne, the first Frank to be called an emperor of Rome (in 800 AD), the kings of the Franks had come to be recognized as heirs to the Western Roman empire. In the time of Charlemagne's grandsons (in 843 AD), the empire came to be divided into three sections, a western Romanized one corresponding very roughly to later France, an eastern part, corresponding very roughly to Germany, and a central one, Lotharingia, later referred to as Lorraine, which was eventually absorbed into the eastern empire. The Duchy of Limburg, like most of modern Belgium, was within Lower Lorraine. For a while, Lower Lorraine had its own single Duke. It is from this Duchy that the Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg</b> derived its Ducal status (as did the Duchy of Brabant, in a competitive claim to succession). The territory of the duchy of Limburg was formed in the 11th century around the town <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg</b> in present-day Wallonia. About 1020, Duke Frederick of Lower Lorraine, a descendant of Count Palatine Wigeric <b>of</b> Lotharingia, had <b>Limbourg</b> Castle built on the banks of the Vesdre river. His estates then comprised the districts <b>of</b> Baelen (with <b>Limbourg),</b> Herve, Montzen (since 1975 part of Plombières), Walhorn, and the southwestern exclave of Sprimont. They were inherited by Frederick's son-in-law Count Waleran of Arlon, who about 1065 began to call himself a [...] "count of Limburg". Waleran also claimed Frederick's ducal title, which was finally acknowledged by Emperor Henry IV in 1101 in favour of Waleran's son Henry. This meant that Lower Lorraine now had two Duchies, that of Brabant, and that of Limburg, and the title of Duke of Lothier, still held by Brabant, eventually became ineffective.|$|R

50|$|These titles clearly reveal {{one of the}} artist’s {{favourite}} themes, {{the representation}} of Alpine landscapes. Deeply impressed by the canvases Alexandre Calame (1810 - 1864) had sent to Belgian Salons, François Roffiaen indeed won a place at Geneva {{in the autumn of}} 1846 and stayed for six months beside this master, before discovering the mountains himself. He continued to familiarise himself with the landscapes of Switzerland, Austria, Upper Bavaria and the Haute-Savoie during several other journeys (1852, 1855, 1856, 1864, 1868, 1879). But the painter also liked to represent picturesque scenes of the valleys of the Meuse and the Ourthe, the Scottish lochs, discovered in 1862, or the extensive heather <b>of</b> <b>Limbourg,</b> which he travelled through {{from the middle of the}} preceding decade, so that like Edmond Tschaggeny (1818-1873), he became one of the pioneers of the Campine Painters (called the School of Genk), a school which has been unjustly forgotten.|$|R
