However, he was taking high doses of inhaled corticosteroid for chronic airflow obstruction. CT guided percutaneous needle aspiration provided the specimen which confirmed the diagnosis of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> His sputum culture was also positive for Candida albicans. The patient achieved favourable out-come with a 4 weeks treatment with fluconazole.

Because the respiratory tract is colonized with Candida, the presence of this agent in respiratory specimens makes the diagnosis of Candida pneumonia problematic. Candida pneumonia is a rare infection, and the majority of cases are secondary to hematogenous dissemination. Furthermore isolated Candida pneumonia originating from endotracheal inoculation is an extremely rare entity. We describe a case of isolated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> in the form multiple nodular lesions in a patient with long-term history of diabetes mellitus without evidence of fungemia or systemic involvement who responded to antifungal therapy...|$|E
40|$|ER- 30346 {{is a novel}} oral {{triazole}} with a {{broad spectrum}} of potent activity against a wide range of fungi. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of oral ER- 30346 on experimental local infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans and compared them with those of itraconazole and fluconazole. In experimental murine models of pulmonary aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis, ER- 30346 reduced the numbers of CFU in the lungs significantly compared with the numbers of CFU in the lungs of the controls (P < 0. 05). ER- 30346 was as effective as or more effective than itraconazole against pulmonary aspergillosis. Against <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> and cryptococcosis, ER- 30346 was more effective than itraconazole and was as effective as fluconazole. ER- 30346 was also effective against <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> caused by fluconazole-resistant C. albicans. In mice with intracranial cryptococcosis, ER- 30346 reduced the numbers of CFU in the brains significantly compared with the numbers of CFU in the brains of the controls (P < 0. 05) and was more effective than itraconazole and as effective as fluconazole. In an experimental model of oral candidiasis in rats, ER- 30346 reduced the numbers of CFU in oral swabs significantly compared with the numbers of CFU in oral swabs from the controls (P < 0. 05) and was more effective than itraconazole and as effective as fluconazole. Thus, ER- 30346 shows efficacy in murine aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis models. Further studies are needed to determine the potential of ER- 30346 for use in the treatment of these infections...|$|E
40|$|E 1210 is a first-in-class, broad-spectrum {{antifungal}} {{with a novel}} {{mechanism of}} action—inhibition of fungal glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis. In this study, the efficacies of E 1210 and reference antifungals were evaluated in murine models of oropharyngeal and disseminated <b>candidiasis,</b> <b>pulmonary</b> aspergillosis, and disseminated fusariosis. Oral E 1210 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in infections caused by Candida species, Aspergillus spp., and Fusarium solani. In the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, E 1210 and fluconazole each caused a significantly greater {{reduction in the number}} of oral CFU than the control treatment (P < 0. 05). In the disseminated candidiasis model, mice treated with E 1210, fluconazole, caspofungin, or liposomal amphotericin B showed significantly higher survival rates than the control mice (P < 0. 05). E 1210 was also highly effective in treating disseminated candidiasis caused by azole-resistant Candida albicans or Candida tropicalis. A 24 -h delay in treatment onset minimally affected the efficacy outcome of E 1210 in the treatment of disseminated candidiasis. In the Aspergillus flavus pulmonary aspergillosis model, mice treated with E 1210, voriconazole, or caspofungin showed significantly higher survival rates than the control mice (P < 0. 05). E 1210 was also effective in the treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus pulmonary aspergillosis. In contrast to many antifungals, E 1210 was also effective against disseminated fusariosis caused by F. solani. In conclusion, E 1210 demonstrated consistent efficacy in murine models of oropharyngeal and disseminated <b>candidiasis,</b> <b>pulmonary</b> aspergillosis, and disseminated fusariosis. These data suggest that further studies to determine E 1210 's potential for the treatment of disseminated fungal infections are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Fungal infections of {{the lung}} are {{uncommon}} and mainly affect people with immune deficiency. There are crucial {{problems in the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this condition. Invasive <b>pulmonary</b> aspergillosis and <b>candidiasis</b> are the most common opportunistic fungal infections. Aspergillus species (spp.) are saprophytes molds that exist in nature as spores and rarely cause disease in immunocompetent individuals. In patients with immune deficiency or chronic lung disease, such as cavitary lung disease or bronchiectasis, Aspergillus may cause a variety of aspergillosis infections. Here we present a case of a 57 -year-old patient without immunodeficiency or chronic lung disease who was diagnosed with endotracheal fungus ball and chronic fungal infection, possibly due to Aspergillus. Bronchoscopic examination showed a paralyzed right vocal cord and vegetating mass that was yellow in color, at the posterior wall of tracheal lumen.

40|$|Myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the {{reaction}} of hydrogen peroxide with chloride ion to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is used for microbial killing by phagocytic cells. Despite {{the important role of}} MPO in host defense, however, MPO deficiency is relatively common in humans, and most of these individuals are in good health. To define the in vivo role of MPO, we have generated by gene targeting mice having no MPO activity in their neutrophils and monocytes. The mice without MPO developed normally, were fertile, and showed normal clearance of intraperitoneal Staphylococcus aureus. However, they showed increased susceptibility to pneumonia and death following intratracheal infection with Candida albicans. Furthermore, the lack of MPO significantly enhanced the dissemination of intraperitoneally injected C. albicans into various organs during the first 7 days. Thus, MPO is important for early host defense against fungal infection, and the inability to generate HOCl cannot be compensated for by other oxygen-dependent systems in vivo in mice.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the epidemiology of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (PC) {{and to identify}} risk factors in premature infants during the 1 st month of life, all infants with a birth weight < 1250 g admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit with PC between January 1994 and December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Infants with PC (n = 20) were compared with a control group (n = 20), matched for gestational age and birth weight, with regard to possible perinatal and postnatal risk factors. Among 325 infants with a birth weight < 1250 g, 20 out of 233 ventilated infants (8. 6 %) developed PC. Candida albicans (n = 12) and C. parapsilosis (n = 4) were the predominant isolates. Neonates with PC were significantly different from controls with regard to male prevalence (P = 0. 002), rates of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (P = 0. 02), longer duration of antibiotic therapy (P = 0. 01) and of ventilation (P = 0. 02). The difference between groups did not attain significance with regard to postnatal dexamethasone administration, duration of central vein catheterisation and duration of parenteral nutrition. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated as significant predictors of PC, among perinatal data, the male gender (OR = 26. 3; 95 %CI 2. 44 to 284) and PPROM (OR = 12. 3; 95 %CI 1. 16 to 130) and, among postnatal data, the duration of ventilation (OR = 1. 54; 95 %CI 1. 01 to 2. 34).

40|$|Spontaneous {{pulmonary}} {{alveolar proteinosis}} (PAP), which resembles human PAP, was found in aging (35 to 40 weeks) germ-free SCID-beige (scid/scid-bg/bg) mice. Spontaneous PAP was not observed in germ-free SCID mice. We describe the induction of PAP in SCID mice monoassociated with a pure culture of Candida albicans for 15 to 40 weeks. The gastrointestinal tracts only are colonized, and disseminated or <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> does not occur. Another spontaneous form of PAP, designated type II, was discovered in germ-free beige (bg/bg and bg/+) mice and in beige-nude (bg/bg-nu/nu) mice. In this form of PAP, macrophages appear to be unable to digest the ingested phospholipoprotein complex and then accumulate in the alveolar spaces. These murine models should prove useful in elucidating the relationships between immune deficiencies, infections, and cytokine regulation of granulocyte and macrophage production and function in {{pulmonary alveolar proteinosis}}...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To examine {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa for {{specific}} antifungal factors. METHODS: Two clinical strains of P aeruginosa with strong in vitro inhibition (by cross streak assay) of Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were examined. Both strains were isolated from sputum [...] {{one from a}} patient with cystic fibrosis and one from a patient with bronchiectasis. Bacterial extracts were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography and examined by ultraviolet absorbance and mass spectroscopy. Antifungal activity against C albicans and A fumigatus was determined in a well plate assay. RESULTS: Pyocyanin was the major antifungal agent of P aeruginosa; 1 -hydroxy-phenazine also possessed activity. Pyocyanin MICs for C albicans and A fumigatus were > 64 micrograms/ml. These phenazines were active against nine other yeast species pathogenic for man. Preliminary experiments also suggested possible inhibition of yeast mycelial transformation in C albicans by pyocyanin. CONCLUSIONS: There may be a role for pyocyanin and 1 -hydroxyphenazine {{in the prevention of}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> in patients colonised by P aeruginosa...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} between January 2002 and April 2003 {{for the detection of}} delayed hypersensitivity to Fonsecaea pedrosoi metabolic antigen (chromomycin) in skin tests. A total of 194 subjects were attended by spontaneous demand at the Infectious and Parasitic Diseases outpatient clinic of the Federal University of Maranhão-UFMA and at the Department of Microbiology, Federal University of Minas Gerais-UFMG and classified into three groups: patients with chromoblastomycosis caused by F. pedrosoi (n= 20), healthy subjects (n= 86) and patients with other diseases (n= 88). For the skin test, 0. 1 ml of the antigen was applied to the anterior side of the right forearm and 0. 1 ml Smith medium was applied to the anterior side of the left forearm as control. The results were analyzed 48 h after inoculation of the antigen and an induration >/= 5 mm was considered to indicate a positive test. A cellular immune response to chromomycin was detected in 18 (90. 0 %) of the 20 patients with chromoblastomycosis caused by F. pedrosoi, and one of the patients with a negative test had reactional leprosy. Eighty-five (98. 8 %) of the 86 healthy subjects presented a negative reaction and only one reacted positively to the antigen. The skin test was negative in all 88 (100 %) patients with other diseases, such as dermatophytosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, <b>pulmonary</b> aspergilloma, <b>candidiasis,</b> pityriasis versicolor, tuberculosis, leprosy, tegumentary leishmaniasis and syphilis, and one case of chromoblastomycosis caused by Rhinocladiella aquaspersa. Chromomycin was effective in detecting delayed hypersensitivity in patients with chromoblastomycosis caused by F. pedrosoi, with a sensitivity and specificity of 90. 0 % and 98. 8 %, respectively. These results suggest that this antigen can be used in the auxiliary diagnosis of the disease and also in epidemiological studies for determination of the prevalence of chromoblastomycosis infection in endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION : In this study, clinical-laboratory and {{epidemiological}} {{characteristics are}} described {{for a group}} of 700 individuals with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) /AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in the ART (antiretroviral therapy) era at a teaching hospital that provides a quaternary level of care, with an emphasis on opportunistic infections (OIs), co-infections and immune profile. METHODS : A retrospective cross-sectional study of AIDS cases was conducted from 1998 to 2008 by reviewing medical records from the Base Hospital/FUNFARME (Funda&# 231;&# 227;o Faculdade Regional de Medicina), S&# 227;o Jos&# 233; do Rio Preto, S&# 227;o Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: The individuals were 14 to 75 years of age, and 458 were males. Heterosexuals accounted for 31. 1 % of all patients. Eighty-three percent were on ART, and 33. 8 % of those presented difficulties with treatment adherence. OIs were analyzed from medical records, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia was the most prevalent, regardless of the LTCD 4 + (TCD 4 + Lymphocytes) levels. Individuals whose viral loads were &# 8805; 10, 000 showed a 90 % greater chance of neurotoxoplasmosis. For P. jiroveci pneumonia, neurotoxoplasmosis, esophageal <b>candidiasis,</b> <b>pulmonary</b> tuberculosis and neurocryptococcosis, the chances of infection were higher among patients with LTCD 4 + levels below 200 cells/mm 3. HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infections were significantly associated with death.

40|$|Liposomes {{which are}} {{stabilized}} by being coated with polysaccharides such as amylopectin and mannan {{are concentrated in}} the lung and liver more than simple liposomes without any polysaccharide-coat. These polysaccharide-coated liposomes are easily internalized by macrophages. Amylopectin-coated liposome with ceftazidime (survival rate, 30 %) was better than free ceftazidime alone (survival rate, 0 %) {{for the treatment of}} Legionella pneumonia in guinea pigs. The antibiotic efficacy rate of polysaccharide-coated liposome bearing minocycline (MINO) or ampicillin (ABPC) was much better than that of free MINO or ABPC for the treatment of Listeria infection. These data suggest that polysaccharide-coated liposomes bearing antibiotics are excellent for intra-cytoplasmic pathogen especially in the reticuloendothelial system where a large population of phagocytes exist. The toxicity of amphotericin B (AmpB) was reduced by encapsulation in polysaccharide-coated liposomes.

This paper reports a rare occurrence of a necrotic lung ball in a young male caused by Candida and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Case report: A 28 -year-old male with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> {{was found to have}} a lung ball on computed tomography (CT) of the chest. The patient was treated with &szlig;-lactams and itraconazole and then fluconazole, which improved his condition (as found on a following chest CT scan) and serum &szlig;-D-glucan level. The necrotic lung ball was suspected to have been caused by co-infection with Candida and S. pneumoniae. Conclusion: A necrotic lung ball can result from infection by Candida and/or S. pneumoniae, indicating that physicians should be aware that patients may still have a fungal infection of the lungs that could result in a lung ball, even when they do not have either Aspergillus antibodies or antigens.

40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} of antibiotic resistance {{has resulted in}} the need for new approaches to be developed to combat the previously easily treatable infections. This work aims to evaluate the antifungal and antioxidant effects of the chitosan, as a new alternative or complementary anti-fungal drug, alone or in combination with amphotericin B against a pathogenic Candida albicans in mice. Eighty neutropenic infected mice were randomly assigned into four main groups (20 mice/group). The 1 st group was treated with saline, neutropenic infected (NI group) (IPC group, invasive <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis),</b> the 2 nd group was treated with chitosan (ED 50) (CE group), the 3 rd group was treated with amphotericin B (150 mg/kg) (AMB group) and the 4 th group was treated with chitosan plus amphotericin B (CE+AMB group). Treatment was started at 24 h after fungal inoculation and was administered for 3 consecutive days. All the previous treatments demonstrated notable growth inhibition against a C. albicans isolate as indicated by measuring the mean diameter of the inhibition zone. Compared with IPC group, CE, AMB, and AMB+CE-treated animals had 73 %, 87 %, and 90 % reduction in fungal burden, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with CE and/or AMB for 24 and 72 h significantly decreased MDA, SOD, CAT and NO levels and increased GSH and in the lung tissues as compared with the infected untreated group. In conclusion, CE treatment, with the combination of antifungal therapy, can alleviate oxidative stress and lung injury associated with IPC in neutropenic mice...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify and characterize the Candida species isolated from lower respiratory tract infections among HIV positive patients and to determine the prevalence rates of Candida infections among these subjects. Two early morning expectorate sputum samples were collected from 272 HIV positive subjects visiting the ART clinics and DOTS centre with cases of lower respiratory tract infection, over a period of 14 months from May 2009 to July 2010 in Calabar. Subjects were recruited for this study upon approval by the Ethical Research Committee of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital and obtaining written informed consent from the patients. Samples were processed by standard methods for isolation of Candida. Speciation was done by a germ tube test, chlamydospore production on corn meal agar and sugar fermentation and assimilation tests using the Microexpress Candida identification kit (Tulip, India). Out of the 544 sputum samples collected from 272 subjects, Candida species were isolated from 40 (14. 7 %) and identified after confirming the growth in the second sample. The majority of Candida species among the Candida isolates were Candida albicans (80 %) followed by Candida tropicalis 5 (12. 5 %), Candida dublin i ensis 2 (5. 0 %) and Candida guilliermondii 1 (2. 5 %). The isolation rate of Candida species from sputum samples was found to be highest among subjects aged 25 - 34 years, followed by those aged 15 - 24 years. Twenty (7. 3 %) HIV seropositive subjects had bacterial infections, while 4 (1. 5 %) subjects had mixed fungal and bacterial infections.

In {{a comparison of the}} MICs at which 50 % of isolates are inhibited (MIC 50 s) for all strains of Candida species and Cryptococcus neoformans tested, SS 750 was four times or more active than fluconazole and had activity comparable to that of itraconazole. The most important advantage of SS 750 was that, when the MIC 90 s were compared, SS 750 had 64 and 32 times greater antifungal activities than fluconazole against Candida krusei and Candida glabrata, respectively, which are intrinsically less susceptible to fluconazole. In cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mouse models of systemic and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>candidiasis</b> caused by C. albicans, oral SS 750 prolonged the number of days of survival of infected animals in a dose-dependent manner and was 4 and ≥ 64 times more potent than fluconazole and itraconazole, respectively. In a safety profile, SS 750, like fluconazole, had less of an affinity for binding to mammalian cytochrome P 450 compared with that of ketoconazole, despite its strong affinity for binding to fungal cytochrome P 450. The mechanism for the increased in vitro antifungal activity of SS 750 against C. krusei is partially due to the potent inhibitory activity (3. 7 times versus that of fluconazole) of C. krusei cytochrome P 450 sterol 14 α-demethylase; SS 750 showed a strong affinity for binding to cytochrome P 450 of C. krusei, indicating that SS 750 acts by inhibiting the cytochrome P 450 sterol 14 α-demethylase of fungal cells...|$|E
