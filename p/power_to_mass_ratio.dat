The impact of four design parameters in the three objectives is studied. Such parameters are the AC-AC converter topology, the number of modules, {{and the number of}} phases and frequency of the AC-link. Six topologies are investigated and compared. The conventional back-to-back (B 2 B) converter, the B 2 B with three phase squared wave output, the B 2 B with single phase squared wave output, the direct matrix converter, the indirect matrix converter, and the reduced matrix converter are the selected topologies. The Pareto surface of the three objectives is obtained for a set of design parameters. It has been found that a wind energy conversion system based on a medium frequency AC-link will lead the best trade-off between efficiency, power density and <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> when the AC-AC converter topology is the direct matrix converter, the AC-link frequency is selected around 1 kHz and the power per module is in the range of 2. 5 to 4 MW...|$|E
40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} are unusual {{organic materials}} featuring high electronic conductivity. Recently {{it has been}} observed that some of these polymers change in dimension when their oxidation state is altered. Dimensional changes induced by electrochemical activation in the conducting polymer polypyrrole are investigated. Swept sine and step voltage and current inputs are employed to investigate the nature of this electro-mechanical coupling. Strains of up to 6 %, strain rates of 4 %/s, <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratios</b> of 40 W/kg and forces of up to 34 MN/m 2 are achieved. Polypyrrole nearly equals mammalian skeletal muscle in <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> and exceeds it in force by two orders of magnitude. A model is developed which predicts the electrochemical impedance, and relates electrical input to mechanical output.

40|$|Applying {{abstracted}} biological locomotion principles {{with reduced}} actuation {{can result in}} an energetic vehicle with greater mobility because a vehicle with the fewest number of motors can have the highest <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio.</b> One such hexapod robot is Whegs II, which benefits from abstracted cockroach locomotion principles and has just one motor for propulsion. Similar to Whegs I, it nominally runs in a tripod gait and passive mechanisms enable it to adapt its gait to the terrain. One of the drawbacks of Whegs I is that it cannot change its body posture. Cockroaches pitch their bodies up in anticipation of climbing a step to enable their front legs to reach higher. They also flex their bodies down while climbing to permit their front legs to maintain contact with the substrate. A bidirectional servo-driven body flexion joint has been implemented in Whegs II to accomplish both of these behaviors. It is shown to be highly mobile and energetic (see video). ...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to provide methods {{which can be used}} to auto-generate {{feasible}} electric propulsion interplanetary trajectories for use with Hall and Ion thrusters. The research is aimed at automating the trajectory generation for trade studies. Automating the trajectory generation process allows non trajectory specialists to generate a good initial guess for use in optimizers and to rapidly conduct trade studies. Two types of trade studies are considered, high and low level trades. High level trades utilize reduced order models, which simplify the problem, while low level trades use high ﬁdelity models of the thruster and power system. Novel methods are designed to automate the entire trajectory generation process. They use information from previous iterations so the user does not have to supply an initial guess. The initial guess for the ﬁrst iteration is generated using a “self starting” method, which allows for the generation of a unique initial guess for each subproblem. For high level trades with variable eﬃciency constant speciﬁc impulse thrusters it is found that the optimal speciﬁc impulse is independent of the launch mass and varies with the propellant and power system. The optimal solution favors a larger power system mass vs. the propellant <b>mass.</b> <b>To</b> carry out these trade studies a homotopy method is used in a proof of concept tool which optimizes the C 3, power level, and speciﬁc impulse over a range of <b>power</b> systems <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratios.</b> A two phase approach is used to generate trajectories for low level trades. The ﬁrst phase uses Chebyshev polynomials to model the trajectories. The Chebyshev coeﬃcients are optimized, which allows for the selection of a unique low cost trajectory for a large range of launch and arrival dates. The Chebyshev trajectory is then used as an initial guess to a feasible trajectory solver which integrates the trajectory and uses thruster and <b>power</b> system models <b>to</b> constrain the trajectory. The use of the Chebyshev polynomials with the fully integrated solver allows trajectories to be generated without requiring the user to supply any initial guess...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Body {{composition}} {{contributes to}} explosive performance by influencing the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> body <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> (Cronin & Hansen, 2005). Measurement errors are seldom considered when evaluating body composition changes determined with DXA. We assessed {{the reliability of}} DXA in an applied setting, quantified body composition changes across a training year, and investigated their association with physical performance. Methods: Forty-eight athletes [12 skeleton (7 elite; 5 talent squad), 8 rugby union, 14 swimming, 14 athletics] underwent two DXA scans, typically within 48 hours. Typical error of the measurement (TEM; %) for total body mass (TBM), non-bone non-fat (lean) mass (LM), fat mass (FM), and leg lean mass (LLM) were calculated. Elite skeleton athletes underwent three further scans (representing two training blocks and the competition season) alongside physical tests (countermovement jump and leg press). Training block 1 focussed on hypertrophy, whereas block 2 involved higher velocity, sprint-based training. Body composition changes between each scan were calculated. Relationships between changes in body composition and performance were tested using Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: TEMs for all participants were: TBM, 0. 6 %; LM, 0. 9 %; FM, 3. 9 %; and LLM, 1. 2 %. Mean (± SD) changes in TBM for elite skeleton athletes were 1. 6 ± 2. 7 %, 1. 1 ± 2. 0 % and 0. 7 ± 2. 3 % across training block 1, block 2, and the competition season, respectively. LM and LLM increased across block 1 (LM, 3. 0 ± 2. 4 %; LLM, 2. 7 ± 2. 6 %) with decreases occurring across block 2 (LM, - 0. 9 ± 2. 6 %; LLM, - 1. 6 ± 2. 4 %) and the competition season (LM, - 1. 6 ± 3. 1 %; LLM, 1. 1 ± 2. 4 %). FM decreased across both training blocks (block 1, - 4. 3 ± 8. 5 %; block 2, - 3. 0 ± 7. 2 %) and increased across the competition season (12. 9 ± 7. 4 %). Significant relationships (p < 0. 05) were found between changes in LM and performance (jump, r = 0. 61; leg press, r = 0. 40) and between changes in LLM and jump performance (r = 0. 65). Discussion: Many body composition changes observed {{in this study were}} above the TEM even with a less stringently controlled scanning protocol than previously suggested (Nana et al., 2012). Therefore, DXA was able to detect real body composition changes, which appear to reflect the emphases of each training block {{and the nature of the}} competition season. Relationships between changes in LM and performance demonstrated the important influence of body composition on strength and power indices. References:Cronin, J. & Hansen, K. (2005).

This result is achieved by adopting for the actuator a telescopic multi-stage architecture and using SMA helical springs with hollow cross-section to power the stages. The hollow geometry leads to reduced axial size and mass of the actuator and to enhanced working frequency while the telescopic design confers to the actuator an indexable motion, with a number of different displacements being achieved through simple on-off control strategies.

40|$|With growing {{fuel prices}} and {{existing}} CO 2 problem, saving fuel {{has become a}} very important issue, both economically and environmental {{and is likely to}} be even more important in the future. A big potential for reducing the fuel consumption remains in anticipatory driving regarding the road slope ahead of the vehicle.

Implementing an anticipatory driving strategy into a driver assistant system allows a reduction in fuel consumption, which is not reachable with a normal cruise control.

This allows e. g. gaining speed prior to significant uphill links or avoiding braking on the downhill. Not completely known so far is the characteristic of the system towards model errors.

40|$|The <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> of a {{heavy truck}} causes even {{moderate}} slopes {{to have a significant}} influence on the motion. The velocity will inevitable vary within an interval that is primarily determined by the ratio and the road topography. If further variations are actuated by a controller, there is a potential to lower the fuel consumption by taking the upcoming topography into account. This possibility is explored through theoretical and simulation studies as well as experiments in this work. Look-ahead control is a predictive strategy that repeatedly solves an optimization problem online by means of a tailored dynamic programming algorithm. The scenario in this work is a drive mission for a heavy diesel truck where the route is known. It is assumed that there is road data on-board and that the current heading is known. A look-ahead controller is then developed to minimize fuel consumption and trip time. The look-ahead control is realized and evaluated in a demonstrator vehicle and further studied in simulations. In the prototype demonstration, information about the road slope ahead is extracted from an on-board database in combination with a GPS unit. The algorithm calculates the optimal velocity trajectory online and feeds the conventional cruise controller with new set points. The results from the experiments and simulations confirm that look-ahead control reduces the fuel consumption without increasing the travel time. Also, the number of gear shifts is reduced.

40|$|Application of {{conducting}} polymers {{has been growing}} widely in {{different fields such as}} batteries, solar cells, capacitors and actuators. Mechanical properties {{of conducting}} polymers like flexibility, high <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> and high active strain make them potentially applicable to robotic and automation industries. Obviously, a dynamic model of the actuation phenomenon in conducting polymers is needed to study its controllability and also to optimize the mechanical performance. De Rossi and colleagues suggest treating the mechanical behaviour of conducting polymers separately from the viscoelastic structural model and electrochemical actuation[1]. But it has been observed that the effects of electrochemical actuation and diffusion of ions on the viscoelastic coefficients cannot be neglected in some conducting polymer actuators, as shown in[1]. In this paper, we present the effects of cyclic voltammetry actuation on shear modulus of polypyrrole in propylene carbonate and EMI. TSFI as measured by an electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (eQCM). The QCM consists basically of an AT-cut piezoelectric quartz crystal disc with metallic electrode films deposited on its faces. One face is exposed to the active medium. A driver circuit applies an AC signal to the electrodes, causing the crystal to oscillate in a shear mode, at a given resonance frequency. QCM has been routinely used for the determination of mass changes. Measured resonance frequency shifts are converted into mass changes by the wellknown Sauerbrey 2 ̆ 7 s equation. In this paper, we correlate the admittance output of QCM to the real shear modulus of polypyrrole.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{techniques}} for fabricating fast contracting and relaxing {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) fibers are presented. Shape memory alloy fibers have demonstrated the largest stress and highest <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> of any known actuator technology. However their practical application {{has been plagued by}} three major drawbacks, namely: (1) relatively slow expansion of the material despite rapid contraction; (2) problems of mechanically and electrically connecting to the material due to the violent nature of their contractions; and (3) low efficiency in the conversion of electrical energy or heat into mechanical energy. The work associated with this thesis has led to solutions to the first two problems allowing even sub-millisecond contraction-expansion cycle times, and fibers to be attached via light weight but high strength and high conductivity joints. The properties of these fibers are extensively studied. Both linear and rotary actuators are built using these fibers. A new technique is presented to mount nickel-titanium (NiTi) SMA fibers. NiTi alloys are not readily bonded, soldered, brazed or welded to other materials. The new method employs metal deposited on the fiber or between two fibers or between fibers and other parts, creating metallic attachments that are mechanically sound and electrically conductive. Furthermore a new process for the three-dimensional microfabrication by localized electrodeposition and etching has also been developed. This latter process, combined with the first process, can be used to integrate NiTi alloys in micro-mechanisms. The good electrical contacts as well as mechanical contact provided by the new attachment mechanisms are important, since they allow the rapid methods to be employed. Several apparatus were built to study the response of NiTi fibers, in particular to very fast current pulses. Experimental results were obtained to describe the response of the fibers, such as their speed, hysteresis, stiffness and resistivity, and show how these variables change dynamically as a function of time, temperature and stress. Other measurements important for the design of new actuators were done, such as those of efficiency when fast actuation with large current pulses is used. In the third part of the thesis a novel application for fast fiber actuators is presented {{in the form of a}} fast rotary motor for in-the-wheel car rotary motors...|$|E
40|$|Efficient drive cycle {{simulation}} of longitudinal vehicle propulsion models {{is an important}} aid for design and analysis of power trains. Tools {{on the market today}} mainly use two different methods for such simulations, forward dynamic or quasi-static inverse simulation. Here known theory for stable inversion of non linear systems is used in order to combine the fast simulation times of the quasi-static inverse simulation with the ability of including transient dynamics as in the forward dynamic simulation. The stable inversion technique with a new implicit driver model together forms a new concept, inverse dynamic simulation. This technique is demonstrated feasible for vehicle propulsion simulation and specifically on three powertrain applications that include important dynamics that can not be handled using quasi-static inverse simulation. The extensions are engine dynamics, drive line dynamics, and gas flow dynamics for diesel engines, which also are selected to represent important properties such as zero dynamics, resonances, and non-minimum phase systems. It is shown that inverse dynamic simulation is easy to set up, gives short simulation times, and gives consistent results for design space exploration. This makes inverse dynamic simulation a suitable method to use for drive cycle simulation, especially in situations requiring many simulations, such as optimization over design space, powertrain configuration optimization, or development of powertrain control strategies. Optimal vehicle propulsion control is developed with special focus on heavy trucks used for long haulage. The <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> for a typical heavy duty truck makes even moderate road slopes significant {{in the sense that it}} is impossible to keep a constant cruising speed. This gives an interesting problem how to control vehicle speed such that fuel consumption is minimized. Todays telematic systems together with three dimensional roadmaps can provide the vehicle control system with information of the road topography. This enables intelligent cruise controllers that utilize this information to control engine fueling and gear shifting such that an optimal speed trajectory is obtained. First the optimal control problem is solved numerically by dynamic programming, giving a controller with real time capabilities that can be used on-line in the vehicles control system. Simulations of such a system on authentic road profiles show that it has potential for significant fuel savings. To achieve knowledge about the underlying physics that affects the optimal solution, the optimal control problem is solved in detail and analytical expressions for the conditions of optimality are derived. Those expressions are then used to find optimal solutions on constructed test road profiles. Such test cases point out the typical behavior of an optimal solution and also which parameters that are decisive for the fuel minimization problem, and also how they quantitatively influence the behavior. It is for example shown that small non-linearities in the engine torque characteristics have significant effect on the optimal control strategy. The solutions for the non linear engine model have a smoother character but also require longer prediction horizons. For optimal gear ratio control it is shown that the maximum fueling function is essential for the solution. For example, in the case of a continuously variable transmission it is shown that the gear ratio never is chosen such that engine speed exceeds the speed of maximum engine power. For a discrete step transmission the gear shifting losses are essential for the optimal shift positions, but over all the solutions are close to continuous solutions...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to observe individual variance in the ability to predict marathon performance from a two-mile time trial performance and determine whether the variance in predictability is influenced by thermoregulatory advantages of body size. Over three distinct marathon conditions, 126 (n = 17 in 2010, n = 42 in 2011, n = 67 in 2012) aerobically-trained college physical activity students participated in pre- and post-anthropometric testing, a two-mile time trial on an indoor track, and concluded with the Eau Claire marathon. Between 72 and 98 % of the variance in marathon performance could be explained by two-mile time trial performance. Variation of predicted performance from actual marathon performance was related to body surface area <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio,</b> body surface area <b>to</b> lean <b>mass</b> <b>ratio,</b> and percent body fat but depended on the race temperature, sex, and aerobic fitness.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a Reissner-Nordström black hole and a charged massive particle is {{studied in the}} framework of perturbation theory. The particle backreaction is taken into account, studying the effect of general static perturbations of the hole following the approach of Zerilli. The solutions of the combined Einstein-Maxwell equations for both perturbed gravitational and electromagnetic fields at first order of the perturbation are exactly reconstructed by summing all multipoles, and are given explicit closed form expressions. The existence of a singularity-free solution of the Einstein-Maxwell system requires that the charge <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratios</b> of the black hole and of the particle satisfy an equilibrium condition which is in general dependent on the separation between the two bodies. If the black hole is undercritically charged (i. e. its charge <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> is less than one), the particle must be overcritically charged, {{in the sense that the}} particle must have a charge <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> greater than one. If the charge <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratios</b> of the black hole and of the particle are both equal to one (so that they are both critically charged, or "extreme"), the equilibrium can exist for any separation distance, and the solution we find coincides with the linearization in the present context of the well known Majumdar-Papapetrou solution for two extreme Reissner-Nordström black holes. In addition to these singularity-free solutions, we also analyze the corresponding solution for the problem of a massive particle at rest near a Schwarzschild black hole, exhibiting a strut singularity on the axis between the two bodies. The relations between our perturbative solutions and the corresponding exact two-body solutions belonging to the Weyl class are also discussed. Comment: 42 pages, 3 eps figures, revtex macro...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of hollow granules from hydrophobic powders in a high-shear mixer granulator {{has been investigated}} by changing the binder/powder <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> and studying its effects on granule size and structure. In this study, a mixer granulator was filled with 100 g of hydrophobic fumed silica and then varying quantities of 5 % Hydroxy Propyl Cellulose solution was slowly sprayed into granulator. A range of liquid <b>to</b> solid <b>mass</b> <b>ratios</b> between from 0. 5 : 1 to 15 : 1 was used. Granules were then dried at 60 °C in a fan forced oven. This paper compares the particle size distributions, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray tomography (XRT) images of hollow granules {{as a function of}} the liquid <b>to</b> solid <b>mass</b> <b>ratio.</b> The granule mean size increased and the fraction of un-granulated (fine) particles decreased as the liquid <b>to</b> solid <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> increased. Simultaneously, the morphology and structure of the hollow granules changed from a spherical to a deformed structure which indicates the importance of choosing the optimal liquid <b>to</b> solid <b>mass</b> <b>ratio.</b> The optimal liquid <b>to</b> solid <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> for Aerosil R 202 powder in this study was found to be between 3 : 1 and 6 : 1. The final granule shape and size distribution are dependent on the liquid to solid ratio if the liquid marble nucleation process starts with a preformed droplet template...|$|R
40|$|A simple, {{efficient}} and very lightweight preliminary {{design for a}} 5 KW and 20 KW BOL output concentrated array evolved and is described by drawings. The relative effectiveness of this design, as compared to an unconcentrated planar array of equal power output, was measured by comparing <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> performance of and the solar cell area required by each. Improvements in <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> performance as high as 42 % together with array area size reduction of 57 % are possible in GaAs systems. By contrast, when the same concentrator design is applied to silicon systems, no improvement in <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> can be obtained although array area reductions as high as 35 % are obtainable...|$|R

40|$|Composition {{measurements}} {{were made of}} the energetic particles produced in the series of large flares which began on 19 October 1989, using the Galileo Heavy Ion Counter which is sensitive to nuclei ranging from carbon (Z= 6) to nickel (Z= 28) over an energy range from about 5 MeV/nucleon to > 70 MeV/nucleon. The observations are unique in that clean, statistically well-measured abundances are available for heavy ions for an unusually large flare. For elements with low First Ionization Potential (FIP), these results show the same correlation of relative abundances with the ion charge <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio</b> as the earlier Voyager observations of solar energetic particles 1. After correction for selection {{on the basis of}} this charge <b>to</b> <b>mass</b> <b>ratio,</b> the abundances of all the elements measured show the expected step-function correlation with FIP, when compared to the spectroscopic photspheric abundances...|$|R
