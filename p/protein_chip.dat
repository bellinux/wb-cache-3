50|$|Nuclear LIM interactor (NLI) / LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) {{is located}} in the nuclei of {{neuronal}} cells during development, it is co-expressed with ISL1 in early motor neuron differentiation and has a suggested role in the ISL1 dependent development of motor neurons. It is suggested that these proteins act synergistically to enhance transcriptional efficiency by acting as co-factors for LIM homeodomain and Otx class transcription factors both of which have essential roles in development. The Drosophila melanogaster <b>protein</b> <b>Chip</b> is required for segmentation and activity of a remote wing margin enhancer. Chip is a ubiquitous chromosomal factor required for normal expression of diverse genes at many stages of development. It is suggested that Chip cooperates with different LIM domain proteins and other factors to structurally support remote enhancer-promoter interactions.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} allowing remote enhancers {{to regulate}} promoters several kilobase pairs away are unknown but are {{blocked by the}} Drosophila suppressor of Hairy-wing protein (Suhw) that binds to gypsy retrovirus insertions between enhancers and promoters. Suhw bound to a gypsy insertion in the cut gene also appears to act interchromosomally to antagonize enhancer–promoter interactions on the homologous chromosome when activity of the Chip gene is reduced. This implicates Chip in enhancer–promoter communication. We cloned Chip and find that it encodes a homolog of the recently discovered mouse Nli/Ldb 1 /Clim- 2 and Xenopus Xldb 1 proteins that bind nuclear LIM domain <b>proteins.</b> <b>Chip</b> <b>protein</b> interacts with the LIM domains in the Apterous homeodomain <b>protein,</b> and <b>Chip</b> interacts genetically with apterous, showing that these interactions are important for Apterous function in vivo. Importantly, Chip also appears to have broad functions beyond interactions with LIM domain <b>proteins.</b> <b>Chip</b> is present in all nuclei examined and at numerous sites along the salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Embryos without Chip activity lack segments and show abnormal gap and pair–rule gene expression, although no LIM domain proteins are known to regulate segmentation.

50|$|A protein {{microarray}} (or <b>protein</b> <b>chip)</b> is a high-throughput {{method used}} {{to track the}} interactions and activities of proteins, and to determine their function, and determining function on a large scale. Its main advantage {{lies in the fact}} that large numbers of proteins can be tracked in parallel. The chip consists of a support surface such as a glass slide, nitrocellulose membrane, bead, or microtitre plate, to which an array of capture proteins is bound. Probe molecules, typically labeled with a fluorescent dye, are added to the array. Any reaction between the probe and the immobilised protein emits a fluorescent signal that is read by a laser scanner. Protein microarrays are rapid, automated, economical, and highly sensitive, consuming small quantities of samples and reagents. The concept and methodology of protein microarrays was first introduced and illustrated in antibody microarrays (also referred to as antibody matrix) in 1983 in a scientific publication and a series of patents. The high-throughput technology behind the protein microarray was relatively easy to develop since it is based on the technology developed for DNA microarrays, which have become the most widely used microarrays.|$|E
50|$|Balancing {{the use of}} mass spectrometers in {{proteomics}} and {{in medicine}} {{is the use of}} protein micro arrays. The aim behind protein micro arrays is to print thousands of protein detecting features for the interrogation of biological samples. Antibody arrays are an example in which a host of different antibodies are arrayed to detect their respective antigens from a sample of human blood. Another approach is the arraying of multiple protein types for the study of properties like protein-DNA, protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Ideally, the functional proteomic arrays would contain the entire complement of the proteins of a given organism. The first version of such arrays consisted of 5000 purified proteins from yeast deposited onto glass microscopic slides. Despite the success of first chip, it was a greater challenge for protein arrays to be implemented. Proteins are inherently much more difficult to work with than DNA. They have a broad dynamic range, are less stable than DNA and their structure is difficult to preserve on glass slides, though they are essential for most assays. The global ICAT technology has striking advantages over <b>protein</b> <b>chip</b> technologies.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a nuclear encoded {{endonuclease}} that is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The encoded protein is widely distributed among animals and cleaves DNA at GC tracts. This protein {{is capable of}} generating the RNA primers required by DNA polymerase gamma to initiate replication of mitochondrial DNA.In some apoptotic pathways, EndoG is released from the mitochondrion and migrates to the nucleus, where it degrades chromatin {{with the help of}} other nuclear proteins. In one such pathway, caspase-independent apoptosis, the E3 ligase C-terminal of Hsc-70 interacting <b>protein</b> (<b>CHIP),</b> a regulator of EndoG expression, functions as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress. Under normal conditions, EndoG remains bound to Hsp70 and CHIP; however, when undergoing oxidative stress, EndoG dissociates from Hsp70 and CHIP and translocates to the nucleus, where it degrades DNA to effect apoptosis. Therefore, maintaining low levels of EndoG could prevent cell death caused by stress conditions. In epithelial cells, the nuclear localization and proapoptotic function of EndoG leads it {{to play a role in}} cell senescence.In addition to DNA degradation, EndoG also stimulates inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) to target proteins for proteasomal degradation.|$|E

By combining protein microarray technology with the use of large cDNA expression libraries, we pro-filed the autoantibody repertoire of sera from alopecia areata patients against a human protein array consisting of 37, 200 redundant, recombinant human proteins. The data sets obtained from incubations with patient sera were compared with control sera from clinically healthy persons and to background incubations with anti-human IgG antibodies. From these results, a smaller protein sub-set was generated and subjected to qualitative and quan-titative validation on highly sensitive protein microarrays to identify novel alopecia areata-associated autoantigens. Eight autoantigens were identified by <b>protein</b> <b>chip</b> tech-nology and were successfully confirmed by Western blot analysis.

40|$|Abstract Background Viral {{hepatitis}} due to hepatitis B {{virus and}} hepatitis C virus are major public health problems {{all over the}} world. Traditional detection methods including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are expensive and time-consuming. In our assay, a <b>protein</b> <b>chip</b> assay using Nano-gold Immunological Amplification and Silver Staining (NIASS) method was applied to detect HBV and HCV antibodies rapidly and simultaneously. Methods Chemically modified glass slides were used as solid supports (named chip), on which several antigens, including HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg and HCVAg (a mixture of NS 3, NS 5 and core antigens) were immobilized respectively. Colloidal nano-gold labelled staphylococcal protein A (SPA) {{was used as an}} indicator and immunogold silver staining enhancement technique was applied to amplify the detection signals, producing black image on array spots, which were visible with naked eyes. To determine the detection limit of the <b>protein</b> <b>chip</b> assay, a set of model arrays in which human IgG was spotted were structured and the model arrays were incubated with different concentrations of anti-IgG. A total of 305 serum samples previously characterized with commercial ELISA were divided into 4 groups and tested in this assay. Results We prepared mono-dispersed, spherical nano-gold particles with an average diameter of 15 ± 2 nm. Colloidal nano-gold-SPA particles observed by TEM were well-distributed, maintaining uniform and stable. The optimum silver enhancement time ranged from 8 to 12 minutes. In our assay, the protein chips could detect serum antibodies against HBsAg, HBeAg, HBcAg and HCVAg with the absence of the cross reaction. In the model arrays, the anti-IgG as low as 3 ng/ml could be detected. The data for comparing the <b>protein</b> <b>chip</b> assay with ELISA indicated that no distinct difference (P > 0. 05) existed between the results determined by our assay and ELISA respectively.
