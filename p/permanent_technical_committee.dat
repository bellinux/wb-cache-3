40|$|A sociedade tem buscado constantemente saber qual Ã o estado atual da economia (recessÃo ou expansÃo). O ICMS Ã o tributo de maior participaÃÃo na receita estadual, incide sobre o valor agregado, portanto, sua arrecadaÃÃo estÃ diretamente vinculada ao nÃvel da atividade econÃmica. Este trabalho visa analisar a sincronizaÃÃo dos ciclos de arrecadaÃÃo do ICMS nos estados nordestinos incluindo a arrecadaÃÃo agregada da RegiÃo Nordeste, vale ressaltar, que Ã o primeiro a fazer esta investigaÃÃo. Os dados foram obtidos atravÃs da ComissÃo TÃcnica Permanente do ICMS, do MinistÃrio da Fazenda e correspondem Ã arrecadaÃÃo mensal do ICMS em valores correntes entre janeiro de 1997 a dezembro de 2010. Foram convertidos em trimestrais, agregando os valores arrecadados em cada trimestre, totalizando 10 sÃries com 56 observaÃÃes cada. A metodologia foi a proposta por Harding e Pagan (2002), onde, usando modelos nÃo-paramÃtricos, foi possÃvel datar os perÃodos nos quais a arrecadaÃÃo trimestral do ICMS dos estados encontravam-se em recessÃo. Concluiu-se que, em geral, os perÃodos recessivos duravam de 2 a 4 trimestres, sendo o estado do PiauÃ o que apresentou 12 trimestres de recessÃo. The {{company has}} {{constantly}} sought {{to know what}} {{the current state of the}} economy(recession or expansion). The ICMS is a tribute to greater participation in state revenue, levied on the value added, therefore, its collection is directly tied to the level of economic activity. This work aims to analyze the synchronization of cycles of collection of VAT in the northeastern states including the aggregated collection of the Northeast, it is noteworthy, which is the first to do this research. Data were obtained from the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Committee</b> of the VAT, the Ministry of Finance and correspond to the monthly collection of VAT at current prices from January 1997 to December 2010. Were converted into quarterly, adding the amounts received in each quarter, totaling 10 sets with 56 observations each. The methodology was proposed by Harding and Pagan (2002), where, using non-parametric models, it was possible to date the periods in which the collection of quarterly VAT states were in recession. It was concluded that, in general, the recessions lasted two to four quarters, which is the state of PiauÃ presented the 12 quarters of recession...|$|E
40|$|The {{work has}} as its {{starting}} point the near consensus in the literature about the Brazilian Congress, particularly on the Chamber of Deputies, according to which rules and procedures inside this institution do not present effective incentives {{for the development of}} expertise and legislators training for the formulation of complex public policies. In other words, Congress would still lack informational mechanisms in its decision making process. The argument contained in the study somehow contradicts this diagnosis, by proposing {{that it is possible to}} detect, within the Chamber of Deputies, nucleus of excellence in principle empowered to exercise functions of informational nature - i. e., their <b>permanent</b> <b>technical</b> <b>committees</b> and the advisory structure of the Chamber; and, within this, highlighting the Legislative Consulting (Conle).

Both Sudan and Egypt {{agreed that the}} water needs of the other eight riparians would not exceed 1 to 2 bcm/y and further agreed to meet any threat to Nile resources with a unified Egyptian-Sudanese response. The building of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s was contentious as it flooded areas of southern Sudan near Wadi Halfa and displaced Sudanese residents living along the Egyptian-Sudanese border.In the mid 1990s Egypt began a massive project {{just south of the}} Aswan. The New Delta Project in southern Egypt and the Salaam Canal in the Sinai Peninsula were both initiatives undertaken by former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to increase water supply for the expanding Egyptian population, which has dispersed further and further from the Nile. Increasing Egyptian water consumption is a source of conflict in the region as upstream riparians - Sudan and Ethiopia - have begun to assert their own rights to dam the river for hydroelectric development. Sudanese plans to build the Kajbar Dam near Khartoum at the confluence of the White and Blue Niles [...] has caused much international tension. Sudan is also planning on building the Merowe Dam south of the Kajbar and enlarging the Roseires Dam, located 300 miles southeast of Khartoum on the Blue Nile. It is estimated that the building of these projects would likely lead to Sudan exceeding its water allotments from the 1959 treaty.|$|R
