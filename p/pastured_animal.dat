50|$|Commons {{are often}} crossed by unfenced public roads, and {{this leads to}} another problem on modern pasture commons where grazing survives (or is to be reintroduced). Historically, the roads would have been cart-tracks, and {{there would have been}} no {{conflict}} between their horse-drawn (or ox-drawn) traffic and the <b>pastured</b> <b>animals,</b> and no great difficulty if <b>pastured</b> <b>animals</b> wandered off the common along the roads. However, these roads now have fast motorised traffic which does not mix safely with animals. To continue (or restore) grazing, such roads may need fencing or at least blocking at the edge of the common with cattle grids — however fencing a common is reminiscent of the process of enclosure, historically fatal to its survival, and permission for fencing on a common is a strictly controlled process within the UK planning system.|$|R

50|$|Bernardo Yorba (1800 - 1858) {{was the son}} of José Antonio Yorba, the grantee of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana. For years Bernardo and his {{brothers}} <b>pastured</b> <b>animals</b> on lands east of their father's rancho, and in 1834 Bernardo requested, and was granted, Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana.

50|$|When {{agriculture}} developed, {{the lands}} {{south of the}} basin proved most fertile, and so {{the rest of the}} basin was used principally for pasture. There were some fields surrounding the villages, but were not very fertile. The forests were used for <b>pasturing</b> <b>animals</b> and fodder was harvested in the wetlands. Transhumance was adopted. In certain cites, the wetlands and lakes were partially drained to try to recover good-quality agricultural lands.|$|R

50|$|A {{barnyard}} of the 19th {{century was}} fenced-in {{an area of}} about 1 acre or more; modern barnyards per se {{may not be as}} large, but agricultural properties still may use a perimeter fence around areas of concentrated animal management to help contain any that may get loose. The barnyard is the domain of the mules, horses, and other working animals, as well as fowl and working pets, such as barn cats. On small farms, <b>pasture</b> <b>animals</b> such milk goats or a dairy cow may stay in the barnyard when not in the fields.|$|R
500|$|Skipsea Mere was drained in {{the second}} half of the 14th century and by 1397 the castle was {{considered}} worthless: the [...] of land around it became used for <b>pasturing</b> <b>animals.</b> The counts of Aumale used the manor house at nearby Cleeton when they visited the area. Probably because of its poor location, the town of Skipsea Brough also proved unsuccessful as a commercial site. There were only three burgesses in the town paying rent in 1260, and by the late 14th century the town was largely abandoned; in 1377 there were only 95 people registered for the poll tax in the two settlements of Skipsea and Skipsea Brough combined.|$|R

The primate house is home to macaques, a chimpanzee, baboon, bush baby, cotton-top tamarins, {{as well as several}} other non-primate mammals. Optional tours of the commissary, where food is stored and diets are prepared daily, are available. The reptile house houses snakes, green iguanas, bearded dragon, American alligator, tortoises, and more.

Residents include Bengal tigers, African lions, puma, bobcats, leopards, gray wolf, and Arctic fox.|$|R

50|$|The {{ecology of}} the island, however, is not in its {{original}} state, due to earlier draining of Great Marsh by parallel channels and destabilization of the dunes by overuse. Much of the inland {{side of the island}} was cleared for farming. The farmers also used the marsh grass for haying and <b>pasturing</b> <b>animals.</b> In the waters, the chemical pollution of the Merrimack River and the damming of its stream at a number of locations totally changed the character of the fish and the bird species that fed on them. Even today coastal currents from the Merrimack in flood deposit unacceptable levels of debris on the beach, which must be cleaned up. The beach currently is free of the waste bunker oil common further south.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} of offal feedings, {{the prevalence of}} the parasites within the offal, {{and the age of}} the intermediate host are factors that affect infection pressure within the definitive host. The immunity of both the definitive and intermediate host plays a large role in the transmission of the parasite, as well as the contact rate between the intermediate and the definitive host (such as herding dogs and <b>pasture</b> <b>animals</b> being kept in close proximity where dogs can contaminate grazing areas with fecal matter). The life expectancy of the parasite, coupled with the {{frequency of}} anthelminthic treatments, will also {{play a role in the}} rate of infection within a host. The temperature and humidity of the environment can affect the survival of E. granulosus.|$|R

40|$|In Phase 1 of this study, three breed types (Simmentaler-, Brahman- and Nguni bulls; n = 60 each) were grain-fed and {{slaughtered}} at 12 {{months of}} age (A-age, fat-class 2). Feed was withdrawn for either three hours or 24 hours pre-slaughter. Within each feed withdrawal group, three electrical stimulation (ES) treatments were applied, viz. ES for 15 seconds, 120 seconds or no stimulation. In Phase 2, the effects of animal age and feeding regime were investigated using of A-age (feedlot and pasture), AB-age (feedlot and pasture) and B-age (<b>pasture)</b> <b>animals.</b> All carcasses were electrically stimulated for 15 seconds. Longer feed withdrawal increased dark-firm-dry (DFD) meat occurrence (pHu > 6) in the Nguni and Simmentaler-cross. Brahman-cross longissimus (LL) {{tended to be more}} tender with paler colour and higher drip loss when 120 ES was applied. Longer feed withdrawal recorded higher Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF) than three hour feed withdrawal. However, ES neutralized the effect of stress on tenderness. On average the AB-age feedlot animals produced the most tender LL followed by the B-age pasture and A-age feedlot which was similar to the AB-age <b>pasture.</b> A-age <b>pasture</b> <b>animals</b> produced the least tender LL steaks. The calpain proteolytic system played a pivotal role in determining the ultimate meat tenderness and although connective tissue becomes less soluble in older animals it did not play the determinant role in tenderness in this study. The intramuscular fat (< 3 %) {{played an important role in}} the tenderness outcome of Nguni LL which marbled well at AB-age.

40|$|Net feed {{efficiency}} (NFE) technology {{is expected to}} improve the productivity of grazing systems in Australia's southern beef producing regions. The extended time path required for implementation of this genetic technology into commercial herds {{and the influence of}} climatic variability on the pasture base are important issues to address in estimating the benefits of this technology at the farm level. NFE also has the potential to impact on the sustainability of the grazing systems in terms of maintaining adequate pasture cover.
