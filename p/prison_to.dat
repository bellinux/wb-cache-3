5|$|Despite being a major {{coaching}} route, {{there were}} several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn. A turnpike trust {{was established in the}} 1730s to improve upkeep of the road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate <b>Prison</b> <b>to</b> the gallows at Tyburn near Marble Arch. Spectators drunkenly jeered at prisoners as they carted along the road, and could buy rope used in the executions from the hangman in taverns. By about 1729, the road had become known as Oxford Street.|$|E

Oklahoma passed a law in 2005 that requires private <b>prisons</b> <b>to</b> have emergency plans in place and mandates state notification of any safety incidents.|$|R

5|$|In 1943, {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Kempeitai under Lieutenant Colonel Haruzo Sumida was charged with finding the culprits {{responsible}} for acts of sabotage in Singapore, mainly the cutting of telephone lines and the burning of warehouses. Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the <b>prison</b> <b>to</b> catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E

5|$|In early 1345, Kantakouzenos sent Franciscan monks to the regency to make {{an offer}} of conciliation, but it was rejected. Despite this show of confidence, the regency's {{position}} remained insecure. The defections of the previous winter had weakened their control of the capital, and in response Apokaukos launched a series of proscriptions. He also ordered {{the construction of a}} new <b>prison</b> <b>to</b> house political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, while undertaking an inspection of the prison unaccompanied by his bodyguard, Apokaukos was lynched by the prisoners.|$|E

Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have.|$|E

In 2009, he submitted a short film he directed entitled The Arrival and an eight-minute trailer of On the Job, featuring Joel Torre, to film festivals in an attempt to pitch the project.

5|$|At {{first the}} revolutionary {{movement}} was uncertain whether {{to destroy the}} <b>prison,</b> <b>to</b> reoccupy it as a fortress {{with members of the}} volunteer guard militia, or to preserve it intact as a permanent revolutionary monument. The revolutionary leader Mirabeau eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle. One of these experts was Pierre-François Palloy, a bourgeois entrepreneur who claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process. Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.|$|E

In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E
