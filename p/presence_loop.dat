30|$|The {{accuracy}} for nonlinear algorithms {{shows some}} degradation. This is expected, since a 1 st-order Taylor approximation {{has been applied}} (9) in the computation of the quantization noise. Moreover, the <b>presence</b> of <b>loops</b> increases the error in the estimation, since the error due to neglecting Taylor series terms is amplified through the feedback loops. The nonlinear algorithms without loops perform significantly well. The mean percentage error is smaller than 1.52 %, and the maximum relative error is smaller than 0.3 [*]dB. This performance {{is similar to that}} of LTI algorithms.|$|R

Thinning of Devnagari characters is difficult as compared to English characters due to <b>presence</b> of <b>loops</b> and conjuncts. The proposed algorithm thins the characters by taking special requirements of the Devnagari script into consideration. The character is first binarized and then crudely thinned. The noise is then removed. We have ensured that the basic characteristics of the image are maintained while keeping the algorithm as simple as possible. The performance of the algorithm after testing is demonstrated...|$|R

In this paper, we not only consider the false locking phenomenon in an OPLL, but also illustrate a method of calculating the locking range. Moreover, we consider the effect of finite line-width of the laser and suggest a method of reducing the deleterious effect of false locking. It appears to the authors that no one has reported in this regard...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{computing}} critical area for open faults (opens) in a circuit layout in the <b>presence</b> of multilayer <b>loops</b> and redundant interconnects. The extraction of critical area is the main computational bottleneck in predicting the yield loss of a VLSI design due to random manufacturing defects. We first model the problem as a geometric graph problem and we solve it efficiently by exploiting its geometric nature. To model open faults we formulate a new geometric version of the classic min-cut problem in graphs, termed the geometric min-cut problem. Then the critical area extraction problem gets reduced to the construction of a generalized Voronoi diagram for open faults, based on concepts of higher order Voronoi diagrams. The approach expands the Voronoi critical area computation paradigm [5, 16 – 19, 22, 28] with the ability to accurately compute critical area for missing material defects even in the <b>presence</b> of <b>loops</b> and redundant interconnects spanning over multiple layers. The generalized Voronoi diagrams used in the solution are combinatorial structures of independent interest...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new way of {{thinking}} about abstract interpre-tation with a method we term environment unrolling. Model checkers for imperative languages will often apply loop unrolling to make their state space finite in the <b>presence</b> of <b>loops</b> and recursion. We propose handling environments in a similar fashion by putting a bound on the number of environments to which a given closure can transitively refer. We present how this idea relates to a normal model of abstract interpretation, give a general overview of its soundness proof in regards to a concrete seman-tics, and show empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Flow typing {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to traditional Hindley-Milner type inference. A key distinction is that variables may have different types at different program points. Flow typing systems are typically formalised {{in the style of}} a dataflow analysis. In the <b>presence</b> of <b>loops,</b> this requires a fix-point computation over typing environments. Unfortunately, for some flow typing problems, the standard iterative fix-point computation may not terminate. We formalise such a problem we encountered in developing the Whiley programming language, and present a novel constraint-based solution which is guaranteed to terminate. This provides a foundation for others when developing such flow typing systems. ...|$|R

40|$|We report {{numerical}} {{results of}} quantum oscillations {{of the specific}} heat in the vortex state of a $d_{x^ 2 -y^ 2 }$-wave superconductor in the <b>presence</b> of <b>loop</b> current order, which gives rise to Fermi pockets coexisting with nodal $d_{x^ 2 -y^ 2 }$-wave superconductivity. Within a lattice tight-binding model, we find that in an intermediate temperature range, the oscillations seem to approximately follow Onsager relation with an effective charge comparable to the electric charge. However, the quasiparticle spectrum does not resemble Landau levels. In {{order to understand the}} origin of the oscillations, we also perform Franz-Tesanovic transformation in the <b>presence</b> of the <b>loop</b> order and find that in addition to scalar and Berry potentials, one component of the gauge invariant superfluid velocity couples to the low lying Dirac particles as a component of a vector potential. The magnetic field associated with this vector potential vanishes on average but is highly non-uniform in the magnetic unit cell. We also compare the results with the model without the loop order but with Zeeman-like coupling which also induces Fermi pockets in the superconducting state. Comment: 13 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

The absence or <b>presence</b> of <b>loops</b> between adjacent layers in the annealed materials is the topic of a growing debate that this Letter aims to put to rest. We offer a rationale explaining why loops do form if Joule heating is used alone, and why adjacent nanoribbon layers do not coalesce when Joule heating is applied after high-energy electrons first irradiate the sample. Our work, based on large-scale quantum molecular dynamics and electronic-transport calculations, shows that vacancies on adjacent graphene sheets, created by electron irradiation, inhibit the formation of edge loops...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{designing}} very high throughput finite state machines (FSMs). The <b>presence</b> of <b>loops</b> in sequential circuits prevents a straightforward and generalized application of pipelining techniques, which work so well for combinational circuits, to increase FSM performance. We observe that appropriate extensions of the “wave steering ” technique [17, 18] are possible to partially overcome the problem. Additionally we use FSM decomposition theory to decouple state variable dependencies. Application of these two techniques to MCNC benchmarks resulted in a factor of 3 average throughput increase as compared to a standard cell implementation, at the expense of factor 3. 7 area and less than factor 2 latency penalties. 1...|$|R
