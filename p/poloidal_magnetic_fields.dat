40|$|We {{model the}} {{non-linear}} ideal magnetohydrodynamics of <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in neutron stars in general relativity assuming a polytropic equation of state. We identify familiar hydromagnetic modes, {{in particular the}} 'sausage/varicose' mode and 'kink' instability inherent to <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The evolution {{is dominated by the}} kink instability, which causes a cataclysmic reconfiguration of the magnetic field. The system subsequently evolves to new, non-axisymmetric, quasi-equilibrium end-states. The existence of this branch of stable quasi-equilibria may have consequences for magnetar physics, including flare generation mechanisms and interpretations of quasi-periodic oscillations.

40|$|We {{obtain the}} general forms {{for the current}} density and the {{vorticity}} from the integrability conditions of the basic equations which govern the stationary states of axisymmetric magnetized self-gravitating barotropic objects with meridional flows under the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation. As seen from the stationary condition equations for such bodies, {{the presence of the}} meridional flows and that of the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> act oppositely on the internal structures. The different actions of these two physical quantities, the meridional flows and the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> could be clearly seen through stationary structures of the toroidal gaseous configurations around central point masses in the framework of Newtonian gravity because the effects of the two physical quantities can be seen in an amplified way for toroidal systems compared to those for spheroidal stars. The meridional flows make the structures more compact, i. e. the widths of toroids thinner, while the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are apt to elongate the density contours in a certain direction depending on the situation. Therefore, the simultaneous presence of the internal flows and the magnetic fields would work as if there were no such different actions within and around the stationary gaseous objects such as axisymmetric magnetized toroids with internal motions around central compact objects under the ideal MHD approximation, although these two quantities might exist in real systems.

40|$|Black hole [...] {{neutron star}} (BHNS) binary mergers can form disks in which magnetorotational {{instability}} (MRI) -induced turbulence may drive accretion onto the remnant BH, supporting relativistic jets and providing the engine for a short-hard gamma-ray burst (SGRB). Our earlier study of magnetized BHNSs showed that NS tidal disruption winds {{the magnetic field}} into a toroidal configuration, with poloidal fields so weak that capturing MRI with full-disk simulations would require âˆ¼ 10 ^ 8 CPU-hours. In that study we imposed equatorial symmetry, suppressing <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> that might be generated from plasma crossing the orbital plane. Here we show that initial conditions that break this symmetry (i. e., tilted <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in the NS) generate much stronger poloidal fields in the disk, indicating that asymmetric initial conditions may be necessary for establishing BHNS mergers as SGRB progenitors via fully general relativistic MHD simulations. We demonstrate that BHNS mergers may form an SGRB engine under the right conditions by seeding the remnant disk from an unmagnetized BHNS simulation with purely poloidal fields dynamically unimportant initially, but strong enough to resolve MRI. Magnetic turbulence occurs in the disk, driving accretion and supporting Poynting-dominated jet outflows sufficient to power an SGRB. Comment: Matches published version; 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|We perform {{nonlinear}} general relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamic {{simulations of}} <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in rotating polytropic neutron stars. We have three primary goals: i) {{to understand the}} nature of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities inherent to <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in non-rotating and rotating neutron stars, ii) to explore the possible space of stable equilibrium configurations and iii) to understand gravitational wave emissions caused by the catastrophic reconfiguration of magnetic fields associated with giant magnetar flares. Our key physical contributions can be summarized as follows: i) gravitational waves from f-modes caused by magnetar flares are unlikely to be detected in the current or near-future generation of gravitational waves observatories, ii) gravitational waves from Alfven waves propagating inside the neutron star are more likely candidates, although this interpretation relies on the unknown damping time of these modes, iii) any magnetic field equilibria derived from our simulations are characterized as non-axisymmetric, with approximately 65 % of their magnetic energy in the poloidal field, iv) rotation acts to separate the timescales of different instabilities in our system, with the varicose mode playing a more major role due to a delayed kink instability and v) despite the slowing growth rate of the kink mode, it is always present in our simulations, even for models where the rotational period is of the same order as the Alfven timescale.

30|$|When {{considering}} {{the effects of}} a current distribution in a sphere, it is common practice to separate the â€˜toroidalâ€™ current systems, which have current purely in concentric spherical surfaces and have no radial component, from the â€˜poloidalâ€™ current systems, which do have radial (as well as tangential) components); see e.g. Backus et al. (1996, section 5.3). It is a standard result that toroidal currents produce only <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> {{both inside and outside the}} region of current, while poloidal current systems produce only toroidal magnetic fields, and these only inside the current region.

40|$|Observations of {{clusters}} of galaxies show ubiquitous presence of X-ray cavities, presumably blown by the active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. We consider magnetic field structures of these cavities.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the King et al. [1] model for the flickering of black hole accretion discs by taking proper account for the thermal properties of the disc. First we develop a one-dimensional, vertically averaged, one-zone model for an optically thick accretion disc and study the temporal evolution. This limits the current model to the so-called high/soft state, where the X-Ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal black-body component. Then we couple this disc model to the flickering process as described in King et al. [1]. Thus we consider the evolution of a <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> subject to a magnetic dynamo.

On the other hand, in a radiation pressure dominated disk the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> will usually move outward faster than it is advected inward.

40|$|A new and {{interesting}} phenomenon {{showing that the}} toroidal current profile for the n= 0 mode, which at first exhibits a peak due to ohmic heating and later flattens around the magnetic axis, is obtained through a compressible resistive MHD simulation in a fully 3 -D toroidal geometry. We conclude through a detailed analysis that the current flattening {{is caused by the}} strong excitation of a nonlinear resistive kink mode. The time-scale of the current profile flattening is of the order of the MHD time-scale. When the current profile is largely flattened, the plasma dynamic pressure due to the strongly excited kink mode pushes the hot core plasma in the radial kink flow direction and the hot core starts deviating from the magnetic surface because of the plasma compressibility and the dynamic pressure. Since the flattening of a current profile weakens the shear effect of the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the q < 1 region where the resistive kink mode is growing, the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> reconnection is driven by the strong kink flow and leads to complete destruction of the magnetic surface within the q= 1 rational surface (minor disruption), and the <b>poloidal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> configuration recovers to an axi-symmetric profile.
