We define two complementary types of failure modes: partial short-circuit and <b>partial</b> <b>disconnect,</b> and demonstrated novel circuits that are resilient across a spectrum of fault levels. In particular, we focus on designs that are uniformly robust, and unlike designs based on redundancy, do not have any single point of failure. We also explore the complementary problem of designing tamper-proof circuits that are highly sensitive to any change or variation in their operating conditions. We find that the number of components remains similar both for robust and standard circuits, suggesting that the robustness does not necessarily come at significant increased circuit complexity.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of phylogenetic analyses is no longer translated into classifications. The resulting phylogeny/classification gap is undesirable because the precise transmission of phylogenetic insights depends on the frequent revision of Linnaean names. The move away from classifying has numerous correlates. These include: an expanded pool of researchers {{who are able to}} produce phylogenetic estimates, a mismatch between the properties of molecular phylogenies and the requirements for verbal Linnaean definitions, the emphasis of statistical representations over the creation and evaluation of scientific terms, and a <b>partial</b> <b>disconnect</b> between the processes of nomenclature and taxonomy. The "taxonomic concept" approach allows systematists to express their varying perspectives with a high precision and can therefore help reduce the aforementioned gap. The phylogeny/classification link must persist in order to ensure community-wide access to, and continued testing of, the products of systematic research. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2005...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nano-bacterial {{cellulose}} (nBC), secreted by Acetobacter xylinum, {{is expected}} to have potential applications in tissue engineering. In this paper, the in-vitro degradation performance and the corresponding mechanism of nBC immersed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for different time periods was investigated. The pH value variation of solution, material degradation, and the swelling and structural changes of nBC was analysed successively. The results indicate that water molecules attack the exposed nBC fibrils, weakening the bonding strength of inter- and intra-molecular chains and <b>disconnecting</b> <b>partial</b> C-O-C bonds. The disconnection of C-O-C bonds is considered the primary reason for the degradation of nBC large molecular chains after nBC is immersed in PBS. The present work is instructive for controlling the in-vivo degradation performance of nBC acting as bone tissue engineered scaffold materials. 1...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} The Letters for a Provincial, {{addressed by}} Mircea Eliade to a hypothetical provincial {{in order to}} prepare access to the capital city. The letters are written so as to dislocate the provincial from a cultural model built on fake values and prejudices. From a mere pretext, the letters are turned into a symbolic act through which the historian of religions assumes, on the one hand, the destiny of a messenger of a new humanism, and, on the other hand, transforms the modern areligious man into a destination point for whom the provincial is the archetype. Thus, in all of Eliade’s works one can trace {{the same pattern of}} dislocation of the <b>partial</b> man, <b>disconnected</b> from archetypes and milestones, in order to re-install him on the road towards the Center, through anthropology structured on cosmic reintegration, alchemy or androgyny in the books of the Romanian period, recovery of the eternal recursion in the Western treatises, and also through the theory of the irecognoscibility of the miracle, in his last essays. The end of the article proposes an answer from the present provincial, who for Eliade was still in the future, an answer showing that the messages of the historian of religions are not reaching him, because he has lost the road towards the Center; moreover, he is situated in an ill-fated extraterritoriality, that is made possible through the great integrations at a horizontal level, and his chance would be the return to the story...|$|R
40|$|Physics at the {{nanoscale}} {{has emerged}} as a field where discoveries of fundamental physical effects lead to a greater understanding of the solid state. This area of research is additionally driven by high hopes for technological relevance and a high pace of experimental achievements in fabrication and characterization has been witnessed in the last decade. From the side of theoretical modeling —so successful in solid state physics in general, since the emergence of density functional theory — we must acknowledge a weak connection to state of the art experimental achievements in the realm of nanostructures. The cause for this <b>partial</b> <b>disconnect</b> resides in the difficulty of the matter. Nanostructures being small in size but large in the number of atoms constituting them, and the relevant observables being accessible only through proper treatment of excitations. The large number of atoms and the need for excited sate properties makes this a challenging task for theory and modeling. In this contribution we will outline the framework, based on empirical pseudopotentials and configuration interaction, to obtain quantitative predictions of the excited state properties of semiconductor nanostructures using their experimental sizes, compositions an...|$|E
40|$|The {{photographic}} work A Mirror With An Imagination {{consists of}} photographs {{made in a}} way consistent with the vernacular photographic tradition. However, their appearance is quite different to what might be expected from that tradition. The lack of worldly context in the images means that they present to the viewer as possibilities, {{to be completed by}} the imagination. The reason for this approach is explained by reference to the <b>partial</b> <b>disconnect</b> between the photographer's intentions and the viewing experience of the audience, as described by Roland Barthes in Camera Lucida (1981). An investigation into Barthes' thought leads to an ontological position espoused by Jean-Paul Sartre in L'Imaginaire (2004), in which he describes the photograph as a partial object with an ontological connection to its referent that nevertheless must be completed by the imagination of the viewer. This action allows for the subjectivity of the viewer to act upon the content of the photograph, as their particular experiences and memories influence what they add to the content of the image. In reflecting on this I identify the theme of the contingent nature of our experience – the sense of the arbitrariness of circumstance and that many things that are might not be, or might be different – as a definitive factor within this subjective action. I also identify that the ontological relationship between world and photograph means that photographs innately express this contingency. I then discuss making photographic work informed by these understandings, in particular the necessity of light in the photographic process and its strong relation to our imaginative metaphorical usage and also the idea of contingency. I continue to outline the choices made in producing this work with reference to the art photographic tradition; in particular the constructed work of Jeff Wall, indexicality as seen in Ed Ruscha and the Bechers, Andreas Gursky's engagement with art history and Hiroshi Sugimoto's conceptual use of light and approach to the sublime...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Classification of {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) images has many clinical and research applications. Because of multiple {{factors such as}} noise, intensity inhomogeneity, and partial volume effects, MR image classification can be challenging. Noise in MRI can cause the classified regions to become <b>disconnected.</b> <b>Partial</b> volume effects make the assignment of a single class to one region difficult. Because of intensity inhomogeneity, {{the intensity of the}} same tissue can vary with respect to the location of the tissue within the same image. The conventional “hard” classification method restricts each pixel exclusively to one class and often results in crisp results. Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) classification or “soft” segmentation has been extensively applied to MR images, in which pixels are partially classified into multiple classes using varying memberships to the classes. Standard FCM, however, is sensitive to noise and cannot effectively compensate for intensity inhomogeneities. This paper presents a method to obtain accurate MR brain classification using a modified multiscale and multiblock FCM...|$|R

The result will not be an elegant or even a fully coherent theoretical explanation, but this is the normal state of affairs in political science. We are not aware of any grand theory of how, say, the American government operates. What we have is a set of <b>partial</b> and rather <b>disconnected</b> theories about the presidency, the cabinet, the logic of congressional action, the politics of regulation, policy making for social security, the development of judicial review, and so on.

40|$|Abstract: In {{southern}} pines of the United States, {{resistance to}} attack by southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann, {{is believed to}} principally involve flow of oleoresin to beetle attack sites. Both environmental and genetic factors are known to affect the quantity of oleoresin flow in loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., but {{little is known about}} the genetic contribution to phenotypic variation in this trait. Here we report estimates of genetic variation in oleoresin flow and growth traits for a population of this species. Oleoresin yield, total height, and diameter were measured on 10 - and 11 -year-old trees from an experimental test in Santa Rosa County, Florida. Trees were from 72 full-sib families pro-duced by mating 48 parents according to a <b>disconnected</b> <b>partial</b> diallel mating design. Resin yield was determined from breast-height samples collected at two times: once in the summer of 1999 when latewood was being produced (summer resin flow), and once in the spring of 2000 during earlywood formation (spring resin flow). All traits studied were found to be highly genetically variable and to have much greater additive than dominance variance. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability for spring and summer resin flow were in the moderate range and are comparable to values obtained for the growth traits. Additive genetic correlations between oleoresin yield and the growth traits were positive and moderately high, suggesting that directional selection to improve growth in loblolly pine will also result in in-creased production of oleoresin.

40|$|Modeling visual scenes {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} tasks of computer vision. Whereas tremendous efforts have been devoted to video analysis in past decades, most prior work focuses on specific tasks, leading to dedicated methods to solve them. This PhD thesis instead aims to derive a probabilistic generative model that coherently integrates different aspects, notably appearance, motion, and the interaction between them. Specifically, this model considers each video as a composite of dynamic layers, each associated with a covering domain, an appearance template, and a flow describing its motion. These layers change dynamically following the associated flows, and are combined into video frames according to a Z-order that specifies their relative depth-order. To describe these layers and their dynamic changes, three major components are incorporated: (1) An appearance model describes the generative process of the pixel values of a video layer. This model, via the combination of a probabilistic patch manifold and a conditional Markov random field, is able to express rich local details while maintaining global coherence. (2) A motion model captures the motion pattern of a layer through a new concept called geometric flow that originates from differential geometric analysis. A geometric flow unifies the trajectory-based representation and the notion of geometric transformation to represent the collective dynamic behaviors persisting over time. (3) A partial Z-order specifies the relative depth order between layers. Here, through the unique correspondence between equivalent classes of partial orders and consistent choice functions, a distribution over the spaces of partial orders is established, and inference can thus be performed thereon. The development of these models leads to significant challenges in probabilistic modeling and inference that need new techniques to address. We studied two important problems: (1) Both the appearance model and the motion model rely on mixture modeling to capture complex distributions. In a dynamic setting, the components parameters and the number of components in a mixture model can change over time. While the use of Dirichlet processes (DPs) as priors allows indefinite number of components, incorporating temporal dependencies between DPs remains a nontrivial issue, theoretically and practically. Our research on this problem leads to a new construction of dependent DPs, enabling various forms of dynamic variations for nonparametric mixture models by harnessing the connections between Poisson and Dirichlet processes. (2) The inference of partial Z-order from a video needs a method to sample from the posterior distribution of partial orders. A key challenge here is that the underlying space of <b>partial</b> orders is <b>disconnected,</b> meaning that one {{may not be able to}} make local updates without violating the combinatorial constraints for partial orders. We developed a novel sampling method to tackle this problem, which dynamically introduces virtual states as bridges to connect between different parts of the space, implicitly resulting in an ergodic Markov chain over an augmented space. With this generative model of visual scenes, many vision problems can be readily solved through inference performed on the model. Empirical experiments demonstrate that this framework yields promising results on a series of practical tasks, including video denoising and inpainting, collective motion analysis, and semantic scene understanding. by Dahua Lin.

40|$|We {{model the}} ascent and {{eruption}} of lunar mare basalt magmas with new data on crustal thickness and density (GRAIL), magma properties, and surface topography, morphology and structure (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter). GRAIL recently measured the broad spatial {{variation of the}} bulk density structure of the crust of the Moon. Comparing this with the densities of lunar basaltic and picritic magmas shows that essentially all lunar magmas were negatively buoyant everywhere within the lunar crust. Thus positive excess pressures must have been present in melts at or below the crust–mantle interface {{to enable them to}} erupt. The source of such excess pressures is clear: melt in any region experiencing partial melting or containing accumulated melt, behaves as though an excess pressure is present {{at the top of the}} melt column if the melt is positively buoyant relative to the host rocks and forms a continuously interconnected network. The latter means that, in partial melt regions, probably at least a few percent melting must have taken place. Petrologic evidence suggests that both mare basalts and picritic glasses may have been derived from polybaric melting of source rocks in regions extending vertically for at least a few tens of km. This is not surprising: the vertical extent of a region containing inter-connected partial melt produced by pressure-release melting is approximately inversely proportional to the acceleration due to gravity. Translating the ∼ 25 km vertical extent of melting in a rising mantle diapir on Earth to the Moon then implies that melting could have taken place over a vertical extent of up to 150 km. If convection were absent, melting could have occurred throughout any region in which heat from radioisotope decay was accumulating; in the extreme this could have been most of the mantle. The maximum excess pressure that can be reached in a magma body depends on its environment. If melt percolates upward from a partial melt zone and accumulates as a magma reservoir, either at the density trap at the base of the crust or at the rheological trap at the base of the elastic lithosphere, the excess pressure at the top of the magma body will exert an elastic stress on the overlying rocks. This will eventually cause them to fail in tension when the excess pressure has risen to close to twice the tensile strength of the host rocks, perhaps up to ∼ 10 MPa, allowing a dike to propagate upward from this point. If partial melting occurs in a large region deep in the mantle, however, connections between melt pockets and veins may not occur until a finite amount, probably a few percent, of melting has occurred. When interconnection does occur, the excess pressure at the top of the partial melt zone will rise abruptly to a high value, again initiating a brittle fracture, i. e. a dike. That sudden excess pressure is proportional to the vertical extent of the melt zone, the difference in density between the host rocks and the melt, and the acceleration due to gravity, and could readily be ∼ 100 MPa, vastly greater than the value needed to initiate a dike. We therefore explored excess pressures in the range ∼ 10 to ∼ 100 MPa. If eruptions take place through dikes extending upward from the base of the crust, the mantle magma pressure at the point where the dike is initiated must exceed the pressure due to the weight of the magmatic liquid column. This means that on the nearside the excess pressure must be at least ∼ 19 ± 9 MPa and on the farside must be ∼ 29 ± 15 MPa. If the top of the magma body feeding an erupting dike is a little way below the base of the crust, slightly smaller excess pressures are needed because the magma is positively buoyant in the part of the dike within the upper mantle. Even the smallest of these excess pressures is greater than the ∼ 10 MPa likely maximum value in a magma reservoir at the base of the crust or elastic lithosphere, but the values are easily met by the excess pressures in extensive partial melt zones deeper within the mantle. Thus magma accumulations at the base of the crust would have been able to intrude dikes part-way through the crust, but not able to feed eruptions to the surface; in order to be erupted, magma must have been extracted from deeper mantle sources, consistent with petrologic evidence. Buoyant dikes growing upward from deep mantle sources of <b>partial</b> melt can <b>disconnect</b> from their source regions and travel through the mantle as isolated bodies of melt that encounter and penetrate the crust–mantle density boundary. They adjust their lengths and internal pressure excesses so that the stress intensity at the lower tip is zero. The potential total vertical extent of the resulting melt body depends on the vertical extent of the source region from which it grew. For small source extents, the upper tip of the resulting dike crossing the crust–mantle boundary cannot reach the surface anywhere on the Moon and therefore can only form a dike intrusion; for larger source extents, the dike can reach the surface and erupt on the nearside but still cannot reach the surface on the farside; for even larger source extents, eruptions could occur on both the nearside and the farside. The paucity of farside eruptions therefore implies a restricted range of vertical extents of partial melt source region sizes, between ∼ 16 and ∼ 36 km. When eruptions can occur, the available pressure in excess of what is needed to support a static magma column to the surface gives the pressure gradient driving magma flow. The resulting typical turbulent magma rise speeds are ∼ 10 to a few tens of m s− 1, dike widths are of order 100 m, and eruption rates from 1 to 10 km long fissure vents are of order 105 to 106 m 3 s− 1. Volume fluxes in lunar eruptions derived from lava flow thicknesses and surface slopes or rille lengths and depths are found to be of order 105 to 106 m 3 s− 1 for volume-limited lava flows and > 104 to 105 m 3 s− 1 for sinuous rilles, with dikes widths of ∼ 50 m. The lower end of the volume flux range for sinuous rilles corresponds to magma rise speeds approaching the limit set by the fact that excessive cooling would occur during flow up a 30 km long dike kept open by a very low excess pressure. These eruptions were thus probably fed by partial melt zones deep in the mantle. Longer eruption durations, rather than any subtle topographic slope effects, appear to be the key to the ability of these flows to erode sinuous rille channels. We conclude that: (1) essentially all lunar magmas were negatively buoyant everywhere within the crust; (2) positive excess pressures of at least 20 – 30 MPa must have been present in mantle melts at or below the crust–mantle interface to drive magmas to the surface; (3) such pressures are easily produced in zones of partial melting by pressure-release during mantle convection or simple heat accumulation from radioisotopes; (4) magma volume fluxes available from dikes forming at the tops of partial melt zones are consistent with the 105 to 106 m 3 s− 1 volume fluxes implied by earlier analyses of surface flows; (5) eruptions producing thermally-eroded sinuous rille channels involved somewhat smaller volume fluxes of magma where the supply rate may be limited by the rate of extraction of melt percolating through partial melt zones...|$|R
