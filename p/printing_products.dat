40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{environmental data}} relating to gravure and offset printing. It {{focuses on the}} printing steps in the production chain of publication <b>printed</b> <b>products.</b> The other steps in the life-cycle of <b>printed</b> <b>products</b> have also been studied {{but they are not}} the subjects of this paper. The study is based on case studies, where almost twenty gravure printers and ten offset printers from around Europe and the United States have been involved. The general, significant environmental aspects of publication <b>printed</b> <b>products</b> have been identified as the following; use of paper, use of energy, consumption (loss) of volatile organic compounds (VOC), including toluene, hazardous waste and environmental management. Transport has also been identified as a significant environmental aspect for <b>printed</b> <b>products</b> but, to a great extent, its magnitude depends on the particular product. The data collected from printers {{in different parts of the}} world were compared to environmental data provided by offset printers in Sweden, which were mainly taken from coldset printers. This paper presents significant environmental data for a fairly large number of companies representing a considerable part of the printing capacity, not only in Europe but also worldwide. These data can provide guidance for both printers and buyers of <b>printed</b> <b>products</b> working to achieve continual improvements and striving towards more environmentally adapted <b>printed</b> <b>products.</b> To some extent, the data can also be used as reference values, since there are few compilations of data providing a general coverage of printers in different parts of the world. </p...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{information}} consumption habits {{have been especially}} rapid and deep {{in the last five}} years. As examples, Facebook, with more than 90 millions users {{at the time of this}} writing, was launched on 2004, and YouTube, a new model that has revolutionized the way the users are getting content, as well as the content itself, started in 2005. These rapid changes are threatening the printing industry. What will be the motivation and environment for consumers to print? What content will consumers prefer to print? What values will consumers appreciate in the <b>print</b> <b>product</b> versus the digital? What will be the role of the printing industry in this new environment? This research is focused exclusively on personal <b>printed</b> <b>products</b> that are created by the current US college-aged population, and offers a prediction for the research questions based mainly on the analysis of 21 interviews conducted with experts in the printing industry and on a wide literature review. The main conclusions obtained in this study are: The current college-aged US population has a very limited interest for <b>printed</b> personal <b>products</b> at their current stage of life, but this interest will grow substantially in the next years. They will print many more personal products than the previous generation did, very often through a social networking environment. The content of these new products will be more visual and more personal, covering all kinds of daily events. Users will use mostly their own content, but they will be able to blend it with professionally created content in a broad gamut of <b>products.</b> Personal <b>printed</b> <b>products</b> will extend to other products and substrates, such as textiles. <b>Printed</b> <b>products</b> are perceived less as a useful or convenient and more as a sensorial and fixed products, something that has value itself. The value of the <b>printed</b> <b>products</b> is precisely that they cannot be used for a purpose other than the purpose of the author. They cannot be reprinted. The industry has to make the process extremely easy for the user, to remove knowledge needed, to be accessible from everywhere at any time, and to make the whole process easy, fast, and fun. The new professionals will need to understand the whole workflow as a manufacturing process, to improve communication skills, to pay more attention to customer service, and to understand how databases interact with content to customize any <b>printed</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R
