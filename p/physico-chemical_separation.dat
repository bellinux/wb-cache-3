40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is the {{production}} of commercial quality precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) for use in papermaking as filler or coating pigment. The calcium source explored is not traditionally pure calcium (hydr) oxides or salts, but rather leachates extracted from steelmaking slags. Utilizing a waste-derived source for PCC production enables the possibility to valorize two thermal residues of steelmaking, namely the slag and carbon dioxide. Additionally, after the calcium extraction, the residual solids, rich in silica and aluminum oxide, can be valorized as a raw material for zeolite synthesis. The main challenge addressed in this work is the prevention of impurity contamination of the formed PCC’s, especially Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Si and Ti. Three approaches are investigated: (i) the selective leaching of calcium, (ii) the purification of the calcium-rich leachates using <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>separation</b> methods, and (iii) the preferential crystallization of pure PCC by controlling precipitation conditions. The produced PCC’s are characterized for chemical, mineralogical, morphological and optical properties to assess their applicability for use in papermaking. The next stage of this research will be the utilization of the produced PCC’s in papermaking applications. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{tremendous}} amount of wet flue-gas desulfurization scrubber sludge (estimated 20 million metric tons {{per year in the}} US) is currently being landfilled at a huge cost to utility companies. Scrubber sludge is the solid precipitate produced during desulfurization of flue-gas from burning high sulfur coal. The amount of this sludge is expected to increase in the near future due to ever increasing governmental regulation concerning the amount of sulfur emissions. Scrubber sludge is a fine, grey colored powder that contains calcium sulfite hemihydrate (CaSO{sub 3 } {center_dot} 1 / 2 H{sub 2 }), calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO{sub 4 } {center_dot} 2 H{sub 2 }O), limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }), silicates, and iron oxides. This material can continue to be landfilled at a steadily increasing cost, or an alternative for utilizing this material can be developed. This study explores the characteristics of a naturally oxidized wet flue-gas desulfurization scrubber sludge and uses these characteristics to develop alternatives for recycling this material. In order for scrubber sludge {{to be used as a}} feed material for various markets, it was necessary to process it to meet the specifications of these markets. A physical separation process was therefore needed to separate the components of this sludge into useful products at a low cost. There are several physical separation techniques available to separate fine particulates. These techniques can be divided into four major groups: magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>separation,</b> and density-based separation. The properties of this material indicated that two methods of separation were feasible: water-only cycloning (density-based separation), and froth flotation (<b>physico-chemical</b> <b>separation).</b> These processes could be used either separately, or in combination. The goal of this study was to reduce the limestone impurity in this scrubber sludge from 5. 6 % by weight to below 2. 0 % by weight. The resulting clean calcium sulfite/sulfate material can be oxidized into a synthetic gypsum that can be used in several markets which include: wallboard manufacturing, plaster, portland cement, and as a soil conditioner. Single stage water-only cycloning removed nearly 50 % of the limestone by weight from the scrubber sludge and maintained a weight recovery of 76 %. Froth flotation produced a calcium sulfite/sulfate that contained 4. 30 % limestone by weight with a 71 % weight recovery. These methods were successful in removing some of the limestone impurity, but were not able to meet the specifications needed. However, the combination of water-only cycloning and froth flotation provided a clean, useful calcium sulfite/sulfate material with a limestone grade of 1. 70 % by weight and a total weight recovery of nearly 66 %...|$|E
40|$|AbstractClosed-loop {{nutrient}} cycling is a simple, persuasive {{and elegant}} approach to realize efficient natural resource management, improved human well-being and long-term food security. In {{the spirit of}} sustainable sanitation through nutrient cycling, this study proposes a new pathway to realize resource recovery from anthropogenic waste fractions by the application of <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>separation</b> processes. Microwave Activated Carbon (MAC) prepared from coconut shells (agro-waste) were immobilized on etched glass bead supports and utilized within a continuous flow packed-bed column. Physical adsorption experiments were performed by passing human urine through the column to strip and recover more than 80 % of the intrinsic urea. Backwashing of the column was performed to demonstrate the ease of urea-N desorption, reusability of MAC over multiple cycles and the reversible nature of the process. Further nutrient recovery was realized by dephosphatizing the column overflow with MgO to allow phosphate precipitation (> 90 %) as struvite. Sorption kinetics, behaviour and influence of process parameters were studied by testing the experimental data against Yoon-Nelson, Thomas and Adams-Bohart models. The column adsorption was also numerically optimized using Response Surface Methodology to determine the optimal parameters as: sorbate flow rate – 8. 5 L. h- 1, urea concentration – 100 %, support size – 1 cm and consequently, column capacity of 21. 58 g. Nutrient recovery, concentration and recycling from diverted human urine {{can be seen as}} a synergistic and circular solution to the issues of sanitation, hygiene, water, and food security...|$|E
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{waste and}} bacterial contamination in <b>physico-chemical</b> and biological <b>separation</b> processes used today for nitrate removal from ground water make novel catalytic technologies that convert nitrates to unharmful gaseous nitrogen, very attractive for scientific research. The Mg-Cu-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) based catalysts with different Mg/Al ratio were investigated in water denitrification {{reaction in the}} presence of hydrogen and with solely copper as an active phase. Since LDHs have ion exchange properties and their derived mixed oxides possess memory effect (restoration of layered structure after thermal decomposition), their adsorption capacity for nitrates was also measured in the same model system. All studied samples showed nitrate removal from 23 % to 62 % following the decrease in Al content, as well as the substantial adsorption capacity ranging from 18 % to 38 %. These results underlie the necessity {{to take into account the}} effects of the adsorption in all future investigations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Environmental risk {{assessment}} (ERA) is predominantly a scientific activity and involves {{a critical review}} of available data {{for the purpose of}} identifying and possibly quantifying the risks associated with a potential threat. Risk management (RM) is performed to consider the need to impose measures to control or manage the risk. The working methodology presented in this paper was done based on several research studies for the environmental {{risk assessment}} for soil pollution with hidrocarbures from accidental crude oil spills. The qualitative and quantitative assessment of the environmental risk for industrial sites for drilling, gas oil separation it is complex and require several data. For these reasons a environmental risk calculation methodology for soil is presented which is structured in modules and steps. Environment risk assessment of pollution with hydrocarbons from crude oil comprises five interrelated modules: hazard identification, hazard assessment, risk estimation by the award of „grades ” for the frequency and severity of consequences environmental risk assessment based on risk criteria (ALARP) and environmental risk management. The modules required data: technical data for the equipment in the upstream industrial activities, extraction and gas-oil <b>separation,</b> <b>physico-chemical</b> analysis for the soil contaminants, soil properties that may influence the severity and consequences of the default risk, charts, mathematical equations and matrix assessment of environmental risk intensity. In the methodology are established the steps needed to calculate the alert threshold and intervention and additional studies needed (geotechnical study, pedological and chemical study) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthetics}} dyes {{are dangerous}} for {{human being and}} aquatic life when it pollute of water resources. Textile processing manufacture is the largest sector and initiator of fluid sewage {{in the shape of}} pollutants containing synthetics dyes. Several wastewater treatment technologies are used to treat of these pollutants including conventional and advances treatment such as <b>Physico-chemical,</b> electrochemical, membrane <b>separation,</b> and reverse osmosis. Nevertheless, all these technologies are high cost operating, need of huge space, limited flexibility and generate by-products. The microbial field which is fungal based bioremediation gives promising treatment for decolorize and degrade the synthetic dye in wastewater from textile industry. It was found to be an environmental friendly, low-cost operation and effective compared to conventional and advances treatments. In this present study, the fungal strains from soil and decayed wood isolated from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) Campus and some region in Johor Bahru forest were screened and selected for its ability to decolorize the azo dye, Mordant Orange- 1 (MO- 1). Two isolates RY 36 and RY 42 showed its ability for decolorization of MO- 1 dye, among fifty fungal strains collected. The degradation experiments were conducted in both of the solid and liquid medium amended with 50 ppm of MO- 1 dye. The efficient degraders, RY 36 and RY 42 were identified using 18 S rRNA sequence analysis and morphology characterization. From the results obtained, these fungi belong to the group of Trichoderma harzianum RY 36 and Acremonium spinosum RY 42, respectively. Further, the effect of various environmental factors parameters such as carbon and nitrogen sources, surfactant (Tween 80), aromatic compounds and pH on the dye decolorization by Trichoderma harzianum RY 36 and Acremonium spinosum RY 42 in the liquid medium was assessed. Trichoderma harzianum RY 36 showed efficient decolorization with addition of glucose (84. 16 %), ammonium nitrate (79. 41 %), tween 80 0. 1 mL (27. 68 %), salicylic acid (84. 73 %) pH 3 (89. 42 %) and maximum biomass production of 6840 mg/L was achieved in the presence of yeast extract. Meanwhile, Acremonium spinosum RY 42 showed efficient decolorization of MO- 1 with addition of glucose (86. 6 %), ammonium nitrate (70. 21 %), Tween 80 0. 1 mL (12. 77 %), salicylic acid (84. 68 %) pH 3 (89. 6 %) and maximum biomass production of 7850 mg/L was achieved in the presence of Tween 80 (1. 5 mL). Further, the degradation products of MO- 1 by both of the isolates were identified using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrophotometer (GC-MS). The analytical results showed that maleic acid and Isophthalic acid were formed during the degradation of MO- 1 by Trichoderma harzianum RY 36. In the case of Acremonium spinosum RY 42, salicylic acid and benzoic acid were identified as metabolic products during the degradation of MO- 1 dye...|$|R
40|$|In nature, the {{commonly}} occurring reactive metal oxides of titanium, chromium, aluminium, and vanadium often chemically combine with the transition metal oxides such as iron oxides and form complex minerals. <b>Physico-chemical</b> <b>separation</b> of transition metal oxides from the remaining reactive metal oxides is therefore {{an important step}} in the purification of reactive oxide constituents. Each purification step has quite a high energy requirement at present. Current practice in industry yields sulphate and neutralized chloride waste from titanium dioxide enrichment, red mud from bauxite refining, slag and leach residues from vanadium extraction and chromite ore process residue (COPR) from chromate processes. In this review article, a novel alkali-based oxidative roasting and aqueous leaching for the extraction of mineral oxides is explained {{in the context of the}} original work of Le Chatelier in 1850, which was unsuccessful in the industrialization of bauxite processing for alumina extraction. However, much later in the 19 th century the alkali-based oxidative mineral roasting was successfully developed for industrial scale manufacturing of chromate chemicals, which yields COPR. The crystal chemistry of mineral oxides, namely alumina, titanium dioxide, and chromium oxide in naturally occurring minerals is briefly reviewed in the context of chemical extraction, which is then developed as a model for developing thermodynamic chemical equilibrium principles for analyzing the physical separation and enrichment of such reactive metal oxides by forming water-soluble and water-insoluble alkali complexes. The involvement of the alkali roasting chemistry of non-magnetic titaniferous mineral waste is also reported in the initial separation of rare-earth oxide mixtures for subsequent separation of individual oxides. The paper concludes with a generic approach to process chemistry which minimizes waste generation and therefore helps in reducing the overall process and energy costs. Examples of recovering alkali from high pH solution using carbon dioxide are also demonstrated...|$|E
30|$|The second, {{outstanding}} keynote lecture {{was given}} by Dr. Werner Brack (UFZ, Leipzig, Germany). He underlined the fact that monitoring programmes and target analysis had, in general, necessarily focused on {{a limited number of}} chemicals (underpinned even with the current concept of WFD-stipulated 33 + 8 priority substances lists). The effect prediction and risk assessment of contaminated sediments based on target analytes always run the risk to ignore important or even key chemicals causing effects. Thus, in many cases, the agreement between measured effects and expected effects based on chemical analysis is poor. To overcome this problem, the concept of effect-directed analysis (EDA) has been developed to focus chemical analysis on those compounds causing the effects. EDA combines toxicity testing with fractionation procedures to isolate toxic fractions and individual toxicants, and non-target chemical analysis and structure elucidation to identify causative toxicants. Several successful studies (including the results of an on-going project on the Sava River presented by Dr. Tvrtko Smital, Rudjer Bošković Institute, Zagreb, Croatia, later during the session) demonstrated that EDA was indeed a powerful tool to identify known and unknown toxicants. However, Dr. Brack emphasized the still existing shortcomings and limitations of EDA and some of the research needs to address them, such as (1) novel extraction and dosing techniques considering bioavailability, (2) in vitro and in vivo testing with higher diagnostic power, (3) improved fractionation procedures exploiting a broad range of <b>physico-chemical</b> properties for <b>separation</b> but reducing expenses and the risk of artefacts by automation, (4) novel analytical and computer tools for better structure elucidation, (5) models for prediction of chromatographic behaviour, of mass and other spectra and of effects based on the chemical structure (quantitative structure-activity relationships and structure alerts) and (6) approaches to confirm identified chemicals as cause of the effects and as a potential hazard in the environment. In line with the former, Dr. Marjan Ahel (Rudjer Bošković Institute, Zagreb, Croatia) stressed the importance of extending analytical window to more polar compounds as a prerequisite for detection of emerging classes of aquatic contaminants, which might be essential for better ecotoxicological assessment of wastewaters and ambient waters. As the WFD directs member states to monitor macroinvertebrates and develop sediment quality standards, there is clearly scope for consideration of sediment quality {{as an integral part of}} river basin management. Yet, as presented by Jos Brils (Deltares, The Netherlands), the preliminary overview of river basin management plans (RBMP) shows extreme inconsistency across Europe--neither sediment management issues became integral part of RBMP nor sediment quality assessment plays an important role in assessing ecological/chemical status. The problem of up-scaling in ERA was tackled by Dr. Mikhail Beketov (UFZ, Leipzig). By giving a number of examples, he showed how ecological knowledge and methods, spanning from organism to ecosystem and landscape levels of complexity, provided essential scientific background for risk assessment, in the first place, regarding measuring and predicting effects of toxicants at the community and ecosystem levels. Toxic effects' alterations caused by system properties at population and community levels were discussed in particular, and the species-at-risk approach based on ecological traits was presented.|$|R
