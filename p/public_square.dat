5|$|The {{house was}} built in 1879 by William Palmer Southworth, a Cleveland {{businessman}} who established W.P. Southworth Co., a leading Cleveland grocery, in the 1850s. He and his wife Louise were prominent in Cleveland society; while she was {{a leader of the}} women's suffrage movement, his store (located in <b>Public</b> <b>Square</b> downtown) was significant enough that its destruction by fire in 1882 prompted a front-page story in the New York Times.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park {{has been}} public {{property}} since the Dongan Charter was granted to Albany incorporating it as a city. The charter specified that all land not privately owned {{at the time}} became property of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty {{of the city of}} Albany, including the land that would become the site of Washington Park. A portion of the land was set aside for a structure built to house gunpowder in 1802, and in 1806 the areas between Willett and Knox streets, and between State Street and Madison Avenue, became the Middle <b>Public</b> <b>Square.</b> In 1800, the land west of Knox Street to Robin Street and south from State Street to Hudson Avenue was taken for a cemetery, which was apportioned into sections for each of Albany's churches. There were separate sections for African-Americans and for strangers. West of the cemetery was the alms-house farm and the penitentiary grounds. In 1809 the Middle <b>Public</b> <b>Square</b> was renamed Washington Square, and later the Washington Parade Ground. In 1868 the remains and headstones in the cemetery were removed and reinterred, most to Albany Rural Cemetery, and some to the cemeteries of other churches.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Cleveland is {{centered}} on <b>Public</b> <b>Square</b> and includes {{a wide range of}} diversified districts. Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the Flats and the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments has been on the increase since 2000. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the courthouse building, the <b>public</b> <b>square</b> contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cultural festivals, Cleveland hosted the CMJ Rock Hall Music Fest, which featured national and local acts, including both established artists and up-and-coming acts, but the festival was discontinued in 2007 due to financial and manpower costs to the Rock Hall. The annual Ingenuity Fest, Notacon and TEDxCLE conference focus on the combination of art and technology. The Cleveland International Film Festival has been held annually since 1977, and it drew a record 66,476 people in March 2009. Cleveland also hosts an annual holiday display lighting and celebration, dubbed Winterfest, which is held downtown at the city's historic hub, <b>Public</b> <b>Square.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meir Ben-Dov {{believed}} that the Acra stood {{just south of the}} Huldah Gates of the southern wall of the Herodian Temple Mount platform. Benjamin Mazar's excavations of the Ophel, the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform, have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large cistern, both possibly dating to the Hellenistic period. These have been tentatively identified as remnants of the Acra, with the structure, featuring rows of small interconnected rooms, believed to be the remains of a barracks. These had been demolished and built over during the Hasmonean period, matching the descriptions in Josephus. The Hasmonean constructions were, in turn, flattened to create a <b>public</b> <b>square</b> fronting the main gates to the Temple platform during the Herodian renovations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} sensuous {{relationship}} amongst {{people and the}} physical elements located in <b>public</b> <b>squares.</b> The research focuses {{on the study of}} sensuous geography and its social implications in contemporary city context. Case studies were drawn from various Western countries. A Lefebvrian approach was utilized to analyse the research findings. The study has generated a preliminary sensuous geography checklist for <b>public</b> <b>squares</b> that can predict the degree of popularity and experiential qualities of <b>public</b> <b>squares.</b> However, limits existed in the paper as sensory experiences are conditioned by individual, socio-cultural and climatic influences. The study suggests further integrated approach is needed in this field of study. The research findings indicated that better knowledge of sensuous geography is important in the design and planning disciplines...|$|R

5|$|Over the {{following}} months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, {{just one week}} before the Revolution was crushed, crowds entered the Interior Ministry, taking over the official copies of Regulamentul Organic and the register of boyar ranks (Arhondologia). The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, in the <b>public</b> <b>square</b> on Mitropoliei Hill. Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a curse on both pieces of legislation.|$|E
5|$|The Ogle County Courthouse is a National Register of Historic Places listing in the Ogle County, Illinois, {{county seat}} of Oregon. The {{building}} {{stands on a}} <b>public</b> <b>square</b> in the city's downtown commercial district. The current structure was completed in 1891 and was preceded by two other buildings, {{one of which was}} destroyed by a group of outlaws. Following the destruction of the courthouse, the county was without a judicial building for a period during the 1840s. The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The ridged roof is dominated by its wooden cupola which stands out at a distance.|$|E
5|$|The site abuts a major ancient intersection. Opposite lay a large <b>public</b> <b>square</b> {{fronting}} the Temple's main Hulda Gates. The Tyropoeon street {{itself was}} lined with shops and formed part of the city's Lower Market. The Royal Stoa, an exceptionally large basilica complex which served various commercial and legal functions, looked down on the intersection from atop the Temple platform. Although the Stoa stood on the Temple esplanade, it was constructed upon an expansion added by Herod. It was therefore evidently not considered sacred by some at the time, allowing it {{to be used for}} mundane activities. The heavy public traffic to and from this edifice accounts for the width of the stepped street, which approximates that of a modern four-lane highway.|$|E

5|$|West of {{the city}} of Watertown, NY3 intersects NY180 {{southwest}} of the Watertown International Airport before connecting to I-81 by way of an interchange at the city line. NY3 heads east into Watertown, intersecting with both US11 and NY12 at Massey Street. At this point, maintenance of NY3 shifts from the state to the city of Watertown. The route overlaps NY12 southbound and a short piece of US11 northbound through downtown to <b>Public</b> <b>Square,</b> where NY3 meets northbound NY12. US11 northbound leaves NY3 here while the overlap between NY3 and NY12 continues eastward through Watertown. The concurrency ends near the eastern fringe {{of the city}}, where NY3 leaves NY12 and becomes state-maintained once more as it departs the city to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Wrigley Square is a <b>public</b> <b>square</b> {{located in}} the {{northwest}} corner of Millennium Park near the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan, across from the Historic Michigan Boulevard District.
