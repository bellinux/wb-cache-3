Main problem with water is its permanent microbiological contamination and periodicaly high turbidity. This graduation thesis – university studies presents several methods to cope mentioned problems. It focuses on two methods, conventional – <b>pressure</b> <b>filters</b> and alternative – ultrafiltration. Both methods are designed for flow of 30 m 3 /h. Before water enters distribution system it must be disinfected, which is done by combined disinfection with UV radiation and chlorine dioxide as residual. Water treatment at spring Jama ends with treatment of concentrated water that is produced by bachwash. In case of <b>pressure</b> <b>filters</b> backwash water is drawn directly to sedimentation basin with retention time of 2 hours and then pumped out to stream. In case of ultrafiltration, membranes are washed also with chemicals. In this situation is build neutralization basin before sedimentation basin. Water from sedimentation basin is pumped out into stream. Sediments from sedimentation basin are taken to deposit. Both methods are evaluated by different criteria.

40|$|The {{advanced}} fine-coal cleaning {{techniques such}} as column flotation, recovers a low-ash ultra-fine size clean-coal product. However, economical dewatering of the clean coal product to less than 20 percent moisture using conventional technology is difficult. This research program objective is to evaluate a novel coal surface modification technique developed at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research in conjunction with conventional and advanced dewatering technique at a pilot scale. The study which is in progress is being conducted at the Powell Mountain Coal Company`s Mayflower preparation plant located in St. Charles, VA. During this quarter laboratory dewatering studies were conducted using a 4 -in diameter laboratory chemical centrifuge. The baseline data provided a filter cake with about 32 % moisture. Addition of 0. 3 kg/t of a cationic surfactant lowered the moisture to 29 %. Addition of anionic and non-ionic surfactant was not effective in reducing the filter cake moisture content. In the pilot scale studies, a comparison was conducted between the high pressure and vacuum dewatering techniques. The base line data with high pressure and vacuum filtration provided filter cakes with 23. 6 % and 27. 8 % moisture, respectively.

40|$|The eighth {{bench scale}} test of POC program, Run PB- 08, was {{successfully}} completed from August 8 to August 26, 1997. A total of five operating conditions were tested aiming at evaluating the reactivity of different pyrolysis oils in liquefaction of a Wyoming sub-bituminous coal (Black Thunder coal). For the first time, water soluble promoters {{were incorporated into}} the iron-based GelCat to improve the dispersion of the promoter metals in the feed blend. The concentration of the active metals, Mo and Fe, was 100 and 1000 ppm of moisture-free coal, respectively. Black Thunder coal used in this run was the same batch as tested in HTI�s Run POC- 02. Similar to Runs PB- 01 through 7, this run employed two back mixed slurry reactors, an interstage gas/slurry separator and a direct-coupled hydrotreater. In addition to the hot vapor from the second stage separator, the first stage separator overhead liquid was also fed to the hydrotreater, which was packed with Criterion C- 411 hydrotreating catalyst. Pyrolysis oil was produced off-line from a pyrolysis unit acquired from University of Wyoming. Solids rejection was achieved by purging out <b>pressure</b> <b>filter</b> solid. The recycle solvents consisted of O- 6 separator bottoms and <b>pressure</b> <b>filter</b> liquid (PFL). The Run PB- 08 proceeded very smoothly without any interruptions. Coal conversion consistently above 90 W% was achieved. High resid conversion and distillate yield have been obtained from co-processing of coal and 343 °C+ (650 °F+) pyrolysis oil. Light gas (C 1 -C 3) yield was minimized and hydrogen consumption was reduced due {{to the introduction of}} pyrolysis oil, compared with conventional coal-derived solvent. Catalytic activity was improved by incorporating a promoter metal into the iron-based GelCat. It seemed that lowering the first stage temperature to 435 °C might increase the hydrogenation function of the promoter metal. In comparison with previous coal-waste coprocessing run (PB- 06), significant improvements in the process performance were achieved due to catalyst modification and integration of pyrolysis technique into liquefaction...|$|E
