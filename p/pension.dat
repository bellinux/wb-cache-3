5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability <b>Pension</b> Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. <b>Pension</b> expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by <b>Pension</b> Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the <b>pension</b> laws. An investigation into the <b>Pension</b> Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting <b>pension</b> cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of <b>pensions</b> as an element of total {{executive}} compensation, {{and the relationship between}} <b>pensions</b> and performance-based compensation in executive pay. Using hand-collected data on FTSE 100 CEOs and senior executives from 2004 - 2011, we document that <b>pensions</b> function as a substitute for performance-based compensation (primarily bonuses) in both cross-sectional and time-series settings. We also examine the effect of corporate governance characteristics on executive <b>pensions.</b> We find that corporate governance characteristics associated with stronger board monitoring play a constraining role on the magnitude of <b>pensions.</b> Our evidence of substitution effects between <b>pensions</b> and performance-based compensation is consistent with a managerial power view of executive compensation-setting, and the use of <b>pensions</b> as a 'stealth' element of compensation. Our findings are robust to considering different types of <b>pensions,</b> product market competition, and cross-listing. Sub-period analysis shows that <b>pensions</b> decrease and substitution effects weaken following the 2008 financial crisis. Moreover, we find no evidence that the use of compensation consultants with potential conflicts of interest is associated with higher <b>pensions.</b> Overall, our study contributes to a greater understanding of {{the role of}} <b>pensions</b> in executive compensation, and shows the importance of including <b>pensions</b> in analysis of executive compensation.
