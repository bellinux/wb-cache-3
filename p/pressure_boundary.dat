Heat transfer coefficients and skin friction coefficients were derived from skin temperature time histories and shear force measurements, respectively.

40|$|Gas {{injection}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely applied enhanced oil recovery methods. Existing analytical solutions to gas injection processes are based on the standard fractional flow assumption of a constant flow rate. Realistically, most reservoirs are operated with constant injection and production pressures where the total volumetric flux varies with time. An analytical model for the gas injection process with constant <b>pressure</b> <b>boundaries</b> and a numerical compositional model are developed in this thesis. By using the standard fractional flow analysis, the Riemann problem associated with the ternary gas injection process is solved. Based on the solution of the eigenvalue and elementary waves, the time dependent total flux, pressure distribution, and saturation profile with constant <b>pressure</b> <b>boundaries</b> are directly calculated by applying the approach developed by Johansen and James (2012). The analysis of the ternary gas injection problem provides the fundamental method for systems with higher numbers of components. [...] The solution from the two-dimensional numerical model interprets the effects from the component property and heterogeneity in the reservoir to the displacement performance. The analytical solution is compared with the numerical solution. It shows that the grid block refinement plays a significant role in the behaviour of the numerical solution. By studying both the analytical and numerical methods, agreement and disparity of solutions between the two approaches can be investigated...|$|R
30|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are twofold. First, we modify the Hearn/Dykstra–Parsons method using fractional flow theory instead of the assumption of piston-like displacement. We do this by first presenting a generalized method for developing pseudorelative permeability curves using the assumption of constant flow rate in each layer, as in Hearn (1971). Second, the main result {{of this paper is}} presented which is to extend the generation of the pseudorelative permeabilities to constant <b>pressure</b> grid block <b>boundaries.</b> In this, no approximation is made since a closed formula solution for the flow rate as a function of time was presented in Johansen and James (2016), see also “Appendix A”. The idea of generating pseudorelative permeability curves to simulate waterflooding in a reservoir with constant grid block <b>pressure</b> <b>boundaries</b> has not been previously studied, and as will be demonstrated, it is a more accurate method compared to the constant flow rate-generated pseudofunctions.|$|R
50|$|In events {{where the}} reactor coolant <b>pressure</b> <b>boundary</b> remains intact, the Isolation Condenser System (ICS) {{is used to}} remove decay heat from the reactor and {{transfer}} it outside containment. The ICS system is a closed loop system that connects the reactor pressure vessel to a heat exchanger located in the upper elevation of the reactor building. Steam leaves the reactor through the ICS piping and travels to the ICS heat exchangers which are submerged in a large pool. The steam is condensed in the heat exchangers and the denser condensate then flows {{back down to the}} reactor to complete the cooling loop. Reactor coolant is cycled through this flow path to provide continuous cooling and to add water to the reactor core.|$|E
50|$|At the John Dye {{conditioning}} plant, two pumping stations {{located on}} {{the north and south}} sides of the plant draw finished water from three ground level storage facilities and pump to the distribution system. The Dye pump station, {{located on the}} south side of the conditioning plant, pumps water to the north towards Dewitt Township, Bath Township, and Watertown Township, to the west to Delta Township, and to the local distribution system. The Cedar Street pump station provides supplemental pumping capacity during periods of high demand. The Wise Road conditioning plants similarly pumps water directly into the distribution system, and generally feeds portions of Windsor Township, Delhi Township, and Alaiedon Township. Using a series of normally closed valves and booster stations, a <b>pressure</b> <b>boundary</b> exists roughly along I-96.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, a plywood {{cover was}} left in the boiler after {{completion}} of a maintenance outage. When the heat transport pumps were restarted, the cover was sucked into the heat transport system where it caused catastrophic damage to one of the pumps. The cause of the incident was lack of control of temporary modifications, poor work management, lack of foreign material exclusion (FME) measures, and human error. There was no public safety significance to the event, since the reactor had been shut down long enough that decay heat power was below the level that required coolant flow. However, the breach of the <b>pressure</b> <b>boundary</b> at the damaged pump created a radiation hazard for workers, and debris in feeders, fuel channels and potentially other Heat Transport and Auxiliaries pipework could have created a significant safety hazard during at-power operation. The cost of pump repairs, and the production downtime caused by the incident and its cleanup, was significant. The incident also left wood and metal debris unrecoverable in the cooling system. Maintenance incidents at Lepreau in 1995 cost the facility more than $50 million in repairs and replacement power.|$|E

50|$|As the {{majority}} of transmission lines, transport systems and storage reservoirs are manufactured with soft carbon steel, all stages of a pipeline are vulnerable to erosion of pipeline components in the transmission line by exposure to Black Powder. Iron sulfides and iron oxides significantly damage components from {{the origin of the}} pipeline to the final product delivery because prior to precipitation, they are at and below sub-micron levels, therefore undetectable when passing through sensors and meters. Black Powder, at this size, damages pump seals, meters, valves, and compressor components because it plates out and wears on exchangers, trays, orifices and valves. These compromised components and instrumentation, lead to flow restriction and disrupted <b>pressure</b> <b>boundaries.</b>|$|R
