40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a complex multifactorial falls prevention (MFFP) intervention for implementation and testing {{within the framework of}} a large UK-based falls prevention randomised controlled trial (RCT). A complex intervention was developed for inclusion within the Prevention of Falls Injury Trial (<b>PreFIT),</b> a multicentre pragmatic RCT. <b>PreFIT</b> aims to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of three alternative primary care falls prevention interventions (advice, exercise and MFFP), on outcomes of fractures and falls. Community-dwelling adults, aged 70  years and older, were recruited from primary care in the National Health Service (NHS), England. Development of the <b>PreFIT</b> MFFP intervention was informed by the existing evidence base and clinical guidelines for the assessment and management of falls in older adults. After piloting and modification, the final MFFP intervention includes seven falls risk factors: a detailed falls history interview with consideration of 'red flags'; assessment of balance and gait; vision; medication screen; cardiac screen; feet and footwear screen and home environment assessment. This complex intervention has been fully manualised with clear, documented assessment and treatment pathways for each risk factor. Each risk factor is assessed in every trial participant referred for MFFP. Referral for assessment is based upon a screening survey to identify those with a history of falling or balance problems. Intervention delivery can be adapted to the local setting. This complex falls prevention intervention is currently being tested within the framework of a large clinical trial. This paper adheres to TIDieR and CONSORT recommendations for the comprehensive and explicit reporting of trial interventions. Results from the <b>PreFIT</b> study will be published in due course. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the <b>PreFIT</b> MFFP intervention, compared to advice and exercise, on the prevention of falls and fractures, will be reported {{at the conclusion of the}} trial...|$|E

Using the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist, to describe the rationale and processes for treatment selection and delivery of the <b>PreFIT</b> exercise intervention. Based on the results of a validated falls and balance survey, participants were eligible for the exercise intervention if they were at moderate or high risk of falling. Intervention development was informed using the current evidence base, published guidelines, and pre-existing surveys of clinical practice, a pilot study and consensus work with therapists and practitioners. The exercise programme targets lower limb strength and balance, which are known, modifiable risk factors for falling. Treatment was individually tailored and progressive, with seven recommended contacts over a six-month period. Clinical Trials Registry (ISCTRN 71002650) ...|$|E

500|$|Criticism {{that the}} Hammond organ was more aesthetically {{suitable}} {{to the home}} instead of the church led {{to the introduction of}} the model C in September 1939. It contained the same internals as the AB or BC, but covered on the front and sides by [...] "modesty panels" [...] to cover female organists' legs while playing in a skirt, often a consideration when a church organ was placed in front of the congregation. The model C did not contain the chorus generator, but had space in the cabinet for it to be fitted. The concurrent model D was a model C with a <b>prefitted</b> chorus. Development of the vibrato system took place during the early 1940s, and was put into production shortly after the end of World War II. The various models available were the BV and CV (vibrato only) and BCV and DV (vibrato and chorus).|$|R

Some healthcare professionals will have considerable experience of working in falls services prevention and will be very familiar with the rationale for falls prevention, assessment procedures, definitions and recommended treatment pathways. However, not all those working from this manual will have the same level of background training and experience therefore the manual has been developed to account for differing levels of skill, training and clinical expertise. The aims of this MFFP manual are: To provide the scientific research evidence about the components within MFFP programmes and to describe the model selected for use in the Pre-FIT study; To explain the rationale for the chosen study design; To describe procedures for the assessment and treatment of trial participants who have been referred to MFFP services; To describe trial documentation and adverse event reporting procedures...|$|E

The detection of astrophysical neutrinos emitted by the same sources would imply that these astrophysical objects are charged cosmic ray accelerators and help to resolve the enigma {{of the origin of}} cosmic rays. A very large volume neutrino telescope might be able to detect these potential neutrino emitters. The apriori known direction of the neutrino source can be used to effectively suppress the $^{ 40 }K$ optical background and increase significantly the tracking efficiency through causality filters.

50|$|The {{connection}} between the defibrillator and the patient consists {{of a pair of}} electrodes, each provided with electrically conductive gel in order to ensure a good connection and to minimize electrical resistance, also called chest impedance (despite the DC discharge) which would burn the patient. Gel may be either wet (similar in consistency to surgical lubricant) or solid (similar to gummi candy). Solid-gel is more convenient, because {{there is no need to}} clean the used gel off the person's skin after defibrillation. However, the use of solid-gel presents a higher risk of burns during defibrillation, since wet-gel electrodes more evenly conduct electricity into the body. Paddle electrodes, which were the first type developed, come without gel, and must have the gel applied in a separate step. Self-adhesive electrodes come <b>prefitted</b> with gel. There is a general division of opinion over which type of electrode is superior in hospital settings; the American Heart Association favors neither, and all modern manual defibrillators used in hospitals allow for swift switching between self-adhesive pads and traditional paddles. Each type of electrode has its merits and demerits, as discussed below.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project was be to compare and contrast the selected materials used in step measurements during pre-fits of thermal protection system tiles and to compare and contrast the accuracy of measurements made using these selected materials. The reasoning for conducting this test was to obtain a clearer understanding to which of these materials may yield the highest accuracy rate of exacting measurements {{in comparison to the}} completed tile bond. These results in turn will be presented to United Space Alliance and Boeing North America for their own analysis and determination. Aerospace structures operate under extreme thermal environments. Hot external aerothermal environments in high Mach number flights lead to high structural temperatures. The differences between tile heights from one to another are very critical during these high Mach reentries. The Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System is a very delicate and highly calculated system. The thermal tiles on the ship are measured to within an accuracy of. 001 of an inch. The accuracy of these tile measurements is critical to a successful reentry of an orbiter. This is why it is necessary to find the most accurate method for measuring the height of each tile in comparison to each of the other tiles. The test results indicated that there were indeed differences in the selected materials used in step measurements during <b>prefits</b> of Thermal Protection System Tiles and that Bees' Wax yielded a higher rate of accuracy when compared to the baseline test. In addition, testing for experience level in accuracy yielded no evidence of difference to be found. Lastly the use of the Trammel tool over the Shim Pack yielded variable difference for those tests...|$|R
40|$|The uterine sound length, the {{functional}} {{length of the}} cervix including the zone of internal cervical os and the fundus transversal were determined in 795 fertile women in vivo using a measuring device, the Cavimeter. The functional cavity length was calculated by subtracting {{the functional}} length of the cervix from the uterine sound length. With growing parity, the uterine length and width increase, but with advance in age, the uterine cavity changes are not so distinct. The wide ranges found by the investigation demonstrate the individuality of the uterine cavity {{and the desire to}} measure it prior to fitting an IUD. The use of adapted IUDs according {{to the size of the}} uterine cavity leads to a remarkable reduction of side effects, partiliarly expulsion, bleeding and cramps caused mainly by dimensional incompatibility. Therefore <b>prefit</b> uterine cavity measurement can lead to better efficacy of IUDs, increased rates of acceptance and higher continuation rates...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Rigid {{contact lenses}} are {{required}} to improve visual acuity {{in all but the}} mildest of keratoconic eyes. The current literature offers the novice keratoconic rigid lens fitter a confusing collection of recommendations on how to initiate the fitting of a keratoconic cornea. The aim of our study is to offer the keratoconic contact lens fitter improved guidance on picking the first trial lens base curve. Methods: Our retrospective study gathered data from 200 previous keratoconic rigid lens fits. We used multivariate linear regression to investigate the relationship between final base curve data and <b>prefit</b> corneal topography parameters to determine which variables would have best predicted the final base curve. In addition, we also used univariate regression to investigate the recommendations proposed by previous studies using our own data for comparison purposes. Results: The best predictors (R 2 = 0. 786) on our keratoconic eyes that had been measured by a Keratron Scout were a linear combination of Steep Sim-K and Steep Normalized Curvature.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} longitudinal associations of objectively measured physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) with body composition and physical fitness at a 12 -month follow-up in healthy Swedish 4 -yr-old children. Methods: The {{data from the}} population-based MINISTOP trial were collected between 2014 and 2016, and this study included the 138 children {{who were in the}} control group. PA and SB were assessed using the wrist-worn ActiGraph (wGT 3 x-BT) accelerometer during seven 24 -h periods and, subsequently, defined as SB, light-intensity PA, moderate-intensity PA, vigorous-intensity PA (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Body composition was measured using air-displacement plethysmography and physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness, lower and upper muscular strength as well as motor fitness) by the <b>PREFIT</b> fitness battery. Linear regression and isotemporal substitution models were applied. Results: Greater VPA and MVPA at the age of 4. 5 yr were associated with higher fat-free mass index (FFMI) at 5. 5 yr (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 044, respectively). Furthermore, greater VPA and MVPA at the age of 4. 5 yr were associated with higher scores for cardiorespiratory fitness, lower body muscular strength, and motor fitness at 12 -month follow-up (P = 0. 001 to P = 0. 031). Substituting 5 min·d− 1 of SB, light-intensity PA, or moderate-intensity PA for VPA at the age of 4. 5 yr were associated with higher FFMI, and with greater upper and lower muscular strength at 12 -month follow-up (P < 0. 001 to P = 0. 046). Conclusion: Higher VPA and MVPA at the age of 4. 5 yr were significantly associated with higher FFMI and better physical fitness at 12 -month follow-up. Our results indicate that promoting high-intensity PA at young ages may have long-term beneficial effects on childhood body composition and physical fitness, in particular muscular strength...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{fitness is}} a {{powerful}} marker of health in youth. Studies in adolescents and adults suggest that higher fat mass is related to worse physical fitness. However, there is limited knowledge whether fat mass and fat-free mass are associated with physical fitness already in preschoolers. Baseline data from the MINISTOP (Mobile-based INtervention Intended to STop Obesity in Preschoolers) trial was utilized for this cross-sectional analysis. Body composition was assessed using air-displacement plethysmography. Fat mass index [fat mass (kg) /height 2 (m) ] and fat-free mass index [fat-free mass (kg) /height 2 (m) ] were used to provide height-adjusted measures of body composition. Physical fitness was measured using the <b>PREFIT</b> (FITness testing in PREschool children) battery, which assesses cardiorespiratory fitness, upper-body and lower-body muscular strength as well as motor fitness. In total, this study included 303 children (168 boys and 135 girls), who were on average 4. 48 ˘ 0. 15 years old. Higher fat mass index was associated with worse cardiorespiratory fitness (standardized β = ´ 0. 17, p = 0. 002), lower-body muscular strength (β = ´ 0. 17, p = 0. 003) and motor fitness (β = ´ 0. 21, p < 0. 001) in regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and mutually adjusted for fat-mass index and fat-free mass index. Conversely, higher fat-free mass index was associated with better cardiorespiratory fitness (β = 0. 18, p = 0. 002), upper-body muscular strength (β = 0. 39, p < 0. 001), lower-body muscular strength (β = 0. 22, p < 0. 001) and motor fitness (β = 0. 17, p = 0. 004). Thus, fat mass and fat-free mass in preschoolers appear to have joint but opposite associations with physical fitness, an important marker for current and future health...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Childhood {{obesity is}} an {{increasing}} health problem globally. Overweight and obesity may be established as early as 2 - 5 years of age, highlighting the need for evidence-based effective prevention and treatment programs early in life. In adults, mobile phone based interventions for weight management (mHealth) have demonstrated positive effects on body mass, however, their use in child populations {{has yet to be}} examined. The aim {{of this paper is to}} report the study design and methodology of the MINSTOP (Mobile-based Intervention Intended to Stop Obesity in Preschoolers) trial. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm, parallel design randomized controlled trial in 300 healthy Swedish 4 -year-olds is conducted. After baseline measures, parents are allocated to either an intervention- or control group. The 6 - month mHealth intervention consists of a web-based application (the MINSTOP app) to help parents promote healthy eating and physical activity in children. MINISTOP is based on the Social Cognitive Theory and involves the delivery of a comprehensive, personalized program of information and text messages based on existing guidelines for a healthy diet and active lifestyle in pre-school children. Parents also register physical activity and intakes of candy, soft drinks, vegetables as well as fruits of their child and receive feedback through the application. Primary outcomes include body fatness and energy intake, while secondary outcomes are time spent in sedentary, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, physical fitness and intakes of fruits and vegetables, snacks, soft drinks and candy. Food and energy intake (Tool for Energy balance in Children, TECH), body fatness (pediatric option for BodPod), physical activity (Actigraph wGT 3 x-BT) and physical fitness (the <b>PREFIT</b> battery of five fitness tests) are measured at baseline, after the intervention (six months after baseline) and at follow-up (12 months after baseline). DISCUSSION: This novel study will evaluate the effectiveness of a mHealth program for mitigating gain in body fatness among 4 -year-old children. If the intervention proves effective it has great potential to be implemented in child-health care to counteract childhood overweight and obesity. <br /...|$|E
