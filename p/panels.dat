40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy supply {{is required in}} Malaysia to meet the increasing electricity demand with rapid growing in population and economy. Photovoltaic solar <b>panel</b> is most suitable alternative way to generate electricity in Malaysia where most of its location receives large number of solar radiation throughout the year. However, fixed solar <b>panel</b> is more preferred than tracking <b>panel</b> because it is cost effective. In present work, the power output and efficiency of single-axis tracking solar <b>panel</b> is compared with fixed solar <b>panel</b> by experimentally in East Coast Malaysia. A single-axis tracking <b>panel</b> produces higher power output than fixed <b>panel</b> up to 28 W. During this time, the average efficiency of tracking <b>panel</b> was about 66. 70 % and fixed <b>panel</b> was 39. 96 %. Hence, the percentage increment on average power output using tracking <b>panel</b> reached up to 66. 92 % compare to fixed <b>panel</b> during this period. The tracking <b>panel</b> module efficiency was higher than fixed <b>panel</b> {{for the same period}} and can reach up to 28. 9 % at 6. 00 p. m. In conclusion, single-axis tracking <b>panel</b> is more efficient than fixed <b>panel</b> in premeridian and postmeridian. Thus, it produces higher power output than fixed <b>panel</b> which means it utilize the most of available solar radiation effectively and this will reduce payback period of the initial investment cost...|$|R

The 13 <b>panels</b> along with the two extra scenery <b>panels</b> bring the painting to 410 feet long according to King. The painting has, for the most part, remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996. The university sold the painting in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh, North Carolina, investors. The painting has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but the value of the sale remains unknown.
