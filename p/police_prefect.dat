25|$|Back in Iași, Codreanu {{created his}} own system of {{allegiance}} within the League, starting with Frăția de Cruce ("Brotherhood of the Cross", {{named after a}} variant of blood brotherhood which requires sermon with a cross). It gathered on May 6, 1924, in the countryside around Iaşi, starting work on {{the building of a}} student center.

These forces had gathered on Ion Câmpineanu Street, in Pasajul Român, and its commanders had stationed themselves in the police station inside the passage.

25|$|Codreanu, {{who began}} {{his career in the}} wake of World War I as an anticommunist and antisemitic {{agitator}} associated with A. C. Cuza and Constantin Pancu, was a co-founder of the National-Christian Defense League and assassin of the Iaşi <b>Police</b> <b>prefect</b> Constantin Manciu. Codreanu left Cuza to found a succession of far-right movements, rallying around him a growing segment of the country's intelligentsia and peasant population, and inciting pogroms in various parts of Greater Romania. Outlawed by successive Romanian cabinets on several occasions, his Legion assumed different names and survived in the underground, during which time Codreanu formally delegated leadership to Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul. Following Codreanu's instructions, the Legion carried out assassinations of politicians it viewed as corrupt, including Prime Minister Ion G. Duca and his former associate Mihai Stelescu. Simultaneously, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu advocated Romania's adherence to a military and political alliance with Nazi Germany.|$|E

50|$|Three periods are {{identified}} by historians:The first phase (épuration sauvage) consisted of popular convictions, summary executions, and the shaving of women's heads. Estimates by <b>police</b> <b>prefects</b> made in 1948 and 1952 were {{that as many}} as six thousand executions occurred before the liberation of France, and four thousand thereafter. The second phase, épuration légale (legal purge), began on 26 and 27 June 1944 with Charles de Gaulle's ordinances on the judgment of collaborators by the commissions d'épuration; the commissions sentenced approximately 120,000 persons. Charles Maurras, the leader of the royalist Action française, was, for example, sentenced to life imprisonment on 25 January 1945. The third phase was more lenient towards collaborators; the trials of Philippe Pétain and the writer, Louis-Ferdinand Céline are examples of actions taken during this phase.|$|R

The apprehension took place while he was operating a fruit wagon in the neighbourhood and he was described as [...] "a young grocer and expressman, with a store at 172 Mott street". Gallucci said he had no reason to kill the woman and provided an alibi. The grand jury dismissed the charges. New York City Police Department detective Joe Petrosino, {{who was in charge of}} the investigation, urged his superiors to inquire for more information in Italy. The <b>police</b> <b>prefect</b> of Naples responded that Gallucci was [...] "a dangerous criminal, belonging to the category of blackmailers" [...] who had been placed under police surveillance and charged several times with theft, blackmail, and other crimes.|$|E
2500|$|Dupin is {{from what}} was once a wealthy family, but [...] "by a variety of {{untoward}} events" [...] has been reduced to more humble circumstances, and contents himself only with the basic necessities of life. He now lives in Paris with his close friend, the anonymous narrator of the stories. The two met by accident while both were searching for [...] "the same rare and very remarkable volume" [...] in an obscure library. This scene, the two characters searching for a hidden text, serves as a metaphor for detection. They promptly move to an old manor located in Faubourg Saint-Germain. For hobbies, Dupin is [...] "fond" [...] of enigmas, conundrums, and hieroglyphics. He bears the title Chevalier, meaning that he is a knight in the Légion d'honneur.

5000|$|Law {{enforcement}} in ancient China {{was carried out}} by [...] "prefects" [...] for thousands of years since it developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period. In Jin, dozens of prefects were spread across the state, each having limited authority and employment period. They were appointed by local magistrates, who reported to higher authorities such as governors, who in turn were appointed by the emperor, and they oversaw the civil administration of their [...] "prefecture", or jurisdiction. Under each prefect were [...] "subprefects" [...] who helped collectively with law {{enforcement in}} the area.

5000|$|The Morales administration's {{critique}} of the police during these events is seen as am mark of further polarization in the country.

[...] That same year no raises were given to local <b>police.</b> The <b>prefects</b> of the regions have [...] "been {{reaching out to the}} police, both out of a true need to address citizen security issues, and as a way to curry their favor to strengthen their positions." [...] In the past the prefects always held control over local police action, but as they were (until 2005) appointed by the President, this had never been an issue before.|$|R

2500|$|Many Parisians {{collaborated with}} the Government of Marshal Pétain and with the Germans, {{assisting}} them with the city administration, the police, and other government functions. French government officials were given the choice of collaborating or losing their jobs. On September 2, 1941, all Paris magistrates were asked {{to take an oath}} of allegiance to Marshal Petain. Only one, Paul Didier, refused. Unlike the territory of Vichy France, governed by Marshal Pétain and his ministers, the document of surrender placed Paris in the occupied zone, directly under German authority, the Militärbefehlshabers in Frankreich (MBF). It stated: [...] "The government of France will immediately invite all the French authorities and administrative services in the occupied territories to conform with the regulations of the German military authorities, and to collaborate with those in a correct manner."

50|$|On {{the day of}} {{the funeral}} for Pope Zosimus, which was held at San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, partisans of Eulalius {{occupied}} the Lateran. Later that day, he proceeded thither with a crowd consisting of deacons, laity and a few priests, and was elected bishop. The new Pope and his supporters remained at the church until Sunday, 29 December, for the formal ordination customarily took place on a Sunday. Meanwhile, on the Saturday after Eulalius had been elected, a majority of the priests of the church elected Boniface, who had previously been a councilor of Pope Innocent, and was also ordained on 29 December at the Church of Saint Marcellus in the Campus Martius. The Urban Prefect Aurelius Anicius Symmachus warned both parties to keep the peace, and wrote to the Emperor Honorius that Eulalius, who had been elected first and in due order, was in the right. The Emperor answered on 3 January 419, recognizing Eulalius as the rightful Bishop of Rome. Despite these official acts, violence broke out between the two groups, and Boniface was seized by the <b>Prefect's</b> <b>police</b> and taken to a lodging outside the walls where he was detained under the surveillance of the Prefect's agents.|$|R
