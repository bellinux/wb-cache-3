5|$|For {{purposes}} of <b>Pan</b> American Games competition, the <b>Pan</b> American Sports Organization (PASO) makes {{a distinction between}} sports and disciplines. A sport, in <b>Pan</b> American Games terms, is a single or group of disciplines as represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation. For example, aquatics, represented at the Olympic level by the International Swimming Federation, is a sport at the <b>Pan</b> American Games that includes the swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and water polo disciplines.|$|E

30|$|Stereo <b>panning</b> aims to {{transform}} {{a set of}} monaural signals into a two-channel signal in a pseudostereo field [1].

In stereo <b>panning</b> the ratio at which its power is spread between {{the left and the}} right channels determines the position of the source.

Gradually the <b>pans</b> {{increased}} in size Christoph Chrysel writing in 1773 in his ‘Remarkable and very useful Information about the present Salt Works and Salt <b>pans</b> in England’ noted salt <b>pans</b> that were40 ft wide and 27 ft long and 1 ft deep. Brine would be pumped into the <b>pans,</b> and concentrated by the heat of the fire burning underneath. As crystals of salt formed these would be raked out and more brine added.|$|R

40|$|The {{perceived}} spatial {{spread of}} amplitude <b>panned</b> virtual sources {{is dependent on}} the number of loudspeakers that are used to produce them.

In this paper a method is presented to make the directional spread of amplitude <b>panned</b> virtual sources independent of their <b>panning</b> direction. This is accomplished by <b>panning</b> the sound signal to multiple directions near each other simultaneously. This forms a single virtual source with constant directional spread as a function of direction. 1...|$|R

30|$|In IEEE 802.15. 4 networks, when non-interfering logical {{channels}} {{are used in}} multiple <b>PANs</b> operating in a Personal Operating Space the inter-PAN communication is not possible because the <b>PANs</b> in the same region remain unaware of each other’s presence. This situation adversely hinders realizing the pervasive and synergistic vision of <b>PANs,</b> e.g., sharing information of common interest amongst <b>PANs</b> and accessing infrastructure networks hopping through multiple <b>PANs.</b> In this paper, we have presented a novel mechanism to allow communication between multiple <b>PANs</b> in the same POS that are using different logical channels. We have proposed a framework that enables neighboring <b>PANs</b> {{to communicate with each}} other by diffusing into each other through “bordering nodes”. The simulation results show improvement in delivery ratio when number of border nodes is increased, and also hinting at the likely detrimental effects when the borders nodes are indefinitely increased.|$|R
