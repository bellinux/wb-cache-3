The case study presented demonstrated that the forecasting process, including the recognised activities, information input and outputs, and roles and responsibilities of all the involved parties, is of great importance in a small- to medium-sized enterprise (SME) in order to become {{able to take advantage of}} any selected forecasting methods for the determination of the future demand...|$|R
