5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the <b>prevailing</b> <b>opinion</b> accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Infuriated by {{what was}} {{perceived}} as yet another affront to British prestige after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, members of the British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait in spite of the Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the <b>prevailing</b> <b>opinion</b> was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss of rights to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Ethel & Millie then {{abandoned}} their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the Nelson survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of the Ethel & Millie were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. <b>Prevailing</b> <b>opinion</b> {{at the time was}} that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, but these scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.|$|E

25|$|Academic tenure's {{original}} {{purpose was to}} guarantee the right to academic freedom: it protects teachers and researchers when they dissent from <b>prevailing</b> <b>opinion,</b> openly disagree with authorities of any sort, or spend time on unfashionable topics.

The intent of tenure is to allow original ideas to be more likely to arise, by giving scholars the intellectual autonomy to investigate the problems and solutions as they see fit and to report their honest conclusions. However, it has also become a type of job security for professors.|$|E

This recovery was controversial at the time, less so after the successful restoration.

25|$|The Marshall Plan aid {{was divided}} among the {{participant}} states on a roughly per capita basis.

The table below shows Marshall Plan aid by country and year (in millions of dollars) from The Marshall Plan Fifty Years Later.

25|$|Kristen R. Ghodsee (born April 26, 1970) is an American ethnographer and a Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at Bowdoin College, known {{primarily}} for her ethnographic work on post-communist Bulgaria {{as well as}} being a contributor to the field of postsocialist gender studies. Contrary to the <b>prevailing</b> <b>opinion</b> of most feminist scholars in the 1990s who believed that women would be disproportionately harmed by the collapse of communism, Ghodsee argued that many East European women would actually fare better than men in newly competitive labor markets because of the cultural capital that they had acquired before 1989. She was critical of the role of Western feminist nongovernmental organizations doing work among East European women in the 1990s. She examined the shifting gender relations of Muslim minorities after communism, and the intersections of Islamic beliefs and practices with the ideological remains of Marxism-Leninism.|$|E
25|$|At that time, geologists {{believed}} that rocks of Early Cretaceous age {{had the greatest}} potential to contain oil and natural gas, and the Leduc area {{appeared to be a}} good location from which to reach those rocks. Earlier discoveries in Texas and at Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories had shown that oil could also be found in Devonian-age reefs, but the <b>prevailing</b> <b>opinion</b> was that Alberta had been a desert at that time so such reefs were unlikely to be present. It was later shown that much of Alberta was actually a marine basin fringed by reefs and lagoons during Late Devonian time and was therefore very likely to host porous, hydrocarbon-containing reefs like those at Norman Wells. The understanding of the Norman Wells field, which Imperial had located in the 1920s, helped provide the geological key to unlock Leduc, and twenty years after the initial discovery at Leduc No. 1, dozens of oil-bearing Devonian reefs had been discovered throughout western Canada.|$|E
25|$|Andronikos' final {{choice as}} Wallachian Prince, Michael the Brave, was also his most enduring, {{allowing}} Wallachia to rebel against Ottoman suzerainty. The uprising ended up absorbing Kantakouzenos, who escaped an Ottoman death sentence {{and settled in}} Wallachia with his wife, Irene Rhali. He went on to serve Michael as Ban, Vistier, and Postelnic. At {{the climax of the}} Long Turkish War, Kantakouzenos oversaw the diplomatic actions which formalized Wallachia's alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and the Holy League. During Michael's conquest of Transylvania, he remained behind in Bucharest to assist the heir apparent, Nicolae Pătrașcu. A <b>prevailing</b> <b>opinion</b> among historians also identifies Andronikos as one of four regents of Moldavia, following that country's annexation by Michael, in mid 1600. Later that year, as Michael's Holy League alliance began to unravel, Andronikos proposed a separate peace with the Ottoman Empire. He was sent to Giurgiu to negotiate it, but was kidnapped by the Ottomans and disappeared from records. He was killed at the latest in November 1601, presumably decapitated in Moldavia.|$|E
