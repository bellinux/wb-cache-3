50|$|Meningococcemia, {{like many}} other gram-negative blood infections, can cause disseminated {{intravascular}} coagulation (DIC), which is the inappropriate clotting of blood within the vessels. DIC can cause ischemic tissue damage when upstream thrombi obstruct blood flow and haemorrhage because clotting factors are exhausted. Small bleeds into the skin cause the characteristic <b>petechial</b> <b>rash,</b> which appears with a star-like shape. This {{is due to the}} release of toxins into the blood that break down the walls of blood vessels. A rash can develop under the skin due to blood leakage that may leave red or brownish pinprick spots, which can develop into purple bruising. Meningococcal rash can usually be confirmed by a glass test in which the rash does not fade away under pressure.|$|E

40|$|Meningitis is {{the main}} {{infectious}} central nervous system (CNS) syndrome. Viruses or bacteria can cause acute meningitis of infectious etiology. The term “Aseptic Meningitis ” denotes a clinical syndrome with a predominance of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with no common bacterial agents identified in the CSF. Viral meningitis is considered {{the main cause of}} lymphocyte meningitis. There are other etiologies of an infectious nature. CSF examination is essential to establish the diagnosis and to identify the etiological agent of lymphocytic meningitis. We examined CSF characteristics and the differential diagnosis of the main types of meningitis. Key-Words: Cerebrospinal fluid, lymphocytic meningitis, viral meningitis, meningitis. Central Nervous System (CNS) infections classically are classified as meningitis and encephalitis [1]. Meningitis is the most common infectious CNS syndrome, defined as an inflammation of the meninges. The clinical symptoms are fever, malaise, vomiting, and in some cases, <b>petechial</b> <b>rashes.</b> Signs of meningeal irritation include neck stiffness, Kernig’s sign, (an inflection of the knee when the limb is placed at a certain degree of relative inflection to th...|$|R
40|$|Abiotrophia defectiva was {{previously}} {{known as a}} member of the nutritionally variant streptococcus (NVS). This microorganism is a member of the normal flora of mouth, urogenital and intestinal tracts. It causes various infections such as bacteriemia, brain abscess, septic arthritis and rarely infective endocarditis. Only < 1 % of all cases of endocarditis are caused by A. defectiva. A 23 year old previously healthy female was admitted to emergency department for left hemiplegia. On physical examination, <b>petechial</b> <b>rashes</b> were detected on her palmar and plantar regions. Magnetic resonance image of brain revealed acute enfarctus in the striatocapsuler area, and total occlusion was detected in right median common arterial segment M 1 with magnetic resonance imaging angiography. Urgent thrombectomy was performed. Echocardiography demonstrated a mobile vegetation on mitral valve leaflet. Infective endocarditis was diagnosed and ceftriaxone at 2 gr/day and vancomycin at 2 gr/day doses were started. A. defectiva was isolated in blood cultures. Antibiotics were changed to ampicillin/sulbactam at 8 gr/day and vancomycin at 2 gr /day doses. Infective endocarditis caused by A. defectiva and other nutritionally variant streptococci are reported to have a higher mortality, morbidity and complication rates.

50|$|Symptoms of a {{vertically}} transmitted infection {{may include}} fever and flu like symptoms. The newborn is often small for gestational age. A <b>petechial</b> <b>rash</b> {{on the skin}} may be present, with small reddish or purplish spots due to bleeding from capillaries under the skin. An enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) is common, as is jaundice. However, jaundice is less common in hepatitis B because a newborn's immune system is not developed well enough to mount a response against liver cells, as would normally {{be the cause of}} jaundice in an older child or adult. Hearing impairment, eye problems, mental retardation, autism, and death can be caused by vertically transmitted infections. The mother often has a mild infection with few or no symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Meningitis {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Neisseria meningitidis (known as [...] "meningococcal meningitis") can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading <b>petechial</b> <b>rash,</b> which may precede other symptoms. The rash consists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots ("petechiae") on the trunk, lower extremities, mucous membranes, conjuctiva, and (occasionally) the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The rash is typically non-blanching; the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler. Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis, it is relatively specific for the disease; it does, however, occasionally occur in meningitis due to other bacteria. Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of hand, {{foot and mouth disease}} and genital herpes, both of which are associated with various forms of viral meningitis.|$|E
50|$|Cameron {{thinks it}} could be a severe vitamin D deficiency, since the patient has a {{restrictive}} diet and works long hours indoors. This would explain all the patient's symptoms. Chase decides to take Hank to the phototherapy suite, blast him with ultra-violet light and give him IV vitamins as well as do the brain angio. During the UV light session, the patient gets a nosebleed and petechial hemorrhages - bleeds in his leg. This new symptom rules out both Cameron and Foreman's diagnoses. The patient's blood won't clot. Foreman notes that the UV rays made his capillaries more fragile, which sped up the onset of DIC. Cameron thinks a widespread <b>petechial</b> <b>rash</b> and nervous system involvement indicates a blood infection. She suggests meningococcemia. The team starts him on heparin for the DIC and broad-spectrum antibiotics for the infection. However, the patient soon gets a fever, meaning the antibiotics aren't working.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} petechial spots in well babies. Methods: A total of 116 babies {{under the age of}} 12 months were fully examined at child health sur-veillance clinics. The number and site of petechiae were recorded together with details of possible causes. Results: A total of 27. 6 % of babies had one or more petechiae, 8. 6 % had two or more petechiae, and 2. 6 % had more than two. None of these babies subsequently developed sepsis. Conclusions: Many well infants examined in the community are likely to have petechial spots. In this setting one or two petechiae are common and their presence should not be taken as pathological with-out other clinical signs. Recognition of this fact may also be helpful when examining otherwise well infants with petechiae in a secondary care setting. Many children assessed in accident & emergency andday assessment units have a few petechial spots; onlya minority have invasive bacterial disease. 1 – 5 Currently there is no consensus among paediatricians for the evaluation and treatment of febrile children with <b>petechial</b> <b>rashes.</b> 6 A recent approach has been that further investigation and man-agement should be based on whether or not the child is wel...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is {{an immune}} {{thrombocytopenia}} with a usually benign clinical course. Bleedings are mostly of the mucocutaneous type with mild symptoms. Massive bleedings requiring transfusion are rarely seen, unless {{the number of}} platelets decreases to extremely low levels. In this case, bilateral perirenal hematoma and bilateral distal ureteral stones were detected on a non-contrast com-puted tomography scan of a 57 -year-old male patient who developed macroscopic hema-turia during his treatment in the clinics of internal medicine because of left flank pain and diffuse <b>petechial</b> <b>rashes</b> all over his body. The patient, who had been receiving chronic ITP treatment for 1 year, had a very low platelet count (4, 000 /mm 3). The patient was prescribed bed rest, and his platelet count increased to a safe level for surgical inter-vention of above 50, 000 /mm 3 with administration of prednisolone, intravenous im-mune globulin, and platelet suspension. A stone-free state was achieved after bilateral ureterorenoscopy and pneumatic lithotripsy. A conservative approach was followed for the perirenal hematoma. Upon regression of the perirenal hematoma, the patient was discharged at 9 weeks postoperatively.

50|$|The rash first appears two to {{five days}} after the onset of fever, and it is often quite subtle. Younger {{patients}} usually develop the rash earlier than older patients. Most often the rash begins as small, flat, pink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles. These spots turn pale when pressure is applied and eventually become raised on the skin. The characteristic red, spotted (<b>petechial)</b> <b>rash</b> of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is usually not seen until the sixth day or later after onset of symptoms, but this type of rash occurs in only 35 to 60% of patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The rash involves the palms or soles in as many as 80% of the patients. However, this distribution may not occur until later on {{in the course of the}} disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Children with <b>petechial</b> <b>rash</b> {{are more}} likely to undergo {{invasive}} diagnostics, to be treated with antibiotics for potential bacterial infection and to be hospitalized. However, viruses have also been associated with <b>petechial</b> <b>rash.</b> Nonetheless, a systematic analysis of viral infections with modern available techniques as quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) in the context of <b>petechial</b> <b>rash</b> is lacking. The purpose of this pediatric study was to prospectively uncover viral pathogens that may promote the emergence of petechiae and to analyze the correlation with the clinical characteristics and course. METHODS:: We conducted a prospective study in children (0 to 18 years) presenting with petechiae and signs or symptoms of infection at the emergency department between November 2009 and March 2012. In nasopharyngeal aspirates the following viruses were analyzed by q-PCR: Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B 19, Influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, human coronavirus OC 43, 229 E, NL 63 and human bocavirus. RESULTS:: A viral pathogen was identified in 67 % of the analyzed 58 cases with <b>petechial</b> <b>rash.</b> Virus positive patients showed a significantly higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infections. Forty-one percent were viral co-infections, which were significantly younger than virus negative patients, had a higher leukocyte count and were hospitalized for a longer time.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{present a}} case of {{cerebral}} fat embolism (CFE) that demonstrated evidence of diffuse white matter cytotoxic edema on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, in addition to punctate hyperintensities on T 2 -weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. The case suggests that CFE represents a combination of occlusive arteriolar disease and secondary neurotoxicity. Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a clinical constellation thatincludes respiratory disability, <b>petechial</b> skin <b>rash,</b> and neurologic symptoms. It usually occurs after traumatic lower-limb long-bone fractures but may occur after rib or short-bone fractures. Cerebral fat embolism (CFE) results in vari-able neurologic disability, often with significant recovery.
