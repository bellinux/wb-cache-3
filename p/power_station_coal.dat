5000|$|In 2014, New Age Exploration Limited {{proposed}} a new coal {{mine in the}} Canonbie area. They estimated that the new mine could operate for 26 years and yield 1.4 million tonnes of coal per annum. The emphasis was upon Coking coal as opposed to <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>coal</b> {{which would be a}} prime market in the UK and EU.|$|E
5000|$|The planned {{closure of}} the {{northern}} end of the Severn Valley Line including Buildwas station pre-dated the Beeching report. Following closure, the station was demolished to make way for Ironbridge B <b>Power</b> <b>Station.</b> <b>Coal</b> for the power station was offloaded close {{to the site of the}} original station until the power station stopped generating electricity in November 2015.|$|E

5000|$|In 2014, {{plans were}} {{announced}} to mine the coal {{under the sea}} near to Haig Colliery again. West Cumbria Mining have proposed plans to start mining for the coal which {{will be used to}} provide coking coal. Chief engineer on the project, Mark Kirkbride, said that most coal projects in Britain involve low-thermal <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>coal,</b> whereas [...] of coking coal is imported into Europe from North America, Russia and Australasia every year.|$|E
50|$|Again {{built at}} the London plant in 1994 and 1995, the six Class 59/2 {{locomotives}} differ from the Class 59/1s in several ways. A carbon dioxide fire control system replaces the original Halon system, and the fleet were originally fitted with drop-head knuckle couplers but were later replaced with standard screw couplings. A more advanced slow speed control suitable for merry-go-round <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>coal</b> train operation has been fitted, as well as yaw dampers for a higher top speed.|$|E

5000|$|Otherwise {{light engine}} {{movements}} {{to and from}} Shirebrook Diesel Depot became the sole regular through traffic, supplemented by occasional freights and <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>coal</b> diversions. This continued until the 1990s when an underground fire threatened to undermine the line, compounded by the expensive need to replace the points at Creswell Junction. These points were replaced by plain line, as were those at Oxcroft Colliery Junction. Superb images of the area are available on line but note that, as the aerial view on the site shows, [...] "Oxcroft Colliery No 3" [...] signalbox was near Barlborough Colliery, not Oxcroft Colliery.|$|E
5000|$|Changes {{in demand}} also {{influenced}} {{the flow of}} coal. By the 1960s household coal was in decline and <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>coal</b> was on the rise. In 1959, for example, High Marnham Power Station opened and immediately created a new demand in a new location. This was followed in the 1960s by larger new power stations in the Trent Valley whose demand for coal necessitated new technology, which was provided in notable forms such as [...] "TOPS" [...] and computer timetabled Merry-go-round trains (mgr). West Burton Power Station's power signalbox was opened in 1965, in preparation for stockpiling coal on a wholly different scale from traditional working.|$|E
50|$|The mine {{produces}} 18.8 Mt {{of final}} coal products annually.As of 2008, Exxaro was supplying Eskom's coal-fired Matimba Power Station.Exxaro delivered 14.8 Mt annually of <b>power</b> <b>station</b> <b>coal</b> to the Matimba power station via a 7 km conveyor belt.Grootegeluk produces 1.5 Mt of metallurgical coal {{for sale to}} metals industries and other users in South Africa annually. Exxaro exports or sells to domestic customers about 1Mt of thermal and semi-soft coking coal.The mine produces 2.5 Mt of semi-soft coking coal annually, delivering most of it to Mittal SA by rail.In the late 2000s the rail link to the Grootegeluk mine was being upgraded.Exxaro expects to expand exports of high-quality coal through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal.|$|E
5000|$|The Swanbank <b>Power</b> <b>Stations</b> {{are located}} in Swanbank within South East Queensland, Australia. The {{original}} <b>power</b> <b>station</b> was <b>coal</b> fired, but the site has since moved to gas. By 2007 the site had consisted of the highly efficient [...] gas-fired Swanbank E <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> and the smaller [...] gas-fired Swanbank C <b>Power</b> <b>Station.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another major {{industry}} was {{the production of}} electric power, with three coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> burning <b>coal</b> mined at Leigh Creek, {{the first of which}} was completed in 1954. As of 2016 all three stations are now defunct and are currently being decommissioned.|$|R

50|$|Some {{sections}} of the Thames river wall date from the early 19th century. Remnants of watermen's stairs {{can be seen at}} Bell Water Gate and behind the Waterfront Leisure Centre at the end of Nile Street (formerly Hog Lane). The Bell Water Gate river stairs were altered in 1824 and have remained largely unchanged since. The Hog Lane or Green Dragon Stairs were reconstructed in concrete in the 1970s but the old paved causeway can still be seen at low tide. The coaling jetty of 1930-31 is all that remains of Woolwich Power Station. The Woolwich Ferry terminal as it exists today largely dates from the 1960s. From the roundabout and the adjacent car park a four-lane concrete causeway curves towards the loading ramp. The most prominent element is a 21 m wide and 29 m tall (above low tide) lifting tower of white polycarbonate. The ferry administration and maintenance building, as well as the ambulance station, are low-rise utilitarian structures with a touch of Brutalism. Originally the roof of the workshop block was accessible to the public as a viewing platform. The south entrance building of the Woolwich Foot Tunnel was built at the north-west side of Nile Street in 1910-12. It is now hidden behind the Waterfront Leisure Centre. The round building of red brick with its leaded dome is the oldest surviving building in this area. The Waterfront Leisure Centre stands at the original sites of the Woolwich Ferry terminal and Woolwich Power Station. It was built in 1986-88 as a replacement for the Public Baths in Bathway. The original design consisted of two separate units on both sides of Nile Street. It included a large indoor swimming pool, sports facilities, a supermarket, a garden centre, a petrol station and flats surrounded by public spaces. These ambitious plans were scaled down after construction had started, which resulted in the current hybrid building of red and yellow brick and mirrored-glass façades with blue detailing. A riverside walk was laid out around the same time. It now forms part of the Thames Path. East of the leisure centre a large car park occupies the site of the former Woolwich <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> <b>coal</b> yard. This and the land further east is earmarked for redevelopment. Closer to the Royal Arsenal the first Waterfront residential tower blocks have topped out at around 70 m.|$|E

50|$|Prairie State Energy Campus is a 1,600 {{megawatt}} base load, coal-fired, electrical <b>power</b> <b>station</b> and <b>coal</b> mine near Marissa, Illinois {{southeast of}} St. Louis, Missouri. Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC) features {{low levels of}} regulated emissions compared to other coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> capturing sulfur from high-sulfur coal mined nearby instead of transporting low-sulfur coal from elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The Gladstone <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> is Queensland's largest <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> {{with six}} <b>coal</b> <b>powered</b> steam {{turbines}} generating {{a maximum of}} 1,680 MW of electricity. <b>Power</b> from the <b>station</b> was first generated in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Timber {{from the}} {{surrounding}} hills was harvested to supply the early Melbourne <b>power</b> <b>station</b> until <b>coal</b> from the Latrobe Valley became the favoured fuel source. That together with dwindling patronage of the rail line to Benalla led to {{the closing of the}} rail line after World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} {{imposed a}} six-day work week while the mass media, public services, healthcare services, <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> <b>coal</b> mines, sea ports, railway stations, and most key factories were placed under military management, with employees having to follow military orders or face a court martial. As {{part of the}} crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent [...] "verification", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions. Military courts were established to bypass the normal court system, to imprison those spreading [...] "false information". In an attempt to crush resistance, civilian phone lines were routinely tapped and monitored by government agents.|$|R
25|$|Most {{electricity}} {{is generated by}} thermal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> or steam plants, the majority of which are fossil fuel <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> that burn <b>coal,</b> natural gas, fuel oil or bio-fuels, such as wood waste and black liquor from chemical pulping.|$|R

5000|$|... "We {{were even}} short of goods brake vans. When {{we wanted to}} run a trip out to Moredon <b>power</b> <b>station</b> with <b>coal</b> we had a special brake van kept for the job—it was an old water tank. When I stood inside it acting as guard my head just poked out of the filler hole nicely, shorter chaps stood on a box inside." ...|$|R
50|$|The chief {{recommendation}} {{is probably the}} enhancement of the loading gauge from Southampton and the East Anglia coast ports to West Coast Main Line (WCML), as most growth is expected in the carriage of deep-sea containers and coal for the electricity-generating industry, mainly for Trent valley and Aire valley <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> Much <b>coal</b> is imported via the east coast ports.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{electric}} power industry now relies on large, central <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> including <b>coal,</b> natural gas, nuclear, and hydropower plants that together generate more than 95% of the nation’s electricity. Over {{the next few}} decades uses of renewable energy could help to diversify the nation’s bulk power supply. Already, appropriate renewable resources (which excludes large hydropower) produce 12% of northern California’s electricity.|$|R
