5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities.

They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{was without}} injured trio Robert Pirès, Freddie Ljungberg and Giovanni van Bronckhorst and {{lined up in}} their {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation; striker Sylvain Wiltord was accommodated to the left wing, with Bergkamp playing off main striker Thierry Henry. After a lengthy illness, Liverpool defender Markus Babbel returned to the squad and was named as a substitute. Houllier deployed a 4–3–1–2 formation with Steven Gerrard, John Arne Riise and Dietmar Hamann as a midfield three and new signing, El Hadji Diouf <b>positioned</b> <b>in</b> a free role to begin with and as the game went on, moved to the right wing to stretch Arsenal's defence.|$|E
5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted {{fore and aft}} on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns <b>positioned</b> <b>in</b> the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, {{one on each side}} aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E

5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out across England in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and artillery {{played an important role}} in the conflict, and most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to control access to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, Camber Castle then being decommissioned to prevent it being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been <b>positioned</b> <b>in</b> the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be <b>positioned</b> <b>in</b> front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Early on 1 September 1939, Germany {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Poland. Schleswig-Holstein had been <b>positioned</b> <b>in</b> the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte {{under the guise of}} a ceremonial visit in August. At 04:47 on 1 September, Schleswig-Holstein opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the signal for ground troops to begin their assault on the installation; though the first German ground attack in the Battle of Westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that morning, again supported by Schleswig-Holstein, though it too had failed to break into the installation by around noon.|$|E
