500|$|Frost {{considered}} {{the new design}} as an interim aircraft between the CF-100 and the more advanced C-104 project. The salient changes to the basic wing planform were in decreasing its chord and thickness, and adding a 42° sweep to the leading edge, creating a near-delta wing configuration. The tail surfaces were also swept back. [...] One version that was considered featured two streamlined fuel tanks blended into {{the leading edge of}} the wings near the three/quarter position. [...] Despite the use of more powerful engines, the redesign had very modest performance specifications, with a planned maximum diving speed of Mach 0.95, scarcely better than the <b>placarded</b> Mach 0.85 speed limit of the production CF-100 Mk 2 and Mk 3. Avro executives, recognizing that the company had already suffered due to the protracted development of the CF-100, determined that Frost's revised design would provide a [...] "hedge" [...] against the CF-100's failure to secure long-term contracts.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{his father}} Charles V, Philip {{was very much}} opposed to the Protestant teachings of Martin Luther, John Calvin and the Anabaptists, which had gained many adherents in the Netherlands by the early 1560s. To {{suppress}} Protestantism he had promulgated extraordinary ordinances, called <b>placards,</b> that outlawed them and made them capital offenses. Because of their severity these <b>placards</b> caused growing opposition among the population, both Catholic and Protestant. Opposition, even among Catholics, was generated because the <b>placards</b> were seen as breaches of the constitutional privileges of the local authorities and the civil liberties of the people, like the Jus de non evocando, as enshrined in the [...] "Joyous Entry", {{the constitution of the}} Duchy of Brabant, to mention a prominent example. For that reason local authorities regularly protested against the <b>placards</b> and the way they were implemented in 1564 and later years. That these protests were systematically ignored and the <b>placards</b> stringently enforced only helped intensify the opposition.|$|R

Later, these <b>placards</b> were protested by the far-right MHP. The leader of MHP described the <b>placards</b> saying [...] "We are all Armenian" [...] as [...] "a freak show organized by {{those who do not}} participate in martyr funerals". On the other hand, a party council member of the main-opposition CHP, a member of Socialist International, said [...] "We became ashamed of being Turkish. I am Turkish and I protest the assassination. Maybe we should have carried the <b>placards</b> saying 'We are all Human' instead of 'We are all Armenians'. The <b>placards</b> that say [...] "assassin 301" [...] are also wrong. As long as {{we do not want to}} denigrate Turkishness, we cannot call 301 an assassin." ...|$|R
