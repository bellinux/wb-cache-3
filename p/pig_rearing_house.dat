40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the growth of cold-blooded stallions in <b>pig</b> breeding test <b>rearing</b> <b>houses.</b> The Czech Republic has set up three <b>pig</b> breeding test <b>rearing</b> <b>houses.</b> A total of 96 stallions were measured with 14 body measurements and they were also weighed whilst alive. Statistically significant differences were detected between breeds as well as between age groups when evaluating the intensity of growth of all measured body size and body weight. In most body sizes there were the biggest Silesian Norics horses (SN). At the age of {{two and a half years}} they stagnated growth in chest circumference, the circumference of the tibia and sternum height, even though it is stated in the Rules and Regulation of breeding book that SN mature between 5 - 6 years of age. During the evaluation there were no statistically significant differences between <b>rearing</b> <b>houses.</b> Stallions from the <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> of Proseč prevailed in growth usually at the beginning of rearing, and later stallions from the <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> of Dvorka at the age of one and a half year grew most. Stallions in the <b>rearing</b> <b>house</b> of Humňany had the lowest WHS, WHT and CC. The smallest variances of individual body size from the three studied cold-blooded breeds were detected by the CzechMoravian Belgian horse (CMB). This breed can therefore be regarded as the most well bred. The greatest value of the index body frame, the index heights in the crisis as well as index of severity were found in the breed SN. On the other hand CMB reached the lowest values in the above-mentioned indices and also in the index of boniness. Norick horses (N) have the most massive skeleton. In the scope of the height index of the sternum there was prevailed CMB at the beginning of rearing, but at the age of year and a half they began reaching a higher value N.

Enriched-reared pigs had higher salivary cortisol concentrations in the home pen before and after transport than barren housed pigs, {{but at the end}} of the lairage period salivary cortisol concentrations did not differ between enriched- and barren-housed <b>pigs.</b> In <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment, salivary cortisol concentrations increased significantly after transport and being in lairage, as compared to home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in an enriched environment, salivary cortisol concentrations did not significantly change after any stage of preslaughter handling and transport as compared with home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In the truck, <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment tended to spend more time walking, standing and manipulating other pigs than enriched-reared <b>pigs.</b> Moreover, <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment tended to spend more time walking and fighting in lairage than enriched-reared pigs. Results showed that rearing conditions may affect the behavioural and physiological responses of pigs to preslaughter handling and mixing at transport. The tendency for increased manipulation of pen mates and fighting, and the significant increases in salivary cortisol in response to mixing at transport and being in lairage in <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment indicate that <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in a barren environment are likely to experience more stress during common preslaughter procedures than <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> in an enriched environment...|$|R
40|$|Nematodes of {{the genus}} Trichinella are parasites of mammals, birds and reptiles. Twelve taxa are {{recognised}} in this genus. Humans may develop trichinellosis through consumption of undercooked meat from Trichinella-infected wildlife and domestic animals. The severity of the disease depends on the dose and species ingested. Meat originating from wild boar and pigs that were kept under non-controlled housing {{is the most important}} source for trichinellosis outbreaks in humans in Europe. The overall aim of this thesis was to study prevalence of Trichinella spp. in wildlife host species in the Netherlands, and to assess the risks for humans by using a quantitative microbial risk analysis (QMRA) approach. A QMRA approach allows quantification of hazards in the meat production chain, including attribution of factors as carcass control, pig husbandry system, types of meat and meat products to support risk-based methods for Trichinella control. We studied three wildlife host species that {{play a role in the}} sylvatic lifecycle of Trichinella. We show that the Trichinella prevalence in Dutch red fox (0. 27 %) decreased significantly in the study area, compared to fifteen years ago (3. 9 %, p = 0. 0006). In contrast, other helminth fauna in Dutch foxes increased in biodiversity over the last three decades. Trichinella seroprevalence in Dutch wild boar during the period 2007 – 2015 (0. 16 %) was shown to be significantly lower than in 2004 - 2005 (0. 61 %, p = 0. 0311), using a validated in-house ELISA. However, we were not able to demonstrate Trichinella in wild rats using artificial digestion. Using molecular techniques, we demonstrate hybridisation between T. spiralis and T. britovi from wild boar and red fox in a highly endemic area in Europe (Poland), where both Trichinella species co-exist. In view of proven absence of Trichinella from slaughter <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> under controlled <b>housing</b> during the last decades, and the large sums that are spent on individual carcass control, a risk-based control approach has been approved for Trichinella control in Europe, but the scientific background is lacking. We developed a QMRA model for Trichinella, which quantifies distribution of Trichinella ML in and among swine, test sensitivity at carcass control, partitioning of edible pork parts, Trichinella ML distribution in edible muscle types, heat inactivation by cooking and portion size. This model was combined with a dose response model for Trichinella species that was previously developed in our lab, to estimate the incidence of human illness after consumption of infected meat. The QMRA model was validated with Polish data and we estimated an average incidence of 1. 56 trichinellosis cases per million persons per year (Mpy) from consumption of <b>pigs</b> that were <b>reared</b> under non-controlled <b>housing,</b> and 1. 97 cases per Mpy from consumption of wild boar. The total estimated incidence is similar to the observed incidence of human trichinellosis (1. 15 Mpy) in Poland. Overall, in the European Union, we estimated less than one predicted case of trichinellosis every 39. 4 years from pork produced under controlled housing. Therefore, Trichinella testing of <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> under controlled <b>housing</b> is not adding any value to protect human health...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine behaviors related to mosquito-borne diseases in different ethnic minority groups and different socioeconomic groups of people living in this region. Methods: A stratified two-stage cluster sampling technique with probability proportional to size was used in Mengla County, Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan. Twelve villages were used to recruit adult (≥ 18 years old) and eight schools were used for children (< 18 years old). A questionnaire on behaviors and environment variables related to mosquito-borne diseases was devised. Results: Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) grouped 20 behaviors into three domains, namely, environmental condition, bed net use behaviors, and repellent use behaviors, respectively. The Han ethnicity had the lowest odds of <b>rearing</b> <b>pigs,</b> their odds being significantly lower than those of Yi and Yao. For bed net use, Dai and other ethnic minority groups were less likely to use bed nets compared to Yi and Yao. The odds of repellent use in the Han ethnicity was lower than in Yi, but higher than in Dai. The Dai group was the most likely ethnicity to use repellents. Farmers were at a higher risk for <b>pig</b> <b>rearing</b> and not using repellents.

40|$|Outdoor <b>pig</b> <b>rearing</b> was reintroduced in Italy, as in {{the rest}} of Europe as a {{consequence}} of a European policy aimed to pay attention to animal welfare and food quality. Despite these advantages, outdoor <b>pigs</b> <b>rearing</b> may lead to serious damage of both vegetation and soil because of animals eating habits and behavior. In a forest ecosystem the effects of pig impact could be really negative, reducing the natural ability of soil to recover itself and causing the loss of organic matter. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of outdoor <b>pig</b> <b>rearing</b> in forest ecosystems in Mediterranean areas on soil, in order to identify the critical thresholds for soil organic matter quality and functionality in terms of: animal pressure (animal density); grazing livestock area (slope, depth and soil characteristics).

In each farm three different situations of animal pressure (high, low animal pressure and undisturbed), combining to territorial and morphologic characteristics used for <b>pig</b> <b>rearing</b> (high, low slope and flat soil), were identified. For each experimental situation, chemical and chemical-structural parameters of soil were investigated. Grazing at high animal pressure showed a reduction of all parameters related to organic matter content, in addition to a worsening of chemical-structural characteristics, thus resulting in a loss of soil quality. Grazing at low animal pressure generally seemed not to affect chemical fertility of soil, preserving organic matter content, even though a significant worsening of chemical-structural characteristics was identified.

40|$|AbstractConsumption of raw or inadequately cooked {{pork meat}} {{may result in}} trichinellosis, a human disease due to {{nematodes}} of the genus Trichinella. In many countries worldwide, individual control of pig carcasses at meat inspection is mandatory but incurs high costs in relation to absence of positive carcasses from <b>pigs</b> <b>reared</b> under controlled <b>housing.</b> EU regulation 2015 / 1375 implements an alternative risk-based approach, in view of absence of positive findings in pigs under controlled housing conditions. Moreover, Codex Alimentarius guidelines for the control of Trichinella spp. in meat of suidae have been published (CAC, 2015) and {{used in conjunction with}} the OIE terrestrial Animal health code, to provide guidance to governments and industry on risk based control measures to prevent human exposure to Trichinella spp. and to facilitate international pork trade. To further support such a risk-based approach, we model the risk of human trichinellosis due to consumption of meat from infected pigs, raised under non-controlled housing and wild boar, using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) methods. Our model quantifies the distribution of Trichinella muscle larve (ML) in swine, test sensitivity at carcass control, partitioning of edible pork parts, Trichinella ML distribution in edible muscle types, heat inactivation by cooking and portion sizes. The resulting exposure estimate is combined with a dose response model for Trichinella species to estimate the incidence of human illness after consumption of infected meat. Paramater estimation is based on experimental and observational datasets. In Poland, which served as example, we estimated an average incidence of 0. 90 (95 %CI: 0. 00 – 3. 68) trichinellosis cases per million persons per year (Mpy) due to consumption of pork from <b>pigs</b> that were <b>reared</b> under non-controlled <b>housing,</b> and 1. 97 (95 %CI: 0. 82 – 4. 00) cases per Mpy due to consumption of wild boar. The total estimated incidence of human trichinellosis attributed to pigs from non-controlled housing and wild boar in Poland, is similar to the incidence of human trichinellosis in that country reported by EFSA. Overall, in Europe, we estimated an upper incidence limit of 5. 3 × 10 − 4 cases per Mpy, or less than one predicted case of trichinellosis in the European Union every 4 years, due to consumption of pork from controlled housing. Therefore, Trichinella testing of pigs under controlled housing is not adding any value to protect human health.

When considered as independent factors influencing feed costs to grow a pig to a market weight of 30 kg, variation in ADG, opportunity cost of feed, and weaning season resulted in feed cost differences of up to 982, 947, and 379 Kenyan shillings (KES), respectively. The variation in revenues attributable to butcher or butcher negotiation and seasonal variance of butcher prices for a 30 kg pig was 744 and 225 KES, respectively.
