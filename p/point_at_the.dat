5|$|In late March, Sherman briefly {{left his}} forces and {{traveled}} to City Point, Virginia {{to consult with}} Grant. Lincoln happened to be at City <b>Point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time, allowing the only three-way meetings of Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman during the war.|$|E
5|$|A major talking <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{conference was}} the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford {{shortly before the}} conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E

5|$|California {{was quickly}} granted {{statehood}} in 1850 and the U.S. military built Fort <b>Point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island {{to secure the}} San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further drove rapid population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals, prostitution, and gambling.|$|E
5|$|Ellen Biddle Shipman {{designed}} the Italian Garden in May 1931. It features {{two rows of}} clipped evergreens between two long, rectangular reflecting pools. It has a focal <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the garden {{in the form of}} a marble fountain surrounded by an arched gloriette. There are also a number of statues, ornaments, tubs of small trees, and flowers.|$|E
5|$|Following Booth's {{second season}} in the NHL with the Florida Panthers, he was named to his first United States men's team for the 2008 IIHF World Championships, held in Halifax and Quebec City, Canada. He scored his lone goal of the tournament (also his first {{international}} goal and <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> men's level) in a 5–1 preliminary round win against Slovakia. In the quarterfinals, the United States lost 3–2 to Finland and finished the tournament in sixth place.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 {{the castle}} was sold for around £2 {{million to the}} Hay Castle Trust, who {{intended}} {{to turn it into}} an arts and education centre. The firm of Rick Mather Architects were taken on in 2015 to manage the work at a projected cost of £4.35 million, to include a new art gallery and a viewing <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the keep. A grant of £528,600 from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2014 supported initial planning, and further grants were given by the Country Houses Foundation and the Headley Trust.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was a folding game board with a cloth and cardboard pocket attached {{to the bottom of the}} game board along its edge. In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as a pin and plate teetotum.|$|E
5|$|Lam Tin Park {{was built}} along Black Hill in 1991 {{to serve the}} needs of the fast-growing community.

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Egyptian artillery strikes alerted the Israelis, who attacked the strong <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pumping station with armor and seized it. Instead of concentrating forces for a counter-attack, the battalion commander used only the forces originally assigned to the strong point in a counter-attack to regain it, which inevitably failed due to the paucity of forces. Meanwhile, the 81st Battalion reached Serabaeum where they established defenses, mainly at a position south of the railway station, at a hill called Orcha by the Israelis. At this point, only these two paratrooper battalions were positioned between Sharon's division and the Ismailia Canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} linked to the {{mainland}} by two ferries: a Caledonian MacBrayne vehicle ferry making the crossing to Oban and a council passenger ferry making the shorter crossing from <b>Point,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> north-eastern tip of the island, to Port Appin. The B8045 is the main road on the island, which it traverses from beyond Kilcheran in the SW, to Point in the NE.|$|E
5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a narrow <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back margin. Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E

25|$|The {{team that}} has scored <b>the</b> most <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of play wins the game. If the scores are level on <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of play, then the game is a draw; extra time applies only during finals matches in some competitions.|$|R
5|$|Victoria's {{season ended}} with {{consecutive}} matches against Queensland. In the first, Meckiff took {{a total of}} 5/88 as his side completed an innings victory at home. In the final match in Brisbane, his slower ball was no-balled in his fifth over of the second innings by umpire Bill Priem. Meckiff bowled 14 further overs without incident and ended the innings with 4/74. Victoria drew the match and sealed their Sheffield Shield victory. Meckiff had been the state's leading wicket-taker {{and one of the}} key figures in their triumph, but his bowling action was the main talking <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the match.|$|E
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other Moorish {{remnants}} are still visible in Gibraltar today. A hamam or bath-house, similar to examples in Fez in Morocco, {{was built in the}} lower town; its remnants can still be seen today incorporated into the Gibraltar Museum. It was built using Roman and Visigothic capitals, perhaps salvaged from the nearby ruined city of Carteia. The bath-house may {{have been part of the}} Moorish governor's house. A mosque was built in the city centre and was later converted by the Spanish into a Catholic church (now the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned). A small mosque was built near Europa <b>Point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> southern tip of Gibraltar and was later converted into the Christian Shrine of Our Lady of Europe. A subterranean reservoir, now known as the Nun's Well, was also built at Europa Point for the supply of water to the city. An existing 12th-century wall along the sea shore was extended to Europa Point to block access to places where landings could be made by sea. Much of the remainder of Moorish Gibraltar was obliterated by the destruction caused by the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1779–83 and is now buried below the strengthened fortifications and rebuilding implemented by the British afterwards.|$|E

50|$|The teams played {{through various}} rounds {{in order to}} gain points. Whichever team had <b>the</b> most <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end was {{declared}} the winner. If both teams had equal <b>points</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end, then the result was declared as a draw with no tie-breaker played.|$|R
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tip of the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted {{at this point and}} the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E
5|$|Buemi elected not {{to change}} tyres and gained the overall lead. Conway later served a drive-through penalty for his {{collision}} with Shaytar. The repairs to Van der Garde's vehicle meant he was stationary in his pit stall for four minutes which allowed Merhi to inherit fifth position in LMP2. Tréluyer reported to Audi that his car had no front downforce, while Buemi went off the track at Raidillon {{in his effort to}} push hard to extend his lead over Bernhard. Buemi was held up by one of the SMP entrants and an Aston Martin at Fagnes causing his advantage to be reduced to 1.015 seconds. The Toyota driver missed his braking <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bus Stop chicane and went wide at La Source shortly afterwards, causing him to lose the first position to Bernhard. Buemi reclaimed the position at Eau Rouge but temporarily fell to second again after Bernhard overtook him on the Kemmel straight and retook the place before the entry to Les Combes. At Blanchimont corner, Bernhard avoided colliding heavily with the rear-end of Buemi's car after the latter slid while lapping Gulf Racing's Porsche entry.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} represented South Africa at under-23 level, McCarthy {{made his}} senior debut on 4 June 1997 against the Netherlands. He scored his first international goals on 16 February 1998, scoring {{four times in}} 13 minutes against Namibia at the 1998 African Cup of Nations. He added another goal against Morocco and scored twice more against the Democratic Republic of Congo to lead South Africa to the final. Though the nation were ultimately beaten by Egypt, McCarthy was named Player of the Tournament, and collected the Top Scorer award for his seven goals. Later that year, at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, he scored South Africa's first ever goal at a World Cup finals, netting the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Denmark that saw the nation earn a <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> competition for the first time. Adding three friendly goals against Iceland and Egypt, McCarthy ended with 11 goals to his name for the year.|$|E
