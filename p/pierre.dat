5000|$|Because of <b>Pierre's</b> {{political}} jargon, {{several of}} his speeches have been censored over the years. Bywaters believes that Venice Preserv’d is {{an attack on the}} Whig party and that <b>Pierre's</b> speeches are the primary vehicle for those attacks: “and <b>Pierre’s</b> accusation of a ‘new Tyranny’… turns the Whigs’ rhetoric of tyranny and arbitrary power against them." [...] <b>Pierre’s</b> charismatic speeches encourage such a passionate response from the audience that The Times wrote, “the audience seemed enraptured with every development of rebel villainy." [...] After an assassination attempt on George III, the performance of Venice Preserv’d that evening nearly caused a riot which caused the further performances to be cancelled. Venice Preserv’d was not seen in London for seven years until it returned in 1802; however, <b>Pierre's</b> part was censored and lacking its idealism.|$|R
