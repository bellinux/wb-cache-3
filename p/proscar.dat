50|$|Drug {{trade names}} include Propecia, marketed for male pattern baldness (MPB), and <b>Proscar,</b> for benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPH); both are products of Merck & Co. There is 1 mg of finasteride in Propecia and 5 mg in <b>Proscar.</b> Merck's patent on finasteride {{for the treatment of}} BPH expired on June 19, 2006. Merck was awarded a separate patent for the use of finasteride to treat MPB. This patent expired in November 2013.|$|E
50|$|Finasteride, {{sold under}} the brand names <b>Proscar</b> and Propecia among others, is a {{medication}} {{used for the}} treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) and male pattern hair loss. It is a type II and type III 5α-reductase inhibitor; 5α-reductase, an enzyme, converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).|$|E
50|$|Finasteride was {{developed}} under the code name MK-906. In 1992, finasteride (5 mg) {{was approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of BPH, which Merck marketed under the brand name <b>Proscar.</b> In 1997, Merck was successful in obtaining FDA approval for a second indication of finasteride (1 mg) for treatment of MPB, which was marketed under the brand name Propecia.|$|E
40|$|In the first-trimester {{mammalian}} fetus, skin wounds heal {{with perfect}} reconstitution of the dermal architecture without scar formation. Understanding environmental molecular regulation in fetal wound healing may reveal scar-limiting therapeutical {{strategies for the}} prevention of postnatal scarring wound repair. Therefore, we performed studies on fetal skin oxygenation and skin and wound expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha) in the sheep model in vivo and performed studies on the potential relevance of HIF- 1 alpha during wound healing in vitro. Skin oxygen partial pressure levels were hypoxic throughout normal development. In nonscarring fetal skin at gestation day (GD) 60, HIF- 1 alpha could be detected neither in healthy nor in wounded tissue. At GD 100, in wounds with minimal scar formation, HIF- 1 alpha was expressed in fibroblasts and was markedly up-regulated at the wound edge. In scarring fetal wounds at GD 120, HIF- 1 alpha was predominantly expressed in inflammatory cells. Expression of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF-beta 3), a potent antiscarring cytokine, overlapped with HIF- 1 a expression at GD 100. HIF- 1 alpha-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed impaired migratory capabilities and demonstrated that TGF-beta 3, but not <b>proscarring</b> TGF-beta 1, manifests hypoxia- and HIF- 1 alpha-dependent regulation. In conclusion, HIF- 1 alpha-dependent regulation of a potent antiscarring cytokine may provide new strategies for antiscarring manipulation of wound healing...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{development}} of new therapies for hypertrophic scarring has been hampered {{by the lack of}} an appropriate animal model. The authors' objective was to establish a reproducible murine model of hypertrophic scarring by infusing bleomycin over a prolonged period to stimulate dermal fibroproliferation. METHODS: Osmotic pumps filled with 90 μl of 2. 8 mg/ml bleomycin or a control solution (phosphate-buffered saline) were inserted subcutaneously under the dorsal skin of BALB/c mice. The pumps delivered their content at a constant rate of 0. 11 μl/hour for 28 days before mice were euthanized or kept alive for a further 28 days and euthanized at day 56. The resulting lesions were analyzed using histological and immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: The lesions displayed histopathological features of hypertrophic scar similar to those observed in humans and had increased cellularity, abnormal collagen I-collagen III ratios, elevated levels of the <b>proscarring</b> cytokine transforming growth factor β 1, and increased numbers of myofibroblasts. The 28 -day model displayed features analogous to those of a developing human hypertrophic scar, while the 56 -day model was analogous to a mature hypertrophic scar. CONCLUSIONS: The bleomycin infusion model stimulates dermal fibroproliferation, creating reproducible murine scars that are comparable to human hypertrophic scars in terms of histological features, collagen content and organization, cellularity, the presence of myofibroblasts, and expression of transforming growth factor β 1. The bleomycin model represents a promising technique for studying scar formation and testing new antiscarring therapies. Alexander M. Cameron, Damian H. Adams, John E. Greenwood, Peter J.

50|$|Finasteride (<b>Proscar</b> or Propecia) {{inhibits}} {{the function}} {{of two of the}} isoenzymes (type II and III), whereas dutasteride inhibits all three. Finasteride potently inhibits 5α-R2 at a mean inhibitory concentration IC50 of 69 nM, but is less effective with 5α-R1 until an IC50 of 360 nM. Finasteride decreases mean serum level of DHT by 71% after 6 months, and was shown in vitro to inhibit 5α-R3 at a similar potency to 5α-R2 in transfected cell lines. Long term side effects can occur after discontinuation of the drug.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a simple, sensitive, rapid, and reproducible reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic assay of finasteride (<b>proscar)</b> in preformulation, and its application to forced degradation studies has been carried out. The method showed excellent linearity (r(2) {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 9997) in the range 20 - 600] mug ml-(1) using a Shimpak C- 8 column (5 mum, 15. 0 cm x 4. 6 mm) and UV-detection (210 nm) at ambient temperature(25 +/- 1 degreesC) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and water (95 : 05,v/v) and flow rate of 0. 7 ml min(- 1). All peaks are eluted in (10 min and the method has good precision. This method showed good efficiency for the analysis of forced degraded samples, studied at different temperatures and humidities. The results manifest that the shelf-life of <b>proscar</b> is greater than two years at room temperature, under proper storage conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In addition, we update our coverage of anticoagulant drugs with new perspectives on adverse events reported for dabigatran (PRADAXA) and rivaroxaban (XARELTO). In the newly released quarterly data, we examined 50, 289 reports of fatal, disabling, or other serious injury received by the U. S.

The total represented a 17. 7 % decline from the previous quarter, but an increase of 13. 1 % compared to the second quarter of the previous year. We investigated the substantial quarter-to-quarter decline and found it was primarily the result of a regulation that permits companies marketing older drugs to submit many of its adverse event reports on an annual basis.
