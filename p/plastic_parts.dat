5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be {{inserted into the}} cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create <b>plastic</b> <b>parts</b> with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{cooling channel}} {{design in the}} mould is {{important}} because it not only affects cycle time but also quality of the injection moulded <b>plastic</b> <b>part.</b> A good cooling system design can reduce cycle time and achieve dimensional stability of the part which will consequently produce better quality part. This paper describes a new square sectioned conformal cooling channel system for injection moulding. Both simulation and experimental verification have been done with these new cooling channels system. Comparative analysis has been done for an industrial <b>part,</b> a <b>plastic</b> bowl, with conventional cooling channels using the Moldflow simulation software. Experimental verification has been done for a test <b>plastic</b> <b>part</b> with mini injection moulding machine. Comparative results are presented based on temperature distribution on mould surface, cooling time or freezing time of the <b>plastic</b> <b>part</b> and hardness number of the <b>plastic</b> <b>part.</b> Results provide a uniform temperature distribution and hardness number with reduced freezing time of the <b>plastic</b> <b>part...</b>|$|R

25|$|Metallurgist Terry Heaslip of the Canadian company Accident Investigation and Research Inc. {{examined}} the aircraft {{skin from the}} tail and found signs of overheating, specifically that the skin had been repeatedly flexed, through a phenomenon known as flutter. This caused investigators to further scrutinize {{the tail of the}} aircraft. Furthermore, the investigation team found that the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), which was in the tail, generated heat which melted certain <b>plastic</b> <b>parts,</b> indicating that the APU was operating during the flight even though it normally would not be. The mechanic who had inspected the aircraft {{on the day of the}} accident flight told the investigators that one of the aircraft's two main generators had failed and that he was not able to repair the faulty generator. The investigators discovered that the pilots had noted in the flight log that they operated the APU during the flight, since two power sources are required for flight. They also discovered that the front APU mount was broken, which allowed it to vibrate excessively.|$|E
500|$|The {{industrial}} complex covers about [...] {{on both sides}} of Quehanna Highway at the southeast edge of the Quehanna Wild Area. Although the {{industrial complex}} lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and <b>plastic</b> <b>parts</b> for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.|$|E

The objectives of this thesis are to investigate the effect of dimensional parameter on warpage, to develop prediction first and second mathematical model for warpage of <b>plastic</b> <b>part</b> using response surface method. A thin <b>plastic</b> <b>part</b> model {{is used in the}} analysis. To achieve minimum warpage, optimum process condition dimensional parameters are determined. X dimension, Y dimension and Z dimension are used as variables. The most important input parameter in this experiment is Z dimension (wall thickness) which is affecting the warpage of the <b>plastic</b> <b>part.</b> The others input also must be considered. Use the different value of X dimension, Y dimension and Z dimension to determine different value of warpage. The design of experiment that use in this experiment is three level full factorial designs. Finite element analysis using MoldFlow is done to determine experimental value of warpage. Response surface methodology is used to predict the warpage value based on finite element result and suitable predictive model is selected based on percentage of error comparison then optimization process using response surface method is done and the optimum dimensional parameters with minimum warpage value is obtained...|$|R
