5000|$|Hero Must Die was {{developed}} by game developer Pyramid. The staff included designer and story writer Shoji Masuda, producers Kyoko Kawakami and Jun Meishi, the latter of whom worked on Patapon and a video game based on Record of Lodoss War; and production manager Junichi Kashiwagi, who worked on Chaos Seed. The game's production was handled and augmented by G-Mode. When creating the concept of Hero Must Die, Masuda drew from own experiences of living through his father's deterioration after receiving surgery for cirrhosis in 1995: despite the surgery being successful, Masuda's father was given ten years to live. During this period, Masuda watched his father slowly become weaker, and at the funeral in 2005 {{he realized that he}} had not had the time he wanted with his father due to various circumstances. These experiences formed the core concepts for Hero Must Die: its main theme was choosing what to do within a limited amount of time. According to Masuda, while this setup had been done in film and television, he had yet to see it done in video games. The playtime was intended to be short, approximately six to eight hours, so people could play it during commutes across a week. Another element was the hero giving gifts to people in need to his own detriment, a theme compared by Masuda to [...] "The Happy Prince" [...] by Oscar Wilde. Incorporating this theme into the entire work proved taxing for him. The specific concept for Hero Must Die was fully formed by 1999, while he was working on the first Oreshika game. His proposal was initially rejected by multiple developers, but after <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his web page as a kind of joke, his proposal was seen and accepted by Meishi and began production. Mobile phones were chosen as the platform due to budgetary issues and the projected production period. According to Masuda, many of the game's more distinguished staff were suggested by Pyramid.|$|R

When the iron stove was brought up the man who had carried it showed them how to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> stakes and start a fire in it, and then Trafford went to the river to get water, and Marjorie made a kind of flour cake in the frying-pan in the manner an American woman from the wilderness had once shown her, and boiled water for tea. The twilight had deepened to night while the men were still stumbling up the trail with the last two canoes.|$|E
6000|$|L. My dear, he is a boaster and self-assertor, by nature; {{but it is}} so far true. For instance, we used to have a fair in our neighborhood--a {{very fine}} fair we thought it. You never saw such an one; {{but if you look at}} the {{engraving}} of Turner's [...] "St. Catherine's Hill," [...] you will see what it was like. There were curious booths, carried on poles; and peep-shows; and music, with plenty of drums and cymbals; and much barley-sugar and gingerbread, and the like: and in the alleys of this fair the London populace would enjoy themselves, after their fashion, very thoroughly. Well, the little Pthah set to work upon it one day; he made the wooden poles into iron ones, and put them across, like his own crooked legs, so that you always fall over them if you don't look where you are going; and he turned all the canvas into panes of glass, and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> his iron cross-poles; and made all the little booths into one great booth;--and people said it was very fine, and a new style of architecture; and Mr. Dickens said nothing was ever like it in Fairy-land, which was very true. And then the little Pthah set to work to put fine fairings in it; and he painted the Nineveh bulls afresh, with the blackest eyes he could paint (because he had none himself), and he got the angels down from Lincoln choir, and gilded their wings like his gingerbread of old times; and he sent for everything else he could think of, and put it in his booth. There are the casts of Niobe and her children; and the Chimpanzee; and the wooden Caffres and New-Zealanders; and the Shakespeare House; and Le Grand Blondin, and Le Petit Blondin; and Handel; and Mozart; and no end of shops, and buns, and beer; and all the little-Pthah-worshippers say, never was anything so sublime! ...|$|E
60|$|They talked all day, {{going out}} to lunch {{together}} at the Astor House, and sitting with their knees against the counter on a row of stools before it for fifteen minutes of reflection and deglutition, with their hats on, and then returning to the basement from which they emerged. The West Virginia company's name was lettered in gilt on the wide low window, and its paint, {{in the form of}} ore, burnt, and mixed, formed a display on the window shelf Lapham examined it and praised it; from time to time they all recurred to it together; they sent out for some of Lapham's paint and compared it, the West Virginians admitting its former superiority. They were young fellows, and country persons, like Lapham, by origin, and they looked out with the same amused, undaunted provincial eyes at the myriad metropolitan legs passing on the pavement above the level of their window. He got on well with them. At last, they said what they would do. They said it was nonsense to talk of buying Lapham out, for they had not the money; and as for selling out, they would not do it, for they knew they had a big thing. But they would as soon use his capital to develop it as anybody else's, and if he could put in a certain sum for this purpose, they would go in with him. He should run the works at Lapham and manage the business in Boston, and they would run the works at Kanawha Falls and manage the business in New York. The two brothers with whom Lapham talked named their figure, subject to the approval of another brother at Kanawha Falls, to whom they would write, and who would telegraph his answer, so that Lapham could have it inside of three days. But they felt perfectly sure that he would approve; and Lapham started back on the eleven o'clock train with an elation that gradually left him as he drew near Boston, where the difficulties of raising this sum were to be over come. It seemed to him, then, that those fellows had <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> him pretty steep, but he owned to himself that they had a sure thing, and that they were right in believing they could raise the same sum elsewhere; it would take all OF it, he admitted, to make their paint pay on the scale they had the right to expect. At their age, he would not have done differently; but when he emerged, old, sore, and sleep-broken, from the sleeping-car in the Albany depot at Boston, he wished with a pathetic self-pity that they knew how a man felt at his age. A year ago, six months ago, he would have laughed at the notion that {{it would be hard to}} raise the money. But he thought ruefully of that immense stock of paint on hand, which was now a drug in the market, of his losses by Rogers and by the failures of other men, of the fire that had licked up so many thousands in a few hours; he thought with bitterness of the tens of thousands that he had gambled away in stocks, and of the commissions that the brokers had pocketed whether he won or lost; and he could not think of any securities on which he could borrow, except his house in Nankeen Square, or the mine and works at Lapham. He set his teeth in helpless rage when he thought of that property out on the G. L. & P., that ought to be worth so much, and was worth so little if the Road chose to say so.|$|E
