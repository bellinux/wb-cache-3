5|$|The President of the Puerto Rican Senate, Luis Muñoz Marín {{together}} with Governor Rexford Tugwell, the last non-Puerto Rican Governor of Puerto Rico appointed by an American president, helped advance legislation geared towards agricultural reform, economic recovery and industrialization. This program {{became known as}} Operation Bootstrap. As {{a result of the}} program, many Jews migrated to the city of Ponce located in the southern region of the island and worked in the agricultural industry. Operation Bootstrap also attracted clothing manufactures from New York and many of the <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> who came to the island were Jews.|$|E
5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{and racial}} issues are {{represented}} in Dreamgirls being a black-cast musical with three female lead roles. Being set in the 1960s, the Black Power Movement was influential on the story line with black artists starting {{to succeed in the}} music industry and black music becoming accessible to all audiences, which is a representation of racial boundaries being broken down. The story is based on three women working their way up in the music industry to achieve their dreams while the most powerful <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> are men. In the end, the women stand up for their rights and become influential figures.|$|E

It became popular in part because of a number of Twitter messages from <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> about it, such as independent designers Anna Anthropy and Erin Robinson, journalist Mathew Kumar, legendary graphic adventure game developer Ron Gilbert, and International Games Festival chair Brandon Boyer.

25|$|Gessle and Fredriksson {{had talked}} about working {{together}} for many years. Fredriksson had done backing vocal work for Gessle's band Gyllene Tider, and they had worked together on Spännande Ostar and other projects, including an attempt by Gyllene Tider to release an English language album in America. Fredriksson's career was soaring in Sweden, but Gessle was a former boyband member whose solo career was not doing as well. Friends and <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> were skeptical towards the idea of Marie collaborating with Gessle. His idea was to form a duo, singing in English, and try to have some success in Europe. However, during the 1980s, it was uncommon for Swedish artists to perform in English.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} at 2007's Screamfest Horror Film Festival, where it impressed {{an assistant at}} the Creative Artists Agency, Kirill Baru, so much that CAA signed on to represent Peli.

He worked with Peli to re-edit the film and submitted it to the Sundance Film Festival, but it was rejected. The DVD also impressed DreamWorks executives Adam Goodman, Stacey Snider, and finally Steven Spielberg, who {{cut a deal with}} Blum and Peli.|$|E

25|$|Devonshire took {{an active}} {{interest}} {{in the lives of}} Canadians, and conducted various tours of the country to meet with them. As a land owner himself, the Governor General was particularly focused on the development of farming in Canada and during his travels, at agricultural and horticultural fairs, shows, and sugaring-off parties in the Gatineau, he discussed agricultural issues with farmers and other <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry.</b> His speeches often referred to Canada's potential to lead the world in agricultural research and development, and one of his major projects while viceroy was to establish experimental farms, including the Crown's central one in Ottawa. At the same time, Devonshire acted as a patron of the arts; when not on tour or residing at La Citadelle the viceregal residence in Quebec City at which the Duke enjoyed spending time he frequently visited the National Gallery and hosted theatrical performances at Rideau Hall. There, {{on the grounds of the}} royal residence, during the winters, the Devonshires also hosted tobogganing and skating parties, as well as hockey matches. Officially, in 1918 Devonshire travelled to the United States to meet President Woodrow Wilson informally, and the following year, he was host to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, during his first tour of Canada.|$|E

In April 2013, Finding Dory, a sequel to Finding Nemo, was announced for a June 17, 2016, release. In March 2014, The Incredibles 2 and Cars 3 were announced as films in development. In November 2014, Toy Story 4 was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director. In an interview, Lasseter stated that [...] " [...] lot of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> view us doing sequels as being for the business of it, but for us, it's pure passion...One {{of the things that was}} very important for me as an artist is to continue directing.

Its story will be built on the fact that Bo Peep was absent in Toy Story 3, with Woody and Buzz Lightyear trying to find her and bring her back.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a flurry}} of {{interest}} in the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) and air taxi markets in the early 2000s, the VLJ sector underwent significant expansion. Several new designs were produced, such as the Embraer Phenom 100, the Cessna Citation Mustang, and the Eclipse 500. However, following the late 2000s recession the air taxi market underperformed expectations, and both Eclipse Aviation and air taxi firm DayJet collapsed. In December 2010, AvWeb's Paul Bertorelli explained that the term very light jet has lost favor in the aviation industry. [...] "Personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ—very light jet—much anymore and some <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> tell me they think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from." ...|$|E
