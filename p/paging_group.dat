5000|$|One {{control channel}} Multi Frame {{is made of}} 51 TDMA frames with a time {{duration}} of 235 ms. Each 51 TDMA frame Multi Frame will have 9 Common Control Channel (CCCH) blocks. Each of these 9 CCCH block is made of 4 TDMA frames. Each CCCH block can carry Paging Messages for 2 MS if IMSI based paging is used or 4 MS if TMSI based paging is used. Thus the paging capacity for one 51 TDMA frame Multi Frame will be 9(number of CCCH blocks available per Multi Frame) * 4 (when TMSI based paging is used) = 36 mobiles per 235 ms or 9*2 = 18 mobiles per 235 ms when IMSI based paging is used. Thus the paging capacity of a cell is 153 mobiles per second when TMSI based paging are used and 68 mobiles per second when IMSI based paging are used. This means we can improve the [...] "paging bandwidth" [...] for a cell (if {{there are too many}} [...] "paging discards at the cell level") by using TMSI based paging rather than IMSI based (at the expense of increased processor load at the BSC and MSC). When the rate of [...] "paging load" [...] at the BTS becomes higher than what the BTS is able to handle (paging capacity of BTS), BTS will start discarding pages (check for high [...] "page discard" [...] stats at the cell level). Once an MS deciphers its <b>paging</b> <b>group,</b> in an idle mode, it will tune in and check for an incoming page only during broadcast time for its <b>paging</b> <b>group</b> (so further the paging groups are places across multiple 51 frame multi frames, less frequently it will tune in to check for an incoming page and longer will be its battery life.|$|E
5000|$|Paging Success by far is {{the most}} complex KPI to deal with as the process of paging touches almost all the nodes in GSM system and is {{influenced}} by performance of each of them. Thatâ€™s the reason why this write up on paging looks too interwoven and cross refers to too many things. But the plus point with paging is by the time paging success rate in a network gets improved; almost all the other KPIs too stand improved. In response to an incoming call, the MSC initiates the paging process by broadcasting a [...] "paging request" [...] message on the paging sub channel (IMSI or TMSI of the MS and its <b>Paging</b> <b>Group)</b> and starts timer T3113. A [...] "paging message" [...] consists of the mobile identity (IMSI or TMSI) of the MS being paged and its [...] "paging group number". A Paging Request Message may include more than one MS identification. The maximum number of paged MS per message is 4 when using [...] "TMSI" [...] for identification of the MS (maximum number of paged MS per message is 2 when using IMSI). The BSC receives this page and processes the paging request and schedules it for transmission on the PCH at appropriate time. The MS on its part will analyse the paging messages (and immediate assignment messages) sent on the paging sub channel corresponding to its <b>paging</b> <b>group.</b> Upon receipt of a [...] "paging request" [...] message, MS will initiate within 0.7s an immediate assignment procedure. Upon receipt of a page at the MS, the MS responds by transmitting a channel request on the RACH. BSS {{in response to the}} received [...] "channel request", will process it and immediately assign the MS a SDCCH (immediate assignment / assignment reject; done over AGCH). MS Paging response- After receiving the immediate assignment command, MS switches to the assigned [...] "SDCCH" [...] and transmits a [...] "Paging Response". The establishment of the main signalling link is then initiated with information field containing the [...] "PAGING RESPONSE" [...] message and the [...] "paging response" [...] is sent to the MSC. Upon receipt of the [...] "Paging Response" [...] MSC stops the timer T3113. If the timer T3113 expires and a [...] "Paging Response"message has not been received, the MSC may repeat the [...] "Paging Request" [...] message and start T3113 all over again. The number of successive paging attempt is a network dependent choice.|$|E

30|$|Machine-type {{communication}} (MTC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important services for next generation networks. 3 GPP, IEEE and other international organizations adopt their technologies to the emerging market of the MTC [1]. Mass machine devices that simultaneously access the network may result in heavy collisions and thus, degrade the network performance [1, 2]. In 3 GPP [3], a concept of group paging has been introduced to alleviate the heavy collision problem in the random access channels (RACHs) of the cellular networks. However, no normative specification work on group issues took place. It may restart again in the next 3 GPP Release 13. In group paging, the base station, which is known as an evolved-NodeB (eNB) in 3 GPP, can assign a number of machine devices to form a <b>paging</b> <b>group.</b> The eNB can then simultaneously activate the group of machine devices by sending a single group paging message. Upon receiving the group paging message, all machine devices belonging to the <b>paging</b> <b>group</b> should immediately perform the random access (RA) procedure to access the network during a period of time, which is referred as a group paging interval herein [4].|$|E

30|$|The {{related works}} of <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> are briefly {{summarized}} as below. The performance analysis of <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> via computer simulations was first addressed in [5]. The first analytical {{model of a}} simplified <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> without random backoff was first presented in [6]. The model is then completed and extended in [4] to analyze the performance of <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> by considering all the implementation constraints of the RA procedure specified in LTE networks. A group-based time control mechanism was presented in [7] to deal with radio access network overload problem in a femtocell-based MTC network. A priority grouping scheme is presented in [8] {{to deal with the}} RACH collisions by assigning priority-dependent backoff parameters. In [9], the authors proposed a two-level device partitioning scheme to deal with the RACH overload problem by limiting the number of contending machine devices. In [10], the authors proposed to alleviate the RACH collision problem by assigning dedicated preamble and RA slot for each UE. Our previous work in [2] introduces consecutive <b>group</b> <b>paging,</b> which provides several <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> intervals consecutively for a <b>group.</b> Normal <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> is performed in each interval, and failing UEs from the previous interval are paged again in the successive interval. Compared with the original <b>group</b> <b>paging,</b> this method slightly increases the success probability at the cost of increased access delay.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{suggested}} {{enhancing the}} performance of <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> by enforcing UEs to perform pre-backoff before the first transmission of preamble. The application had to be delay tolerant, since the time for backoff window might be long. An analytical model was then presented to derive {{the performance of}} <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> with pre-backoff. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> with pre-backoff in terms of collision probability, access success probability, the average access delay, and the tradeoffs with the existing backoff mechanism. The results verify {{the accuracy of the}} analysis and demonstrate that pre-backoff can greatly enhance the performance of <b>group</b> <b>paging</b> when the <b>group</b> size is big. The proposed analytical model can be used to determine the optimal pre-backoff window size under a target access success probability.|$|R
