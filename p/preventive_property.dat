The present study is designed to investigate the mechanism involved in the inhibitory action of genistein in MCF- 7 cells. Genistein at 50 and 100 μM significantly arrested the growth of MCF- 7 cells at G 2 /M phase (P< 0. 05) and decreased at the proliferative S phase (P< 0. 05). Using cDNA microarray technology, genes differentially regulated by genistein were identified. In particular, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), genistein up-regulated heat shock protein 105 (HSP) mRNA and down-regulated mRNA expression of serum response factor (SRF), estrogen receptor (ER) α, disabled homolog 2 (DOC 2) and recombination activation gene 1 (RAG- 1). Using real time RT-PCR, we have shown that HSP and SRF mRNA were both regulated by genistein in a time- and dose-dependent manner; however, it appears that only the effect of genistein on SRF mRNA, but not HSP mRNA expression, can be partially abolished by cotreatment with estrogen antagonist ICI 182, 780. Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of the ERα and SRF protein decreased significantly with genistein treatment (P< 0. 05). These results suggest that the inhibitory action of genistein on human breast cancer cells appears to be complex and is only partially mediated by the alteration of estrogen receptor-dependent pathways...|$|R

40|$|Vitamin D {{is a key}} {{regulator}} {{of calcium}} metabolism and has been implicated as a cancer preventive agent. However, clinical studies have revealed conflicting results on its cancer <b>preventive</b> <b>properties,</b> attributed in part to multiple metabolic and regulatory factors susceptible to affect individual responses to exogenous vitamin D. Vitamin D is obtained from dietary sources and sun exposure, which depends on numerous parameters such as skin type, latitude, and lifestyle factors. Focusing on thyroid cancer, we document that genetic and epigenetic determinants can greatly impact individual response to vitamin D and may outweigh the classical clinical correlative studies that focus on sun exposure/dietary intake factors. In particular, genetic determinants innate to host intrinsic metabolic pathways such as highly polymorphic cytochromes P 450 s responsible for the metabolic activation of vitamin D are expressed in many organs, including the thyroid gland and can impact vitamin D interaction with its nuclear receptor (VDR) in thyroid tissue. Moreover, downstream regulatory pathways in vitamin D signalling as well as VDR are also subject to wide genetic variability among human populations as shown by genome-wide studies. These genetic variations in multiple components of vitamin D pathways are critical determinants for the re-valuation of the potential <b>preventive</b> and anticancer <b>properties</b> of vitamin D in thyroid cancer...|$|R

40|$|Polyphenols are a {{very broad}} group of chemicals, widely {{distributed}} in plant foods, and endowed with antioxidant activity {{by virtue of their}} numerous phenol groups.

A variety of assays are in use to study genetic damage endpoints. Human trials, of which there are rather few, tend to show decreases in endogenous DNA damage and protection against DNA damage induced ex vivo in blood cells. Most animal experiments have investigated the effects of polyphenols (often at high doses) in combination with known DNA-damaging agents, and generally they show protection.
