Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to <b>polybrominated</b> <b>diphenyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (<b>PBDEs),</b> a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency.
