For aim {{applied to}} develop Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), a traffic {{incident}} detection method based on Reduced Error <b>Pruning</b> <b>Tree</b> (REPTree) algorithm of decision tree is presented. Different from unpruned decision tree, REPTree {{model is a}} fast decision tree learner which builds a decision tree using information gain as the splitting criterion, and prunes it using reduced-error pruning. The detection performance of the REPTree was compared to multi-layer feed forward neural networks (MLFNN) and Radical Basis Function neural networks (RBFNN) which yield superior incident detection performance in the previous studies. The experimental results indicate that REPTree model is competitive with MLFNN and RBFNN...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to NNs, several other ML techniques thrived during the 1980 s. Among these techniques, Bayesian Network (BN) arose as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation {{model for the}} statistical models in use [352], such as NB and HMM –the latter considered as the simplest dynamic BN [107, 110]–. Two DT learning algorithms, similar to ID 3 but developed independently, referred to as Classification And Regression Trees (CART) [76], were proposed to model classification and regression problems. Another DT algorithm, {{under the name of}} Reduced Error <b>Pruning</b> <b>Tree</b> (REPTree), was also introduced for classification. REPTree aimed at building faster and simpler tree models using information gain for splitting, along with reduced-error pruning [374].|$|E

Several effective data structures, such as two-dimensional arrays, graphs, trees, and tries {{have been proposed}} to collect candidate and frequent itemsets. It seems as the tree structure is most extractive to storing itemsets. The outstanding tree has been proposed so far is called FP-tree which is a prefix-tree structure. In this paper, MFP-tree data structure is introduced. It is a modification of FP-tree. A CP-mine algorithm is also proposed in order to mine frequent itemsets from the MFP-tree by using <b>pruning</b> <b>tree</b> and a marked value technique. We have conducted several experiments based on both synthetic and real world datasets with different parameters.

40|$|Abstract — Decision {{trees are}} {{few of the}} most {{extensively}} researched domains in Knowledge Discovery. Irrespective of such advantages {{as the ability to}} explain the choice procedure and low computational costs, decision trees also usually produce relatively great outcomes in assessment with other machine finding out formulas. Although the best decision tree induction algorithms, such as J 48, had been developed some time ago, they continue to be regularly used for solving everyday classification tasks. In this work we aim to improve the predictive performance of these algorithms by mitigating three of their major disadvantages by Pruning Trees. Pruning decreases the complexity in the final classifier, and therefore improves predictive accuracy from the decrease of over fitting. This paper introduces a new decision tree algorithm based on J 48 and reduced error <b>pruning.</b> <b>Tree</b> obtained is fast decision tree learning and will be based on the information gain or reducing the variance...|$|E

50|$|Gillet’s next notable plant {{introduction}} to California (in 1883) {{was a free}} stone dessert prune from the Clairac region of France, which he called “Clairac Mammoth” (a.k.a. “Imperial Epineuse”). At {{a time when most}} California fruit was consumed fresh, dried and canned dessert prunes were a popular, expensive import from France. California prune growers as early as 1854 had attempted to cut into this lucrative market by importing and growing French <b>prune</b> <b>trees,</b> but struggled to copy French drying methods. Gillet competed with John Rock, another well-known nurseryman in Niles (Fremont), to market hardier <b>prune</b> <b>trees</b> that produced very large fruit. Gillet introduced his Clairac <b>prune</b> <b>trees</b> two years before Rock. Both men crossed or grafted the French prunes with wild California plums to produce a variety that was more drought-tolerant and hardier in upland orchards, than in lowlands such as the Santa Clara Valley, then the prune growing center of California.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, the {{hardware}} description and some experimental results regarding <b>pruning</b> <b>tree</b> branches {{in a real}} environment using an aerial pruning robot were shown. Results obtained show that the PI control implemented to control speed of the circular saw was helpful for pruning a real tree branch. In addition, the wireless communication between the aerial pruning robot and a ground station has shown {{that it is possible}} to follow the pruning task monitoring the performance of the speed of the circular saw to avoid possible accidents. In the future, there are some necessary improvements to increase the performance of the pruning task such as monitoring the process using either a smart phone or a tablet instead of a PC along with a more powerful wireless communication to cover a large working area. Moreover, a quadrotor helicopter in a coaxial configuration is also being considered to increase the payload capacity and thus allowing the operator to place an extra battery to increase the flying time, which is crucial to accomplish the pruning task.|$|E
30|$|It is {{not always}} {{possible}} to collect bidirectional flows due to routing asymmetries [138, 347]. However, {{it is possible to}} derive components of the feature vector for an application class given a priori knowledge [347], or estimate the missing statistics [138]. In addition, filtering can be leveraged to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and the training time. Park et al. [347] employ supervised tree-based classifiers on unidirectional flows and compare them against NBKE using WEKA [288]. They exploit the faster classification time and low memory storage requirements of DT to employ Reduced Error <b>Pruning</b> <b>Tree</b> (REPTree) for classification. REPTree finds a sub-optimal tree that minimizes classification error. In addition, the Bagging ensemble is used to classify flows using majority rule to aggregate multiple REPTree predictions. Recall, that P 2 P bulk data transfer and streaming applications often behave similar to each other [390]. Therefore, the authors in [347] employ a burst feature to better discriminate between such classes. The burst feature is based on packet inter-arrival statistics and a predetermined threshold that dictates whether packets are exhibiting “bursty” behavior. Evidently, bulk data transfer applications exhibit higher burst than streaming applications.|$|E

The {{primary goal of}} this work was to identify the hazardousness of sewer pipeline to offer safe and non-hazardous access to sewer pipeline workers so that the human fatalities, which occurs due to the toxic exposure of sewer gas components, can be avoided. The dataset acquired through laboratory tests, experiments, and various literature sources was organized to design a predictive model that was able to identify/classify hazardous and non-hazardous situation of sewer pipeline. To design such prediction model, several classification algorithms were used and their performances were evaluated and compared, both empirically and statistically, over the collected dataset. In addition, the performances of several ensemble methods were analyzed to understand the extent of improvement offered by these methods.

A complimentary study presented in Appendix 1, {{was conducted to}} evaluate the short term effectiveness of K soil amendments, mulching and foliar K sprays for correcting K deficiency in sweet cherry and <b>prune</b> <b>trees.</b> Potassium solutions were injected into sweet cherry trees at an average rate of 0. 4 liter/min and into <b>prune</b> <b>trees</b> at an average rate of 0. 06 - 0. 08 liter/min using a pressure of 3. 5 - 3. 9 kg/cm². Fall trunk injections of 200 g K in K₂SO₄, solution or up to 300 g K in K₂HPO₄ solution {{had no effect on}} sweet cherry midshoot leaf K the following August. Fall <b>prune</b> <b>tree</b> injections of up to 50 g K in K₂HPO₄, solution had no effect on midshoot leaf K the following August. One year, fall K₂HPO₄, (200 g K, 79. 2 g P) injections of sweet cherry trees significantly increased the K content of spur tissues and the P content of buds in March and increased the P content of midshoot leaves in August. Fruit set was significantly lower on sweet cherry trees injected with 200 g K (K₂SO₄) and 300 g K (K₂HPO₄). Yield was significantly lower for all injection treatments but fruit quality was not affected. Spring trunk injections of 12. 5 g K in K₂SO₄ or K₂HPO₄ solution increased prune leaf K within four days and K levels remained higher than controls for at least 22 days with K₂SO₄. Leaf P was increased within four days by K₂HPO₄, injections and remained higher than controls in August. Spring applications of 11. 36 kg K₂SO₄, per tree by banding, placing in augered holes in the soil or injection into the soil had no effect on sweet cherry trees within two years but did significantly increase August midshoot leaf K in <b>prune</b> <b>trees</b> within one growing season.

This work aimed at evaluating {{the use of a}} substrate based on composted sewage sludge and crushed <b>pruning</b> <b>tree</b> for the production of Anadenanthera colubrina seedlings (monjoleiro) using three different fertilization levels. Seedling growth was then compared to growth on a commercial substrate based on composted Pinus bark and vermiculite.

Seedling height, diameter and aerial dry mass (leaves and branches) were measured. Considering seedlings growth without fertilization, the greatest values for all morphological characteristics were obtained using composted substrate based on sewage sludge.

40|$|International audienceBranch-and-bound (B&B) {{algorithms}} {{are attractive}} methods for solving to optimality combinatorial opti-mization problems using an implicit enumeration of a dynamically built tree-based search space. Neverthe-less, they are time-consuming {{when dealing with}} large problem instances. Therefore, <b>pruning</b> <b>tree</b> nodes (subproblems) is traditionally used as a powerful mechanism {{to reduce the size}} of the explored search space. Pruning requires to perform the bounding operation, which consists of applying a lower bound function to the subproblems generated during the exploration process. Preliminary experiments performed on the Flow-Shop scheduling problem (FSP) have shown that the bounding operation consumes over 98 % of the execution time of the B&B algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the use of graphics processing unit (GPU) computing as a major complementary way to speed up the search. We revisit the design and implementation of the parallel bounding model on GPU accelerators. The proposed approach enables data access optimiza-tion. Extensive experiments have been carried out on well-known FSP benchmarks using an Nvidia Tesla C 2050 GPU card. Compared to a CPU-based single core execution using an Intel Core i 7 - 970 processor without GPU, speedups higher than 100 times faster are achieved for large problem instances.
