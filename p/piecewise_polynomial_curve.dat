40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for constructing a spline {{curve of the}} Bezier type, which is continuous along with its first derivative by a piecewise polynomial function. Conditions for its existence and uniqueness are given. The constructed curve lies inside the convex hull of the control points, and the segments of the broken line connecting the control points are tangent to the curve. To construct the curve, we use the approach proposed earlier for constructing a parabolic spline. The idea is to use additional points with unknown values of some function. Additional points are used as spline nodes, and the function values are determined from {{the condition of the}} first derivative continuity of a <b>piecewise</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>curve.</b> In multiple interpolation nodes, the function takes the given values and the values of the first derivative, which are determined by the control points.

40|$|Abstract: A {{class of}} cubic {{polynomial}} blending functions with a shape parameter is presented. It {{is an extension}} of cubic uniform B-spline basis functions. <b>Piecewise</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>curves</b> with a shape parameter are constructed from these blending functions. The generated curves have second geometric continuity for any fixed shape parameter and have the same terminal properties as the cubic uniform B-spline curves. If the value of the shape parameter is changed, the approaching degree of the curves to their control polygon is adjusted accordingly and the curves are manipulated to approximate the cubic uniform B-spline curve from its both sides. In comparison with the existing results, the degree of blending functions is lower and the domain of the shape parameter is larger in this paper. A new method using cubic <b>polynomial</b> <b>curves</b> with a shape parameter is also proposed to solve interpolation problem without solving global systems of equations.

Although formally {{they are}} C 2 or higher, the {{variation of the}} curvature of (<b>piecewise)</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>curves</b> is difficult to control; {{in some cases it}} is practically impossible to obtain the desired curvature. As an alternative we propose piecewise clothoid curves (PCCs). We show that from the design point of view they have many advantages: control points are interpolated, curvature extrema lie in the control points, and adding control points does not change the curve. We present a fast localized clothoid interpolation algorithm that can also be used for curvature smoothing, for curve fitting, for curvature blending, and even for directly editing the curvature. We give a physical interpretation of variational curvature minimization, from which we derive our scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the achievable quality with a range of examples...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{smoothness}} of the limit function for one dimensional unequally spaced interpolating subdivision schemes. The new grid points introduced {{at every level}} can lie in irregularly spaced locations between old, adjacent grid points and not only midway as is usually the case. For the natural generalization of the four point scheme introduced by Dubuc and Dyn, Levin, and Gregory, we show that, under some geometric restrictions, the limit function is always C 1; under slightly stronger restrictions we show that the limit function is almost C 2, the same regularity as in the regularly spaced case. 1.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of 3 DGA data often requires the segmentation of joint angle time­series (e. g. {{the identification of}} rockers in the ankle sagittal plane kinematics). We introduce a novel method for the automatic segmentation of joint angle time­series based on a Bayesian time­series model called Hierachical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP­HMM) [1]. The goal of the method is to segment a joint angle time­series {{in a set of}} <b>piecewise</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>curves,</b> {{while at the same time}} estimating the curve parameters and the time­correlation between the segments. The proposed method is suited for segmention of a set of time­series, (e. g., a set of gait cycles exhibiting a specific pattern identified by a clinician) and to learn a probabilistic shape signature that can be used for classification of gait trials.

40|$|Abstract. The spatial {{discretization}} of elastic continuum by {{finite element}} method (FEM) in-troduces dispersion errors to numerical solutions of wave propagation tasks. For higher order Lagrangian as well as Hermitian elements there are optical modes in their frequency spec-tra leading to spurious oscillations of shock induced responses in a vicinity of propagating wavefronts. Furthermore, the behavior of classical higher order elements accounts for discon-tinuities in their spectra {{as well as for}} false representation of maximum frequency, the error of which increases with element order. For brevity this property is called the divergent behav-ior in the text. The recent innovations in finite element analysis rely on spline-based shape functions, taking inspiration in CAD (Computer Aided Design) approaches where the B-splines and mainly NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline) representations are regularly employed. B-spline as well as NURBS <b>curves</b> are <b>piecewise</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>curves</b> that are differentiable up to a prescribed order. The B-splines functions, employed as finite element shape functions, are examined in this paper, using the 1 D stress wave modeling as a testing vehicle. It is shown that the employed approach leads to substantial minimization of dispersion errors; furthermore the errors decrease with increasing order of B-spline elements. It is believed that the B-spline based FE technology represents a promising tool allowing to increase reliability of numerical solutions of wave propagation problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Given a large set of irregularly spaced {{points in}} the plane, an {{algorithm}} for partitioning the points into subsets and fitting a parametric curve to each subset is described. The points could be measurements from a physical phenomenon, and the objective in this process could be to find patterns among the points and describe the phenomenon analytically. The points could be measurements from a geometric model, and the objective could be to reconstruct the model {{by a combination of}} parametric curves. The algorithm proposed here can be used in various applications, especially where given points are dense and noisy. x 1. Introduction In many science and engineering problems {{there is a need to}} fit a curve or curves to an irregularly spaced set of points. Curve fitting has been studied extensively in Approximation Theory and Geometric Modeling, and there are numerous books on the subject [1, 5, 6, 12, 23]. Existing techniques typically find a single curve segment that approximates or interpolates the given points. Many techniques assume that the points are ordered and fit a curve to them by minimizing an error criterion [3, 7, 8, 14, 16, 22, 27, 29, 31, 34]. If the points are ordered, <b>piecewise</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>curves</b> can also be fitted to them [19, 30]. Difficulties arise when the points are not ordered. To fit curves to an irregularly spaced set of points, 1) the set should be partitioned into subsets, 2) the points in each subset should be ordered, and 3) a curve should be fitted to points in each subset. This paper will provide solutions to the first two problems; that is, partitioning a point set into subsets and ordering the points in each subset. Once the points in each subset are ordered, existing techniques can be used to find the curves...|$|R

Data were analysed using algorithms based on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) (an objective whole brain processing technique) to generate global volume measures of whole brain, grey matter (GM) and white matter (GM). Gender-specific development of WM and GM volumes is characterised using a <b>piecewise</b> <b>polynomial</b> growth <b>curve</b> model {{to account for}} the non-linear nature of human brain development, implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The statistical method employed in this study proved to be successful and robust in the characterisation of brain development. The resulting growth curve parameter estimates lead to the following observations: total brain volume is demonstrated to undergo an initial rapid spurt. The total GM volume peaks during childhood and decreases thereafter, whereas total WM volume increases up to young adulthood. Relative to brain size, GM decreases and WM increases markedly over this age range in a non-linear manner, resulting in an increasing WM-to-GM ratio over much of the observed age range. In addition, significant gender differences are found. In general, brain volume and total white and grey matter volume are larger in males than in females, with a time-dependent difference over the age range studied. Over part of the observed age range females tend to have more GM volume relative to brain size and lower WM-to-GM ratio than males. The presented findings should be taken into account when investigating physiological and pathological changes during brain development...|$|R
