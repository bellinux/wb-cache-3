5000|$|A spacious {{interior}} {{married with}} [...] "an abundance of polished hardwood, {{not only for}} the facia but also for the door cappings, a floor .... covered with thick pile carpet" [...] and the car's driving qualities will have attracted admiration, but purchase tax on cars was high and in 1954 the UK manufacturer-recommended retail <b>price,</b> <b>including</b> <b>tax,</b> for the standard bodied 3½-litre Daimler Regency was £2,324. [...] That price included a heater, but customer requiring a radio to be fitted would need to find another £48. [...] In the same year Jaguar's recommended UK retail price for the similarly sized (and very effectively promoted) Mark VII was £1,680. [...] (Jaguar buyers also received the heater included in the price, though they were obliged to find an extra £50 for a radio.) The price differential is probably enough to explain why relatively few Daimler Regencys found buyers but {{it should be pointed out}} that the Daimler was a much more substantial and durable product assembled with much greater care than Jaguars of that same day and aimed at quite different customers.|$|E
30|$|The Resourcecostshare variable, being {{constrained}} between {{zero and}} one, {{is defined as}} the share of the vehicle’s retail price that is not made up by purchase tax or value added tax (VAT), i. e. as the price net of tax divided by the <b>price</b> <b>including</b> <b>tax.</b> As expected, its coefficient comes out positive, suggesting that, other things (including the price) being equal, buyers are more reluctant to choose a heavily taxed car than one that is subject to zero or little tax. The Resourcecostshare variable allows us to distinguish the effect of a tax increase from that of a higher manufacturing or marketing cost.|$|E

50|$|A six-cylinder car was road {{tested by}} Britain's Autocar {{magazine}} in March 1975 {{at the time}} of the model's launch. It recorded a maximum speed of 104 mph (167 km/h) and reached 60 mph (97 km/h) from a standing start in 13.5 seconds. The top speed was marginally lower than the 109 mph (175 km/h) achieved by a recently tested Ford Consul 2500 L and a full three seconds slower to 60 mph than the Ford which managed the standing start test in just 10.4 seconds. The 2200 also fell slightly behind the Fiat 132GLS 1800 in these comparisons. At the same time its overall fuel consumption at 20.7 mpg was usefully superior to the Ford's 18.1 mpg. The lighter Fiat was more frugal with fuel than either of the other two.

50|$|These {{fees are}} {{set by the}} credit card networks, and are the largest {{component}} of the various fees that most merchants pay {{for the privilege of}} accepting credit cards, representing 70% to 90% of these fees by some estimates, although larger merchants typically pay less as a percentage. Interchange fees have a complex pricing structure, which is based on the card brand, regions or jurisdictions, the type of credit or debit card, the type and size of the accepting merchant, and the type of transaction (e.g. online, in-store, phone order, whether the card is present for the transaction, etc.). Further complicating the rate schedules, interchange fees are typically a flat fee plus a percentage of the total purchase <b>price</b> (<b>including</b> <b>taxes).</b> In the United States, the fee averages approximately 2% of transaction value. In the EU, interchange fees are capped to 0.3% of the transaction for credit cards and to 0.2% for debit cards.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to outline an {{analytical}} framework which captures the ample scope of locational competition: cost differences, resulting from differences in factor <b>prices</b> <b>including</b> <b>taxes,</b> human capital, infrastructure services and total factor productivity. If cost differences are small, locational competition controls excessive government power. We have modeled locational competition by assuming that governments have a vital interest to keep mobile factors of production at home. We represent this aspect by restricting the usage of environmental instruments such that they will at most exhaust the cost difference to a competing foreign firm. If cost differences are large enough there is no binding restriction for the cost-benefit calculus of a national environmental policy. The tax will be below marginal damage due to strategic reasons of rent shifting. If small international cost differences do not allow taxation in accordance with marginal damage considerations, then locational competition restricts {{the size of the}} tax rate such that the firm is indifferent in relocating or staying at home. If no cost differences exist, it is even possible that both governments will subsidize the pollution intensive input {{in order to make the}} domestic location attractive...|$|R

40|$|By 2015, global oil {{consumption}} will reach 90 {{million barrels per}} day (U. S. DOE, 2013, Table A 5). In part, this high level of consumption reflects the fact that many countries provide subsidies for gasoline and diesel. This paper examines global fuel sub-sidies using the latest available data from the World Bank, finding that road-sector subsidies for gasoline and diesel totaled $ 110 billion in 2012. Pricing fuels below cost is inefficient because it leads to over-consumption. Under baseline assumptions about supply and demand elasticities, the total annual deadweight loss worldwide is $ 44 billion. Incorporating external costs in-creases the economic costs substantially. I. Fuel Prices Figure 1 plots road-sector gasoline con-sumption per capita and gasoline prices for 128 countries. A plot of diesel consump-tion and prices is available in the online appendix. Prices are domestic consumer <b>prices</b> <b>including</b> <b>taxes</b> and come from a sur-vey administered November 2012. The size of the circles is proportional to country pop-ulation. The figure reveals an enormous amount of variation in gasoline prices. Gasoline prices average $ 5. 26 per gallon, but range from $. 09 per gallon in Venezuela to above $ 9. 00 in Turkey and Norway. Diesel prices tend to be a bit lower, averaging $ 4. 12 per gallon, with a range from $. 04 to above $ 7. 00. This wide variation in prices is somewhat sur-prising because crude oil and refined prod-ucts are widely traded internationally, s...|$|R
50|$|On its {{launch in}} 1959 the British Motor Corporation's Mini car was {{sold at a}} {{starting}} <b>price</b> (<b>including</b> <b>taxes)</b> of £496 for its most basic model, and {{it was estimated that}} BMC lost £30 per car sold at this price. However the headline-grabbing price was significantly lower than that of the car's contemporary rival, the Ford Anglia - indeed the only cheaper four-wheeled, four-seater car on the British car market at the time was very basic and old-fashioned Ford Popular, which sold for only £2 less than the basic Mini. While BMC lost money on every basic Mini sold, such cars were unattractive to many buyers since they lacked features such as heaters, floor carpets and opening rear windows and BMC priced the better-equipped models (which cost from £537) to make a small profit, using the basic car as a loss-leader to allow the promotion of a starting price below the significant £500 mark and to make the Mini at least appear to undercut its main rival on price. The ploy did not work entirely as BMC intended - even in its most basic form the Mini was far superior in many areas to its rivals while also being lower in price. BMC sold far more basic Minis than it had anticipated, meaning that it sold many Minis at a significant loss. Despite the car being a bestseller in Britain (and several other markets) it made little to no profit for many years.|$|R
