5|$|Alabama was a {{strongly}} Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the Democratic-Republican and Democratic parties. It had two Republican governors following Reconstruction, {{but after the}} Democratic Party re-established control, 112 years <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> voters chose another Republican.|$|E

5|$|Florida was a {{strongly}} Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the Democratic and Whig parties. It elected three Republican governors following Reconstruction, {{but after the}} Democratic Party re-established control, 90 years <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> voters chose another Republican.|$|E

5|$|In April 1804, President Jefferson {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} Preble's squadron. President, Congress, Constellation, and Essex prepared to sail {{as soon as}} possible under the direction of Commodore Samuel Barron. Barron selected President as his flagship, but she required a new bowsprit and repairs to her masts and rigging. Some two months <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> the squadron was ready to sail. They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12August.|$|E
5|$|A {{sound film}} is a motion picture with {{synchronized}} sound, or sound technologically coupled to image, {{as opposed to a}} silent film. The first known public exhibition of projected sound films took place in Paris in 1900, but decades <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> sound motion pictures were made commercially practical. Reliable synchronization was difficult to achieve with the early sound-on-disc systems, and amplification and recording quality were also inadequate. Innovations in sound-on-film led to the first commercial screening of short motion pictures using the technology, which took place in 1923.|$|E
5|$|A {{whole week}} <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> Grace reappeared, again at Lord's, on Monday, 3 June. He played seven matches in June, all first-class, {{starting}} with MCC v Derbyshire. This was a three-day match completed on the Tuesday with MCC winning by 5 wickets. Derbyshire won the toss, elected to bat and Grace proceeded to bowl {{them out for}} a mere 36. His figures were 8–23. Derbyshire then bowled MCC out for 74, Grace scoring 7. Grace took 2 more wickets in Derbyshire's second innings of 118 to give him his second 10-wicket match of the season. He scored 37 in the second innings as MCC made 81–5 to take the match.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} after its discovery, the {{evolutionary}} origins of Triceratops remained largely obscure. In 1922, the newly discovered Protoceratops was seen as its ancestor by Henry Fairfield Osborn, but many decades <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> additional findings came to light. Recent years have been fruitful for the discovery of several dinosaurs related to ancestors of Triceratops. Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, was described in the late 1990s, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, in 2005.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|Neptune has 14 known moons, {{which are}} named for minor water deities in Greek mythology. By {{far the largest}} of them is Triton, {{discovered}} by William Lassell on October 10, 1846, just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself; over a century <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> {{the discovery of the}} second natural satellite, Nereid. Neptune's Neso, which has an orbital period of about 26 Julian years, orbits further from its planet than any other moon in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|On November 7, 1862, Maj. Gen. McClellan {{was removed}} from command of the Army of the Potomac and {{replaced}} with Maj. Gen. Burnside. Over the course of November, Burnside moved the army south to Falmouth, Virginia, opposite the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg. The 21st arrived in Falmouth on November 19. Nearly a month <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> Burnside could organize a crossing {{of the river and}} an assault on the city and the heights beyond. The Battle of Fredericksburg took place on December 13, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Our Friends in the North {{helped to}} {{establish}} the careers of its four lead actors, Daniel Craig, Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong. Daniel Craig's part in particular {{has been referred to}} as his breakthrough role. It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> it was adapted from a play, performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, to a television drama, {{due in part to the}} BBC's fear of litigation.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> he performed with them again.|$|E

5|$|Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area, but {{the initial}} {{operations}} in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction to Task One, the seizure of {{the southern part of}} the Solomon Islands, was more violent than anticipated and some months <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track campaign, Battle of Milne Bay, Battle of Buna–Gona, the Battle of Wau and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.|$|E
5|$|Six years <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> {{the couple}} {{returned}} to screen writing, {{this time for}} the romantic comedy Murphy's Romance, based on a novel by Max Schott. Once again they worked with director Martin Ritt, their seventh project together, and Sally Field, who had played the titular lead role in Norma Rae. Despite Murphy's Romance being well-received (it was nominated for two Academy Awards) {{it would be another}} five years before Frank and Ravetch wrote another screenplay; hired by Martin Ritt, the couple wrote the screenplay for Stanley & Iris, loosely based on the novel Union Street.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} some critical acclaim, but achieved no commercial success, and Columbia Records ended their contract with Blue Öyster Cult {{at the completion}} of the Imaginos Tour. Albert Bouchard, excluded from the recording progress of Imaginos after the initial rejection from Columbia Records, then took legal action against the band and the label to protect his rights as author and producer on the album. Blue Öyster Cult continued to perform and remained a live attraction, but ten years <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> they released an album of new songs.|$|E

The fleet did not make a stop, but <b>passing</b> <b>before</b> Mogadishu, the anonymous diarist of the expedition noted that it was a large city with houses of four or five storeys high and big palaces in its center and many mosques with cylindrical minarets.|$|R
5|$|The first {{subatomic}} particles to be formed included protons, neutrons, and electrons. Though simple atomic nuclei formed {{within the first}} three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> the first electrically neutral atoms formed. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or during supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Worlebury Camp {{has been}} {{explored}} {{at various times}} {{over a period of}} 150 years. From 1851 to 1852, Charles Dymond, Edwin Martin Atkins, and Francis Warre excavated and surveyed Worlebury Camp. Dymond returned in 1880 to continue the excavation, which lasted until 1881. Another century <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> the Woodspring Museum from Weston-super-Mare excavated more of Worlebury camp in 1987 to 1988. Finally, in 1998, the Avon Extensive Urban Study team performed the latest (as of 2008) assessment of the site.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged {{along by the}} medium, so that the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century <b>passed</b> <b>before</b> a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E
