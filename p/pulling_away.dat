5|$|During the {{engagement}} between Streatham and Caroline, Lord Keith and Europe had fired sporadically at the French ship with little effect. <b>Pulling</b> <b>away</b> from his surrendered opponent, FÃ©retier then fired on Lord Keith, whose captain, Peter Campbell, realised that his ship stood no chance against the frigate and turned eastward, running before {{the wind to}} escape despite suffering severe damage to Lord Keith rigging as he did so. William Gelston, captain of Europe, also attempted to flee, but his battered ship was in no condition to outrun the virtually untouched frigate, and he surrendered at 10:00. Lord Keith eventually arrived safely at Penang on 9 June. Casualties on the British ships were six killed and at least four wounded, while the French lost one killed and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at {{position}} 22 and thereafter declined. The track was promoted by a music video, which {{was directed by}} Marco Brambilla. The video features a long take of the camera <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> from West. The video received positive reviews from critics and received two nominations for MTV Video Music Awards. West performed the song on Saturday Night Live, at the 2010 BET Awards, at the 2011 Coachella Music Festival, and his Watch the Throne Tour. When performing the song, West often wore clothes made from red leather. A remix of the track featuring rapper Jay-Z was released on August 20, 2010, {{as a part of}} West's weekly GOOD Fridays series.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the day {{the chase}} continued, the British frigates gaining slowly on their quarry and as {{darkness}} fell Pique closed with the larger French ship. At 23:00 Milne {{was close enough to}} open fire on Seine, to which Bigot responded without reducing speed. For the next {{two and a half hours}} the frigates exchanged broadsides at full speed as the French coastline rapidly approached ahead. At 01:35 a shot from Seine struck the main topmast on Pique, bringing it crashing down. The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back, Seine <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> from the smaller ship but unable to escape Jason which was steadily gaining.|$|E

5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after {{driving on the}} outside lane. Vickers followed Johnson on the inside line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around the outside for the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars driving on the outside lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> {{from the rest of}} the field. Kurt Busch, with help from Vickers, got ahead of Kyle Busch to move into first place.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to find ways to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, {{even before}} the British column began to form up for the march to Fort Edward, the Indians renewed attacks on the largely defenceless British. At 5 am, Indians entered huts in the fort housing wounded British who were {{supposed}} to be under the care of French doctors, and killed and scalped them. Monro complained that the terms of capitulation had been violated, but his contingent was forced to surrender some of its baggage {{in order to be able}} even to begin the march. As they marched off, they were harassed by the swarming Indians, who snatched at them, grabbing for weapons and clothing, and <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> with force those that resisted their actions, including many of the women, children, servants and slaves. As the last of the men left the encampment, a war whoop sounded, and a contingent of Abenaki warriors seized several men at the rear of the column.|$|E

5|$|The next storm formed well to {{the east}} of the Lesser Antilles on September 3 and moved westward, {{attaining}} tropical storm status about a day later. The storm slowed and curved toward the southwest, nearing the northern coast of Colombia before <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> from land and strengthening into a hurricane. It further intensified to Category 2 status before striking Nicaragua on September 10. Quickly weakening to a tropical storm, the cyclone continued westward across Central America and briefly entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. It dissipated shortly thereafter. In the town of Corinto, a report indicated the deaths of 10 people and 50 additional injuries. About 250 houses were destroyed, leaving approximately $2 million (1911 USD, $ 2014 USD) in damage. Data on this storm is extremely scarce; as such, only minor revisions could be made to its chronology in the hurricane database.|$|E

Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers with curiosity. For the song's refrain, Oh Land rides an all-terrain vehicle, before the video concludes with {{a large group of}} children joining the women for a final dance.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the season the NHL's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired resulting in a lockout. The season was threatened with cancellation before the lockout ended, ultimately the length of the labor dispute resulted in the reduction of games from the standard 82 to a shortened 48. Cory Schneider entered the season as the team's new starting goaltender, while the Canucks attempted to trade incumbent Roberto Luongo. The two goaltenders battled for playing time early in the season resulting in a goaltender controversy. After a six-game winning streak to start February the Canucks dealt with multiple injuries and suspensions resulting in the team slumping. In late March Schneider captured the starters job starting seven consecutive games helping the team to a second six-game winning streak. Vancouver dueled the Minnesota Wild in the standings before <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> in April and winning the division. Led by Henrik and Daniel Sedin the Canucks' power play struggled dropping from fourth the previous season to twenty-third, with the Sedin twins' point production declining. Derek Roy was brought in through a trade to help deal with injuries at centre in the team's only trade of the year. Schneider was injured late in the season and missed the first two games of the playoffs. Vancouver lost the fourth game of their playoff series on a controversial call on Daniel Sedin.|$|E

5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso was <b>pulling</b> <b>away</b> at the front, setting fastest laps on laps {{seven and}} fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica {{was the first}} man to pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} traction control problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy, with RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen being the first front runner to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E

25|$|William S. Burroughs (19141997) was {{the writer}} who finally brought science fiction {{together}} with the trends of postmodern literature.
