5|$|Davis had {{poor health}} {{for most of}} his life, {{including}} repeated bouts of malaria, battle wounds from fighting in the Mexican–American War and a chronic eye infection that made bright light <b>painful.</b> He also had trigeminal neuralgia, a nerve disorder that causes severe pain in the face; it has been called one of the most <b>painful</b> known ailments.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with <b>painful</b> symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several <b>painful</b> clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Some {{diagnostic}} procedures, such as {{lumbar puncture}} (see post-dural-puncture headache), venipuncture, paracentesis, and thoracentesis can be <b>painful.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tumors cause pain by {{crushing}} or infiltrating tissue, triggering {{infection or}} inflammation, or releasing chemicals that make normally non-painful stimuli <b>painful.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be <b>painful</b> and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{treatment}} for cervical or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient urinary {{symptoms such as}} urinary retention, urinary incontinence or <b>painful</b> urination (dysuria).|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 76, Moses had {{developed}} arthritis, which made embroidery <b>painful.</b> Her sister Celestia suggested that painting would be easier for her, and this idea spurred Moses's painting career in her late 70s. When her right hand began to hurt, she switched to her left hand.|$|E
5|$|Fire ants, Solenopsis spp., {{are unique}} {{in having a}} venom sac {{containing}} piperidine alkaloids. Their stings are <b>painful</b> and can be dangerous to hypersensitive people.|$|E
5|$|Miles' body also {{possesses}} a strong resistance to injury. During an altercation with the Roxxon mercenary Taskmaster, Miles is thrown through {{a brick wall}} without any apparent serious injury, though the experience is <b>painful</b> for him.|$|E
5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{feeds on}} plankton. The tentacles of the dactylzooids are {{normally}} extended all the time. If an object is waved about above the coral, {{it will cause}} the tentacles to retract and then the coral can be handled without experiencing the <b>painful</b> stings caused by the cnidocytes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or <b>painful</b> swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely <b>painful.</b> Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms in PID {{range from}} none to severe. If there are symptoms, then fever, {{cervical}} motion tenderness, lower abdominal pain, new or different discharge, <b>painful</b> intercourse, uterine tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or irregular menstruation may be noted.|$|E
5|$|The entire Lackawanna {{region is}} idle. Week before last this region sent nearly 150,000 tons of coal to market. Last week {{it did not}} send any... The {{situation}} here is absolutely <b>painful,</b> {{and there is no}} knowing what moment an outbreak will occur.|$|E
5|$|This in turn {{blocks the}} flow of fluids in the eye, leading to a <b>painful</b> {{increase}} in intra-ocular pressure (glaucoma) and often irreparable optic nerve damage, leading to visual field loss and eventual blindness.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be <b>painful.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{first it}} always bothers you {{even though you}} say it doesn't. But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with what you have. At first it was <b>painful</b> to watch all those things but now I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, Bryant, who had {{generally}} abstained {{from alcohol}} earlier in life, {{was suffering from}} <b>painful</b> and incurable adiposis dolorosa (Dercum's disease) and was drinking heavily. Bullitt, citing his wife's drinking and alleging that {{she was involved in}} a lesbian relationship with Gwen Le Gallienne, a stepdaughter of writer Richard Le Gallienne, divorced Bryant in 1930 and won sole custody of Anne. Bryant remained in Paris, occasionally advising writer Claude McKay, and briefly assisting researchers from Harvard University in preserving Reed's papers.|$|E
5|$|Camino, a 2008 Spanish film {{directed}} by Javier Fesser, allegedly {{based on the}} real story of Alexia González-Barros, a girl who died from spinal cancer at fourteen in 1985 and awaits canonization. Fesser portrays the Opus Dei in a negative way, depicting it as an extreme cult destroying families, suggesting that Opus Dei manipulated the tragedy of the young Camino's <b>painful</b> death for its own ends.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is <b>painful</b> and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|For the {{transformed}} children's safety - {{and also}} because it is <b>painful</b> for their parents {{to see what they}} had become - they are segregated on a continent of their own. No more human children are born, and many parents die or commit suicide. The members of New Athens destroy themselves with a nuclear bomb.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training <b>painful</b> as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|Freya {{explains}} how {{she came to}} inhabit Chi's body. She reveals that she and Chi merely switched places inside the body, but Chi has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her. Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes to the conclusion that while life with Hideki may seem <b>painful</b> because of her limitations, it is even more <b>painful</b> without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray will defend itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely <b>painful,</b> but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, Ewing {{suffered}} {{an attack of}} rheumatism, and received treatment several times thereafter, often being confined to his chair. He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge's madness in Kentucky. He was made a brevet major general on March 13, 1865. After leaving the Army, he experienced <b>painful</b> attacks {{for the rest of}} his life, often bedridden for periods of up to forty days.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps {{is found}} in hot hilly areas and woodland, nesting {{underground}} in mounds. The ant's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey, which are fed to the carnivorous larvae. Spiders are known to eat these ants, and echidnas consume the larvae and pupae. Like other Myrmecia species, M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and <b>painful</b> sting, and the venom is capable of inducing allergic reactions in sensitive people.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 2007, Kelly Johnson died of spinal cancer, {{after six}} years of <b>painful</b> therapy and {{treatment}} of her illness. At Kelly’s memorial, Tracey Lamb read the eulogy she had written for her. The band performed a tribute gig on 20 August 2007 at the Soho Revue Bar in London, with many of Johnson’s friends and former Girlschool’s members and a concert for Cancer Research UK at Rock of Ages Fest in Tamworth on 8 September 2007.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a <b>painful</b> swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce <b>painful</b> conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
5|$|<b>Painful</b> {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{prominent}} in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island, the stingray serves as a fascination and <b>painful</b> natural encounter for many beach goers. Small stingrays inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath {{a thin layer of}} sand. Stingrays are a type of demersal, cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a stingray injury, where the stingray punctures the human with its poisonous barb. While these injuries are extremely <b>painful,</b> they are not usually life-threatening {{as long as they are}} properly attended to by a medical professional. One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for stingray injuries.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a <b>painful</b> headache.|$|E
5|$|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a {{very large}} and {{dangerous}} type of DVT. It is characterized by an acute and almost total venous occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the iliac and femoral veins. The leg is usually <b>painful,</b> tinged blue in color, and swollen, which may result in venous gangrene.|$|E
5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as herpes zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a <b>painful</b> skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left or right of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a <b>painful</b> swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, {{given that}} females can inflict a <b>painful</b> sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran {{flies in the}} families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely <b>painful,</b> is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
