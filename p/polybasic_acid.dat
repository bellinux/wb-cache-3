The popularity of alkyd resins in surface coating industry {{throughout the world}} is due to cost effectiveness and versatility. Synthesis process of alkyd resins needs basically three different types of chemical constituents. One type of constituent is polyol with hydroxyl functionality greater than 2 and second constituent is <b>polybasic</b> <b>acid</b> or acid anhydride. Usually most of conventional alkyd recipes contain glycerol and pthalic anhydride.

40|$|RATIONALE: Alkyd resins are {{synthetic}} polyesters used as {{paints and}} coatings. Current approaches for their analysis {{do not allow}} the characterization of pentaerythritol and phthalic acid esters, whose detection is interesting to fully characterize the materials, e. g. for forensic or cultural heritage applications. METHODS: A combined analytical approach based on Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), HighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) /MS and flow injection analysis (FIA) /MS was adopted. GC/MS was used to characterize the fatty acid profile and the <b>polybasic</b> <b>acids</b> in extracts from industrial alkyd resins. HPLC/MS and FIA/MS {{were used for the}} characterization of the triglyceride profile of the oil used to manufacture the resin and for the identification of reaction products deriving from the synthesis process. RESULTS: The multi-analytical approach was applied on two different industrial alkyd resins produced from two different oils. The GC/MS analysis was successful in characterizing the fatty acid profile and the aromatic fraction of the resin. The HPLC/MS analysis allowed us to characterize the pentaerythritol and phthalic acid ester and the triglycerides residues from the synthesis process, by studying their high-resolution tandem mass spectra. CONCLUSIONS: The application of liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to the study of industrial alkyd resins allowed us to characterize {{for the first time the}} esters formed by the transesterification reactions involving pentaerythritol, phthalic acid and triglycerides.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to tune acidity/basicity in non-aqueous and low-water media by using a class of ionic liquids (ILs) with buffering characteristics, which was readily synthesized by the reaction of 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hydroxide ([RMIM] OH) base moieties with a serials of binary or <b>polybasic</b> <b>acids</b> and defined as ionic liquid-buffers (IL-buffers). We have performed controlled experiments of hydrogenation of olefins and trans-cinnamaldehyde, catalyzed by [RuCl 2 (PPh 3) (3) ] in non-aqueous media such as DMF and ILs {{in the presence of}} IL-buffers. Remarkable buffer dependence of the formation and catalytic behavior of ruthenium hydrides were evidenced by the kinetic studies and NMR measurements. The hydride [RuHCl(PPh 3) (3) ], being favorably formed {{in the presence of the}} IL-buffer with lower log(10) ([Base]/[Acid]), exhibited higher activity in the reduction of the C=C bond against the carbonyl functionality of trans-cinnamaldehyde. While the hydride [RuH 4 (PPh 3) (3) ], being preponderantly formed in the presence of the IL-buffer with higher log 10 ([Base]/[Acid]) showed activity and higher selectivity towards the C=C reduction. Consequently, the hydrogenation performance of olefins and trans-cinnamaldehyde in non-aqueous system could be adjusted by adding the different IL-buffers. It is envisioned that the ability of IL-buffers to alter and precisely control the catalytic active species in non-aqueous or low-water systems might find appreciable applications for both fundamental studies and syntheses where the reactions are acid/base-sensitive.

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the relationships between}} buffering properties and acid erosion and hence improve models of erosive potential of acidic drinks, a pH-stat {{was used to measure}} the rate of enamel dissolution in solutions of citric, malic and lactic acids, with pH 2. 4 - 3. 6 and with acid concentrations adjusted to give buffer capacities (β) of 2 - 40 (mmol·l(- 1)) ·pH(- 1) for each pH. The corresponding undissociated acid concentrations, [HA], and titratable acidity to pH 5. 5 (TA 5. 5) were calculated. In relation to β, the dissolution rate and the strength of response to β varied with acid type (lactic > malic ≥ citric) and decreased as pH increased. The patterns of variation of the dissolution rate with TA 5. 5 were qualitatively similar to those for β, except that increasing pH above 2. 8 had less effect on dissolution in citric and malic acids and none on dissolution in lactic acid. Variations of the dissolution rate with [HA] showed no systematic dependence on acid type but some dependence on pH. The results suggest that [HA], rather than buffering per se, is a major rate-controlling factor, probably owing to the importance of undissociated acid as a readily diffusible source of H(+) ions in maintaining near-surface dissolution within the softened layer of enamel. TA 5. 5 was more closely correlated with [HA] than was β, and seems to be the preferred practical measure of buffering. The relationship between [HA] and TA 5. 5 differs between mono- and <b>polybasic</b> <b>acids,</b> so a separate analysis of products according to predominant acid type could improve multivariate models of erosive potential...|$|R

30|$|In {{preparation}} of Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, when large alumina particles are impregnated {{with a solution}} of hexachloroplatinic acid (CPA, H 2 PtCl 6) alone, usually an “egg-shell” profile is achieved because CPA adsorption is so rapid that the diffusion of the solute into the pores controls the rate. By introducing a competitor adsorbate, the platinum tends to penetrate deeper into {{the interior of the}} support. Competitors compete with metal ions for being adsorbed on the support surface by adsorption on active sites first and then driving the metal ions to the subsurface layers [19]. Two kinds of competitive adsorbate have been reported. When using a limited amount of <b>polybasic</b> organic <b>acid,</b> i.e., citric or tartaric acid as a competitive agent, a catalyst with an “egg-white” or “egg-yolk” type distribution may be achieved. On the other hand, when acetic, chloro-acetic, nitric, or hydrochloric acid is used, the platinum does not distribute in an “egg-white” or “egg-yolk” type, but tends to form an uniform or broadened “egg-shell” type distribution. The competitor ion, Cl−, influences the acid property, dispersity, and agglomeration of Pt and the interaction between metal and support.

We studied the pathogenicity of four human and nine avian H 5 N 1 / 04 influenza viruses in ferrets (an excellent model for influenza studies). All four human isolates were fatal to intranasally inoculated ferrets. The human isolate A/Vietnam/ 1203 / 04 (H 5 N 1) was the most pathogenic isolate; the severity of disease {{was associated with a}} broad tissue tropism and high virus titers in multiple organs, including the brain. High fever, weight loss, anorexia, extreme lethargy, and diarrhea were observed. Two avian H 5 N 1 / 04 isolates were as pathogenic as the human viruses, causing lethal systemic infections in ferrets. Seven of nine H 5 N 1 / 04 viruses isolated from avian species caused mild infections, with virus replication restricted to the upper respiratory tract. All chicken isolates were nonlethal to ferrets. A sequence analysis revealed <b>polybasic</b> amino <b>acids</b> in the hemagglutinin connecting peptides of all H 5 N 1 / 04 viruses, indicating that multiple molecular differences in other genes are important for a high level of virulence.

40|$|Abstract Background Indonesia {{is one of}} the {{countries}} most severely affected by H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus in terms of poultry and human health. However, there is little information on the diversity of H 5 N 1 viruses circulating in backyard farms, where chickens and ducks often intermingle. In this study, H 5 N 1 virus infection occurring in 96 smallholder duck farms in central Java, Indonesia from 2007 - 2008 was investigated and the molecular and antigenic characteristics of H 5 N 1 viruses isolated from these farms were analysed. Results All 84 characterised viruses belonged to H 5 N 1 clade 2. 1 with three virus sublineages being identified: clade 2. 1. 1 (1), clade 2. 1. 3 (80), and IDN/ 6 / 05 -like viruses (3) that did not belong to any of the present clades. All three clades were found in ducks, while only clade 2. 1. 3 was isolated from chickens. There were no significant amino acid mutations of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sites of the viruses, including the receptor binding, glycosylation, antigenic and catalytic sites and NA inhibitor targets. All the viruses had <b>polybasic</b> amino <b>acids</b> at the HA cleavage site. No evidence of major antigenic variants was detected. Based on the HA gene, identical virus variants could be found on different farms across the study sites and multiple genetic variants could be isolated from HPAI outbreaks simultaneously or at different time points from single farms. HPAI virus was isolated from both ducks and chickens; however, the proportion of surviving duck cases was considerably higher than in chickens. Conclusions The 2. 1. 3 clade was the most common lineage found in this study. All the viruses had sequence characteristic of HPAI, but negligible variations in other recognized amino acids at the HA and NA proteins which determine virus phenotypes. Multiple genetic variants appeared to be circulating simultaneously within poultry communities. The high proportion of live duck cases compared to chickens over the study period suggests that ducks are more likely to survive infection and they may better suit the role of long-term maintenance host for H 5 N 1. As some viruses were isolated from dead birds, there was no clear correlation between genetic variations and pathogenicity of these viruses. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a novel method for the rapid identification of complex organic materials, including macromolecules, that involves a high temperature simultaneous hydrolysis and derivatisation reaction. In this procedure, aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxides are made to react {{with a wide range of}} complex molecular species, including synthetic and natural polymers, under high temperature flash heating conditions. The hydrolysis products are converted to derivatives, such as alkyl esters or alkyl ethers. The reaction forms the basis for a modified pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py-GC) identification technique. Although the process is primarily intended for the rapid identification of polymers which are susceptible to hydrolysis, it is also valuable for characterisation of a variety of hydrolysable lower molecular weight species, such as polymer additives, triglycerides and natural waxes. The reaction takes place when an intimate mixture of an aqueous quaternary alkylammonium hydroxide solution is flash heated with the analyte in a conventional pyrolysis unit, and "on-line" GC-MS is used to separate and identify the reaction products. Analytes included synthetic polyester resins and phenolic polymers, natural products such as lipids and wood extractives, and natural polymers including lignocellulose, proteins and kerogen. Reaction variables, such as temperature, pH analyte particle size, substrate, and the derivatising reagent were studied, in order to find the optimum conditions for the reaction. While the reaction occurs at temperatures as low as 358 degrees celsius, a 770 degrees celsius reaction temperature was adopted to allow direct comparison with Py-GC data. A high pH of the derivatising reagent was found to be necessary to achieve an efficient hydrolysis of the macromolecule. Small particle size gives better conversion to derivatised ++products. The nature of the heating substrate did not appear to influence the reaction. Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides (TAAH) were found to be the most effective derivatising reagents for the reaction. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was the most useful derivatising reagent, since the methyl derivatives of the hydrolysed products were conveniently chromatographed and usually had well known mass spectra. Other TA-AHs were useful for (i) producing higher molecular weight alkyl derivatives of low molecular weight side chains in some polymers, e. g., acetate groups in polyvinyl acetate, (ii) the purpose of determining sites of pre-existing methylation in natural products such as lignocellulose, or (iii) cases where methylation products could be confused with existing pyrolysis products. The reaction mechanism is believed to involve hydrolysis of the organic material, formation of the tetra-alkylammonium salt, and thermal degradation of the quaternary ammonium salt to alkylated derivatives. Some evidence is presented to support this mechanism, which is considered to be ionic in character, rather than a free radical reaction. A detailed study of the reaction of alkyd resins indicated that polyhydric alcohols, <b>polybasic</b> <b>acids,</b> degree of cure, oil length, and rosin acid and epoxy modification could be determined. The reaction of rosin modified phenolic resins (tert-butyl phenol formaldehyde and para-nonyl phenol formaldehyde), gave rosin acid methyl esters and easily identifiable products from the synthetic components. Fatty acid methyl esters could be obtained directly from lipids, such as vegetable oils, without time consuming preparative steps. The problems of base catalysed isomerisation of the double bonds in polyunsaturated fatty acids were overcome by reducing the amount of base used for the reaction. The reaction facilitated the identification of fatty acids in ++woolwax, the triglycerides in cosmetic products, and lipids in trace quantities of human fingerprint deposits. A more reliable representation of the chemical structure of lignocellulose in softwood and hardwood species was obtained by the reaction, as compared to conventional PyGC which underestimates the aromatic carboxylic acid moieties. Gymnosperm or angiosperm origin was indicated by the presence of solely guaiacyl, or both guaiacyl and syringyl derived groups, respectively. Other extraneous extractable material was identified simultaneously, including aliphatic and aromatic acids, which would not normally be detected by conventional Py-GC. An alternative method involved extracting the wood with TMAH, followed by pyrolysis of the extract, to give less complex but more specific GC profiles. The TMAH extraction procedure also indicated some characteristic biomarker species as well as guaiacyl and syringyl derived compounds. The pyrolysis of tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAH) extracts revealed the sites of pre-existing methylation in the Eucalyptus marginata species. The thermally assisted hydrolysis and alkylation method which has been developed is usually superior to the conventional Py-GC procedure for those polymers which are prone to hydrolysis, since it results in products which are more readily related to the polymer structure. For example, concerted hydrolysis and alkylation of polyester resins results in alkyl carboxylate esters and the alkyl ethers, whereas in conventional Py-GC the products are alkenes and carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids are more difficult to chromatograph by GC, and aromatic carboxylic acids in particular are susceptible to decarboxylation under the pyrolysis conditions. The reaction procedure has provided an alternative approach to the characterisation of submicrogram quantities of a range of synthetic polymers, natural products and ++natural polymers, which has not previously been possible without lengthy chemical degradation procedures. Although it has not displaced the conventional Py-GC technique, it has given a new dimension to the characterisation of organic materials, providing a powerful tool for forensic science investigations and the analysis of complex materials...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to overestimate the importance of nucleoside triphosphates in cellular chemistry: They are the building blocks for DNA and RNA and important sources of energy. Modifications of biologically important organic molecules with fluorine are {{of great interest to}} chemists and biologists because the size and electronegativity of the fluorine atom {{can be used to make}} defined structural alterations to biologically important molecules. Although the concept of nonhydrolyzable nucleotides has been around for some time, the progress in the area of modified triphosphates was limited by the lack of synthetic methods allowing to access bisCF 2 -substituted nucleotide analogs—one of the most interesting classes of nonhydrolyzable nucleotides. These compounds have “correct” polarity and the smallest possible steric perturbation compared to natural nucleotides. No other known nucleotides have these advantages, making bisCF 2 -substituted analogs unique. Herein, we report a concise route for the preparation of hitherto unknown highly acidic and <b>polybasic</b> bis(difluoromethylene) triphosphoric <b>acid</b> 1 using a phosphorous(III) /phosphorous(V) interconversion approach. The analog 1 compared to triphosphoric acid is enzymatically nonhydrolyzable due to substitution of two bridging oxygen atoms with CF 2 groups, maintaining minimal perturbations in steric bulkiness and overall polarity of the triphosphate polyanion. The fluorinated triphosphoric acid 1 was used for the preparation of the corresponding fluorinated deoxynucleotides (dNTPs). One of these dNTP analogs (dT) was demonstrated to fit into DNA polymerase beta (DNA pol β) binding pocket by obtaining a 2. 5  Å resolution crystal structure of a ternary complex with the enzyme. Unexpected dominating effect of triphosphate/Mg 2 + interaction over Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding was found and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The polysialyltransferases ST 8 Sia II and ST 8 Sia IV polysialylate the glycans {{of a small}} {{subset of}} {{mammalian}} proteins. Their most abundant substrate is the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). An acidic surface patch and a novel α-helix in the first fibronectin type III repeat of NCAM are required for the polysialylation of N-glycans on the adjacent immunoglobulin domain. Inspection of ST 8 Sia IV sequences revealed two conserved polybasic regions that might interact with the NCAM acidic patch or the growing polysialic acid chain. One is the previously identified polysialyltransferase domain (Nakata, D., Zhang, L., and Troy, F. A. (2006) Glycoconj. J. 23, 423 – 436). The second is a 35 -amino <b>acid</b> <b>polybasic</b> region that contains seven basic residues and is equidistant from the large sialyl motif in both polysialyltransferases. We replaced these basic residues to evaluate their role in enzyme autopolysialylation and NCAM-specific polysialylation. We found that replacement of Arg 276 /Arg 277 or Arg 265 in the polysialyltransferase domain of ST 8 Sia IV decreased both NCAM polysialylation and autopolysialylation in parallel, suggesting that these residues are important for catalytic activity. In contrast, replacing Arg 82 /Arg 93 in ST 8 Sia IV with alanine substantially decreased NCAM-specific polysialylation while only partially impacting autopolysialylation, suggesting that these residues may be particularly important for NCAM polysialylation. Two conserved negatively charged residues, Glu 92 and Asp 94, surround Arg 93. Replacement of these residues with alanine largely inactivated ST 8 Sia IV, whereas reversing these residues enhanced enzyme autopolysialylation but significantly reduced NCAM polysialylation. In sum, we have identified selected amino acids in this conserved polysialyltransferase polybasic region that are critical for the protein-specific polysialylation of NCAM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{transmission}} of avian H 5 N 1 influenza viruses to 18 humans in Hong Kong in 1997 with six deaths established that avian influenza viruses can transmit to and cause lethal infection in humans. This report characterizes the antigenic and biological {{properties of the}} H 5 N 1 influenza viruses isolated from chickens, ducks, and geese from farms and poultry markets in Hong Kong during 1997 and compares them with those of virus isolated from the index human case. Each of the H 5 N 1 viruses from Hong Kong poultry markets that were tested were lethal in chickens, possessed <b>polybasic</b> amino <b>acids</b> at the carboxy-terminus of HA 1, and by definition were highly pathogenic in poultry. The available nonpathogenic H 5 influenza viruses and the pathogenic H 5 N 1 virus from Hong Kong were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies prepared to A/chicken/Pennsylvania/ 1370 / 83 (H 5 N 2). The analysis revealed limited antigenic drift in 15 years and established that monoclonal antibodies are useful reagents for identification and antigenic analysis of avian strains that may transmit to humans in the future. One of the monoclonal antibodies permitted separation of the H 5 N 1 influenza viruses from poultry into two groups that correlated with {{the presence or absence}} of a carbohydrate at residue 158 adjacent to the receptor binding site on HA. The H 5 N 1 viruses examined replicated in geese, pigs, rats, and mice, but to only a very limited extent in ducks. It is noteworthy that all infected geese shed virus and that the H 5 N 1 viruses caused disease signs and death in a portion (3 of 16) of the geese, with evidence of systemic spread to the brain. The tropism for geese is unusual and may provide insight into the origin of these viruses. In mice, the H 5 N 1 virus caused lethal pneumonia and spread systemically to the brain. Mice would thus provide an ideal model system for studying immune responses and pathogenesis. Transmission experiments in chickens revealed that the H 5 N 1 viruses are spread by fecal–oral transmission rather than by aerosol, and that the viruses are inactivated by drying of feces at ambient temperature. However, infectivity is maintained for at least 4 days in wet feces at 25 °C. There were differences in the morphology of the H 5 N 1 viruses isolated from birds and humans. The perpetuation of H 5 N 1 influenza viruses in the poultry markets in Hong Kong and the {{transmission of}} these viruses to humans emphasize the importance of these markets in the epidemiology of influenza. The poultry markets are of critical importance in the perpetuation and transmission of influenza viruses to other avian species and to mammals, including humans...|$|R
