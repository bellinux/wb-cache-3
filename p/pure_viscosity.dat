The influence of the molecular architecture of PAM on the rheological properties in aqueous solution has been investigated. The well-known theory of increased entanglement density by branching for polymers in the melt can also be applied to polymers in the semi-dilute water solutions. We have demonstrated this by investigating the rheological properties of PAM of similar molecular weights with different molecular architectures. Interestingly, the solution viscosity of a comb PAM is higher compared to its linear and star analogues (both at equal span molecular weight, M-n,M-SPAN, and total molecular weight, M-n,M-tot). In addition to the <b>pure</b> <b>viscosity,</b> we also demonstrate that the visco-elastic properties of the polymeric solutions depend significantly on the molecular architecture of the employed PAM. The elastic response of water solutions containing comb PAM is more pronounced than for solutions containing either linear or star PAM at similar M-n,M-SPAN and M-n,M-tot, The obtained results {{pave the way for}} application of these polymeric materials in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).

This report presents the results of 12 core floors performed to enhance recovery of waterflood residual oil. The recovery is enhanced by a visous surfactant flood consistent of one polymer to increase the viscosity, one surfactant for interfacial tension reduction, and one di-alcohol to function as co-surfactant and for salinity control. The chemical treatment that gave the best result, gave an additional oil production normalized on OOIP of 20 %, improving the oil recovery from 45 to 66 % mostly by the means of mobility control. <b>Pure</b> <b>viscosity</b> floods gave an additional recovery of 12 to 13 % of OOIP. Novel technology is used to investigate environmental friendly enhanced oil recovery. A biopolymer made out of microfibrils from wooden material was {{for the first time ever}} to my knowledge, attempted used in a core flood to enhance oil recovery.

40|$|Chemical pulp fibres {{from wood}} are {{commonly}} used in products associated with packaging {{as well as with}} printing and writing. The prevalent way of liberating fibres is by subjecting wood chips to Kraft cooking. This process has a history of almost 130 years and should be both well described and well established. However, new products and new applications that use fibres as an important renewable resource make it all the more important that the properties of fibres be controllable. The properties of wood fibres are influenced by their carbohydrate composition which, in turn, is dependent on the cooking conditions used. This thesis studies the degradation and dissolution of the different carbohydrates during Kraft cooking and summarizes the results in kinetic expressions. Industrial wood chips from Norway spruce (Picea abies) were cooked at a high liquor-to-wood ratio in an autoclave digester at varying concentrations of hydroxide ions, hydrogen sulphide ions and sodium ions as well as varying temperatures. The pulps were analysed for carbohydrate composition, kappa number, content of hexenuronic acid and the <b>pure</b> cellulose <b>viscosity,</b> i. e. only the cellulose content in the pulp sample was used for calculating the viscosity. Kraft cooking of Eucalyptus urophylla and Eucalyptus grandis was also studied, using industrial liquor-to-wood ratios, {{to examine the relationship between}} hexenuronic acids and the amount of xylan in the pulp samples. For Kraft cooking of Norway spruce it was found that an increase in the concentration of hydroxide ions increased the rate of dissolution of the carbohydrates and the degradation of the cellulose degree of polymerization (DP). However, measured at a kappa number of 30, it is seen that a low hydroxide ion concentration can lower the carbohydrate yield and the <b>pure</b> cellulose <b>viscosity</b> dramatically. The hydroxide ion concentration not only affects the rate of dissolution but also the amount of xylan that reacts in the slower, final phase. Both cellulose and hemicelluloses were found to be affected by the hydrogen sulphide ion concentration. The dissolution of cellulose and hemicelluloses at varying sodium ion concentrations was found to be affected in different directions. The effect of sodium ion concentration on the DP was found to be dependent on the method of evaluation. The pulp viscosity was found to be affected twice as much by the sodium ion concentration than the <b>pure</b> cellulose <b>viscosity</b> was. For Kraft cooking of hardwood it was found that a high xylan yield not always is synonymous with a high hexenuronic acids content...|$|R

While physically appealing, this observation is hard to reconcile with a recent theoretical prediction that at long times the VACF in a suspension {{should be the same}} as the VACF at infinite dilution. It also differs, in a rather subtle manner, from a scaling rule which has been used in the analysis of experimental and computer simulation results. From the scaling behavior of the VACF we conclude that effective fluid behavior only occurs on a time scale somewhat longer than the time taken for transverse momentum to diffuse a particle radius. This contrasts with the findings of earlier workers who concluded that effective fluid behavior is already observed at much shorter times...|$|R

This population structure builds a continuum between individual selection, kin selection, kin group selection and group selection without a clear boundary for each level. However, early theoretical models by D.S. Wilson et al. (1992) and Taylor (1992) showed that <b>pure</b> population <b>viscosity</b> cannot lead to cooperation and altruism.

However, this exact cancelling out also suggests that any additional benefit of local cooperation would be sufficient to allow cooperation to evolve. Mitteldorf and D.S. Wilson (2000) later showed that if the population is allowed to fluctuate, then local populations can temporarily store the benefit of local cooperation and promote the evolution of cooperation and altruism. By assuming individual differences in adaptations, Yang (2013) further showed that the benefit of local altruism can be stored in the form of offspring quality and thus promote the evolution of altruism even if the population does not fluctuate. This is because local competition among more individuals resulting from local altruism increases the average local fitness of the individuals that survive.|$|R

This problem resulted in decreasing in the amount of oil and gas produced and production efficiency, formation damage, emergency shutdown, equipment failure and increase the maintenance cost. The deposition of scale often resulted from the incompatibility between injected saline water and reservoir water. The common scales formed in the oil field are CaCO 3, CaSO 4 (anhydrite, gypsum), BaSO 4 (barite), SrSO 4 (celestite) and ferrous scale. Among the scales, BaSO 4 was the hardest scale and difficult to remove chemically or mechanically. Thus, a suitable chelating agent needs to be identified in order to overcome this problem. In this present study, the physical properties, characterization and interaction mechanism between BaSO 4 and Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid pentapotasium salt (DTPA) used as solvent were investigated. Based on the findings, the pH value of pure DTPA and DTPA-BaSO 4 mixture were same which were 14. 00. On the other hand, the <b>pure</b> DTPA <b>viscosity</b> was 7. 28 mPa. s and based on the observation, the DTPA-BaSO 4 mixture was identified less viscous than the pure DTPA.

25|$|Group {{selection}} is often criticized {{to be too}} slow to happen in real biology. However, Jiang-Nan Yang recently showed with an individual-based model that the evolution of altruistic ageing occurs under fairly general conditions by kin/group selection. Group selection can be based on population viscosity (limited offspring dispersal, first proposed by Hamilton (1964) for kin selection) that is widely present in natural populations. This population structure builds a continuum between individual selection, kin selection, kin group selection and group selection without a clear boundary for each level. Although early theoretical models by D.S. Wilson et al. (1992) and Taylor (1992) showed that <b>pure</b> population <b>viscosity</b> cannot lead to cooperation/altruism because of the exact cancelling out of the benefit of kin cooperation {{and the cost of}} kin competition, this exact cancelling out also suggests that any additional benefit of local cooperation would be sufficient for the evolution of cooperation. Mitteldorf and D.S. Wilson (2000) later showed that if the population is allowed to fluctuate, then local populations can temporarily store the benefit of local cooperation and promote the evolution of altruism. By assuming individual differences in adaptations, Yang (2013) further showed that the benefit of local altruism can be stored in the form of offspring quality and thus promote the evolution of altruistic ageing even if the population does not fluctuate, this is because local competition among the young will result in an increased average local inherited fitness of survived progenies after the elimination of the less adapted by natural selection, since the young do not have strong age-associated abilities and have to depend more on inherited abilities to compete. In Yang (2013)'s model, altruistic ageing is stabilized by higher-level selection instead of just kin selection.|$|R

Pure R- 407 C performed very similar to pure R- 134 a run previously in similar tests at all three mass velocities, differing only at high vapor qualities where the peaks in href vs. x were shifted slightly. For local vapor qualities from 10 - 70 %, oil tended to have little effect on local R- 407 C/oil heat transfer coefficients at the lowest mass velocity while at the higher mass velocities the effect was to increase or decrease the coefficients within ± 20 % of the pure R- 407 C values. At vapor qualities higher than 70 %, {{the effect of the}} oil was very dramatic, decreasing performance by as much as 80 - 90 % even with small amounts of oil. Two-phase pressure drops were increased by the presence of oil, especially at high vapor qualities. Two methods for predicting local boiling coefficients of refrigerant-oil mixtures were presented.

40|$|Theory and {{experiments}} {{are used to}} establish lower and upper bounds on the ratio of actual <b>viscosity</b> to <b>pure</b> ice <b>viscosity</b> for a suspension of rock particles in a water ice matrix. For typical conditions encountered in icy satellites, this ratio is of order ten or possibly larger, depending on unknown {{factors such as the}} particle size distribution. It is shown that even this modest increase in viscosity may be enough to have caused a failure of solid state convective self-regulation early in the evolution of a homogeneous, rock-water ice satellite, provided the satellite is large enough and sufficiently silicate rich. The criteria for this failure are satisfied by Ganymede and are marginal for Callisto, if the silicates are hydrated. Failure of self-regulation means that the viscosity is too high for the interior to remain completely solid and eliminate the heat production of long-lived radioisotopes by solid state convection. Partial melting of the ice then occurs. It is further shown that satellites of this size may then undergo runaway differentiation into a rock core and almost pure ice mantle, because the gravitational energy release is sufficient to melt nearly all the ice and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability time scale is short. (Although the high pressure phases of ice melt, the resulting water quickly refreezes at a higher level.) It is conjectured that these results explain the striking surface dissimilarity of Ganymede and Callisto, if these satellites accreted cold and undifferentiated. Ganymede may have gone supercritical (melted and differentiated) because of a failure of self-regulation, whereas Callisto remained undifferentiated to the present day. Like all proposed explanations for the Ganymede-Callisto dichotomy, this conjecture cannot be quantified with confidence because of inadequate or incomplete observations, theory, and experimental data...|$|R

Many <b>pure</b> hydrocarbon gas <b>viscosity</b> correlations are available. However, a wide-ranging and accurate viscosity correlation of gas mixtures associated with heavier hydrocarbon components and impurity components, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen sulphide, is not available.

Increasing magma vesicularity affects the bulk viscosity of the bubble-melt suspension {{and has the}} potential to promote non-Newtonian behavior in the form of shear localization or brittle failure. Here, we present a series of high temperature uniaxial deformation experiments designed to investigate the effect of bubbles on the magma bulk viscosity. The starting materials are cores of natural rhyolitic obsidian synthesized to have variable vesicularity (φ= 0 - 66 %). The foamed cores were deformed isothermally (T= 750 °C) at atmospheric conditions using a high-temperature uniaxial press under constant displacement rates (strain rates between 0. 5 - 1 × 10 - 4 s- 1) and to total strains of 10 - 40 %. The viscosity of the bubble-free melt (η 0) was measured by micropenetration and parallel plate methods to establish a baseline for experiments on the vesicle rich cores. At the experimental conditions, rising vesicle content produces a marked decrease in bulk viscosity that is best described by a two-parameter empirical equation: log 10 ηBulk=log 10 β 0 - 1. 47 [φ/(1 -φ) ] 0. 48. Our parameterization of the bubble-melt rheology is combined with Maxwell relaxation theory to map the potential onset of non-Newtonian behavior (shear localization) in magmas as a function of melt viscosity, vesicularity, and strain rate. For low degrees of strain (i. e. as in our study), the rheological properties of vesicular magmas under different flow types (pure vs. simple shear) are indistinguishable. For high strain or strain rates where simple and <b>pure</b> shear <b>viscosity</b> values may diverge, our model represents a maximum boundary condition. Vesicular magmas can behave as non-Newtonian fluids at lower strain rates than unvesiculated melts, thereby, promoting shear localization and (explosive or non-explosive) magma fragmentation.

The data on square tank aerators support another such simulation equation developed earlier for square tanks. A comparison of results, while re-aerating the same volume of water in both the shapes of tanks, leads to the interesting conclusion that for a given rotor speed the oxygen transfer rate is substantially more in square tanks than in circular tanks; whereas for a given effective input power to the rotor the oxygen transfer rate is more in circular tanks than in square tanks.

40|$|Two main seismic {{features}} {{characterize the}} Earth’s inner core: a North-South polar anisotropy and an East-West asymmetry of P-wave velocity and attenuation. Anisotropy is expected if shear deformation is induced by convective motions. Translation {{has recently been}} put forward as an important mode of convection of the inner core. Combined with a simple diffusive grain growth model, this mechanism is able to explain the observed seismic asymmetry, but not the bulk anisotropy. The source of anisotropy has therefore to be sought in the shear motions caused by higher modes of convection. Using a hybrid finite-difference spherical harmonics Navier-Stokes solver, we investigate the interplay between translation and convection in a 3 D spherical model with permeable boundary conditions at the inner core boundary. Three parameters act independently: viscosity, internal heating and convection velocity in the outer core. Our numerical simulations show the dominance of <b>pure</b> translation for <b>viscosities</b> of the inner core higher than 1020 Pas. Translation is almost completely hampered by convective motions for viscosities lower than 1018 Pas. Between these values, translation and convection develop, but convective downwellings are restricted to the coldest hemisphere where crystallization occurs. On the opposite side, shear is almost absent, thereby allowing grain growth. We propose that the coexistence of translation and convection observed in our numerical models leads to a seismic asymmetry but localizes deformation only in one hemisphere.

Input impedance of a rigid‐wall polyethylene tube (Zt) was measured when the tube was filled with various mixtures of carrier gases (air, 100 % oxygen, 50 % oxygen+ 50 % nitrogen) to which different concentrations of volatile anaesthetic inhalation agents (halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane) had been added. µ and ρ were calculated from real and imaginary portions of Zt, respectively, using the appropriate physical equations. Multiple linear regression was applied to estimate µ and ρ of <b>pure</b> volatile agents. <b>Viscosity</b> values of <b>pure</b> volatile agents were markedly lower than those for oxygen or nitrogen. Clinically applied concentrations, however, did not markedly affect the viscosity of the gas mixture (maximum of 3. 5 % decrease in µ for 2 MAC desflurane).

Our results suggest that the composition of the carrier gas has a greater impact on viscosity than the amount and nature of the volatile anaesthetic agent whereas density is more influenced by volatile agent concentrations.

However, reliable experiments on their thermophysical properties in reservoir conditions, in particular viscosity, are very scarce. From a modeling point of view H 2 S (and CO 2) are polar compounds and are so often considered as rather difficult to model accurately. In this work, we propose a correlation based on a corresponding states approach in order to predict the viscosity of acid gas mixtures, among others, with a strong physical background. This correlation {{is based on the}} Lennard-Jones fluid model, which has been studied extensively thanks to molecular dynamics simulations over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. This fluid model can be extended to deal with polar molecules such as CO 2 or H 2 S without a loss of accuracy. In a first part, we demonstrate that the proposed physically based correlation is able to provide an excellent estimation of the viscosity (with average absolute deviations below 5 %) of pure compounds including normal-alkanes, CO 2 or even H 2 S whatever the thermodynamic conditions, gas, liquid or supercritical. Then, using a one-fluid approximation and a set of combining rules, the correlation is applied to various mixtures in a fully predictive way, i. e. without any additional fitted parameters. Using this scheme, the deviations between predictions and measurements are as low as on <b>pure</b> fluids. The <b>viscosity</b> of natural and acid gas mixtures in reservoir conditions is shown to be very well predicted by the proposed scheme. In addition, it is shown that this correlation can also be applied to predict reasonably the viscosity of asymmetric high pressures mixtures even in the liquid phase.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the work on}} detailed characterization of effervescent spray of Jatropha and Pongamia pure plant oils. The spray characteristics of these biofuels are {{compared with those of}} diesel. Both macroscopic and microscopic spray characteristics at different injection pressures and gas-to-liquid ratio (GLR) have been studied. The particle/droplet imaging analysis (PDIA) technique along with direct imaging methods are used for the purpose of spray characterization. Due to their higher <b>viscosity,</b> <b>pure</b> plant oils showed poor atomization compared to diesel and a blend of diesel and pure plant oil at a given GLR. Pure plant oil sprays showed a lower spray cone angle when compared to diesel and blends at lower GLRs. However, the difference is not significant at higher GLRs. Droplet size measurements at 100 mm downstream of the exit orifice showed reduction in Sauter mean diameter (SMD) diameter with increase in GLR. A radial variation in the SMD is observed for the blend and pure plant oils. Pure oils showed a larger variation when compared to the blend. Spray unsteadiness has been characterized based on the image-to-image variation in the mean droplet diameter and fluctuations in the spray cone angle. Results showed that pure plant oil sprays are more unsteady at lower GLRs when compared to diesel and blend. A critical GLR is identified at which the spray becomes steady. The three regimes of spray operation, namely ``steady spray,'' ``pulsating spray,'' and ``spray and unbroken liquid jet'' are identified in the injection pressure-GLR parameter space for these pure plant oils. Two-phase flow imaging inside the exit orifice shows that for the pure plant oils, the flow is highly transient at low GLRs and the bubbly, slug, and annular two-phase flow regimes are all observed. However, at higher GLRs where the spray is steady, only the annular flow regime is observed...|$|R
40|$|Living {{biological}} {{cells are}} highly complex, multifunctional systems whose physical attributes are relatively unknown. Critical functions involving plasticity of cell morphology, connectivity {{and response to}} stimuli are proposed to be fundamentally related to the micromechanical character {{and the ability of}} the cell to exert directed mechanical signaling. Unique abilities of atomic force microscopy in measuring cellular viscoelastic properties (on length scales from nanometers to microns) are explored with specific applications to (1) airway smooth muscle cells and (2) hippocampal neurons. Surface indentation techniques for stiffness mapping, as well as quantitative measurements of frequency-dependent complex rheology are featured. Structural and molecular determinants of dynamic mechanical behavior are identified. In smooth muscle cells, an isotropic fiber network provides strong resistance to deformation. Actin polymerization is largely responsible for stiffening following contractile activation, not myosin cross-bridge formation as expected. On neuronal dendrites, stiffness contrast correlates with known distributions and stability of cytoskeletal elements: microtubules along the shafts and dynamic actin in the spines (micron-sized surface protrusions). Focus is given to dendritic spines as the post-synaptic contact sites for most excitatory transmission between neurons. Large heterogeneity is observed in spine mechanical properties, but stiffer spines appear to be associated with axon-like contacts. Spines may stiffen in response to synaptic stimulation, in agreement with recent observations of actin-based stabilization of spine shape (reduced motility) following excitatory treatments. Remarkably, the frequency dependence of the complex shear moduli (0. 5 - 100 Hz indentations) of both cellular systems is described well by the same rheological model: that of soft glassy materials existing just above the glass transition. The central feature of this model is that storage (G') and loss moduli (G") scale in parallel as a weak power-law function of frequency. Power-law exponents (alpha), measured to be of the order 0. 1, are related to the level of molecular agitations in the cell and determine the degree of solid-like (G' >> G" with a glass transition at alpha = 0) or fluid-like behavior (G' << G" with alpha = 1 for a pure fluid). The soft glassy hypothesis is founded on the concepts of disorder and metastability of structural elements. A Newtonian <b>viscosity</b> (<b>pure</b> fluid) component is also identified with significant effects for high frequency deformations. Together these properties are critical for describing cellular remodeling: contraction in smooth muscle cells or synaptic plasticity at dendritic spines...|$|R
40|$|While much {{research}} into the field of ionic liquids has described applications for which these new and facile materials can be used, {{the origins of the}} desirable physical properties (i. e. high ionic conductivity, large electrochemical windows, high thermal stability, etc.), remains subject to empirical understanding and guess-work. The investigation of new salts from the> 1010 possibilities can be cumbersome as time is invested in either a wide range of promising materials that may yield limited success, or through systematic testing of whole families of ionic liquids to find the best performing material. Developing an understanding of the role different ions and functional groups play in the bulk physical properties of an ionic liquid is crucial in guiding future research to uncover modem materials for advanced practical applications. This work first analyses the physical properties of many different ionic liquids to gain insight into the liquid state of <b>pure</b> ionic liquids. <b>Viscosity,</b> ionic conductivity and density data are used to construct Walden Plots, to understand the freedom of movement of ions in the electrolyte, based on the Walden rule that states that the product of molar conductivity and viscosity is constant. It is proposed in this work that the observed deviation from this relationship is influenced {{by the size of the}} ions. Based on estimates of ion size using ab initio calculations, new deviations in molar conductivity in the Walden Plot (~W) are determined. Furthermore, using the Nernst-Einstein equation, ionicity values are determined from diffusion NMR analysis. The pure state IS also probed in detail for the ionic liquid trihexyltetradecylphosphonim chloride ([P 6, 6, 6, 14](Cl]) using wide angle X-ray scattering coupled with molecular dynamics simulations. Nanometer sized domains are observed in the liquid state, which is correlated by the computer simulations. These domains alternate between polar and non-polar, reflecting aggregation of the charged ions and aggregation of the uncharged alkyl chains on the phosphonium cation. While there are many new ionic liquids to explore, another avenue of research that is beginning to bloom is the study of mixtures of ionic liquids. The most obvious starting point is perhaps the study of ionic liquids combined with molecular solvents, as these latter materials have well documented and accurately measured properties. However, some of the properties that are so heavily sought after in ionic liquids are sacrificed in such mixtures. In contrast, ionic liquids mixed with other ionic liquids offer the possibility of improvement of undesirable properties without the loss of advantageous properties such as negligible volatility. As there is an overwhelmingly large range of ionic liquid in ionic liquid possible combinations, though, a guided and well constructed approach is required to make significant headway in the field. This work presents the study of a group of ionic liquids where the differences in constituent ions are chosen to yield significant information on how different ions interact, while the number of differences is kept to a minimum to avoid too many competing factors. The concept of "simple" mixing, in terms of the properties of ionic liquid mixtures, is clarified first in order to identify any unusual behaviour. Thus, equations for predicting viscosities in mixtures are confirmed, and analogous equations are used to describe molar conductivities. The greatest deviation from simple mixing is observed in mixtures of the N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium ([C 3 mpyrt]+) cation and the large [P 6, 6, 6, 14]+ cation, used with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide ([NTf 2]*) anion. These mixtures exhibit an immiscibility window, a lack of crystallisation in single phase mixtures, a large excess molar volume and significant departure from the expected viscosity. It is conjectured that the physical properties of the miscible composition in this mixture is the result of alkyl-rich domains in the liquid state, and that when the composition of [C 3 mpyr][NTf 2] is in the majority these domains cannot stay in solution and force the ionic liquids to separate. In order to accurately perform NMR diffusion analyses of the ionic liquid binary mixtures, the exact procedure for the NMR diffusion experiments needed to be explored and clarified. It is observed that the standard pulse sequence traditionally used for diffusion experiments, the Hahn-Echo pulse sequence, yields anomalous results in high viscosity ionic liquids. As only the most fluid of ionic liquids give consistent results with this standard procedure a different pulse sequence is required. The stimulated echo sequence is shown to have no viscosity dependence and is therefore recommended for PFG-NMR studies on ionic liquids. Finally, mixtures of ionic liquids and molecular solvents will produce materials that are useful in some applications, and this work presents a study comparing analysis based on transport properties (Le. the Walden plot) against studies of the vapour pressure (Le. osmotic coefficient and activities). It is shown that both techniques give evidence of ion aggregation at low concentrations, but deviate from one another above - 0. 3 mole fraction ionic liquid. This is attributed to breakdown of the validity of osmotic coefficient measurements at high salt concentrations. An effect of solvent polarity on ion aggregation is also observed. This work gives significant advances in the probing of the state of ions within an ionic liquid, and gives insights into how ions interact with each other, other ionic liquids and molecular solvents. The findings here can serve as a basis for developing new ionic liquids, as well as direct investigations for new ionic liquid mixtures...|$|R
