5|$|Dinefwr Park has {{a history}} of {{occupation}} spanning at least two millennia. A <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> axe dated to the Neolithic period was unearthed on the site in 1976, and during the Iron Age, a farm existed on the property. The Romans later built a pair of forts here, with one partly overlying the other. There are traces of Roman roads and tracks, some of which may {{have been part of the}} Carmarthen–Llandovery Roman road. A Roman milestone and a coin hoard were unearthed near Dinefwr Castle, and pieces of amphorae and Samian items have been excavated near Dinefwr Farm.|$|E

5|$|Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples, with {{linguistic}} and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as {{peoples of the}} Philippines, Malaysia, Madagascar and Oceania. Chipped-pebble tools dating from perhaps as early as 15,000 years ago suggest that the initial human inhabitants of Taiwan were Paleolithic cultures of the Pleistocene era. These people survived by eating marine life. Archaeological evidence points to an abrupt change to the Neolithic era around 6,000years ago, {{with the advent of}} agriculture, domestic animals, <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> adzes and pottery. The stone adzes were mass-produced on Penghu and nearby islands, from the volcanic rock found there. This suggests heavy sea traffic took place between these islands and Taiwan at this time.|$|E

25|$|Human's {{technological}} ascent {{began in}} earnest in {{what is known as}} the Neolithic Period ("New Stone Age"). The invention of <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms. This use of <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland. Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as nomadic ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer economy.|$|E

25|$|About 4200-4000 BCE, {{more than}} 500 {{years before the}} {{geographic}} expansion evidenced {{by the presence of}} horse bones, new kinds of graves, named after a grave at Suvorovo, appeared north of the Danube delta in the coastal steppes of Ukraine near Izmail. Suvorovo graves were similar to and probably derived from earlier funeral traditions in the steppes around the Dnieper River. Some Suvorovo graves contained <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> mace-heads shaped like horse heads and horse tooth beads. Earlier steppe graves also had contained <b>polished</b> <b>stone</b> mace-heads, some of them carved in the shape of animal heads. Settlements in the steppes contemporary with Suvorovo, such as Sredni Stog II and Dereivka on the Dnieper River, contained 12%-52% horse bones.|$|E
25|$|The Bronze Age is characterised by metal {{smelting}} of copper and its alloy bronze, an alloy of tin and copper, to create implements and weapons. <b>Polished</b> <b>stone</b> tools {{continued to be}} used due to their abundance compared with the less common metals (especially tin).|$|E
25|$|As well, two {{objects were}} found with an inlay of dark blue stone, {{resembling}} lapis lazuli.

The stone vessel inscription mentions Huni's name without a cartouche, but with the Njswt-Bity title.

However, as the stream enters a bend and vortex flow commences as the primary flow, a secondary flow also commences and flows partly across the floor of the stream toward the convex bank (the bank with the smaller radius). Sand, gravel and <b>polished</b> <b>stones</b> that have travelled with the stream for a great distance where the stream was following a straight course may finally come to rest in the point bar of the first stream bend.|$|R
