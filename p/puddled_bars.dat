Since the industrial revolution, machines of augmented power, size and precision have {{given rise to}} TMP that challenged explanation of the crystal mechanisms. In wrought iron, lamellar ferrite exhibited high transverse crack resistance due to fine slag stringers that as flux facilitated welding of <b>puddled</b> <b>bars</b> in forging of shafts or rolling of plates for bell-welding into pressure tight pipes; the substructure developed in the iron as working continued below 900 ËšC strengthened it. Patenting of high C steel wire led to an optimum cold-drawn structure for outstanding strength and toughness. Hot forming technology, combined with the refining potential for austenite decomposition gave rise to controlled rolling for enhanced ferrite nucleation, ausforming to refine martensite and intercritical rolling to deform the ferrite or to spheroidize the carbides. Cold rolling and annealing have been scheduled to impart suitable strength, grain size, substructure and texture...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fully}} {{developed}} process (of Hall), this metal was placed into the hearth of the puddling furnace {{where it was}} melted. The hearth was lined with oxidizing agents such as haematite and iron oxide. The mixture was subjected to a strong current of air and stirred with long <b>bars,</b> called <b>puddling</b> <b>bars</b> or rabbles, through working doors. The air, the stirring, and the [...] "boiling" [...] action of the metal helped the oxidizing agents to oxidize the impurities and carbon out of the pig iron. As the impurities oxidize, they formed a molten slag or drifted off as gas while the retaining iron solidified into spongy wrought iron that floated {{to the top of}} the puddle and were fished out of the melt as puddle balls using <b>puddle</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The bloom {{was passed}} through rollers and to produce bars. The bars of wrought iron were of poor quality, called muck <b>bars</b> or <b>puddle</b> <b>bars.</b> [...] To improve their quality, the bars were cut up, piled and tied {{together}} by wires, {{a process known}} as faggoting or piling. [...] They were then reheated and rolled again in merchant rolls. The process could be repeated several times to produce wrought iron of desired quality. Wrought iron that has been rolled multiple times is called merchant bar or merchant iron.|$|R
50|$|Either {{white cast}} iron or refined iron is then placed in hearth of the furnace, {{a process known as}} charging. For wet puddling, scrap iron and/or iron oxide is also charged. This mixture is then heated until the top melts, {{allowing}} for the oxides to begin mixing; this usually takes 30 minutes. This mixture is subjected to a strong current of air and stirred by long bars with hooks on one end, called <b>puddling</b> <b>bars</b> or rabbles, through doors in the furnace. This helps the oxygen from the oxides to react with impurities in the pig iron, notably silicon, manganese (to form slag) and to some degree sulfur and phosphorus, which form gases that escape with the exhaust of the furnace.|$|R
50|$|Stays {{made from}} <b>puddled</b> iron <b>bar</b> {{were used as}} a cheaper {{alternative}} to copper for joining {{the inner and outer}} firebox plates of steam locomotives. The incorporated stringers gave flexibility akin to stranded wire rope and stays made of the material were therefore resistant to snapping in service. Wrought iron rivets made from iron bar typically contained stringer filaments running the length of the rivet, but filaments at right angles to the tension, particularly beneath the head, caused weakness.|$|R
5000|$|More fuel is {{then added}} and the {{temperature}} raised. The iron completely melts and the carbon starts to burn off as well. When wet puddling, the formation of carbon dioxide due to reactions with the added iron oxide will cause bubbles to form that cause the mass to appear to boil. This process causes the slag to puff up on top, giving the rabbler a visual indication of {{the progress of the}} combustion. As the carbon burns off, the melting temperature of the mixture rises from 1150 to 1540 C, so the furnace has to be continually fed during this process. The melting point increases since the carbon atoms within the mixture act as a solute in solution which lowers the melting point of the iron mixture (like road salt on ice). Burning them off causes the melting point to increase towards that of pure iron, and since the temperature of the puddling furnace is less than that which wrought iron melts, decarburized iron in the mixture start to solidify around the <b>puddling</b> <b>bars.</b> Eventually the carbon is mostly burned off and the iron [...] "comes to nature", forming into a spherical spongy mass, indicating that the process is complete and the material can be removed. The hook {{on the end of the}} bar is then used to pull out the large puddle balls of the material, about 35 - 40 kg each, and 30 - 38 cm in diameter. Sometimes a large pair of tongs are used to remove the puddle balls.|$|R
