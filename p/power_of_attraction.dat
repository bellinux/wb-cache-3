40|$|Coastal {{areas of}} the Mediterranean exert {{significant}} <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> during the summer months, resulting in a highly seasonal phenomenon. In order to meet market demand during the summer period, permanent accommodation structures have been established in coastal areas, bringing with them major environmental impact.

In order to provide a response to this paradox, the spread of open-air tourism and forms of camping are seen as able to guarantee the reception of a great number of visitors whilst minimizing environmental impact through the use of flexible and movable structures. The present work investigates what may be regarded as good practice applicable to this type of structure, both in terms of micro-scale residential accommodation units and macro-scale of a site as a whole.

40|$|In {{this new}} Policy Brief, CEPS Senior Research Fellow Michael Emerson {{asserts that the}} {{aftershocks}} of the EU’s failed referenda on the European Constitution will be most sharply felt – in an external sense – in the Black Sea region. He describes how Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia were the first hit by the tremors. But he traces its effects further than that, up the Danube basin to Belgrade, across the Caucasus to Armenia and Azerbaijan, and last but certainly not least up to Russia. For all the states that have been espousing long-term EU membership aspirations – including all of the above, except Russia –the author recommends they take time out for a reality check. For Russia, which had not anticipated this upset in the EU, it may be interpreted {{not so much a}} time for a rethink, as an encouragement not to have a rethink. For these states (in different degrees), there is a new question of strategic importance {{and the name of the}} game has changed. Emerson is keen to explore whether the EU’s hugely successful political conditionality machine and gravitational <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction,</b> as evidenced in its recent enlargement, can continue to operate with some variant model of virtual, functional membership? Or, if not, he asks whether the prospects for the deepening and consolidation of democracy in these regions are going to be seriously prejudiced...|$|R

Bishop, who had ambled back to earth again when the present theme was broached, acquiesced. He said it was indeed highly important to Society that one in the trying situation of unexpectedly finding himself invested with a power for good or for evil in Society, should become, as it were, merged in the superior power of a more legitimate and more gigantic growth, the influence of which (as in the case of our friend at whose board we sat) was habitually exercised in harmony with the best interests of Society.|$|E

That {{she was one of}} those women--not too common in the Anglo-Saxon race--born to be loved and to love, who when not loving are not living, had certainly never even occurred to him. Her <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction,</b> he regarded as part of her value as his property; but it made him, indeed, suspect that she could give as well as receive; and she gave him nothing! 'Then why did she marry me?' was his continual thought. He had forgotten his courtship; that year and a half when he had besieged and lain in wait for her, devising schemes for her entertainment, giving her presents, proposing to her periodically, and keeping her other admirers away with his perpetual presence. He had forgotten the day when, adroitly taking advantage of an acute phase of her dislike to her home surroundings, he crowned his labours with success. If he remembered anything, it was the dainty capriciousness with which the gold-haired, dark-eyed girl had treated him. He certainly did not remember the look on her face--strange, passive, appealing--when suddenly one day she had yielded, and said that she would marry him.|$|E
40|$|Many rural {{towns and}} villages fail to achieve their tourism {{development}} goals because the pulling <b>power</b> <b>of</b> their <b>attractions</b> is not strong enough. An appropriate combination <b>of</b> minor <b>attractions</b> may be {{an effective means of}} increasing the pulling <b>power</b> <b>of</b> these destinations. This study demonstrates a method for predicting the probability of a visit to other attractions based on the visitation <b>of</b> one <b>attraction.</b> Along with other analyses, a series of 11 bivariate logistic regression analyses predicts the probability of tourists visiting the 10 other attractions if they visited a specific attraction. For example, the results indicate that a visit to Sunset Crater may be nearly 19 times more likely when Wupatki National Monument is visited. The study demonstrates that separating natural and cultural attractions, while valid for solving many research problems, is of little value in understanding the behavior of general sightseeing visitors. The results of the research method may be useful for creating a strong image for the destination, cross-marketing attractions, developing packages that sell local lodging and food service, for advertising and for developing tours...|$|R
