5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction.</b> These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler {{that had not been}} available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E

25|$|Art {{history as}} we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has {{precedents}} that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on formal analysis, semiotics, psychoanalysis and iconography. Advances in <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding context, form, and social significance.|$|E

2500|$|Archipenko {{evolved in}} close contact with the Salon Cubists (Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay, Joseph Csaky and others). At the same time, his affinities with Futurism were {{documented}} by the British magazine The Sketch in October 1913, where Archipenko's Dancers (Dance), reproduced on its front cover, was described as a 'Futurist sculpture'. [...] "In this work", writes Alexandra Keiser, [...] "two abstracted figures are engaged in a dynamic dance movement." [...] Moreover, the chiaroscuro observed in the <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> [...] "accentuated the artist's multi-faceted use of positive and negative space as a compositional element to create dynamic movement, in both the fragmentation of the dancers' bodies {{as well as in the}} void created between their bodies". In the <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> of Dancers, writes Keiser, [...] "the sculpture is set off at an angle reinforcing the idea of dynamism and creating the illusion that the sculpture is propelled through space. The sculpture Dance itself as well as the style of its reproduction played strongly to the generalized notions of Futurism and to the idea that sculpture could be conceived as a specifically modern medium".|$|E

2500|$|It was at {{this time}} that Lichtenstein began to find fame not just in America but worldwide. He moved back to New York to {{be at the center of}} the art scene and {{resigned}} from Rutgers University in 1964 to concentrate on his painting. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna (early acrylic) paint in his best known works, such as Drowning Girl (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts #83. (Drowning Girl now hangs in the Museum of Modern Art, New York.) Drowning Girl also features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots, as if created by <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Of his own work Lichtenstein would say that the Abstract Expressionists [...] "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes.

2500|$|Another {{successful}} infringer was Henry G. Allen, {{who developed}} a <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> method for the Britannica and charged {{only half as}} much as Stoddart ($2.50 per volume). Other people alleged to have copied the 9th edition included John Wanamaker and the Reverend Isaac Kaufmann Funk of the Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia. Richard S. Pearle & Co. of Chicago photoengraved some sets in 1891, and added 3 volumes of [...] "American Revisions and additions," [...] the first 2 in 1891 and the third in 1892. In 1893 they published sets with volumes 1–24 from the original Britannica, the 3 [...] "American" [...] volumes 25–27, and the index as Vol. 28. Some copies of this version say they were printed by Werner, also of Chicago, and from 1902 to 1907 Werner printed the commonly found [...] "New Werner Edition," [...] of 30 volumes (24 volumes plus 5 New American Supplement volumes and a new index for all 29 volumes). In 1890, James Clarke published the Americanized Encyclopædia Britannica, Revised and Amended which was only 10 volumes, as was the 1895 Belford-Clark issue by the same name (Chicago).|$|E
2500|$|In The Archaeology of Baptism (1876) Wolfrid Cote, quoting Prudentius, {{who in his}} Psychomachia {{spoke of}} the [...] "bathed chests" [...] of the baptized, and the views of two earlier Italian archaeologists, stated that [...] "the {{primitive}} mode {{appears to have been}} this: The administrator and candidate both standing in the water the former placed his right hand on the head of the candidate, and, pronouncing the baptismal words, gently bowed him forward, till he was completely immersed in the water". He included in his book a woodcut of a fresco in the Catacomb of San Callisto (a <b>photographic</b> <b>reproduction</b> appears in this article), and reported that one archaeologist interpreted it as a youth being baptized by affusion, while for another the youth standing in the water was [...] "immersed in a cloud of water". Cote described this painting as of great antiquity, probably of the 4th or 5th century, while remarking {{that it is impossible to}} ascertain the precise age of the pictures in the catacombs of Rome. [...] The other paintings that Cote described are of much later periods, while the mosaic in the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Fonte, in Ravenna (erected in the 4th century), which shows John baptizing Jesus by pouring water on his head from a cup, Cote explained as the product of later restoring. The font in this baptistery Cote described as ten feet in diameter and three and a half feet deep. Cote listed 67 still existing Italian baptisteries dating from the 4th to the 14th centuries, all of which he understood to have been used for total immersion. He made no mention of any pre-Constantine evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Pop art is {{exemplified}} by artists: Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Wayne Thiebaud, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Tom Wesselmann and Roy Lichtenstein among others.

(Drowning Girl now is {{in the collection of}} Museum of Modern Art, New York.)

My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's." [...] Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted The New Realists the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Sidney Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the New York School and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 a historically important and ground-breaking New Painting of Common Objects exhibition of Pop art, curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum sent shock waves across the Western United States. Campbell's Soup Cans (sometimes referred to as 32 Campbell's Soup Cans) is the title of an Andy Warhol work of art (see gallery) that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20inches in height x 16inches in width (50.8 x 40.6cm) and each consisting of a painting of a Campbell's Soup can—one of each canned soup variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised silkscreen process, using a non-painterly style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from popular culture. These works by Andy Warhol are repetitive and they are made in a non-painterly commercial manner.|$|E
