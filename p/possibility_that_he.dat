5|$|In {{view of the}} {{scarcity}} of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's hasty trial and execution as contrary {{to the principles of}} justice. The <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she {{may be able to}} ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal {{plaintiff}} in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is one means of circumventing the requirement of standing {{on the part of the}} individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E

50|$|Walid Jumblatt, {{the former}} March 14 member {{and head of}} the PSP, {{traveled}} to Syria to discuss the crisis with al-Assad amid <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could be a kingmaker in forming a new government. His Democratic Gathering bloc was scheduled to meet on 16 January to discuss its stance over the parliamentary consultations.|$|R
5|$|According to Ammianus, a deserter {{informed}} Chnodomar that Julian had 13,000 {{men with}} him at Saverne. But this leaves open the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have summoned more to join him for the battle. It is possible that Severus' division was additional, as it is stated that while Julian was at Saverne, Severus' men occupied a separate camp near Barbatio's army. Libanius implies that Julian had 15,000 men under his command. If this was true, the additional 2,000 may have been Severus' division. Also, Julian may {{have been able to}} call on some limitanei units to join his comitatus for the campaign. Zosimus states that on arrival in Gaul, Julian set about a major recruitment drive. This would mainly have aimed at reconstituting limitanei regiments that had largely dissolved during the years of anarchy. Julian's force may therefore have numbered somewhat more than 15,000.|$|E
5|$|When the Buccaneers {{selected}} University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde first {{overall in}} the 1987 NFL Draft, starting quarterback Steve Young became expendable. He {{was traded to the}} 49ers on April 24, 1987. The 49ers were concerned about the health of Joe Montana, and were preparing for the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might not recover from back surgery. The Buccaneers received 2nd and 4th round draft picks in the trade, picks 50 and 106 overall, which they used to draft University of Miami linebacker Winston Moss and Arizona State wide receiver Bruce Hill. They also received an unspecified amount of cash in the deal. Young would spend the final 13 years of his career with the 49ers, a stint which would help him secure a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mercer, who {{was then}} {{coaching}} the England schools team, urged Busby to sign Edwards, who was also attracting interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Aston Villa. Edwards signed for United as an amateur on 2 June 1952, but accounts of when he signed his first professional contract vary. Some reports state that it occurred on his 17th birthday in October 1953, but others contend that it took place a year earlier. Those accounts that favour the earlier date usually state that a club official, either Busby himself or coach Bert Whalley, arrived at the Edwards family home soon after midnight to secure the youngster's signature as early as possible, but other reports claim that this occurred when he signed his amateur contract. Wolves manager Stan Cullis was indignant at missing out on a highly touted local youngster and accused United of improperly offering financial inducements to Edwards or his family, but Edwards maintained that he {{had always wanted to}} play for the Lancashire team. To guard against the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might not make a success of his football career, he also began an apprenticeship as a carpenter.|$|E
50|$|His {{style is}} a skilful blend {{of the organic}} with geometry, of order with dissonance, of precise vision with suggestion. It is a whole {{language}} in itself, sincretic, and bearing a strong current of delight springing from the <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> coaxes from the materials, methods and tools he uses to work with, the very keys to his paintings.|$|R
50|$|Whilst researching a {{book called}} Russian Comfrey, Hills {{discovered}} that this common plant {{was introduced in the}} nineteenth century by Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) a Quaker smallholder who was so intrigued by its <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> devoted {{the rest of his life}} to popularising it. Hills took up this crusade, finally naming his fledgling society in Doubleday's memory.|$|R
50|$|When {{the energy}} healer finished, Ruben {{expressed}} a wish to learn {{everything about the}} method he was using. The healer gave him a book called “Caucasian Yoga” by Count Stefan Colonna Walewski. It was hand-written in Russian {{and was the first}} step in Ruben’s self-tutoring. With this book came an understanding of human energy and a glance at the <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had within himself.|$|R
5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might begin killing all criminals.|$|E
25|$|After the 2009 season Marquis {{became a}} free agent. The Rockies offered him arbitration, but he {{rejected}} their {{offer of a}} one-year, non-guaranteed deal for the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will receive a multi-year deal.|$|E
25|$|Compagnoni {{gave the}} {{explanation}} that {{his decision to}} change the agreed site of the camp was to avoid an overhanging serac, but Bonatti accused both (and the facts would later give him reason) to have deliberately changed the location to exclude the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could join in the summit climb.|$|E
5000|$|Later in the Faune, Debussy {{builds a}} complex texture, where, as Austin says, “Polyphony and {{orchestration}} overlap...He adds {{to all the}} devices of Mozart, Weber, Berlioz and Wagner the <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> learned from the heterophonic music of the Far East.... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost {{the same way that}} the smallest bells of a Javanese gamelan vary the slower basic melody.” ...|$|R
6000|$|While {{the fireman}} was {{lowering}} the feeding hose, Bob Tidball, [...] "Shark" [...] Dodson and a quarter-bred Creek Indian called John Big Dog climbed {{on the engine}} and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that they carried. These orifices so impressed the engineer with their <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> raised both hands in a gesture such as accompanies the ejaculation [...] "Do tell!" ...|$|R
50|$|Another <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was in fact}} {{originally}} {{derived from}} a third St Theodore called St Theodore Orientalis from Anatolia.|$|R
25|$|It's {{possible}} that he had received some sort of formal education in Galway, studying English, Latin and some Greek. This is inferred from his use of all three languages in his works. There is also the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> received additional training at the Mac Aodhagáin bardic school located at Ballymacegan, Lough Derg, County Tipperary, which was run by noted scholar, Flann Mac Aodhagáin.|$|E
25|$|Also on August 10, Abdel Aziz did {{not exclude}} the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or {{other members of}} the junta could run for President, {{although}} he said that the issue had not been decided and that other things needed to be dealt with first. His acknowledgement of the possibility was in contrast to the decision of the previous junta in 2005 to exclude its members from running for office.|$|E
25|$|We {{should note}} that Descartes' doubt is a methodological and {{rational}} doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is {{trying to set up}} this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.|$|E
50|$|The {{place of}} Luo's birth and date are a {{controversial}} question. One <b>possibility</b> was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was from Taiyuan, {{and lived in}} the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty by the record of his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), who said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had met him in 1364. Another <b>possibility</b> was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born in Dongyuan, the province of Shangdong, in about 1280 - 1360. Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including Hangzhou and Jiangnan.|$|R
50|$|In 1004 or 1005, Ragnall died in Munster. His {{death is}} {{recorded}} by the eleventh - fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, the fifteenth - sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, and the twelfth-century Chronicon Scotorum. The circumstances surrounding Ragnall's demise are uncertain. One <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was attempting {{to take control of}} Limerick. Another <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have been exiled from the Isles, which could account for the fact that no military engagement is associated with his obituaries.|$|R
50|$|Domitianus's fate is unknown. One <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was either}} {{executed}} by Tetricus or, more likely, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was murdered by}} his own troops when the main Rhine army garrisons declared for Tetricus. A second <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was defeated by Placidianus, a general loyal to Aurelian who had been stationed to guard the lower Rhone valley during Victorinus' assault on Autun in 270. This would suggest that his rebellion took place in southern Gaul, near enough to the central empire's provinces to be of concern to Aurelian.|$|R
25|$|Yeltsin's {{personal}} and health problems received {{a great deal}} of attention in the global press. As the years went on, he was often viewed as an increasingly unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure he was once seen as. The <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might die in office was often discussed. Starting in the last years of his presidential term, Yeltsin's primary residence was the Gorki-9 presidential dacha west of Moscow. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in Barvikha.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore was {{haunted by}} his sad family history. In particular, he was riddled with guilt over the {{circumstances}} surrounding the death of his sister. He felt enormous remorse for his selfishness and was tortured {{for the rest of his}} life by the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have been the one who cast the spell that killed his sister. When he looked into the Mirror of Erised, he saw himself redeemed in the eyes of his brother and his entire family alive and together.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{consider}} national defense, {{a standard}} {{example of a}} pure public good. Suppose homo economicus thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all {{of the millions of}} other people in the country. There is also a very high <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or she could get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service.|$|E
50|$|Random crime: Another <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not {{targeted}} for any particular reason, {{but rather that}} the crime came {{to him as a}} result of general lawlessness.|$|R

25|$|During {{practice}} in Xi'an {{weeks before the}} Olympic games, Fabriga suffered a waist injury that seriously hampered the pace of his training. Both he and his coach admitted that his performance in the games would inevitably {{be affected by the}} injury, with the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be unable to finish his dive. In the preliminary stage of the competition, Fabriga's opening dive was the least impressive of the round, and he went on to finish the preliminaries in 28th place in a field of 30.|$|E
25|$|Anton Chigurh kills or {{tries to}} kill almost every person he meets {{in the film}} version. The only people he spares are the gas station {{proprietor}} (who correctly guesses Chigurh's coin flip), {{the woman at the}} trailer park office when Chigurh hears a toilet flush in a nearby room, the woman at the motel front desk and the two bicycle riding kids who give Chigurh one of their shirts after his car accident. There is a small <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> left the accountant alive as well.|$|E
25|$|Tobin's {{candidacy}} {{raised the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would become the}} city's first ever elected black mayor. By {{the time of the}} 2000 census, Minden had become 52 percent black. Businessman Bill Robertson, {{a former member of the}} Minden City Council and the then president of the Webster Parish Police Jury, the parish's governing board, also ran for mayor, as did real estate agent Peggy J. Staples (1933–2009), who was a member of the city council from 1978 to 1990, the first woman ever elected to the governing body.|$|E
5000|$|David is left {{troubled by}} the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> facing a battle with {{testicular}} cancer, and is caught trying {{to take a picture}} of his testicles with his pants down by Leyla. She then takes a picture for him. While they talk about David's impending battle, the pair hug and David says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "loves" [...] Leyla, which Jacob overhears, and wrongly assumes David and Leyla to be an item. The following day; his 13th birthday, he confronts them about their encounter, and David sets the record straight, in the process telling Jacob <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have cancer. Their bond is strengthened because of this.|$|R
2500|$|The {{profound}} ambivalence of the opera's central character, Henri (clearly representing Pousseur himself), {{faced with}} the extreme plurality of <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> encounters, {{as well as the}} open-ended nature of the opera as a whole, may be a sign of Pousseur's [...] "desire not to impose any particular solution in the search for musical alternatives to high modernism. Through Henri's uncertainty and resistance to embark on any particular aesthetic path, Pousseur suggests that his own aesthetic questioning and soul-searching remained unresolved at the time he composed Votre Faust" [...]|$|R
