40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the diffusion of}} zinc into InP/InGaAs avalanche photodiode structures using dimethylzinc in an MOCVD reactor. Diffusion profiles were measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry and compared with cleaved cross-sections imaged by scanning electron microscopy, in order to accurately target the diffusion depth for device fabrication. The dependence of the diffusion depth on the diffusion temperature, partial pressures of dimethylzinc and phosphine, and diffusion time is reported. Diffused devices exhibit, in some cases, a step increase in dark current {{at or near the}} <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage.</b> We show that the dark current above the <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage</b> is proportional to the junction area and originates in the bulk of the material. The dependence of this bulk dark current contribution on the diffusion process parameters has been studied in detail, and a reduction of three orders of magnitude was achieved.

40|$|A novel {{process is}} {{proposed}} to self-align the emitter and extrinsic base in a bipolar transistor. The process {{involves the use}} of double thermal oxidation and RIE to create a steep oxide emitter sidewall. The method avoids the potential problems of LPCVD oxide and can remove the residual poly on the extrinsic base, both of which lead to base-emitter shorts. It also eliminates the need for growth of adhesion oxide and annealing of LPCVD oxide. The devices thus fabricated exhibit a high current gain of 130 and high <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage</b> of 20 V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Turning off a SiC VJFET from INFINEON {{requires}} {{to apply}} a gate-to-source voltage comprised between the JFET gate threshold voltage and the <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage.</b> Unfortunately, for applications operating over a large temperature range, these two limits vary with the temperature and reduce the useful blocking gate-to-source voltage range as the temperature rises. So, the punch-through temperature dependence {{is a very important}} feature for applications operating in a wide temperature range like aeronautic applications. This paper addresses the analysis and modeling of the punch-through phenomenon and its dependence to the temperature. The proposed model gives a good agreement with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The main {{punch-through}} characteristics {{have been}} studied on Field Oxide FETs (FOXFETs) used for microstrip biasing in Si detectors. The voltage current DC curves {{have been studied}} on devices with different channel widwength ratios, fabricated on Si substrates with Merent doping levels. The <b>punch-through</b> threshold <b>voltage</b> depends on the positive charge in the gate oxide, device layout and temperature. The relation between punch-through current and dynamic resistance is insensitive to charge accumulation in the gate oxide induced by irradiation and to different Si donor doping levels. Dynarmc resistance however varies as the doping changes from n- to p-type, and it also depends on the Si bulk damage induced by neutron irradation. The AC impedance will reproduce the DC dynamic resistance, but show also large effects due to parasitic capacitance, which dominates the FOXFET response at high frequency and can affect the detector performance...|$|R
30|$|We {{found that}} the device {{performance}} is greatly influenced by the electric field distribution. To maintain the high gain and small dark current, the proper control of the electrical field in the multiplication and absorption layers is important. From the ref. [32], a suitable field distribution in InGaAs/InAlAs APD should comply with those rules. The guarantee Vpt (<b>punch-through</b> voltage)[*]<[*]Vbr (breakdown <b>voltage)</b> and Vbr-Vpt should have a safety margin for processing variations in temperature fluctuations and operation range. At breakdown voltage, the multiplication gain goes toward infinity and the current sudden increase [32]. When the dark or photo current reached 50  μA, the corresponding voltage is called breakdown voltage Vbr. In the absorption layer, the electric field should be larger than 50 – 100  kV/cm to ensure enough velocity for the photo-induced carriers. Concurrently, the electric field must be less than 180  kV/cm to avoid the tunneling effect in the absorption layer. Electric field distribution greatly influences the device performance. The choice of electric field in the absorption layer has a balancing of the trade-off between small transit time, dark current, and high responsivity for the practical requirement.|$|R
30|$|Studies on InGaAs/InAlAs APDs have {{mainly focused}} on {{increasing}} the single-photon detection efficiency (SPDE) and decreasing the DCR in SPADs. Karve et al. demonstrated the first InGaAs/InAlAs SAPDs, {{which has a}} SPDE of 16 % at 130  K [18]. Nakata et al. improved the temperature performance of SPADs, which achieves a SPDE of 10 % at 213  K [19]. Zhao et al. designed a self-quenching and self-recovering InGaAs /InAlAs SPAD with a SPDE of 11.5 % at 160  K; concurrently, a DCR of 3.3  M[*]Hz has been observed [20]. Meng et al. designed a mesa structure InGaAs/InAlAs SPAD, which achieves a SPDE of 21 % at 260  K [21]. Then, they applied a thick absorption and multiplication layer in a similar structure, which improves the SPDE to 26 % at 210  K and decreases the DCR to 1 [*]×[*] 108  Hz [22]. However, in these studies, the DCRs of InGaAs/InAlAs SPADs are too high compared with InGaAs/InP SPADs (in recent InP SPADs, DCRs are typical <[*] 104  Hz) [23]. The high DCRs in InGaAs/InAlAs SPADs are attributed to tunneling currents, which {{is caused by the}} high field at the over bias voltage [21, 22, 24]. Thus, decreasing tunneling-related mechanisms is significant for InGaAs/InAlAs SPADs, and these mechanisms are related to the electric-field distribution in SAPDs. From literatures [1. 9], the tunneling threshold electric field is 2.0 [*]×[*] 105  V/cm in the absorption layer (InGaAs) and 6.8 [*]×[*] 105  V/cm in the multiplication layer (InAlAs). Thus, a suitable electric-field distribution is significant for InAlAs SPADs, which is determined by the charge-layer and multiplication-layer thickness. Considering the charge layer of InAlAs APDs, Kleinow et al. studied the influence of doping concentration in this layer and found that doping concentration is more important for the performance of InGaAs/InAlAs APDs [25, 26]. Chen et al. studied the influence of the charge and multiplication layers on <b>punch-through</b> and breakdown <b>voltages</b> by theoretical analysis and simulation [27]. These studies have focused on the performance of InAlAs APDs under the linear model. However, the performance of InAlAs SPADs has not yet been fully understood under the Geiger mode.|$|R
40|$|Dealing with {{large-scale}} {{application of}} semiconductor detectors, {{one of the}} keystones is to ensure the robustness and long-term electrical stability. A phenomenon that can compromise {{the performance of a}} system based on these detectors is the dependence of the punch-through effect on the environmental conditions. In this paper we investigated the influence of humidity on the punch-through in microstrip and drift silicon detectors. Simulations and laboratory measurements on different prototypes were performed. Data analysis allowed to determine a special solution for the design of the cathode metallisation mask that reduces in a substantial way the evolution of the <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage</b> due to humidity influence...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the materials properties and dark currents of planar InP/InGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) {{in which the}} p-dopant, Zn, is introduced by diffusion in an MOCVD reactor using dimethylzinc (DMZn) as the source. APD dark currents are compared with low-temperature photoluminescence (PL), electrochemical capacitance-voltage (ECV) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurements of layers diffused under {{the same set of}} conditions. Device dark currents exhibit both surface-related and bulk contributions, with the bulk contribution appearing as a step increase in the current near the <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage.</b> The bulk dark current contribution depends on the diffusion process parameters and is correlated with the total Zn incorporation and the intensities of the InP and InGaAs PL peaks. A variation of three orders of magnitude is observed in the bulk dark current contribution as diffusion conditions are varied. 9 2013. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
30|$|The current mapping in Fig.  5 b {{shows that}} the {{nanowires}} in Fig.  5 a are initially non-conducting, with only several spots showing current flow. To better investigate why the nanowires are non-conducting, we performed an I-V characterization on individual nanowires. The range of the sample voltage sweep is from − 10 to 10 V, with the resulting tip current ranging from − 10 to 10 nA, which {{is limited by the}} AFM system specification. The result is shown in Fig.  5 c. For the first sweep, we find that the nanowires exhibit very high turn-on voltage, indicating a Schottky contact behavior between the n-GaN and ITO layer. However, after repeating the measurement, we find that the turn-on voltage of the I-V curve has been significantly reduced, attributed to the lowering of the Schottky barrier height. We observed this trend of reduced turn-on voltage after the initial <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage</b> sweep across multiple nanowires in the AFM scan area shown in Fig.  5 d, confirming that this applies to all of the nanowires grown on ITO. The exact mechanism of the lowering of the turn-on voltage still requires further investigation. Previous reports have shown that applying a high voltage to the material might have induced current-carrying paths through electrical breakdown [21, 22], or modify the structure of the GaN nanowire itself [23] leading to improvement in turn-on voltage.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation's research was to develop single-photon detectors with high detection efficiencies for photodetection application, as well as solar cells with high conversion efficiencies and radiance resistance for photovoltaic space applications. Hetero-PN-junctions, which can provide unique material combinations, were utilized {{in order to accomplish}} these goals. One of research focuses is on the high efficient four-junction solar cells using AlAsSb, InP, InGaAsP and InGaAs materials for space applications. The temperature and radiation effect on these solar cells performance were discussed. The effect of cell structure on the radiation response was studied. We fabricated the 1. 0 eV InGaAsP cell, which is critical for this four-junction solar cell. A heterojunction AlInAs/InP tunnel diode, which interconnects the cells, was designed, fabricated and tested with low zero-bias resistivity of 4. 76 × 10 - 3 ? cm 2 and high peak tunnel current of 147 A/cm 2. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with the structure of a single-avalanche-stage were proposed to achieve high gain, high speed, and low noise operation for telecommunication applications. Simulation results show {{that it is possible to}} realize such a device with the InGaAs/InGaAlAs/InAlAs/InGaAsP/InGaAs materials system by combing the high doping with the heterojunction band discontinuity. Mesa-terminated N = 1 APDs were fabricated with the procedure developed using the equipment and facilities available at UMBC cleanroom. Multiplication gains were demonstrated at low bias voltages of ~ 7 V. The results show the dark current decreased a factor of 10 at a gain of 10 by changing the p-dopant from Zn to carbon. We believe that the high performance device can be obtained by carefully controlling the doping profile. Photon counting (PC) detection devices in the 1. 0 - 1. 6 µm wavelength range are important for LIDAR image, remote sensing, standoff chemical detection, and deep-space communications. Lacking of sufficient single photon detection efficiency (SPDE), one of the most important performance metrics, has been a primary issue for PC devices operating at the near infrared wavelength range. A method to improve single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) performance was proposed by reducing the voltage difference between the <b>punch-through</b> and breakdown <b>voltages</b> of APDs. SPADs based on the proposed structure were fabricated. Results demonstrate the improvement in the leakage current and the I-V characteristics of APDs. Device's dark count probability (DCP) and SPDE were measured using our innovative gated current bias scheme under different operating conditions to obtain a maximum SPDE. We found that the SPDE can be enhanced with the proposed structure and a SPDE of ~ 25 % was achieved...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} silicon carbide (SiC) {{microwave}} devices. It treats two devices; the Schottky diode and the metal semiconductor {{field effect transistor}} (MESFET). Different MESFET materials, fabrication processes, theoretical models for physical simulation, and device models are presented. The aim of this work {{is to improve the}} understanding of these devices and their performance by careful design. An optimisation design technique for the SiC microwave Schottky diode is developed. Depending of the desired <b>punch-through</b> <b>voltage</b> a certain calculated drift layer thickness and doping concentration for the Schottky diode provides an optimum when designing for cut-off frequency. Schottky diodes that behave according to the models presented are demonstrated. For a 5 µm anode radius diode a cut-off frequency (f cut) of 91 GHz was calculated. To our knowledge this is the highest f cut presented for a SiC Schottky diode. A singly balanced diode mixer was measured. The input third order intermodulation intercept point is 31 dBm. The mixer has a conversion loss of 5. 0 dB at 850 MHz RF. Eleven MESFET structures have been investigated both by physical drift-diffusion (DD) simulations, and measurements. The models used in the DD simulations are described in detail, and approximations of published data have been presented. In particular different buffer structures, and their influence on device performance have been investigated. Measurements on 11 different MESFET materials are presented. In the research performed at Chalmers, devices with very good DC characteristics have been manufactured. The best RF device has a saturated drain current of 270 mA/mm, a maximum transconductance of 35 mS/mm, a breakdown voltage of > 100 V, and a pinch-off voltage of - 15 V. The high frequency performance of this device are an f max of 27 GHz, an f T,ext of 8 GHz, and an output power density of 3. 2 W/mm with an associated gain of 14 dB at 3 GHz. A resistive FET mixer using a 3. 2 mm gate periphery MESFET is presented, and it had a conversion loss of 10 dB, and a IIP 3 of 36 dBm at 3. 3 GHz. A small signal model for the MESFET in coldFET operation is given...|$|E
