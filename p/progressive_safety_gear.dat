40|$|The paper {{presents}} an analysis {{and assessment of}} recorded accelerations acting on Hybrid III dummy during emergency braking of a passenger lift. The dummy was equipped with a system of three-axis accelerometers. The type of <b>progressive</b> <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> that has the shortest time of reaction and the shortest effective braking distance in its group, was chosen for tests. The tests were carried out on an emplacement, which simulated the movement of passenger lift. Tests of emergency braking were performed at variable load of a cabin corresponding to the mass of different passengers number. The cabin was dispelled by the gravity force using its free-fall. During the braking, the values of accelerations effected on individual parts of dummy, were measured. Based on them and using HIC and Nij indexes, the impact of temporary accelerations on passenger’s health was determined...|$|E

In addition, the paper investigates the work conditions of <b>safety</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>gears</b> at emergency braking. The experimental results show agreement with the numerical results...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} {{risk factors for}} injury, injury prevalence, <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> use, and skating habits of adult recreational in-line skaters. METHODS: Randomly selected in-line skaters in 6 major US cities were interviewed. RESULTS: Only 6 % of skaters consistently wore all 4 recommended types of <b>safety</b> <b>gear.</b> Skaters with greater skating experience {{were more likely to}} perform tricks, wear less <b>safety</b> <b>gear,</b> and sustain an injury. CONCLUSION: More experienced adult recreational in-line skaters are at increased risk for injury. <b>Safety</b> <b>gear</b> use in alarmingly low in adult recreational in-line skaters, especially experienced skaters. Safe skating education programs should consider targeting this newly recognized at-risk skating population...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{kinetic energy}} of lift car will be {{consumed}} by the friction between the <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> and guide rail in emergent braking process. This will lead to remarkable temperate increase of frictional surface. Due to the explosive atmospheres in which the explosive-proof lift servers, the high temperature may result in severe explosion accident. In this paper, an finite element model is developed to analysis this progress. The transient heat flux density is derived from energy transformation progress in <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> action, and applied as boundary condition to the finite element model. Experiments are carried out to measure the temperature increase of <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> frictional surface, and the results show good coincidence of temperature increase tendency between experiments and simulations...|$|R

The present study examines whether risk compensation theory applies to parents' judgments about school age children's permissible risk taking under non-safety <b>gear</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> conditions for seven common play situations. The extent of the child's experience with the activity and parental beliefs about <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> efficacy were examined as possible moderators of extent of children's risk taking allowed by parents...|$|R
40|$|Elevators {{have been}} {{a key element of}} buildings, {{especially}} tall buildings, since their widespread use began in the 19 th century. As a matter of fact, high-rise buildings would not have existed without elevators. Elevators have a myriad of safety features and devices to ensure a safe journey for the passengers. One of these devices is the <b>safety</b> <b>gear.</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>gears</b> are emergency brakes that stop speeding elevators by gripping the guide rails. They are adjusted for a safe deceleration range by the technician during installation and exert a constant force. Due to their purely mechanical nature, once triggered, the <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> is currently unable to actively adjust the braking force to counteract vibrations, to decelerate at different rates, or to stop the elevator at the closest landing. Therefore, the emergency braking event can be harsh and noticeable, leaving the passengers stuck in the elevator shaft after the braking event. This thesis aims to develop an intelligent <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> system that is able to bring the elevator to a stop with a safe and adjustable deceleration rate. This was achieved by first, modeling a computer simulation of a small-scale elevator to be able to quickly simulate different braking event scenarios. Second, a small-scale elevator test rig was constructed to test the computer simulation with physical components. The test rig was validated by comparing its results with KONE’s high-rise <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> test. The control system developed was able to safely stop the moving mass with the desired deceleration {{and a great deal of}} control over other parameters. Further development of the system could lead to a safer, more comfortable, and energy efficient elevator ride...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{behaviour}} {{consists of}} actions, thoughts, and/or protective objects that fearful individuals use {{to reduce their}} anxiety. It can potentially interfere with the progress of exposure therapy, which entails exposing patients to a feared stimulus or situation, but other hypotheses suggest {{that it may not}} be entirely detrimental to treatment effectiveness. This study aims to elucidate the role of safety behaviour in exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders and uses a paradigm of exposure treatment for snake fear. Participants are randomized to one of two conditions, whereby they use either <b>safety</b> <b>gear,</b> such as gloves and goggles, or do not use any <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> during 45 minutes of systematic exposure to a live snake. Measures are administered pre-treatment, immediately following treatment, and 10 minutes post-treatment to assess participants' fear-related cognitions, subjective ratings of fear, and their distance of closest approach to the snake. The results demonstrate that exposure treatment for snake fear is effective irrespective of safety behaviour use, as indicated by pre- to post-treatment differences for both groups of participants on all outcome measures. It was found that participants who used <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> reported cognitive change equivalent to those who did not use <b>safety</b> <b>gear</b> post-treatment, supporting the notion that use of safety behaviour during exposure treatment may promote adaptive cognitive change. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive-behavioural theories of and treatments for anxiety disorders...|$|R
