5|$|Planning {{started in}} 1937, despite there being no legal powers that {{permitted}} motorway construction until {{the introduction of}} the Special Roads Act 1949. Early work was hampered by heavy rainfall, resulting in postponement of various heavy engineering works such as the base foundation; the result of the weather meant the original two-year plan was delayed by a further five months. Weeks after opening, the road had to temporarily close due to water causing further <b>problems,</b> <b>when</b> the base layer was damaged {{as a result of a}} rapid freeze and thaw cycle.|$|E

5|$|There are {{potential}} <b>problems</b> <b>when</b> the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds.

5|$|Anfield could {{accommodate}} {{more than}} 60,000 supporters at its peak, {{and had a}} capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Liverpool to convert Anfield to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, reducing the capacity to 45,276. The findings of the Taylor Report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to <b>problems</b> <b>when</b> it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Cyril's {{employment}} as a policeman causes Betty <b>problems</b> <b>when</b> Keith Lucas (David Webb), {{a man he}} has previously arrested, begins stalking her.

Betty has a breakdown when Cyril dies {{of a heart attack in}} 1974, leaving her only £859. The same year the truth about her illegitimate son is revealed, and when the community discovers this, Betty finds it difficult to face them. She busies herself by taking in lodgers, and acquiring a ginger cat named Marmaduke for extra companionship. Betty builds a relationship with Gordon, though he upsets her occasionally, particularly when he neglects to invite her to his wedding.|$|E

5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop <b>problems</b> <b>when</b> subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Much of Bloodlines {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical <b>problems</b> <b>when</b> it was released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed {{the game and}} typographical errors in on-screen text. Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized {{while waiting for the}} player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants standing still, unable to locate a hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was Bloodlines greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's strong suit, features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.|$|E
5|$|Much of Redemption's {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical <b>problems</b> <b>when</b> it was released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted {{issues with the}} initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point, which meant that dying or technical issues with the game could necessitate them to reload a previous save, and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay. CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having to repeat it was a particular downside. Next Generation, who provided {{the game with a}} score of 3 out of 5, said that Redemption was potentially only a few patches away from being a 5 out of 5 game, if not for technical issues. PC Gamers review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws.|$|E
