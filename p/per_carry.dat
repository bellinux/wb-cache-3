40|$|Power {{control in}} mobile and {{wireless}} ad hoc networks has received increasing research interest in recent years. The main idea of power control is to transmit packets {{at the appropriate}} power levels that guarantee their successful reception, {{with the objective of}} improving the network throughput or lowering the energy consumed by the transmissions. In this thesis, we focus on the study and design of power control algorithms for IEEE 802. 11 -based wireless ad hoc networks to reduce energy consumption <b>per</b> <b>carried</b> byte, without degrading the network throughput. We first examine the routing layer point of view, and study the relationship between the network throughput capacity and the transmission range, which is determined by the transmission power setting. We notably show that there cannot exist a universal power control algorithm to improve the network performance without access to global network information which is inappropriate in ad hoc networks. We thus focus on the MAC layer point of view, where we study the correlations that exist between the required transmission power of RTS, CTS, DATA and ACK frames to guarantee a successful 4 -way handshake and propose novel power control algorithms that take such correlations into consideration in order to reduce energy consumption <b>per</b> <b>carried</b> byte...|$|R

The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game.

New York's resurgence was led {{by some of the}} league's best linemen, such as Ray Flaherty, and future Hall of Famers Red Badgro, and Mel Hein. Hein, the team's center, was acquired in 1931, and also played the linebacker position. He would go on to a fifteen-year NFL career in which, as a center, he became an All-NFL first team selection eight times, and the only offensive lineman ever named league MVP.

Following the 63rd Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech running back Ken Oxendine and Nebraska running back Damon Benning were awarded the honor. Oxendine carried the ball 20 times during the game {{for a total of}} 150 rushing yards—an average of 7.5 yards <b>per</b> <b>carry.</b> He also caught three passes for 60 yards, making him the game's leading receiver as well as its leading rusher.

5|$|In the 1969 season, after a {{slow start}} and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers {{led the league in}} rushing once again with 1,032 yards. He {{averaged}} 4.4 yards <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> and was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears' all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West's leading rusher and its leading receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the back of the game.|$|E
5|$|In week thirteen, the Bears {{visited the}} Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome {{to play the}} Vikings, whom the Bears trailed 50–53–2 in the all-time series. Josh McCown was given the start for the third {{straight}} week, with an expectation that Jay Cutler would return the following week. McCown entered the game having a 65.5 completion percentage for 1,106 yards, seven touchdowns, an interception, and a 100.8 passer rating. As a result, McCown had an advantage over the Vikings' pass defense, which ranked 29th in the league with 282 passing yards allowed, while also allowing quarterbacks to record a 65 completion percentage, 40 attempts per game, and a 97.7 passer rating. Also, the Vikings allowed 31.5 points per game, the worst in the NFL, while recording only 14 turnovers. However, the Bears' defense was a weakness, ranking last in rushing yards allowed per game (145.2), total yards (1,597) and first-downs allowed (89); the defense was 31st in the NFL in yards <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> (4.9), first-down percentage (27.1) and 20-plus yard runs (12). Additionally, the defense allowed running backs in the previous five games to rush for 999 yards, average 5.8 yards <b>per</b> <b>carry,</b> and 197 yards per game. Adrian Peterson ran for an average of 108 yards per game in his career against the Bears, including 120.6 in the last three meetings between the two. Minnesota's rushing game also ran for a year-best 232 yards in the previous week. Cutler, Lance Briggs, Major Wright, Anthony Walters, James Brown, Jonathan Scott, and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the Bears.|$|E
