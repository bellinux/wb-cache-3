30|$|The overall {{procedure}} for viscometry of mixture of asphaltenic crude with a <b>precipitant</b> is presented here: first, several diluted samples of oil with different volumetric ratios of <b>precipitant</b> to oil {{need to be}} prepared. The number of samples is chosen {{in such a manner}} that covers the entire range of <b>precipitant</b> concentration. Escobedo and Mansoori (1995) used 30 samples for their viscometry study. Then, sufficient time should be allotted to prepare samples at thermal equilibrium with environment. After equilibration, viscosity of all the samples should be measured. The next step is to prepare solutions of crude oil in a polar and non-precipitating solvent such as toluene or benzene with the same volume proportions as those of the <b>precipitant</b> in the first step, and then measure the viscosity of oil–non-precipitating solvent mixture. These latter solutions are considered as references with which viscosity of mixtures of crude oil and <b>precipitant</b> is compared. This comparison highlights the point of onset on a graph of viscosity versus solvent or <b>precipitant</b> concentrations. In the end, each sample of oil–precipitant solution is examined under microscope to visually confirm the onset point. The onset of asphaltene precipitation is defined as the lowest <b>precipitant</b> concentration at which the suspended asphaltene could be visually detected.|$|R
30|$|The {{basic idea}} behind this {{methodology}} {{is that there}} should be a sudden change in the IFT value versus precipitation factor (pressure, temperature or concentration of <b>precipitant)</b> as a sign of onset of asphaltene precipitation. An example of such a study is published by Mousavi-Dehghani et al. (2004) where the IFT between water and mixtures of <b>precipitant</b> and various oil samples were measured at 25  °C. Figure  16 shows that there is a slight change in the IFT value with increasing <b>precipitant</b> concentration. This oil sample is a light one with a very small asphaltene content (0.8  wt%). Therefore, IFT was relatively constant at 21  dyne/cm over a wide range of <b>precipitant</b> concentration.|$|R
25|$|The {{isoelectric point}} (pI) is the pH of a {{solution}} at which the net primary charge of a protein becomes zero. At a solution pH that is above the pI {{the surface of the}} protein is predominantly negatively charged and therefore like-charged molecules will exhibit repulsive forces. Likewise, at a solution pH that is below the pI, the surface of the protein is predominantly positively charged and repulsion between proteins occurs. However, at the pI the negative and positive charges cancel, repulsive electrostatic forces are reduced and the attraction forces predominate. The attraction forces will cause aggregation and precipitation. The pI of most proteins is in the pH range of 4–6. Mineral acids, such as hydrochloric and sulfuric acid are used as <b>precipitants.</b> The greatest disadvantage to isoelectric point precipitation is the irreversible denaturation caused by the mineral acids. For this reason isoelectric point precipitation is most often used to precipitate contaminant proteins, rather than the target protein. The precipitation of casein during cheesemaking, or during production of sodium caseinate, is an isoelectric precipitation.|$|E

2500|$|Balancing {{the cost}} of care {{with the quality of}} care is a major issue in {{healthcare}} philosophy. In Canada and some parts of Europe, democratic governments {{play a major role in}} determining how much public money from taxation should be directed towards the healthcare process. In the United States and other parts of Europe, private health insurance corporations as well as government agencies are the agents in this precarious life-and-death balancing act. According to medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber, [...] "Good-quality healthcare means cost-effective healthcare," [...] but [...] "more expensive healthcare does not mean higher-quality healthcare" [...] and [...] "certain minimum standards of quality must be met for all patients" [...] regardless of health insurance status. This statement undoubtedly reflects the varying thought processes going into the bigger picture of a healthcare cost-benefit analysis. In order to streamline this tedious process, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) like BlueCross BlueShield employ large numbers of actuaries (colloquially known as [...] "insurance adjusters") to ascertain the appropriate balance between cost, quality, and necessity in a patient's healthcare plan. A general rule in the health insurance industry is as follows: This generalized rule for healthcare institutions [...] "is perhaps one of the best expressions of the practical meaning of stewardship of resources," [...] especially since [...] "the burden of proof is on justifying the more expensive intervention, not the less expensive one, when different acceptable treatment options exist." [...] And lastly, frivolous lawsuits have been cited as major <b>precipitants</b> of increasing healthcare costs.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Looking {{up at the}} sky, {{we would}} never guess that our {{atmosphere}} contains between one and three billion tons of dust and other particles at any given time. 1 Wind assists in keeping this dust airborne, but gravity wins most of the time, forcing the dust particles earthward, proving the old adage: “what goes up, must come down. ” <b>Precipitant</b> dust levels in the Western Cape do not follow the same pattern as the <b>precipitant</b> dust levels in the summer rainfall areas of South Africa. Due to the very dry summer conditions in the Western Cape, the <b>precipitant</b> dust levels can be very high, especially if sources of fugitive dust are ignored. An environmental consulting company positioned <b>precipitant</b> dust monitoring units at strategic locations, taking process and open dust sources into account. Both wet and dry depositions have been reported on in this report as one figure. Seasonal changes in, and long-term trends of, the amount of <b>precipitant</b> dust were documented and statistically analysed {{to determine if the}} precipitantdust levels were above the South African legislated action levels. The particle size analysis performed on the <b>precipitant</b> dust indicated that the dust was predominantly less than 100 _μm and that about 22 percent of the particles by volume were under 15 _μm. No significant decline in the <b>precipitant</b> dust levels around the calcining industry was noted. Recommendations are that they increase the dust control measures on site, especially near to the DHF sampling location. There was a significant decrease in the <b>precipitant</b> dust levels to the north and south of the smelting industry from October 2001 to April 2005, p-value 0. 005 and 0. 048.

2500|$|The Second Samnite War {{resulted}} from tensions which arose from Roman interventions in Campania. The immediate <b>precipitants</b> were {{the foundation of}} a Roman colony (settlement) at Fregellae in 328 BC and actions taken by the inhabitants of Paleopolis. Fregellae had been a Volscian town on the eastern branch of the River Liris, at the junction with the River Tresus (today’s Sacco)--viz., in Campania and in an area which was to be under Samnite control. It had been taken from the Volsci and destroyed by the Samnites. [...] Paleopolis ("old city") was the older settlement of what is now Naples (which was a Greek city) and was very close to the newer and larger settlement of Neapolis ("new city"). Livy said that it attacked Romans who lived in Campania. Rome asked for redress, but they were rebuffed and she declared war. In 327 BC the two consular armies headed for Campania. The consul Quintus Publilius Philo took on Naples. His colleague Lucius Cornelius Lentulus positioned himself inland to check the movements of the Samnites because of reports {{that there had been a}} levy in Samnium that intended to intervene, in anticipation of a rebellion in Campania. Lentulus set up a permanent camp. The nearby Campanian city of Nola sent 2000 troops to Paleopolis/Neapolis and the Samnites sent 4000. In Rome there was also a report that the Samnites were encouraging rebellions in the towns of Privernum Fundi, and Formiae (Volscian towns north of the River Liris). Rome sent envoys to Samnium. The Samnites denied that they were preparing for war, that they had not interfered in Formiae and Fundi, and said that the Samnite men were not sent to Paleopolis by their government. They also complained about the founding of Fregellae, which they thought was as an act of aggression against them, as they had recently overrun that area. They called for war in Campania.|$|E

30|$|Particles of 0.5  microns in size {{appeared}} {{after about}} 1.4  h; however, smaller asphaltene particles appeared sooner (at 0.9  h) {{but were not}} recognizable in size due to the microscope limitations (Maqbool 2011). The smaller particles were called as “haze” in his study. The onset of asphaltene precipitation (with threshold particle size of 0.5 microns) and that of haze precipitation was measured for two different crudes subject to titration with different heptane concentrations and the data are presented in Fig.  9. It was concluded that the onset time was reduced exponentially with respect to <b>precipitant</b> concentration (Maqbool 2011). This figure demonstrates that based on 24  h of contact time of crude oil K- 1 and <b>precipitant</b> (i.e., common time for asphaltene precipitation tests), all solutions composed of a <b>precipitant</b> concentration of less than 46.5 % (vol/vol) are stable solutions. This statement is of course valid considering only 24  h of residence time. It {{should be noted that}} if the exposure time was extended, more precipitation would have happened. The results could also be analyzed from the <b>precipitant</b> concentration point of view. In other words, if less concentration of <b>precipitant</b> (i.e., lower than 46.5 % by volume) was used, it would have taken more time to attain precipitation and aggregation to the extent of achieving a 0.5 -micron particle size, capable of being detected by optical microscopy. This proves that the dynamics of asphaltene precipitation matter, and a combination of residence time and <b>precipitant</b> concentration plays the essential role in onset of asphaltene precipitation.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{microgravity}} crystal growth hardware is optimized to produce crystals within the limited time available on orbit. This often results in the actual nucleation and growth process being rushed or the system not coming to equilibrium within the limited time available. Longer duration hardware exists, but one cannot readily pick out crystals grown early versus those which nucleated and grew more slowly. We have devised a long duration apparatus, the Multi-chamber Dialysis Unit for Crystallization Kinetics, or McDUCK. This apparatus-is a series of protein chambers, stacked upon a <b>precipitant</b> reservoir chamber. All chambers are separated by a dialysis membrane, which serves to pass small molecules while retaining the protein. The volume of the <b>Precipitant</b> chamber {{is equal to the}} sum of the volumes of the protein chamber. In operation, the appropriate chambers are filled with <b>precipitant</b> solution or protein solution, and the McDUCK is placed standing upright, with the <b>precipitant</b> chamber on the bottom. The <b>precipitant</b> diffuses upwards over time, with the time to reach equilibration a function of the diffusivity of the <b>precipitant</b> and the overall length of the diffusion pathway. Typical equilibration times are approximately 2 - 4 months, and one can readily separate rapid from slow nucleation and growth crystals. An advantage on Earth is that the vertical <b>precipitant</b> concentration gradient dominates that of the solute, thus dampening out solute density gradient driven convective flows. However, large Earth-grown crystals have so far tended to be more two dimensional. Preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of lysozyme crystals grown in McDUCK have indicated that the best, and largest, come from the middle chambers, suggesting that there is an optimal growth rate. Further, the improvements in diffraction resolution have been better signal to noise ratios in the low resolution data, not an increase in resolution overall. Due to the persistently large crystals grown we are currently proposing McDUCK for the growth of macromolecule crystals for use in neutron diffraction studies...|$|R
