5000|$|Republican {{leaders in}} the House of Representatives, {{including}} Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Tom DeLay of Texas and Tom Davis of Virginia, opened a congressional inquiry of the House Government Reform Committee, which was {{to take place in}} Clearwater on March 25, and issued subpoenas for Terri and Michael Schiavo and several hospice workers. Because of her condition, Terri Schiavo obviously {{would not have been able}} to testify; however, the subpoena gave her federal protection as a <b>prospective</b> <b>witness,</b> as it is a federal crime to prevent a person from testifying before Congress. Greer opted to ignore the subpoenas, telling congressional attorneys over a conference call [...] "I have had no cogent reason why the (congressional) committee should intervene." [...] This was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court. [...] Although Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, Sen. Rick Santorum, and Rep. Tom Delay, brought the possibility of sanctioning Greer on charges of Contempt of Congress, Congress did not attempt to enforce the subpoenas or take any action against Greer.|$|E

40|$|A typical {{problem that}} {{international}} criminal tribunals face regarding criminal evidence {{is how to}} deliver justice and ascertain the truth with limited resources, time and mandate while respecting the requirements for a fair trial, the fundamental rights of the accused and the underlying objective of peace. In this respect, international criminal courts and tribunals are called to respect the normative rules established for a fair trial but also to consider the pragmatic objective of the court’s mandate and of the peace process. The case law developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the Special Court of Sierra Leone (SCSL) on granting a defendant’s request to obtain a witness testimony puts forth the debate on pragmatism and normativity in international criminal justice. The article addresses this issue, by reviewing the relevant ICTY, ICTR and SCSL jurisprudence on subpoenas’ requests. After establishing {{the definition of the}} different types of subpoenas and the legal implications that the distinctions bear, the article grapples with the different tests applied by the courts in an attempt to clarify the elaborate legal standards developed by these courts for issuing subpoenas ad testificandum. It then proceeds to examine how by adding more requirements and burden {{on the side of the}} defendant to prove the necessity of a subpoena, the international courts’ interpretation of the relevant rule may compromise the procedural fairness and the principle of equality of arms. The analysis shows that when the court had to adjudicate a subpoena request, it adapted the relevant legal standard by taking into consideration the object of the subpoena, the <b>prospective</b> <b>witness</b> and the court’s role and mandate. The recent ICC jurisprudence on the nature of witness summonses enhances the timeliness of this question. By closely examining the conditions laid down by the international criminal tribunals on issuing subpoenas, the article, sheds new light on the rarely acknowledged issue of the defendants’ right to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses under the same conditions as witnesses against him in international criminal law...|$|E

They concluded that the Three's ability [...] "to mount a vigorous defence has thereby been severely compromised, if not eviscerated".

5000|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} are secret. No {{judge is}} present; the proceedings {{are led by}} a prosecutor; and the defendant {{has no right to}} present his case or (in many instances) to be informed of the proceedings at all. While court reporters usually transcribe the proceedings, the records are sealed. The case for such secrecy was unanimously upheld by the Burger Court in Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 US 211 (1979). The dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Burger and Stewart but concurred with the Court's opinion as to the importance and rationale of grand jury secrecy. Writing for the Court, Justice Powell found that [...] "if preindictment proceedings were made public, many <b>prospective</b> <b>witnesses</b> would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily"; [...] "witnesses who appeared before the grand jury {{would be less likely to}} testify fully and frankly"; and [...] "there also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors". Further, [...] "persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury should not be held up to public ridicule".|$|R
5000|$|The {{landlord}} of the cottage, H. C. Benedict, {{wrote on}} a back of a photo of McPherson {{that there was nothing}} about it that reminded him of the woman who was with Ormiston. Benedict testified Joseph Ryan, Deputy District Attorney, tried very hard to get him to identify the woman in his rented cottage as McPherson, however, he could not. When asked about the photos of McPherson, he answered, [...] "he had a whole squad of them up there...and they been pulling these photographs and saying [...] "do you recognize this" [...] and another one [...] "Do you recognize this?" [...] Biographer Raymond Cox, based on H. C. Benedict's testimony, described the method Ryan used to obtain some of his witnesses. Persons were sought who at least had a brief glimpse of the woman with Ormiston. Ryan would take a sheath of photographs taken of McPherson, as provided by the newspapers and then show them to the <b>prospective</b> <b>witnesses,</b> one photograph at a time. Once the prospect finally agreed that a photo of McPherson resembled the woman with Ormiston, Ryan would have his witness identification.|$|R

40|$|The {{unfolding}} {{of the case}} of Prosecutor v. Vojislav ŠeŠelj at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has been dramatic {{and more than a}} little chaotic. The author argues that it is diagnostic of a broader crisis at the Tribunal. As an experiment in international justice, the ad hoc tribunal model has proved to be expensive and slow, but on several points also procedurally arbitrary, intellectually unconvincing, and vulnerable to improper political considerations. These problems have attained a critical mass in ŠeŠelj’s case, as illustrated here. The accused ŠeŠelj, an ultranationalist politician and former paramilitary leader, has vowed to bring the Tribunal to its knees. He is self- represented at trial. This privilege was twice reaffirmed in 2006 by the ICTY Appeals Chamber, having been twice revoked by a bench of trial judges. In 2007, the new pre-trial judge in the case (now presiding judge), Jean-Claude Antonetti, declared that a self-represented accused who can prove indigence is entitled to legal aid. He ordered the Registrar of the Tribunal to pay ŠeŠelj’s defence expenses from the Tribunal’s legal aid budget if ŠeŠelj could prove his indigence. The author argues that while there is good reason to disburse legal aid funds to an indigent accused who has been granted privileges of self-representation, this entitlement was not convincingly explained by Antonetti. Moreover, ŠeŠelj’s destructive aims were improperly set aside by Antonetti in reaching his decision on the public financing of his defence. The current situation, which represents the combined effort of the Appeals Chamber and Antonetti, allows ŠeŠelj to bully participants in the proceedings, issue thinly veiled threats to <b>prospective</b> <b>witnesses</b> and the public at large, and bend the trial procedure to the requirements of his political populism. The poor handling of this case by the Tribunal as a whole calls into question the ad hoc tribunal model of international criminal justice. 23 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The Jencks Act, , {{provides}} {{that the government}} (prosecutor) is required to produce a verbatim statement or report made by a government <b>witness</b> or <b>prospective</b> government <b>witness</b> (other than the defendant), but only after the witness has testified. Jencks material is evidence that {{is used in the}} course of a federal criminal prosecution in the United States. It usually consists of documents relied upon by government witnesses who testify at trial. The material is described as inculpatory, favoring the United States government’s prosecution of a criminal defendant. The Jencks Act also covers other documents related to the testimony, or relied upon by government witnesses at trial. Typically, the material may consist of police notes, memoranda, reports, summaries, letters, related to an indictment or verbatim transcripts used by government agents or employees to testify at trial. This also includes a witness's grand jury testimony, if the witness testified at trial.|$|R
25|$|The Jencks Act governs {{production}} of statements and reports of prosecution witnesses during federal criminal trials.

After testimony of the witness, called by the government on direct examination, the court must, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement of the witness in the possession of the government. If the entire contents of any such statement relate to {{the subject matter of the}} testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.|$|R
40|$|Delay {{in calling}} {{emergency}} medical services following stroke limits access to early treatment that can reduce disability. Emergency medical services contact is mostly initiated by stroke witnesses (often relatives), rather than stroke patients. This study explored appraisal and behavioural factors that are potentially important in influencing witness behaviour in response to stroke. Semi-structured interviews with 26 stroke witnesses were transcribed and theory-guided content analysed was undertaken based on the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (appraisal processes) and Theory Domains Framework (behavioural determinants). Response behaviours were often influenced by heuristics-guided appraisal (i. e. mental rules of thumb). Some witnesses described their responses to the situation as 'automatic' and 'instinctive', rather than products of deliberation. Potential behavioural influences included: environmental context and resources (e. g. time of day), social influence (e. g. prompts from patients) and beliefs about consequences (e. g. 999 accesses rapid help). Findings are based on retrospective accounts and need further verification in <b>prospective</b> studies. <b>Witnesses</b> {{play a key role}} in patient access to {{emergency medical services}}. Factors that potentially influence witnesses' responses to stroke were identified and could inform behavioural interventions and future research. Interventions might benefit from linking automatic/instinctive threat perceptions with deliberate appraisal of stroke symptoms, prompting action to call emergency medical services...|$|R

40|$|Few {{longitudinal}} {{studies have examined}} the pathways through which family violence leads to dating aggression. In the current study the authors used 3 waves of data obtained from 8 th- and 9 th-grade adolescents (N = 1, 965) to examine the hypotheses that the <b>prospective</b> relationship between <b>witnessing</b> family violence and directly experiencing violence and physical dating aggression perpetration is mediated by 3 constructs: (a) normative beliefs about dating aggression (norms), (b) anger dysregulation, and (c) depression. Results from cross-lagged regression models suggest that the relationship between having been hit by an adult and dating aggression is mediated by changes in norms and anger dysregulation, but not depression. No evidence of indirect effects from witnessing family violence to dating aggression was found through any of the proposed mediators. Taken together, the findings suggest that anger dysregulation and normative beliefs are potential targets for dating abuse prevention efforts aimed at youth who have directly experienced violence.

40|$|Survival {{of cardiac}} arrest is {{improved}} by basic life support (BLS). This {{study investigated the}} relationship between ventricular fibrillation (VF) characteristics and survival. In a 2 -year <b>prospective</b> study out-of-hospital <b>witnessed</b> non-traumatic cardiac arrests were observed. The probabilities of recording VF, asystole or other rhythms in relation to BLS and the time to the rhythm recording were analyzed with logistic regression. Amplitude and baseline crossings of VF were related to survival, using linear regression analysis. In 873 patients, the probability to record VF decreased per minute (OR 0. 92, 95 %CI 0. 89 - 0. 95) and of asystole increased (OR 1. 13, 95 %CI 1. 09 - 1. 18) as time from collapse elapsed. BLS reduced these trends significantly for VF (OR 0. 97, 95 %CI 0. 94 - 0. 99) and asystole (OR 1. 09, 95 %CI 1. 05 - 1. 13). This effect was not observed for other rhythms. The amplitude of VF decreased in time; significantly less for patients who received BLS than {{for those who did}} not (p = 0. 009). Survival significantly decreased with lower amplitude of VF (OR 0. 23 per mV, 95 %CI 0. 07 - 0. 79) and with less baseline crossings (OR 0. 80 per baseline crossings per second, 95 %CI 0. 71 - 0. 91). Our study demonstrated that BLS and VF as initial rhythm, considered being 'baseline' predictors in survival models, were proved not independent of each other. The decrease of VF amplitude and increase in prevalence of asystole is slowed significantly by BLS. Predicting survival from VF amplitude and baseline crossings alone is limited.
