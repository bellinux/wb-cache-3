50|$|The {{conservation}} {{status of the}} <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> has been changing quite {{a bit in the}} past few years. This is partly because its status is dependent on where the species population is. In Canada, the <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> is currently listed as endangered but the status varies by state in the United States. This species has been declining through the upper midwest because of turbidity, decreasing vegetation, and invasive species within its home. There are multiple subpopulations of <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> but there is limited connection between the different populations because of low dispersal potential. It was listed as Near Threatened in 2010 but as of 2014, the <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> has been of Least Concern status. It has patterns of population decline so it is continually on concern conservation attention.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> genus name Notropis {{comes from}} Greek descent {{and it is}} a name given to shriveled-like specimens. It {{translates}} to the words [...] "back keel". The species name anogenus is also from Greek descent and it translates to [...] "without a chain".|$|E
50|$|Although {{it is not}} an {{abundant}} species, the <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> can be found inhabiting weedy, clear lakes and slow-moving streams throughout its temperate, freshwater range. When temperatures are warmer, this fish is found in shallow water but when it cools down in the winter months, it is found in waters as deep as 2 meters. The <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> is a great indicator for healthy ecosystems because it is very sensitive to its environment because it is intolerant to turbidity. Their diets tend to consist of filamentous algae and cladocera (water fleas), eggs, insects, worms, and anything else under 2mm. Their predators consist of any omnivorous fish that is larger than this shiner. They are mid to low level consumers and therefore take little part in the transfer of nutrients.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> {{is a type}} of minnow {{that can}} live for up to 3 years and is able to reach sizes between 20-60mm, {{although}} it is about 47mm on average. It has a lateral dark stripe on the side of its body that runs from the tip of the caudal fin, through the eye, and to the nose tip. It has a small, terminal mouth angled upwards, giving it the pug-nose appearance. The abdominal region is yellow, and it has a clear-colored tail fin. Each fish has about 34-37 round, silver cycloid scales covering its body which has a [...] shape to help the pugose shiner swim against the constant stream currents. The pelvic fins are in the abdominal position. Because it is a ray-finned species, the fin rays are used as elements to support the skeletal features. The <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> has an 8-rayed dorsal fin on top of the dusky-colored back, a feature separating it from the pugnose minnow. This fish is also the only Minnesota Notropis species that has a darkly pigmented peritoneum.|$|E
50|$|Supporting {{approximately}} 1201 sq mi of watershed environment, {{there are}} over 61 species of fish, including darters, minnows, channel catfish, <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner,</b> greater redhorse, stonecat, river chub and striped shiner. There are also 14 species of freshwater mussel found in the watershed. The swamps and fens adjacent to the river's headwaters support several rare species {{of plants and animals}} and {{play a major role in}} the travels of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis anogenus) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the genus Notropis. It is in the family Cyprinidae which {{consists}} of freshwater carps and minnows. Cyprinidae is the largest fish family which consists of about 369 genera and 3,018 species. Its distribution has been decreasing due to the removal of aquatic plants {{in order to create}} swimming beaches and boating access in freshwater lakes and is now mostly found in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.|$|E
50|$|The sand shiner (Notropis stramineus) and mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) are similar, {{but lack}} a {{prominent}} lateral band. The bridle shiner {{is very similar}} to other black-lined shiners, including the <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> (Notropis anogenus), blackchin shiner (Notropis heterodon) and blacknose shiner (Notropis heterolepis). The bridle shiner can be distinguished from pugnose and blackchin shiners by the lack of pigment on the lower jaw. Blacknose shiners also lack this pigment, but have a more subterminal mouth as well as eight anal rays: bridles typically have seven.|$|E
5000|$|Forest types {{typical in}} and around Wayzata have been [...] "maple-basswood forest, oak forest, lowland {{hardwood}} forest, and floodplain forest. Non-native forest types within the city were predominantly disturbed second growth forest types made up of elm, box elder, ash, cottonwood, with occasional basswood, maple, and oak." [...] Some of the species of plants that are considered invasive in the Wayzata area are purple loosetrife, narrow-leaf cattail, common buckthorn, leafy spurge, tartarian honeysuckle, garlic mustard, reed canary grass, Siberian elm, and Amur maple. Some rare native species have also been spotted in Wayzata, including the Acadian flycatcher, <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner,</b> and red-shouldered hawk.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> is a non-abundant {{species of}} Notropis {{and within the}} United States, it is {{distributed}} across parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. It is native to North America and its historic range was from eastern Ontario and Western New York to North Dakota, Illionios, Indiana, and Ohio, ending in the St. Lawrence River drainage. The population that was once in North Dakota is now thought to be extirpated due to turbity and uprooted vegetation within the freshwater lakes and streams.Also {{can be found in}} Orlando Florida the St. John chain. This minnow can also be found in a few areas of Canada but those ranges have also decreased throughout time so now the Canadian population mostly lies within Ontario.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pugnose</b> <b>shiner</b> reaches sexual {{maturity}} {{between the ages}} of 1 and 2 for both the male and female genders. They are an oviparous species and spawning and fertilization occur in summer between May and July. The female distributes her eggs in shallow water in areas of dense vegetation in which she lays between 530 and 1275 eggs. Once the eggs are fertilized, they generally hatch within one or two days. This species does not spend energy in parental investment so after the eggs are laid and fertilized, the male and female leave the eggs. In pugnose shiners, sexual dimorphism occurs and they have a polygynandrous mating system, meaning that both males and females have multiple mates. Sexes are physically different in that the males' pelvic fins go beyond the anal openings while the females' don't.|$|E
