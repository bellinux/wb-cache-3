5000|$|The fluids {{associated}} with the human body includes air, oxygen, carbondioxide, water, solvents, solutions, suspensions, serum, lymph and blood. The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is [...] "Blood". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. The blood flow in arteries and veins are {{closely linked to the}} blood vessel properties.Carrying the oxygen and nutrients to various tissues and organs of our body, delivering carbon dioxide to the lungs and accepting oxygen, bringing the metabolic by products to the kidneys, regulating the body's defence mechanism, that is, the immune system and facilitating in effective heat and mass transfer across the body are some of the major functions which blood performs in the human body.Blood consists of the red blood cells or erythrocytes, white blood cells or leukocytes, and platelets or thrombocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide are known as Erythrocytes [...] The cells which are involved primarily in phagocytosis (the process of destruction of unknown particulate matter) and immune responses are known as Leukocytes; thrombocytes are the components of blood which are involved in blood clotting. In addition to these 55 to 60 percent of blood by volume consists of plasma. Plasma is the transparent, amber-colored liquid in which the cellular components of blood are suspended. Plasma contains constituents such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and nutrients. Serum is blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed.Blood accounts for 6 to 8 percent of body weight in normal, healthy humans. The density of blood is slightly greater than the density of water at approximately 1060 kg/m3. The increased density comes from the increased density of a red blood cell compared with the density of water or plasma. Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter. Blood Rheology is the study of blood, especially the properties {{associated with}} the deformation and flow of blood. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid. However, often the non-Newtonian effect is very small due to various reasons. Thus, {{it is important to know}} about the blood rheology.One of the characteristics of blood that affects the work required to cause the blood to flow through the arteries is the viscosity of blood. The viscosity of blood is in the range of 3 to 6 cP, or 0.003 to 0.006 Ns/m2. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, which means that the viscosity of blood is not a constant with respect to the rate of shearing strain. In addition to the rate of shearing strain, the viscosity of blood is also dependent on temperature and on the volume <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> that consists of red blood cells. If blood is made stationary for several seconds then clotting begins in the blood, as a result of which the viscosity of the blood increases. When stationary state is disturbed with increasing shear rate, the clot formation is destroyed and the viscosity decreases. Moreover, the orientation of red blood cells present in the blood also effect the viscosity of blood. Thus, we can say that blood is a shear thinning fluid, i.e., viscosity decreases with increase in shear rate. Beyond a shear rate of about 100s^-1, the viscosity is nearly constant and the blood behaves like a Newtonian fluid. Blood is a viscoelastic material, i.e., viscous and elastic because the effective viscosity of blood not only depends on the shear rate but also on the history of shear rate.It is also important to note that the normal blood flows much more easily compared to rigid particles, for the same particle volume fraction. This is due to the fact that red blood cells can accommodate by deforming in order to pass by one another.|$|E

To observe the indicators of milk yield and especially to observe yield in standardized lactation, index of persistence of the lactation line and whole-life yield of these cows. Next, to focus on the reproductive indicators: the insemination interval, the service period and the interval itself. Gathered information was recorded into tables and then statistically evaluated. Also, all groups were mutually compared. Needed information was gathered from GEA Dairy plan program and the milk cow cards. Milk cows, which started the lactation in period from 10. 10. 2014 to 30. 2. 2015, were included into the analyzed group. Generally, 155 pieces of livestock participated here. The milk yield indicators were evaluated as excellent. The groups of cows C 1 and C 2 cows with dominant <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> of Czech Fleckvieh breed, showed significantly better-than-average results when compared with the yield check.

Reproductive indicators were different in comparison from the yield; they were on very low levels.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of geometric factors upon the function of modified Blalock-Taussig anastomoses (mBT) using a computational dynamic code based upon the method of finite elements. METHODS: The mBT operation, performed in 10 patients, was graphically reconstructed to create a parametric 3 -dimensional geometric model. Using Streamline Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin approximations, blood flow and distribution were evaluated in different diameters of subclavian arteries and polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (PTFE) and angles of proximal anastomoses. RESULTS: The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> flow derived through the PTFE grows as its diameter increases in relation to subclavian artery diameter. Variations in the PTFE diameter do not interfere with pulmonary artery flow distribution. An angle of 110 º in proximal anastomoses results in a high <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> derivation to the graft, while angles of 30 º, 60 ºand 90 º present with almost similar flow rates. However, angles of 30 º and 110 º produce an excessive flow {{to one of the}} pulmonary arteries, in detriment of the other. Peak pressure in the PTFE is affected by the proximal angle of anastomosis, with 30 º resulting in higher and 110 º in lower values. As the angle increases, the region of higher pressure shifts from the PTFE to subclavian artery. CONCLUSION: In the experimental model, percentage of flow derived in the PTFE {{is directly related to the}} diameter of the graft. The ratio between the diameters of subclavian artery and graft is an important regulator of flow deviation to the anastomosis. Angles of the anastomosis between the subclavian artery and the PTFE of 60 º to 90 º result in favorable pulmonary artery flow distribution and the location of the peak pressure...|$|E

Design-Cell isolation, monoclonal antibody, phagocytosis and flow cytometric studies. Animals- 4 clinically normal lactating Holstein cows {{for studies on}} CD 14 and CD 18, and 2 for phagocytosis studies. Procedure-Binding of CD 14 and CD 18 monoclonal antibodies to blood and milk neutrophils and mononuclear leukocytes was studied by flow cytometry before and after intramammary injection of LPS, and nonopsonic phagocytosis of E coli by blood neutrophils was determined. Presence of intracellular CD 14 was determined after in vitro incubation of neutrophils in skimmed milk and after fixation and permeabilization of freshly isolated neutrophils. Results-Before LPS injection, <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> neutrophils and large mononuclear (LMO) cells expressing CD 14 averaged 3 and 63 % and 68 and 35 % for mammary neutrophils and LMO cells, respectively. After LPS injection, CD 14 was only detected on blood and mammary LMO cells (61 and 25 %); receptor expression increased by 1. 8 - and threefold, respectively. In vitro incubation of neutrophils in skimmed milk increased the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> neutrophils expressing CD 14. The number <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> neutrophils staining positive for CD 14 increased after permeabilization of the plasma membrane, which was blocked by unlabeled anti-CD 14 monoclonal antibodies. Before LPS, <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> neutrophils and LMO cells expressing CD 18 averaged 93 and 95 % and was 88 and 55 % for mammary neutrophils and LMO cells, respectively. After LPS, <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> mammary neutrophils and LMO cells expressing CD 18 increased to 100 and 95 %, respectively. Expression of CD 18 was 2. 6 -fold higher for mammary neutrophils before injection of LPS, compared with blood neutrophils, either before or after LPS.
