The Piper trilinear diagram {{can be used to}} illustrate the similarities and differences in the composition of waters and to classify them into certain chemical types, while Chadha’s plot can demonstrate the hydrochemical processes like recharging, reverse ion exchange, seawater mixing and base ion exchange chiefly acting in an aquifer. In the present study, piper trilinear diagram classified 93.48  % of the samples under Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–Cl−–SO 4 2 − type indicating the <b>permanent</b> <b>hardness</b> and remaining 6.52  % samples under Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–HCO 3 − type demonstrating temporary hardness. The piper plots further confirmed the existence of mixed type of water with no one cation–anion pair exceeding 50  % in majority of the analyzed samples. Chadha’s plot also demonstrated the dominance of reverse ion exchange water having <b>permanent</b> <b>hardness</b> (viz., Ca–Mg–Cl type) in majority of the samples over recharging water with temporary hardness (i.e., Ca–Mg–HCO 3 type). It is therefore evident that primary salinity and secondary alkalinity were dominant in majority of samples as indicated by permanent (non-carbonate) hardness. In contrast, secondary salinity and primary alkalinity were limited to only few samples as specified by temporary (carbonate) hardness. No typical seawater mixing or base ion exchange was observed in the study area as none of the samples belong to Na–Cl and Na–HCO 3 water types. Both the plots highlighted the contribution from the reverse ion-exchange processes besides the dominance of alkaline earth metals (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) over the alkalis (Na+, K+), and strong acidic anions (Cl−, SO 4 2 −) over the weak acidic anions (CO 3 2 −, HCO 3 −) in the study area. Further, PCA analysis established that water quality parameters under PC 1 and PC 2 (viz., 65.55 and 10.17  % of total variance) having strong loading (> 0.75) was considered to govern the groundwater quality in the study area. While water quality parameters under PC 3 and PC 4 though exhibited strong and positive loading by one parameter each, were considered insignificant due to a lesser percentage of variance (i.e., 6.88 and 6.52  %).

Interestingly, Chadha’s plot also demonstrated the dominance of reverse ion exchange water having <b>permanent</b> <b>hardness</b> (viz., Ca–Mg–Cl type) in majority of the samples over recharging water with temporary hardness (i.e., Ca–Mg–HCO 3 type). Thus, evaluation of hydrochemical facies from both the plots highlighted the contribution from the reverse ion exchange processes in controlling geochemistry of groundwater in the study area. Further, PCA analysis yielded four principal components (PC 1, PC 2, PC 3 and PC 4) with higher eigen values of 1.0 or more, accounting for 65.55, 10.17, 6.88 and 6.52  % of the total variance, respectively. Consequently, majority of the physico-chemical parameters (87.5  %) loaded under PC 1 and PC 2 were having strong positive loading (> 0.75) and these are mainly responsible for regulating the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study area.|$|E
