40|$|Described is a {{fatigue testing}} {{apparatus}} for simultaneously subjecting {{a plurality of}} material test specimens to cyclical tension loading to determine the fatigue strength of the material. The fatigue testing apparatus includes a <b>pulling</b> <b>head</b> having cylinders defined therein which carry reciprocating pistons. The reciprocation of the pistons is determined by cyclical supplies of pressurized fluid to the cylinders. Piston rods extend from the pistons through the <b>pulling</b> <b>head</b> and are attachable to {{one end of the}} test specimens, {{the other end of the}} test specimens being attachable to a fixed base, causing test specimens attached between the piston rods and the base to be subjected to cyclical tension loading. Because all the cylinders share a common pressurized fluid supply, the breaking of a test specimen does not substantially affect the pressure of the fluid supplied to the other cylinders nor the tension applied to the other test specimens...|$|E

25|$|They are {{classified}} under the subfamily Geoemydinae under the family Geoemydidae. Black marsh turtles are cryptodires, having {{the ability to}} <b>pull</b> their <b>heads</b> straight back into the shells; instead of folding their necks sideways along the body like in pleurodiran turtles.|$|R
40|$|Class III {{malocclusion}} is {{very common}} malocclusion and can be due to maxillary retrusion, mandibular prognathism, or combination. Ellis and McNamara found a combination of maxillary retrusion and mandibular protrusion {{to be the most}} common skeletal relationship (30 %). The treatment should be carried out as early as possible for permitting normal growth of the skeletal bases. Reverse <b>pull</b> <b>head</b> gear combined with maxillary expansion can effectively correct skeletal Class III malocclusion due to maxillary deficiency in growing patient. An eight-year-old female patient with chief complaint of prognathic mandible and anterior crossbite was successfully treated in duration of 5 months with facemask and expansion therapy based on Alternate Rapid Maxillary Expansion and Constriction (Alt-RAMEC) protocol...|$|R

50|$|Podocnemis unifilis {{is a type}} of side-necked turtles, {{so called}} because they do not <b>pull</b> their <b>heads</b> {{directly}} into their shells, but rather bend their necks sideways to tuck their heads under the rim of their shells.

5000|$|The annular {{ligament}} secures {{the head}} of the radius from dislocation, which would otherwise tend to occur, from the shallowness of the cup-like surface on {{the head of}} the radius.

"He won't find it so easy though," [...] {{said the}} Chevalier, panting, {{and out of}} breath; but still holding his own, and, indeed, more than his own; for he had fixed his left hand in Denot's hair, and was <b>pulling</b> his <b>head</b> {{backwards}} with such force, that he nearly broke his neck.|$|R
30|$|This {{visualization}} {{contains all}} commits of all clones {{in an integrated}} graph. Each commit is painted according to its existence in the local repository and the peers’ repositories. Ordinary commits that exist locally and in all peers are painted in white. Green commits are ready to be pushed, as they exist locally but do not exist in peers on the push list. Yellow commits need attention because they exist {{in at least one}} peer in the pull list, but do not exist locally, meaning that they may be pulled. Red commits do not exist locally and are not available to be pulled, as they exist only in clones that are not peers. Finally, gray commits belong to non-tracked branches, so they can neither be pushed nor <b>pulled.</b> <b>Heads</b> of these branches are not identified with thicker borders.|$|R

50|$|Reins {{consist of}} leather straps or rope {{attached}} to the outer ends of a bit and extend to the rider's or driver's hands. Reins are {{the means by which}} a horse rider or driver communicates directional commands to the horse's <b>head.</b> <b>Pulling</b> on the reins can be used to steer or stop the horse. The sides of a horse's mouth are sensitive, so pulling on the reins pulls the bit, which then <b>pulls</b> the horse's <b>head</b> from side to side, which is how the horse is controlled.|$|R

50|$|<b>Head</b> <b>pull</b> is an Inuit {{game where}} two people lie belly {{down on the}} ground, <b>pull</b> each other’s <b>heads,</b> and try to move the {{opponent}} across a line. The game is played with a loop placed around the competitors’ heads as they face each other. The loop is placed above the ears, and the game becomes more difficult the higher the loop is placed. The match is complete {{when one of the}} competitors either pulls their opponent across the line or if the loop slips off their opponent’s head.|$|R
