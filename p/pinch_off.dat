5|$|The {{heavy losses}} {{sustained}} by the Heer (army) since the opening of Operation Barbarossa had resulted in a shortage in infantry and artillery. Units were in total 470,000 men understrength. For the Wehrmacht to undertake an offensive in 1943 {{the burden of the}} offensive, in both attacking the Soviet defenses and holding ground on the flanks of the advance, would have to be carried primarily by the panzer divisions. In view of the exposed position of Army Group South, Manstein proposed that his forces should take the strategic defensive. He anticipated that a Soviet offensive would attempt to cut off and destroy Army Group South by a move across the Donets River toward the Dnieper. In February, he proposed waiting for this offensive to develop and then delivering a series of counterattacks into the exposed Soviet flanks. Hitler, concerned about the political implications of taking a defensive stance, and preoccupied with holding the Donbass, rejected this plan. On 10 March, Manstein presented an alternative plan whereby the German forces would <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> the Kursk salient with a rapid offensive commencing as soon as the spring rasputitsa had subsided.|$|E
5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually <b>pinch</b> <b>off.</b> This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 Î¼m in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E

5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually <b>pinch</b> <b>off,</b> enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E
25|$|Viruses {{can remain}} intact from {{apoptosis}} {{in particular in}} the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the apoptotic bodies that <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> {{from the surface of}} the dying cell, and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a host response. This favours the spread of the virus.|$|E

2500|$|Two leading {{mechanisms}} of action {{are thought to}} be responsible for synaptic vesicle recycling: full collapse fusion and the [...] "kiss-and-run" [...] method. Both mechanisms begin with the formation of the synaptic pore that releases transmitter to the extracellular space. After release of the neurotransmitter, the pore can either dilate fully so that the vesicle collapses completely into the synaptic membrane, or it can close rapidly and <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> the membrane to generate kiss-and-run fusion.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the normal}} site of {{infection}} is the gut columnar epithelium, cells are packed closely together and a cell protrusion from one cell will easily push into a neighboring [...] "target" [...] cell without rupturing the target cell membrane or the donor protrusion membrane. At this point, the bacterium {{at the tip}} of the protrusion will begin to undergo [...] "fitful movement" [...] caused by continuing polymerization of actin at its rear. After 7-15 minutes, the donor cell membrane <b>pinches</b> <b>off</b> and fitful movement ceases for 15-25 minutes due to depletion of ATP. Subsequently, the target membrane <b>pinches</b> <b>off</b> (taking 30-150 seconds) and the secondary vacuole containing the bacterium forms inside the target cell cytoplasm.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles. [...] Portions of the outer membrane <b>pinch</b> <b>off,</b> forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials. [...] Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. [...] While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.|$|E
2500|$|Once the vesicles <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> {{from the}} ER they are transported passively (by diffusion) or {{actively}} (by intracellular motors {{that run on}} cytoskeletal tracks). The mode of transport seems {{to be influenced by}} distance. Short distances may tend towards passive transport, whereas longer distances tend towards active transport. Once these vesicles reach their destination, they need to be first physically linked with their acceptor compartment (else they may float away). This process is facilitated by [...] "tethers". Tethers come in two [...] "flavors": long protein(s) with domains called [...] "coiled-coil," [...] or complexes of many subunits which are for the most part globular. The tether that functions to tether ER derived vesicles to the VTC (or Golgi apparatus in case of lower eukaryotes), the next compartment in the transport pathway, is the Transport Protein Particle (TRAPP).|$|E
2500|$|On May 20, French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud {{dismissed}} Maurice Gamelin for {{his failure}} to contain the German offensive and replaced him with Maxime Weygand, who immediately attempted to devise new tactics to contain the Germans. More pressing, however, was his strategic task: he formed the Weygand Plan, ordering to <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> the German armoured spearhead by combined attacks {{from the north and}} the south. On the map, this seemed a feasible mission: the corridor through which von Kleist's two Panzer Corps had moved to the coast was a mere [...] wide. On paper, Weygand had sufficient forces to execute it: in the north, the three DLM and the BEF; in the south, de Gaulle's 4th DCR. These units had an organic strength of about 1,200 tanks and the Panzer divisions were very vulnerable again, the mechanical condition of their tanks rapidly deteriorating but the condition of the Allied divisions was far worse. Both in the south and the north they could in reality muster but a handful of tanks. Nevertheless, Weygand flew to Ypres on the 21st trying to convince the Belgians and the BEF of the soundness of his plan.|$|E

60|$|It is true, I spoke enough {{before to}} break thine heart asunder; 'But beside all this,' there lie and swim in flames for ever. These words, 'Beside all this,' are terrible words indeed.

We will serve you thus these twenty years together, and after that we will fill your mangled body full of scalding lead, or run you through with a red-hot spit; would not this be lamentable? Yet this is but a flea-biting to the sorrow of those that go to hell; for if a man were served so there would, ere it were long, be an end of him. But he that goes to hell shall suffer ten thousand times worse torments than these, and yet shall never be quite dead under them. There they shall be ever whining, pining, weeping, mourning, ever tormented without ease; and yet never dissolved into nothing. If the biggest devil in hell might pull thee all to pieces, and rend thee small as dust, and dissolve thee into nothing, thou wouldst count this a mercy. But here thou mayst lie and fry, scorch, and broil, and burn for ever. For ever, that is a long while, and yet it must be so long.

O! thou that wast loth to foul thy foot if it were but dirty, or did but rain; thou that was loth to come out of the chimney-corner, if the wind did but blow a little cold; and was loth to go half-a-mile, yea, half-a-furlong to hear the word of God, if it were but a little dark; thou that wast loth to leave a few vain companions, to edify thy soul; thou shalt have fire enough, thou shalt have night enough, and evil company enough, thy bellyfull, if thou miss of Jesus Christ; and 'beside all this,' thou shalt have them for ever, and for ever.|$|E
