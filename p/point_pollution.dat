5000|$|In the {{management}} plan CFI says that agricultural {{use of the}} surrounding land has most likely contributed most to the small range of the chucky madtom. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority Little Chucky Creek is “Biologically impaired.” If not properly practiced, some agricultural practices can lead to siltation of streams due to erosion of the streams banks as well as debris and particulates from runoff. Siltation affects bottom feeders like the chucky madtom as it removes hiding places as well as covering potential food. It is theorized that this sediment contaminating these streams are inhibiting both the feeding and reproductive practices of the chucky madtom. The Middle Nolichucky Watershed Alliance (MNWA) is currently responsible for carrying out the restoration plan for the chucky madtom. They plan to sustain the population by carrying out two objectives. The first objective is protecting the habitat by ensuring proper land use, This should help with the water quality problems by addressing <b>point</b> <b>pollution</b> {{as well as other}} factors such as faulty septic tanks and other pollutants. The second objective is to gather more information about the biology of this species.

In particular, this paper describes an extensive data gathering campaign carried out in the Nocella catchment, which is an agricultural and semi-urbanised basin located in Sicily, Italy. Two sewer systems, two wastewater treatment plants and a river reach were monitored during both dry and wet weather periods. A mathematical model of the entire integrated system was also created. Specifically, a detailed modelling approach was developed by employing three well known models: Storm Water Management Model, GPS-X and Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The study proposed a comprehensive modelling approach to analyse the importance of diffuse and concentrated polluting sources on receiving water quality. The study demonstrated that <b>point</b> <b>pollution</b> loads can be more influential during wet periods by an order of magnitude compared with the dry weather period. In the long term, diffuse and <b>point</b> <b>pollution</b> sources were demonstrated to affect river quality and they have both to be considered.

This audit was performed on 100 farms in the Flemish Yser catchment and on 100 farms at the French side.

The critical points and risks for <b>point</b> source <b>pollution</b> were similar for both regions.

To determine the environmental impact of iron ore processing activity in Spodnja Radovna, which finished {{at the end of the}} 19 th century, a sampling campaign was carried out in the area of ironworks and along the river Radovna next to the ironworks. 45 soil samples were collected in three grids at various distances (10, 60 and 110 m) from the former blast furnace location and in two cross-valley profiles stretching from Pokljuka to Mežakla plateau. Along the river Radovna samples were collected 200 m upstream and downstream from the location of blast furnace. The analysis of heavy metal distribution in soil in the area of former ironworks and its vicinity confirmed the influence of former activities on the environment, since elevated concentrations of heavy metals, a distinctive feature of iron industry and tailings, were detected in a quite narrow area around iron foundry. While Cd and Pb indicate areal load of heavy metals in soil, concentrations of As, Cu, Hg and Zn are typical of <b>point</b> <b>pollution</b> sources, where the officially allowed limit and warning values are exceeded.

30|$|Generally, the waste-load {{allocation}} {{problems are}} {{to determine the}} allowed discharge levels or required removal levels {{from a number of}} <b>point</b> <b>pollution</b> sources in a basin to achieve satisfactory (or aspired) water-quality responses in the receiving water body. Previously, the optimal allocation of waste loads has been typically solved by developing various forms of optimization models Mujumdar and Vemula 2004; Yang et al. 2011; Qin and Xu 2011). The decision variables in the optimization models are the discharge (or removal) levels of wastewater or pollutants at each of the <b>point</b> <b>pollution</b> sources. The objective function is often to maximize economic return or to minimize the treatment cost while the constraints are to ensure that the resulting water-quality responses in the receiving water body are satisfactory. Since the resulting water-quality responses in the receiving water body can only be quantified by water quality simulation models, the waste-load allocation problems are essentially required to conduct a simulation-optimization assessment of levels of waste load reductions and allocations from various sources while ensuring the water quality standards being satisfied. Examples of such studies include a waste load allocation model developed by Cho et al. (2003) for the heavily polluted Gyungan River in South Korea, where a modified QUAL 2 E model was used for the water quality simulation, and a simulation–optimization analysis of waste load allocation for a river water quality management by Mujumdar and Vemula (2004). In the TGR area, previously, many optimization modeling studies have been conducted but mainly focused on Yangtze River flood control (Cai et al. 2010), hydropower generation (Guo et al. 2011), Yangtze River watershed navigation (Wang and Ruan 2011), and regional water resources allocation and supply (Sun and Lv 2010).|$|E
