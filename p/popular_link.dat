5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the <b>popular</b> <b>link</b> between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E

Few links are more frequently visited and few rarely visited. In this scenario, identifying the frequently used links and placing them in the top left corner of the page will increase the user's satisfaction. This process will reduce the time spent by a visitor on the page, {{as most of the}} times, the <b>popular</b> <b>links</b> are presented in the visible part of the screen itself. Also, a site can be indexed based on the <b>popular</b> <b>links</b> in that page. This will increase the efficiency of the retrieval system. We presented a model to display the <b>popular</b> <b>links,</b> and also proposed a method to increase the quality of retrieval system...|$|R

40|$|Many online {{communities}} ask their members {{to do work}} {{for the good of}} everyone on the site. On social voting sites like Reddit, this means that users judge a stream of incoming links by voting them up or down. The links with the most up-votes bubble up to the main page, pointing everyone toward the best content. A threat to all sites designed this way, however, is underprovision: when too many people rely on others to con-tribute without doing so themselves. In this paper, we present findings suggesting that widespread underprovision of votes is happening on Reddit, arguably the internet’s largest social voting community. Notably, Reddit overlooked 52 % of the most <b>popular</b> <b>links</b> the first time they were submitted. This suggests that many potentially <b>popular</b> <b>links</b> get ignored, jeop-ardizing the site’s core purpose. We conclude by discussing possible reasons behind it, and suggest future research on social voting sites. Author Keywords social navigation; reddit; voting; free riding; underprovisio...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} juxtaposition, interaction, {{and integration of}} what Japanese authors conceived of as “Japanese” and “Chinese” elements in linked verse compositions of Japan from the 14 th to 17 th centuries. Through examining un- or under-explored forms of linked verse, it shows the multiple dimensions of Japanese conceptions and representations of “China” and the complexity surrounding the Sino-Japanese relationship. A significant part of this dissertation {{is devoted to the}} discussion of Sino-Japanese interplay in wakan renku (linked verse in Japanese and Chinese) and wakan haikai (<b>popular</b> <b>linked</b> verse in Japanese and Chinese), in which verses written in vernacular Japanese and verses written in the form of classical Chinese (kanbun) were composed in alternating turns. In some cases, the Chinese verses comprehensively imitated precedents by Chinese authors, and they formed a very distinctive world from the one created by the Japanese verses that generally maintained Japanese poetic traditions. These linked verse sequences thus display a juxtaposition, confrontation, and integration of two entities that vary greatly in terms of poetic topoi, idea, sentiment, and style. In many cases, however, the so-called “Chinese” verses deviated from Chinese poetic traditions. Sometimes they draw upon vernacular Japanese poetry. Sometimes individual Chinese verses build on Chinese poetry but are linked in a Japanese way. Sometimes the Chinese verses do not make sense in Chinese; they only take the form of Chinese poetry but juxtapose it with vernacularized, Japanese content. These examples show the instability and hybridity embodied by the “Chineseness. ” The boundary between Japanese and Chinese verses is greatly blurred and confused. Meanwhile, these examples reveal that the Sino-Japanese relationship within literary texts produced by Japanese authors is not unidirectional: vernacular Japanese texts also exerted influence on kanbun texts, making them diverge from Chinese poetic traditions. This dissertation also studies Japanese linked verse that heavily engaged with Chinese elements, focusing on compositions by the circle of Matsuo Bashō, the best-known poet in early modern Japan. On the one hand, I explore various ways Bashō’ circle appropriated Chinese literature in the “Chinese style” <b>popular</b> <b>linked</b> verse, demonstrating that their absorption of Chinese literature and thought on the spiritual level contributed to sublimating <b>popular</b> <b>linked</b> verse into a serious art. On the other hand, this dissertation seeks to demonstrate that Bashō’s reception of Chinese texts was sometimes mediated by Yamaguchi Sodō, who had profound knowledge in Chinese studies and was also a respected poet of <b>popular</b> <b>linked</b> verse. The existence of mediums between Chinese literature and Japanese reception casts doubt on a neat division of “Japan” and “China”...|$|R

However, PageRank only consider hyperlink information. In this paper, we propose several novel ranking algorithms, which make use of both hyperlink and site structure information to measure the importance of each web page. Specifically, two kinds of methodologies are adopted to refine the PageRank algorithm: one combines hyperlink information and website structure information together by graph fusion to refine PageRank algorithm, while the other re-ranks the pages within the same site by quadratic optimization based on original PageRank values. Experiments show that both two methodologies effectively improve the retrieval performance. ...|$|E
