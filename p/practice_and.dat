This report focuses on <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> products applicable to upland areas. The overall goals of the Caltrans Erosion Control New Technology Report are to identify promising <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> products for future pilot studies. New <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> products will be recommended by Caltrans, as applicable, to new construction and retrofit projects. This report evaluates erosion control <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> products, which stem from methods, often biotechnical, rather than application of a specific product. The evaluation focuses on the capacity of each product or practice to protect surface soils from erosion or to contain sediments generated upslope of the point of installation...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{models in}} {{strategic}} {{human resource management}} research commonly include employee attitudes and behaviors as key mediating links between human resource <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> firm performance. However, almost all empirical SHRM work to date has ignored the mediating hypothesis and merely examined the direct relationship between HR <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> firm outcomes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to test the relationship between HR <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> employee attitudes and behaviors. Using a sample of 174 independent work groups, we examined the relationship between HR <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> collective behaviors (turnover and absenteeism) mediated by collective attitudes (job satisfaction and commitment). Results indicate attitudes partially mediate the relationship between HR <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> employee behaviors. The direct and indirect relationships identified in this study support the notion that attitudes and behaviors play a mediating role between HR <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> firm outcomes. These findings illustrate the varying impacts of HR <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> the importance of utilizing multilevel theory and methods...|$|R

This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> with the historical records of the time.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} associations between parents' childrearing <b>practices,</b> behavior problems <b>and</b> pre-school children's social competence. A total of 48 mothers and 33 fathers, when their firstborn children were aged six, completed an interview about child-rearing <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> the Social Skills Rating System that also assesses behavior problems. Spearman correlations indicated positive associations between maternal coercive <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> children's behavior problems, especially {{those related to}} externalizing. Positive correlations were also found between fathers' coercive <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> internalizing problems, as well as among fathers' inductive <b>and</b> non-interference <b>practices</b> with children's cooperation and assertiveness, respectively. Girls' mothers {{reported higher levels of}} self-control and social competence than did boys' mothers. Moreover, lower SES mothers referred more coercive practices while higher SES mothers reported more inductive practices. Findings underscore the relationship between fathers' inductive <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> children's social competence.
