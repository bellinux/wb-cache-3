50|$|The MIT {{students}} had very diverse backgrounds and interests, and Cooper emphasized a generalist approach, {{encouraging them to}} switch flexibly among editorial, <b>platemaking,</b> printing, typesetting, and design tasks. In the mid-1970s, VLW students would work overnight to produce posters for campus-wide events, including designs by Cooper's former Design Services colleagues, Jacqueline Casey and Ralph Coburn. Cooper explored early versions of nearby Polaroid Corporation's new SX-70 instant color camera, as well as experimental large-format Polaroid cameras and film. In the early 1980s, Cooper secured major funding from the Outdoor Advertising Association, and pioneered the development of large-scale printers that could quickly produce billboard-sized high-resolution graphics and eventually full-color photographs.|$|E

50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of rubber plate and sleeve materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct photopolymer laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo <b>platemaking</b> using photopolymer plates. After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals. See below.|$|E
50|$|Riklis is {{credited}} with originating complicated paper transactions like high-yield bonds and leveraged buyouts to take over control of major companies, then doing paper switches of the assets into companies he owned. His first significant foray {{was the creation of}} the Rapid-American Corporation by combining his significant stake in Rapid Electrotype Company, a <b>platemaking</b> concern with the American Colortype Company, a maker of stereoview lithographs and dollhouse furniture. Tracing the history of Rapid American Corporation and its renamed form Glen Alden Corporation, one can find the succession of acquisitions Riklis used to create his financial empire, including McCrory Stores, Leeds Travelware, Gruen Watch Company, Elizabeth Arden cosmetics, Aunt Nellie's Farm Kitchens, Bargain Time, Beatrice Foods, Canadian retailer Dylex, Culligan International, Fabergé Cosmetics, J. J. Newberry stores, Lerner Shops, Lawry's Meat Specialties, Martha White Foods, Odd Lot Trading, International Playtex, the Riviera hotel and casino in Las Vegas, RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Samsonite, Schenley Industries, the one-time American distributor of Dewar's whisky.|$|E
50|$|With {{this process}} the {{electronically}} generated image is scanned at speed to a photopolymer plate material that carries a thin black mask layer on the surface. The infrared laser-imaging head, which runs {{parallel to the}} drum axis, ablates the integral mask to reveal the uncured polymer underneath. A main ultraviolet exposure follows to form the image through the mask. The remaining black layer absorbs the ultraviolet radiation, which polymerizes the underlying photopolymer where the black layer has been removed. The exposed digital plate {{still needs to be}} processed like a conventional flexo plate. That is, using solvent-based washout with the necessary waste recovery techniques, although some water-washable digital plates are in development. This technology has been used since 1995 and is only now becoming more widely used around the world as more affordable equipment becomes available. Trade sources say there are around 650 digital platesetters installed in label, packaging and trade <b>platemaking</b> houses.|$|E

50|$|The root words photo, litho, and graphy {{all have}} Greek origins, with the {{meanings}} 'light', 'stone' and 'writing' respectively. As {{suggested by the}} name compounded from them, photolithography is a printing method (originally based {{on the use of}} limestone printing plates) in which light plays an essential role. In the 1820s, Nicephore Niepce invented a photographic process that used Bitumen of Judea, a natural asphalt, as the first photoresist. A thin coating of the bitumen on a sheet of metal, glass or stone became less soluble where it was exposed to light; the unexposed parts could then be rinsed away with a suitable solvent, baring the material beneath, which was then chemically etched in an acid bath to produce a printing plate. The light-sensitivity of bitumen was very poor and very long exposures were required, but despite the later introduction of more sensitive alternatives, its low cost and superb resistance to strong acids prolonged its commercial life into the early 20th century. In 1940, Oskar Süß created a positive photoresist by using diazonaphthoquinone, which worked in the opposite manner: the coating was initially insoluble and was rendered soluble where it was exposed to light. In 1954, Louis Plambeck Jr. developed the Dycryl polymeric letterpress plate, which made the <b>platemaking</b> process faster.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. PlatemakingThe first {{method of}} plate {{development}} uses light-sensitive polymer. A film negative is {{placed over the}} plate, which is exposed to ultra-violet light. The polymer hardens where light passes through the film. The remaining polymer has the consistency of chewed gum. It is washed away in a tank of either water or solvent. Brushes scrub the plate to facilitate the [...] "washout" [...] process. The process can differ depending on whether solid sheets of photopolymer or liquid photopolymer are used, but the principle is still the same. The plate to be washed out is fixed in the orbital washout unit on a sticky base plate. The plate is washed out {{in a mixture of}} water and 1% dishwasher soap, at a temperature of approximately 40 °C. The unit is equipped with a dual membrane filter. With this the environmental burdening is kept to an absolute minimum. The membrane unit separates photopolymer from the washout water. After addition of absorb gelatine for example, the photopolymer residue can be disposed of as standard solid waste together with household refuse. The recycled water is re-used without adding any detergent.The second method uses a computer-guided laser to etch the image onto the printing plate. Such a direct laser engraving process is called digital <b>platemaking.</b> Companies such as AV Flexologic, Glunz & Jensen, Xeikon, Esko, Kodak, Polymount and Screen from The Netherlands are market leaders in manufacturing this type of equipment.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. PrintingA flexographic {{print is}} made by {{creating}} a positive mirrored master of the required image as a 3D relief in a rubber or polymer material. Flexographic plates can be created with analog and digital <b>platemaking</b> processes. The image areas are raised above the non image areas on the rubber or polymer plate. The ink is transferred from the ink roll which is partially immersed in the ink tank. Then it transfers to the anilox or ceramic roll (or meter roll) whose texture holds a specific amount of ink since it is covered with thousands of small wells or cups that enable it to meter ink to the printing plate in a uniform thickness evenly and quickly (the number of cells per linear inch can {{vary according to the}} type of print job and the quality required). To avoid getting a final product with a smudgy or lumpy look, it must be ensured that the amount of ink on the printing plate is not excessive. This is achieved by using a scraper, called a doctor blade. The doctor blade removes excess ink from the anilox roller before inking the printing plate. The substrate is finally sandwiched between the plate and the impression cylinder to transfer the image. The sheet is then fed through a dryer, which allows the inks to dry before the surface is touched again. If a UV-curing ink is used, the sheet {{does not have to be}} dried, but the ink is cured by UV rays instead.|$|E

A series of experiments were conducted {{to determine whether or not}} there were significant differences in the areas of half tone dots in different areas of the tonal scale on different types of flexographic plate materials all made from a single negative with a specially designed test object on it. Assuming significant differences were found in the dot areas among the various plates, we further wished to discover whether or not these differences would have a significant effect on the tones printed from these plates or whether differences would be overshadowed by the multitude of other press variables. Differences in the areas of halftone dots among the different types of printing plates were confirmed at the 95 % level of statistical significance. Further, these differences were detectable in printed reproductions made from these plates, although other variables of flexographic printing had a much greater confirmed influence on tone reproduction...|$|E
