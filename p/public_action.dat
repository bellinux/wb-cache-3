Using representative survey data, a decline in <b>public</b> <b>actions</b> can be reported while private actions have remained relatively stable.

The trafficking of children has been internationally recognized as a serious crime that exists in every {{region of the world}} and which often has human rights implications. Yet, it is only within the past decade that the prevalence and ramifications of this practice have risen to international prominence, due to a dramatic increase in research and <b>public</b> <b>action.</b> A variety of potential solutions have accordingly been suggested and implemented, which can be categorized as four types of action: broad protection, prevention, law enforcement, and victim assistance.|$|E
25|$|Kramer {{witnessed}} {{the spread of}} the disease later known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) among his friends in 1980. He co-founded the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), which has become the world's largest private organization assisting people living with AIDS. Kramer grew frustrated with bureaucratic paralysis and the apathy of gay men to the AIDS crisis, and wished to engage in further action than the social services GMHC provided. He expressed his frustration by writing a play titled The Normal Heart, produced at The Public Theater in New York City in 1985. His political activism continued with the founding of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in 1987, an influential direct action protest organization with the aim of gaining more <b>public</b> <b>action</b> to fight the AIDS crisis. ACT UP has been widely credited with changing public health policy and the perception of people living with AIDS (PWAs), and with raising awareness of HIV and AIDS-related diseases. Kramer has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for his play The Destiny of Me (1992), and he is a two-time recipient of the Obie Award.|$|E

There was little reaction {{from most of the}} military commanders. The Republic of Vietnam Air Force commander Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ had promised a fortnight earlier to use his aircraft against any coup attempt, but he took no action early in the morning.

500|$|The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") took <b>public</b> <b>action</b> in 2005. [...] In mid year, it {{released}} two private letter rulings, each {{of which}} described an organization that was conducting operations {{in a manner similar}} to the Nehemiah Program. [...] Each ruling found that (i) the organization's operations did not exclusively serve a charitable purpose but, instead, served to promote [...] "the private interests of home sellers and other private parties" [...] and, consequently, (ii) the payments made by home sellers to the organization would not qualify as [...] "charitable contributions" [...] for which the seller could claim a tax deduction. [...] And in November 2005, the Department of Justice filed suit in Chicago on behalf of the IRS, seeking an injunction against an Illinois-based seller-funded down-payment program. [...] The injunction sought to bar that program from [...] "falsely advising" [...] home sellers that they could claim their payments to the program as charitable-contribution tax deductions. [...] The IRS made its findings applicable to all seller-funded down-payment assistance programs when it issued a revenue ruling in May 2006. [...] That ruling, Revenue Ruling 2006–27, contrasted the tax treatment of seller-funded programs with the treatment accorded to other types of down-payment assistance. [...] Seller-funded programs, the ruling stated, were [...] "not operated exclusively for charitable purposes". [...] Furthermore, payments made by the seller to the organizations were to be treated not as charitable contributions, but either as rebates to the home buyer or as reductions in the sales price of the home. [...] Shortly after the revenue ruling was issued, Nehemiah published an open letter from its president, in which it noted its opposition to the ruling but added that the ruling did not prevent the Nehemiah Program from continuing its operations. The letter did note, however, that Nehemiah might have to pay [...] "appropriate business taxes on the revenue generated by its downpayment assistance program".|$|E
500|$|Jardine was {{the centre}} of {{attention}} {{at the start of}} the tour. He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds and was seen as one of the main English threats. In his first hundred, the crowd engaged in some good-natured joking at Jardine's expense, but he was jeered by the crowd in his second hundred for batting too slowly. His third hundred was described by Bradman as one of the finest exhibitions of strokeplay that he had seen; Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked, to play some excellent shots. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, partially for his success with the bat, but mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear. His first <b>public</b> <b>action</b> in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Then, he wore a Harlequin cap, given to people who played good cricket at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and M.C.C. captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators, with his general demeanour drawing one comment of [...] "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?" [...] Jardine's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could still have brought the crowds onto his side by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century {{at the start of the}} tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that [...] "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob". After the innings, when Patsy Hendren said that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied [...] "It's fucking mutual". Due to the large number of good close fielders in the side, Jardine did not field in the slips, his usual position for Surrey, but next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked, particularly when chasing the ball: he was not a good fielder on the boundary. In one of the Test matches, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.|$|E

On December 25, 1956, {{the night before the}} protest, Shuttlesworth's house was bombed, blasting him into the basement where he landed, still on his mattress. The fact that he emerged relatively unscathed left Shuttlesworth convinced that he was ordained to lead and contributed to his attitude of fearlessness. The demonstration went on as planned and resulted in 22 arrests, which in turn triggered ACMHR lawsuits asking for an injunction.|$|E

2500|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, they agreed on 27 August that Khánh, Minh, and Khiêm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, {{until a new}} {{civilian}} government could be formed. The trio then brought paratroopers into Saigon to end the rioting. However, the momentum petered out {{due to the lack}} of unity in the ruling triumvirate. Khánh dominated the decision-making, sidelining Khiêm and Minh. Khánh blamed Khiêm for organizing a failed coup attempt led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức on 13 September. General Cao, a Catholic and former Diệm loyalist, claimed in a 1972 newspaper interview that Khiêm, by then prime minister, had asked him to join the coup. Cao claimed that he declined Khiêm's invitation, mildly mocking him by asking [...] "You're part of the 'Troika' now ... won't you be overthrowing yourself?", and pointing out that a political upheaval in Saigon would be a bad idea because Vietnam was prominent during the ongoing U.S. presidential election campaign and negative publicity could lead to weakening US public and political support for South Vietnam. Khiêm's lack of <b>public</b> <b>action</b> was seen as tacit support for the coup; A U.S. Embassy log during the coup claimed that the Thiệu and Khiêm [...] "seem so passive that they appear to have been either tacitly supporting or associated with his move by Đức and Phát", and that Khiêm had [...] "issued expressions of firm support for Khánh somewhat belatedly", as control was eventually reestablished.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{prominent}} <b>public</b> <b>action</b> of the LCS was the November 29, 1792 {{publication of}} the pamphlet [...] "Address of the London Corresponding Society to the other Societies of Great Britain, united for obtaining a Reform in Parliament", stating their aims while clarifying a position of non-violent reform through [...] "moral force." [...] This {{was just one of}} a series of over 80 similar tracts calling for reform as the LCS gained followers and popularity. By mid1794, the LCS had gained enough traction to call for a convention of similar reform societies. In response, due to an inexplicable and unsubstantiated fear of a violent French Revolution-style rebellion, some leaders of the LCS, including Hardy, were arrested and charged with treason as part of the 1794 Treason Trials. Despite claims that the LCS was plotting to depose or assassinate the King and members of Parliament, the government's arguments were so unsubstantiated that juries acquitted LCS organizers Hardy, John Thelwall, and John Horne Tooke. The LCS’s popularity only continued to grow until the government, increasingly uneasy, passed the Treason Act and Seditious Meetings Act in 1795, which, while short of outright banning reform societies, made it increasingly difficult to conduct large meetings. While the LCS continued to publish works and function in some capacity for the next three years, the effect of these acts was destabilizing and the society gradually lost traction and fell apart due to disorganization and the radicalization of some of its members. A final Parliamentary Act of 1799 [...] "for the more effectual suppression of societies established for seditious and treasonable Purposes; and for better preventing treasonable and seditious practices", which referenced the LCS by name (among others), banned reform societies altogether, disbanding the LCS as an entity for all intents and purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Norma Arrostito {{left the}} {{communist}} party in 1967, and joined the organization Comando Camilo Torres, where she met Mario Eduardo Firmenich, Carlos Ramus and Fernando Abal Medina. She {{fell in love with}} the latter, despite being seven years older than he was, and broke her relationship with Roitvan. They were trained in guerrilla warfare in Cuba during 1968, and back in Argentina they split from the Comando Camilo Torres to create a new cell. They were joined by Nélida Arrostito, a sister of Norma and her husband, Carlos Alberto Maguid. Her nom de guerre was Gaby (shortened form of [...] the name Gabriela) or Gaviota (seagull). The organization carried out in a series of operations against the security forces, which ended on 1 June 1970 in the kidnapping and murder of General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, a former de facto President and one of the leaders of the Revolución Libertadora which overthrew Perón in 1955. Norma played a supporting role during the kidnapping and she wrote and sent [...] "dispatches" [...] to the media updating [...] the process of [...] "trial" [...] and [...] "execution" [...] of Aramburu. This operation, code named Pindapoy, marked the first <b>public</b> <b>action</b> of Montoneros. Argentina was then under military rule, but the return of Peron to power was a matter of time. The death of Aramburu prompted the fall of president Juan Carlos Onganía and triggered a huge manhunt of suspected terrorists. On 20 September, a police raid caught Ramus and Abal Medina in a restaurant in William Morris, a neighborhood in the western outskirts of Buenos Aires, killing both of them after a brief shootout. After Abal Medina's death, Arrostito was known inside the organisation as la viuda ("the widow").|$|E

2500|$|Although Bourdieu earlier faulted public intellectuals such as Sartre, he {{had strong}} {{political}} views which influenced his sociology from the beginning. By {{the time of}} his later work his main concern had become the effect of globalisation and those who benefited least from it. His politics then became more overt and his role as public intellectual was born, from an [...] "urgency to speak out against neoliberal discourse that had become so dominant within political debate." [...] Bourdieu developed a project to investigate the effects — particularly the harm — of neoliberal reforms in France. The most significant fruit of this project was the 1993 study 'The Weight of the World,' although his views are perhaps more candidly expressed in his articles. 'The Weight of the World' represented a heavyweight scientific challenge to the dominant trends in French politics. Since it was the work of a team of sociologists, it also shows Bourdieu's collaborative character, indicating that he was still in 1993 reluctant to accept being singled out with the category (he deplored the term 'role') of public intellectual. Nevertheless, Bourdieu's activities as a critical sociologist prepared him for the public stage, fulfilling his [...] "constructionist view of social life" [...] as it relied upon the idea of social actors making change through collective struggles. His relationship with the media was improved through his very <b>public</b> <b>action</b> of organizing strikes and rallies that raised huge media interest in him and his many books became more popular through this new notoriety. One of the main differences between the critical sociologist and public intellectual is the ability to have a relationship with popular media resources outside the academic realm. It is notable that in his later writings Bourdieu sounded cautionary notes about such individuals, describing them as [...] "like the Trojan Horse [...] " [...] for the unwanted elements they may bring to the academic world. Again Bourdieu seems wary of accepting the description 'public intellectual,' worrying that it might be difficult to reconcile with science and scholarship. Research is needed on what conditions transform particular intellectuals into public intellectuals.|$|E
