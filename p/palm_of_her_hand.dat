25|$|In 1440, {{the poet}} Kabir was also {{said to have}} been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Like Karna, Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream. This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as {{secretly}} descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority {{in the eyes of the}} Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up {{her eyes on the}} <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E
60|$|The full meaning <b>of</b> <b>her</b> conduct came to her. She {{felt hot}} all over; the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> were moist beneath the thin silk {{covering}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gloves.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, 'Dolphus, no," [...] replied his wife. [...] "I'm quite myself." [...] With that, {{settling}} her hair, {{and pressing}} the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> upon <b>her</b> eyes, she laughed again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you will," [...] {{said her}} aunt, putting the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> against Lydia's, and so {{pressing}} forward to kiss her. [...] "We shall have breakfast at ten. Go to bed!" ...|$|R
500|$|Ono's final {{album of}} the 1980s was Starpeace, a concept album that she {{intended}} {{as an antidote to}} Ronald Reagan's [...] "Star Wars" [...] missile defense system. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> Starpeace became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort. [...] The single [...] "Hell in Paradise" [...] was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video, directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński received major airplay on MTV and won [...] "Most Innovative Video" [...] at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986. In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for Starpeace, primarily visiting Eastern European countries.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's one and there's the other," [...] said M'liss quietly, {{indicating}} {{their respective}} localities by smartly tapping {{them with the}} <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head at this {{imperative}} appeal and saw the woman revolutionist making the motions of counting money into the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
50|$|Laja means parched rice or barley like popcorn. The bride shall {{place the}} <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> over those <b>of</b> the bridegroom and make three offerings (ahutis) of parched rice soaked in ghee (clarified butter).|$|R
60|$|She {{positively}} snorted with indignation; she {{had rolled}} her handkerchief into a ball, and nervously dabbed the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> with it. 'I followed you this afternoon, and I saw {{you go into}} that 'ouse with that low woman. What now? Eh?' She spoke with the greatest possible emphasis.|$|R
6000|$|... "For what end," [...] thought she, giving vent to {{that feeling}} of hostility {{which is the only}} real abasement of the poor in {{presence}} of the rich,--"for what good end, in the wisdom of Providence, does that woman live? Must the whole world toil, that the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> may be kept white and delicate?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{composed}} herself comfortably, {{with her}} plump elbows on her knees, and her fan crossed on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> before her, and began again: ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor Maude {{held out}} her guilty relic on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> 'I am so sorry,' said she. 'I am afraid I cannot put it back.' ...|$|E
60|$|A sort of solemn embarrassment {{had come}} over Mr. Travers. Mrs. Travers, leaning her chin on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> stared at the bare {{matchboard}} side of the hut.|$|E
60|$|The {{good old}} woman, not knowing very well {{what to do}} in this affair, cried out for help. People came in from every quarter in great numbers; they threw water upon the Princess's face, unlaced her, struck <b>her</b> on the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and rubbed <b>her</b> temples with Hungary-water; but nothing would bring her to herself.|$|R

5000|$|Shannon Baker {{was born}} in the Stellat'en First Nation, British Columbia, Canada. Shannon is of the Carrier tribe. [...] As a baby an elder put warm bee honey in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> so that she may have strong artistic abilities. She has always been in {{competitions}} since being a small child. At age 16, she was in competition for classical music.|$|R
60|$|Mary put {{her hand}} over his mouth and began to chide him for his awfulness, whereupon he kissed the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and put his head closer to hers.|$|E
60|$|Stewart {{lifted her}} out of the saddle, and as their hands parted she felt {{something}} moist and warm. Blood was running down her arm and into the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|God, how she starts! And {{looks at}} me, and {{looks in the}} <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand!</b> And again at me! I turn and run Down the Embankment, run for my life.|$|E
6000|$|Harry {{drew a deep}} breath, {{and took}} one step toward Bessie. [...] "So it's you--the girl," [...] he said, in a lowered voice. She had not moved, and she {{remained}} half turned away from him, pressing {{her head in the}} <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "My word!" [...] he continued, with an invisible half-smile on his lips. [...] "I have a great mind to stop...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Therein {{you show}} your sense," [...] said the surgeon, {{approaching}} the spinster, who sat holding the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and the soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{feet to the}} genial heat of a fine fire, {{making the most of}} comfort amid all her troubles. [...] "You appear to be a sensible, discreet woman, and some who have had opportunities of acquiring more correct views might envy you your respect for knowledge and the lights of science." ...|$|R
6000|$|We read of {{the dead}} body of Jezebel being devoured by the dogs of Jezreel, so that no man might say, [...] "This is Jezebel," [...] and that the dogs left only <b>her</b> skull, the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and the soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> feet; but the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> the hands and the soles of the feet are the very remains by which a corpse might be most surely identified, if {{impressions}} of them, made during life, were available.|$|R
6000|$|Madame de Bellegarde gave a rap {{with her}} fan in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "If you don't {{take it you}} can leave it, sir. It matters very little what you do. My {{daughter}} has given you up." ...|$|E
60|$|She drew it out, {{holding it}} in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> for a moment with tear-blurred eyes bent upon it. Then she raised it to her lips, and {{crushing}} it there {{buried her face in}} the soft ferns, sobbing.|$|E
6000|$|She {{struck the}} table before which he sat, with the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "If he did," [...] she cried, [...] "it was for your sake! I am sure of it! He went to do your bidding, and you must save him!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} on the rail above him now. As he spoke she cupped her chin with the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{delicate}} <b>hand</b> and observed him curiously.|$|R
40|$|A 58 -year-old Chinese woman {{presented}} with syphilis d'emblée. Seven weeks after {{a blood transfusion}} lesions appeared on the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and the soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> feet. These gradually increased in number and other lesions developed on the scalp and palatal mucosa. One of the blood donors {{was found to have}} had positive serological test results for syphilis but no clinical symptoms or signs. This case illustrates the danger inherent in the use of whole fresh blood for transfusion purposes...|$|R
5000|$|She {{can also}} project spider-like [...] "weblines" [...] from the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> or an {{individual}} finger. This {{appears to be}} naturally generated, as opposed to Spider-Man's mechanical web-shooters, but she is similarly prone to running out of [...] "web fluid" [...] ("The Ghost Vikings"). She is {{able to control the}} direction in which her weblines move; [...] "The Kingpin Strikes Again" [...] shows her casting a web in a descending spiral to disorient and then restrain a criminal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me look,' said a {{woman with}} heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> 'Indeed he is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.' ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{struck it}} a resounding blow with the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> and Eustace's face popped over the edge, peering down anxiously. 'I {{can see it}} now,' said Nutty. A sudden, faint hope came to him. 'Can you see it?' he asked.|$|E
6000|$|So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted {{down with}} it. He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "What a lovely bit of glass," [...] cried the little girl; {{and she ran}} home, laughing.|$|E
60|$|Lawford paused on the hearth-rug {{with his}} comb in his hand. 'It's {{just the last}} rags of that beastly influenza,' he said, and began vigorously combing his hair. And yet, simple and frank though the action was, it moved Sheila, perhaps, {{more than any other}} of the {{congested}} occurrences of the last few days. Her forehead grew suddenly cold, the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> began to ache, she had to hasten out of the room to avoid revealing the sheer physical repulsion she had experienced.|$|R
25|$|Julia Pastrana (1834–1860) {{travelled}} {{throughout the}} United States in a freak show as the bearded lady, capturing {{the attention of}} many artists. She is portrayed as having dark extensive hairs distributed equally throughout the surface <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body, even on the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Originally, she was believed to have congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa; however, the generalized form of the syndrome coupled with her gingival hyperplasia indicated that her condition was congenital terminal hypertrichosis. This was not confirmed until after her death, {{when it became clear}} that her X-linked syndrome resulted in terminal hairs.|$|R
2500|$|By {{this time}} the rash had spread and covered all Parker's body, {{including}} the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> feet, and it was confluent on her face. [...] At 10pm {{she was on her}} way to Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital near Solihull. By 11pm all her close contacts, including her parents, were placed in quarantine. Her parents were later also transferred to Catherine-de-Barnes. The next day, poxvirus infection was confirmed by electron microscopy of vesicle fluid. Parker died of smallpox at Catherine-de-Barnes on 11 September 1978.|$|R
