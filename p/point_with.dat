5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a <b>point</b> <b>with</b> only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E

A halving line for a set of n points (n even) is a line passing through two of the points, and cutting the remaining set of n - 2 points in half. Given any set S, we define H(S) to be the set of such lines. We are interested in bounding the worst-case size of this set, h(n) = max |S|=n |H(S) |.

30|$|More {{directly}} {{relevant to}} our present project, Dodson and Dobolyi (2015) compared nine confidence scales using lineup identifications as recognition tests. They employed verbal and numeric scales (e.g., ranged from 0 to 100 or from “not at all confident” to “completely confident”) and different numbers of points identified on a 100 -point scale (e.g., numeric 6 points, 0 – 100 : 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100). They also manipulated whether the 100 -point scale started at 0 or 50 (e.g., numeric 6 points, 50 – 100 : 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100) {{and whether they}} gave labels only for end points on verbal scales (e.g., using 6 <b>points</b> but only <b>with</b> “not at all confident” and “completely confident” labels on the end points). Thus, for verbal scales, they had 6 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> each <b>point</b> labeled, 11 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> each one labeled, 6 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> only the end points labeled, and 11 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> only the end points labeled. For numeric scales, they had 6 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> 0 – 100, 6 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> 50 – 100, 11 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> 0 – 100, and 11 <b>points</b> <b>with</b> 50 – 100. They also used a continuous numeric scale ranging from 0 to 100 with a slider, and thus overall they used nine different confidence scales. They analyzed the results derived from these scales in using confidence-accuracy calibration measures as well as correlational measures. They showed that the confidence-accuracy relationship was generally the same with all types of scales. Of course, in some sense, all their measures were variations on using a 100 -point confidence scale.|$|R
