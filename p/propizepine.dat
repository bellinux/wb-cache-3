50|$|Condensation of 2-chloronicotinic acid (2) with {{o-phenylenediamine}} (1) leads {{directly to}} the tricyclic lactam (3) Although the reaction involves amide formation and nucleophilic aromatic displacement of chlorine, the order of these steps is not known. Alkylation of the anion obtained by treatment if 3 with the 1-chloro-2-dimethylaminopropane (4) affords the antidepressant compound <b>propizepine</b> (5).|$|E
40|$|To the Editor: A 16 -year-old {{boy in a}} coma (Glasgow scale 3) {{with general}} {{seizures}} {{was admitted to the}} intensive care unit. No palpable pulse necessitated cardiac massage. A blood specimen submitted to this laboratory tested positive for tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) by EMIT (Behring, Cupertino, CA) and negative by FPIA (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). A number of antidepressants were screened for in blood by a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method (1) : amineptine, amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, dosulepine, doxepin, fluoxetine, imipramine, maprotiline, metapramine, mianserine, nomifensine, nortriptyline, opipramol, <b>propizepine,</b> protriptyline, quinupramine, tianeptine, trimipramine, and vilox,~ine. None of these compounds were found in this sample. Drug screening for phenothiazines (2), which are known to be a frequent cause of false-positive results with immunoassays (3), was negative. A comprehensive drug test, performed by HPLC with diode-array detection (4), identified buflomedil, a peripheral vasodi ator, at a concentration f 28 mg/L in this specimen. Studies were then performed with drug-free plasma samples spiked with buflomedil in a concentration range of 1 to 100 mg/L. A positive result for TCA was obtained for 13 mg/L with EMIT and 85 mg/L with FPIA. These results demonstrate that buflomedil cross-reacts with TCA in both systems at concentrations that can be found in ac te toxications. Indeed, whereas therapeutic plasma values of buflomedil are 1 to 4 rag/L, cardiotoxicity may occur as soon as plasma concentrations are greater than 10 mg/L (5). A review of the literature revealed nodata on this cross-reactivity. The pointing out of such an interference may beof grea...|$|E
