The main construction lemma in Calegari and Gabai’s proof of Marden’s Tameness Conjecture {{can be replaced}} by an applicable version of our theorem. Finally, we will give a short proof of the conjecture along their ideas. 57 M 50; 30 F 40 Agol [1] and Calegari and Gabai [5] proved independently that any hyperbolic 3 – manifold M with finitely generated fundamental group is homeomorphic to {{the interior of a}} compact 3 –manifold. This is the affirmative answer to Marden’s Tameness Conjecture in [8]. Subsequently, Choi [7] gave another proof of the conjecture, similar to Agol’s, in the case when M has no <b>parabolic</b> <b>cusps.</b> We are here interested in arguments in [5], where the notion of “shrinkwrapping ” was introduced. Shrinkwrappings {{play an important role in}} their proof. For the proof of the existence of shrinkwrappings and that of their CAT. 1 /–property, Calegari and Gabai used very deep and rarefied arguments, which some readers, including the author, may find difficult to approach. This paper is intended to give an elementary proof of part of their proof by using ruled wrappings instead of shrinkwrappings. For simplicity, we only consider the case when a hyperbolic 3 –manifold has no <b>parabolic</b> <b>cusps</b> and will prove the following theorem.

40|$|We {{prove that}} in degree three, the bounded cohomology of finitely {{generated}} Kleinian groups without parabolic elements distinguishes the isometry classes of geometrically infinite ends. That is, if two homotopy equivalent hyperbolic manifolds with infinite volume and without <b>parabolic</b> <b>cusps</b> have different geometrically infinite end invariants, then they define a 2 dimensional subspace of bounded cohomology. Moreover, our techniques apply to classes of hyperbolic 3 -manifolds that have sufficiently different end invariants; we give explicit bases for vector subspaces whose dimension is uncountable. We {{also show that}} these basis elements are uniformly separated in pseudo-norm, extending results of Soma. The technical machinery of the Ending Lamination Theorem allows us to analyze the geometrically infinite ends of hyperbolic 3 -manifolds with unbounded geometry.

40|$|The TIS formula, {{relating}} the rms surface roughness parameter R(q) to the specularly reflected light by TIS = specularly reflected light/total reflected light = exp [-((pi/lambda) R(q)) (2) ], has been derived for surfaces with a Gaussian height distribution. This study investigates {{the validity of}} this formula for Various realistic and artificial surface height distributions with and without skewness. The specular light intensity is calculated by using a Fourier transform expression for the Kirchhoff formalism of diffraction. The Kirchhoff formalism is valid for gently sloped metallic surfaces producing small scattering angles. In the case where the scattered light is collected by a lens, the light distribution in the focal plane of this lens {{is proportional to the}} power spectrum of the optical field close to the scattering surface. This optical input field can be related to the surface height distribution by geometrical optics, resulting in a phase modulation expression for the input field E(i) (x) proportional to exp[i 2 kyx) ] where k = 2 pi/lambda and y(x) is the surface profile. Normal incidence illumination with wavelength lambda is assumed in this study. The theoretical surface profiles under investigation can be divided into profiles with and without skewness. They have the following surface height distributions: (i) zero skewness (can be produced by grinding triangular profile diffraction grating), exponential, Gaussian, uniform, sinusoidal, square wave; Iii) non-zero skewness (can be produced by diamond turning split triangular profile resembling plateau honing) : <b>parabolic</b> <b>cusp,</b> pseudo-uniform. The results of this study are: (i) in the surface roughness range R(q) < 0. 08 lambda, the percentage error in the roughness value obtained by the TIS formula is limited to 10 % and (ii) skewness in the surface height distribution tends to reduce the light scatter for a given surface roughness...|$|R
40|$|We {{minimized}} the interface diffuseness in the phase-field models by introducing the parabolic double-well potential and localizing the solute redistribution (or latent heat release) {{into a narrow}} region within the phase-field interface. In spite of the <b>parabolic</b> potential with <b>cusps,</b> highly localized solute redistribution and discontinuous diffusivity function adopted in this model, it works remarkably well in numerical computations. The computations on dendritic solidification of an one-sided system yield quantitatively the same results with the anti-trapping model [A. Karma, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 115701 (2001) ], indicating the anomalous interfacial effects can be effectively suppressed. This approach can be easily extended to the multi-components or multi-phases system.

In dimension 4 and higher, the diameter of a closed strictly convex manifold is at most 9 times {{the diameter of the}} thick part.

40|$|We {{consider}} geometrically infinite Kleinian groups and, in particular, {{groups with}} singly <b>cusped</b> <b>parabolic</b> fixed points. In order {{to distinguish between}} different geometric characteristics of such groups, we introduce the notion of horospherical tameness. We give a brief discussion of the fractal nature of their limit sets. Subsequently, we use Jrgensen's analysis of punctured torus groups to give a canonical decomposition into ideal tetrahedra of the geometrically infinite end. This enables us to relate horospherical tameness to Diophantine properties of Thurston's end invariants.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the intersection of}} pairs of subgroups of a Kleinian group of the second kind K whose limit sets intersect, where one subgroup G is analytically finite and the other J is geometrically finite, possibly infinite cyclic. In the case that J is infinite cyclic generated by M, we show that either some power of M lies in G or there is a doubly <b>cusped</b> <b>parabolic</b> element Q of G with the same fixed point as M. In the case that J is nonelementary, we show that {{the intersection of the}} limit sets of G and J is equal to the limit set of the intersection G ∩ J union with a subset of the rank 2 parabolic fixed points of K. Hence, in both cases, the limit set of the intersection is essentially equal to the intersection of the limit sets. The main facts used in the proof are results of Beardon and Pommerenke [4] and Canary [6], which yield that the Poincaré metric on the ordinary set of an analytically finite Kleinian group G is comparable to the Euclidean distance to the limit set of G. ...|$|R
40|$|We examine some generic {{features}} of surfaces in the Euclidean 3 -space R^ 3 {{related to the}} Gauss map on the surface. We consider these features on smooth surfaces and on singular surfaces with a cross-cap singularity. We study some symmetries between two classical pairs of foliations defined on smooth surfaces in R^ 3 : the asymptotic curves and the characteristic curves (called harmonic mean curvature lines in garciasotomayorharmonic). The asymptotic curves exist in hyperbolic regions of surfaces and have been well studied. The characteristic curves are in certain ways the analogy of the asymptotic curves in elliptic regions. In this thesis we extend this analogy.. We use We produce results on the characteristic curves mirroring those of Uribe-Vargas (uribevargas) on the asymptotic curves. By considering cross-ratios of Legendrian lines in the manifold of contact elements to the surface we show that certain properties of the characteristic curves are invariant under projective transformations, and examine their behaviour at cusps of Gauss. We establish an analogy of the Beltrami-Enepper Theorem, which allows us {{to distinguish between the}} two characteristic foliations in a natural geometric way. We show that the local properties of characteristic curves may be used to prove certain global results concerning the elliptic regions of smooth surfaces. Motivated by the study of the asymptotic, principal and characteristic curves on surfaces in R^ 3, we construct a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of non-degenerate binary differential equations (BDEs) and linear involutions on the real projective line. We show that one may construct pairs of BDEs that have various symmetric properties using a single involution on RP^ 1. We study the folded singularities of BDEs, and associate an affine invariant to such points. We show that one may associate a complex parameter to folded singularities that determines the relative positions of various curves of interest. We show that the BDEs asymptotic, characteristic, and principal curves are related to other quadratic forms on surfaces. These include the BDE that defines the lines of arithmetic mean curvature which are studied in garciasotomayorarith, and the third fundamental form of the surface. We define a new pair of foliations of a surface which we label the minimal orthogonal spherical image (MOSI) curves which are the integral curves of those tangent directions to a surface that have orthogonal images under the Gauss map, and are inclined at an extremal angle. We establish the configurations of the MOSI curves in a neighbourhood of umbilic points, <b>parabolic</b> points and <b>cusps</b> of Gauss. We construct natural 1 -parameter families of BDEs that interpolate between the BDEs we have studied, and establish relationships between these families. We exhibit the existence of a curve of points of zero torsion of the characteristic curves, and a curve of points where the tangent plane to the surface is the osculating plane of a characteristic curve. We determine the behaviour of these curves near cusps of Gauss and umbilic points. We study BDEs with coefficients that vanish simultaneously at an isolated point and with discriminant having an A_ 2 -singularity at that point. We show that such BDEs can be grouped into three distinct types, and study the differences between these types in terms of their codimension and the linear parts of their coefficients. We establish the topological configurations of the solution curves in each case with codimension ≤ 4. We study the asymptotic and characteristic curves in the neighbourhood of a parabolic cross-cap, that is, on a singular surface with a cross-cap singularity with a parabolic set having a cusp singularity at the singular point. We obtain the topological configurations of these foliations both in the domain of a parametrisation of such a surface, and on the surface itself. We construct a natural one-parameter family of surfaces with cross-cap singularities in which the parabolic cross-cap is the transition from a hyperbolic cross-cap to an elliptic cross-cap. We study the bifurcations of the asymptotic and characteristic curves in this family. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
