5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. When {{atmospheric}} pollution nearly annihilates life on Earth, the remnants of humanity construct a <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> called Basel. In time, the surviving human population create a civilization around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties human lives to quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists—Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron—form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} {{artifacts}} were recovered, historians {{said the}} dig offered a clearer view of early 19th-century life at Colross. Discoveries included an underground domed brick cistern {{that served as a}} water <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> and evidence that slaves lived in outbuildings on the Colross estate. Archaeologists also discovered the mansion's original basement floor, which was laid in a herringbone bond. Evidence of the estate's exterior walls, the foundations of the smokehouse, stables, and a burial vault were also unearthed. In the northwestern portion of the property, what is thought to have been the foundation of a rectangular burial vault was found. No burial remains were discovered. All interments were presumably removed in the early 20th century. Thomson Francis Mason was originally interred at the Colross graveyard in 1838, as were two of his daughters. Subsequent residents had their remains reinterred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery in Alexandria. According to the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, the delay in construiction caused 79 condominium buyers to abandon their purchases.|$|E

25|$|The thermal {{cracking}} reaction is highly endothermic, and is generally {{carried out in}} a fired heater. Even though residence time and temperature are carefully controlled, it produces significant quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbon side products. In practice, EDC conversion is relatively low (50 to 60 percent). The furnace effluent is immediately quenched with cold EDC to stop undesirable side reactions. The resulting vapor-liquid mixture then goes to a <b>purification</b> <b>system.</b> Some processes use an absorber-stripper system to separate HCl from the chlorinated hydrocarbons, while other processes use a refrigerated continuous distillation system.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{immediate}} and lethal problems facing many third world countries is the availability of clean drinking water. Solar powered technologies can help alleviate this problem with minimal cost {{using a combination of}} solar powered well pumping, a water tower or other holding tank, and a solar powered water purifier. These technologies require minimal maintenance, have low operational costs, and once set up, will help provide clean water for drinking and agriculture. With large enough reservoirs for the water that has been pumped and purified with solar powered technology, a community will be better able to withstand drought or famine. This reservoir water could be consumed by humans, livestock, or used to irrigate community gardens and fields, thus improving crop yields and community health. A solar powered water <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> can be used to clean many pathogens and germs from groundwater and runoff. A group of these devices, filtering the water from wells or runoff could help with poor sanitation and controlling the spread of waterborne illnesses.|$|E
25|$|Early on 17 March, TEPCO {{requested}} {{another attempt}} by the military to put water on the reactor using a helicopter and four helicopter drops of seawater took place around 10:00 JST. The riot police used a water cannon to spray water onto {{the top of the}} reactor building and then were replaced by members of the SDF with spray vehicles. On 18 March, a crew of firemen took over the task with six fire engines each spraying 6 tons of water in 40 minutes. 30 further hyper rescue vehicles were involved in spraying operations. Spraying continued each day to 23 March because of concerns the explosion in Unit 3 may have damaged the pool (total 3,742 tonnes of water sprayed up to 22 March) with changing crews to minimise radiation exposure. Lighting in the control room was restored on 22 March after a connection was made to a new grid power supply and by 24 March it was possible to add 35 tonnes of seawater to the spent fuel pool using the cooling and <b>purification</b> <b>system.</b> On 21 March grey smoke was reported to be rising from the southeast corner of Unit 3 – where the spent fuel pool is located. Workers were evacuated from the area. TEPCO claimed no significant change in radiation levels and the smoke subsided later the same day.|$|E
500|$|Admiral Nimitz had one priceless advantage: US cryptanalysts had {{partially}} {{broken the}} Japanese Navy's JN-25b code.

It was initially not known where [...] "AF" [...] was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse of telling the base at Midway (by secure undersea cable) to broadcast an uncoded radio message stating that Midway's water <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> had broken down. Within 24 hours, the code breakers picked up a Japanese message that [...] "AF was short on water."

500|$|All {{utilities}} except electricity {{are managed}} by Komunalno poduzeće Zaprešić (...) [...] Zaprešić's electricity is, {{as in the}} rest of Croatia, provided by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, and distributed by Elektra Zagreb, a company managing access to electricity in Zagreb, and Zagreb County. Zaprešić receives tap water from underground water reserves through a water pump in the settlement of Šibice. The water from the water pump is of drinking quality. However, local factories Pliva, and Kvasac produce waste water, which is released into the Sava River through the Harmica-Pliva-Zaprešić water treatment plant. Before the construction of the treatment plant, the polluted water was piped into the Gorjak Creek, endangering the tap water quality. Possible consequences of releasing waste water into the Sava will be dealt with by the construction of the Zajarki water <b>purification</b> <b>system</b> for screening the used water. The ecological problem is multiplied {{by the fact that the}} utility company received only 400 requests to clean septic tanks in 2007, although most households in the relatively rural surroundings of Zaprešić use septic systems. There are plans of constructing four hydroelectric power plants around Zagreb with one being in Zaprešić (HE Zaprešić, also known as HE Podsused) as a part of a system of exploiting natural resources of the Sava River.|$|E

In fact, the wastewater from the acetaldehyde plant, which the company knew still contained mercury and led to Minamata disease when fed to cats, was not treated through the Cyclator at the time. Testimony at a later Niigata Minamata disease trial proved that Chisso knew the Cyclator to be completely ineffective: [...] "The purification tank was installed as a social solution and did nothing to remove organic mercury." ...|$|E
