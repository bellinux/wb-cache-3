40|$|Cardiotoxic and lethal {{effects of}} Listeria monocytogenes hemolysin were studied in CD- 1 mice {{injected}} with varying doses of hemolysin. Intravenous injection of 100 complete hemolytic units (CHU) caused 100 % lethality within 4 to 5 min. Doses ranging from 40 to 50 CHU caused death of approximately 50 % of the animals. Adrenergic blocking agents and antihistamine failed to protect mice against lethality and thereby suggested that {{death was not}} due to release of vasoactive agents by hemolysin. Plasma levels of creatine phosphokinase increased after intravenous administration of hemolysin and suggested myopathy, possibly of the myocardium. Electrocardiograms from hemolysin-treated mice indicated serious alterations in heart rate and rhythm, suggesting damage to contractile and <b>pacemaker</b> <b>cardiac</b> tissue.

40|$|The {{transistorized}} implanted pacemaker {{is proving}} to be an effective and reliable method for long-term pacing of the heart. All patients suffering from Stokes-Adams seizures were first given a trial period of conservative therapy, including isoproterenol (Isuprel), ephedrine, atropine and steroids. Twenty-four pacemaker implants were performed on 23 patients over a 21 -month period. The preoperative insertion of a <b>pacemaker</b> <b>cardiac</b> catheter was a very valuable safety precaution. In this way the heart could be safely and reliably paced during the period of preoperative assessment and during the critical periods of anesthetic induction and thoracotomy.

40|$|SUMMARY As {{pacemaker}} electrode myocardial {{contact area}} is reduced, the energy required {{to stimulate the}} heart decreases; but the effect of surface area on an electrode's ability to transmit R-wave potentials has not been well documented.

40|$|Purpose- To {{determine}} the indication for and inci-dence {{and evolution of}} temporary and permanent pace-maker implantation in cardiac transplant recipients. Methods- A retrospective review of 114 patients who underwent orthotopic heart transplantation InCor (Heart Institute USP BR) between March 1985 and May 1993. We studied the incidence of and indication for temporary pacing, the relationship between pacing and rejection, the need for pemanent pacing and the clinical follow-up. Results- Fourteen of 114 (12 %) heart transplant recipients required temporary pacing and 4 of 114 (3. 5 %) patients required permanent pacing. The indication for temporary pacing was sinus node dysfunction in 11 patients (78. 5 %) and atrioventricular (AV) block in 3 patients (21. 4 %). The indication for permanent pace-maker implantation was sinus node dysfunction in 3 patients (75 %) and atrioventricular (AV) block in 1 patient (25 %). We observed rejection in 3 patients (21. 4 %) who required temporary pacing and in 2 patients (50 %) who required permanent pacing. The previous use of amiodarone was observed in 10 patients (71. 4 %) with temporary pacing. Seven of the 14 patients (50 %) died during follow-up. Conclusion- Sinus node dysfunction was the princi-pal indication for temporary and permanent pacemaker implantation in cardiac transplant recipients. The need for pacing was related to worse prognosis after cardiac transplantation. Key-words: <b>pacemaker,</b> <b>cardiac</b> transplantatio...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{monitoring}} of cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIED: <b>pacemaker,</b> <b>cardiac</b> resynchronisation therapy device and implantable cardioverter defibrillator) {{has been developed}} for technical control and follow-up using transtelephonic data transmission. In addition, automatic or patient-triggered alerts are sent to the cardiologist or allied professional who can respond if necessary with various interventions. The advantage of remote monitoring appears obvious in impending CIED failures and suspected symptoms but is less likely in routine follow-up of CIED. For this follow-up the indications, quality of care, cost-effectiveneness and patient satisfaction have to be determined before remote CIED monitoring can be applied in daily practice.

40|$|Introduction. Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{consists of}} the symptoms and signs present in the single chamber (VVI) pacemaker patient with electrode placed in the right ventricular apex. It is caused by inadequate timing of atrial and ventricular contractions. Pacemaker syndrome without a pacemaker (or pseudopacemaker syndrome) refers to occurrence of symptoms {{in the presence of}} marked first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, when P wave is too close to the preceding QRS complex producing the same haemodynamic disturbance as artificial <b>pacemaker</b> <b>cardiac</b> stimulation with retrograde VA conduction. Case Outline. We present the patient with acute inferior myocardial infarction due to late bare metal stent thrombosis, treated with primary pectutaneous coronary intervention. Hospital course was complicated by complete heart block which was treated with temporary pacing. During the stand-by mode of temporary pacing, sinus rhythm with marked first-degree AV block (PQ interval 480 ms) was observed while the patients re-experienced the symptoms that were present prior to pacemaker implantation. Temporary pacing was continued for the next 24 hours when spontaneous shorteninig of PQ interval (250 - 270 ms) was noticed; since the patient was asymptomatic during the stand-by mode, the pacemaker electrodes were removed and the patient discharged 11 days after admission. Conclusion. Conduction disturbances, such as the varying degrees of AV blocks, are relatively common in acute inferior myocardial infarction. The first degree AV blok is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment, unless when it is associated with pseudopacemaker syndrome. In that case, temporary pacing provides haemodynamic stability until conduction system recovers...|$|E

40|$|Direct cardiac {{stimulation}} {{was conducted}} in the open chest. In normal animals, auricular stimula-tion at frequencies faster than the spontaneous rate caused little change in vascular pressures or cardiac output. Comparable ventricular stimulation in the same animals caused falls in cardiac output and blood pressure, with elevations in venous pressure. In contrast, ventricular stimulation in animals with complete heart block caused elevations in cardiac output and blood pressure, and declines in venous pressure. A study was also made of repetitive stimulation in experimental cardiac arrest. Occasionally pacemaking was of value in the resuscitation, {{but in most cases}} effective con-tractions could not be induced with stimulation. REPETITIVE electric stimulation of the animal heart for investigative pur-poses has been standard laboratory procedure for many decades. The interest of clinicians has been sporadically directed to electric pacemaking as a tool in the treatment of clinical cardiac arrest since it could be, in theory, a means of dealing with this disastrous situation by meeting a specific need with a specific therapeutic provision.

The growing burden of comorbidities in CIED patients, the greater complexity of the devices, and the increased duration of procedures have led to an augmented risk of infections, which is out of proportion to the increase in implantation rate. CIED infections are an ominous condition, which often implies the necessity of hospitalization and carries an augmented risk of in-hospital death. Their clinical presentation may be either at pocket or at endocardial level, but they can also manifest themselves with lone bacteremia. The management of these infections requires the complete removal of the device and subsequent, specific, antibiotic therapy. CIED failures are monitored by competent public authorities, that require physicians to alert them to any failures, and that suggest the opportune strategies for their management. Although the replacement of all potentially affected devices is often suggested, common practice indicates the replacement of only a minority of devices, as close follow-up of the patients involved may be a safer strategy. Implantation of a PM or an ICD may cause problems in the patients&# 39; psychosocial adaptation and quality of life, and may {{contribute to the development of}} affective disorders. Clinicians are usually unaware of the psychosocial impact of implanted PMs and ICDs. The main difference between PM and ICD patients is the latter&# 39;s dramatic experience of receiving a shock. Technological improvements and new clinical evidences may help reduce the total burden of shocks. A specific supporting team, providing psychosocial help, may contribute to improving patient quality of life.

40|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} can be {{obtained}} from embryonic stage or generated by in vitro reprogramming of terminally differentiated somatic cells. Such reprogrammed cells possess similar developmental potential as embryonic stem (ES) cells and therefore are an indispensible source of diverse cell types, including cardiomyocytes (CMs), for basic research. CMs derived from ES cells and reprogrammed cells can provide possibilities for study of development, differentiation processes, stem cell malignancy and genetic diseases in vitro. Such studies can allow for development of novel compounds for drug discovery and toxicity testing which might help to develop more efficient and safer drugs The present thesis is based on analyzing the impact of switching the cell fate on the differentiated state of reprogrammed cells using cardiomyocytes as a model. Detailed structural molecular and functional characterization of CMs derived from ES cells and reprogrammed cells like fusion hybrid (FH) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells was performed. Somatic cells (spleenocytes and bone marrow cells) were fused with ES cells to generate FH cells. The formed hybrid cells were morphologically similar to pluripotent ES cells and retained a tetraploid genome through many passages. Spontaneous differentiation led to formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) with appearance of beating areas representing differentiation to cardiac lineage. The EBs derived from FH cells also retained tetraploid genome and expressed major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules of both fusing partners. FH derived CM expressed typical cardiac structural proteins and intact β-adrenergic and muscarinic signaling receptors. Atrial, ventricular and <b>pacemaker</b> <b>cardiac</b> subtypes could be found in FH-CMs. Thus, CMs derived from tetraploid FH cells appear to be structurally and functionally intact. Ongoing research proved iPS cell technology to be more robust reprogramming strategy. In order to obtain homogenous population of CMs for further studies an iPS cell line TiB 7. 4 was genetically manipulated to allow for antibiotic-based purification of cardiomyocytes after spontaneous differentiation. We generated highly purified CMs from transgenic murine iPS and ES cell lines expressing puromycin N-acetyltransferase and EGFP under the control of α-myosin heavy chain promoter. iPS and ES cells differentiated into CMs at comparable efficiencies yielding highly purified CMs after drug selection. Purified iPS- and ES-CMs exhibited indistinguishable structural properties, similarly responded to pharmacological agents, expressed functional voltage-gated sodium, calcium and potassium channels and possessed comparable current densities. Global transcriptional profile and gene ontology signature of transgenic iPS-CMs were very similar to that of ES-CMs but clearly distinct from fibroblasts that were used to generate iPS cells and differentiated cells in iPS or ES cell-derived embryoid bodies. After puromycin selection, iPS-CMs did not contain any residual pluripotent cells nor formed teratoma in immunodeficient mice. Therefore, cell fate switching brought about by reprogramming does not affect the structural, molecular and functional characteristics of cardiac derivatives of the reprogrammed cells. ...|$|E

40|$|Background - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are {{recommended}} for patients {{at high risk}} of sudden cardiac death or for survivors of cardiac arrest. All ICDs combine a shock function with a pacing function to treat fast and slow heart rhythms, respectively. The pacing function may be very sophisticated and can provide so-called cardiac resynchronisation therapy for the treatment of heart failure using a <b>pacemaker</b> (<b>cardiac</b> resynchronisation therapy with pacemaker) or combined with an ICD [cardiac resynchronisation therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) ]. Decision-making about these devices involves considering the benefit (averting sudden cardiac death), possible risks (inappropriate shocks and psychological problems) and the potential need for deactivation towards the end of life. Objectives - To explore patients’/relatives’ and clinicians’ views/experiences of decision-making about ICD and CRT-D implantation and deactivation, to establish how and when ICD risks, benefits and consequences are communicated to patients, to identify individual and organisational facilitators and barriers to discussions about implantation and deactivation and to determine information and decision-support needs for shared decision-making (SDM). Data sources - Observations of clinical encounters, in-depth interviews and interactive group workshops with clinicians, patients and their relatives. Methods - Observations of consultations with patients being considered for ICD or CRT-D implantation were undertaken to become familiar with the clinical environment and to optimise the sampling strategy. In-depth interviews were conducted with patients, relatives and clinicians to gain detailed insights into their views and experiences. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently. Interactive workshops with clinicians and patients/relatives were used to validate our findings and to explore how these could be used to support better SDM. Results - We conducted 38 observations of clinical encounters, 80 interviews (44 patients/relatives, seven bereaved relatives and 29 clinicians) and two workshops with 11 clinicians and 11 patients/relatives. Patients had variable knowledge about their conditions, the risk of sudden cardiac death and the clinical rationale for ICDs, which sometimes resulted in confusion about the potential benefits. Clinicians used various metaphors, verbal descriptors and numerical risk methods, including variable disclosure of the potential negative impact of ICDs on body image and the risk of psychological problems, to convey information to patients/relatives. Patients/relatives wanted more information about, and more involvement in, deactivation decisions, and expressed a preference that these decisions be addressed at the time of implantation. There was no consensus among clinicians about the initiation or timing of such discussions, or who should take responsibility for them. Introducing deactivation discussions prior to implantation was thus contentious; however, trigger points for deactivation discussions embedded within the pathway were suggested to ensure timely discussions. Limitations - Only two patients who were prospectively considering deactivation and seven bereaved relatives were recruited. The study also lacks the perspectives of primary care clinicians. Conclusions - There is discordance between patients and clinicians on information requirements, in particular the potential consequences of implantation on psychological well-being and quality of life in the short and long term (deactivation). There were no agreed points across the care pathway at which to discuss deactivation. Codesigned information tools that present balanced information on the benefits, risks and consequences, and SDM skills training for patients/relative and clinicians, would support better SDM about ICDs. Future work - Multifaceted SDM interventions that focus on skills development for SDM combined with decision-support tools are warranted, and there is a potential central role for heart failure nurses and physiologists in supporting and preparing patients/relatives for such discussions...|$|E
