5000|$|After the world's first {{testing in}} November 8, 1972 {{it was decided}} to order and deploy short-take-off-and-vertical-landing (STOVL) AV-8S Matadors (AV-8A Harrier) when Dédalo was overhauled. Since the Harriers' {{downdraft}} on vertical landing would have damaged the wooden deck, <b>protective</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing</b> was installed on the rear area of the flight deck. [...] The first batch of six AV-8S single seat and two TAV-8S two seat aircraft were delivered to the Armada Española throughout 1976. A second batch of four AV-8S aircraft was delivered in 1980. Unlike some carriers used for Harrier operations, a ski-jump to assist STOVL takeoff was never installed on Dédalo, limiting the maximum takeoff weight of the Harriers.|$|E

40|$|Simple compact {{models for}} {{combined}} overhead-cable lines supplying a substation {{are presented as}} an extension of a previous paper for grounding system analysis. The overhead line section can be equipped with uniform or combined ground wires, whereas the cable line section can consist of coated <b>metal</b> <b>sheathed</b> cables, with/without intermediate grounding, or uncoated <b>metal</b> <b>sheathed</b> cables in continuous contact with the earth. Besides the calculation of the earth current at the faulted substation, the proposed modeling method allows the evaluation of the leakage current at the transition station, where cables are connected to the overhead line, as well as at critical overhead line towers. In this manner, the effects of the so called “fault application transfer” phenomenon can be conveniently estimated at the design stage in order to assess the most appropriate safety conditions. Some numerical examples are given by applying a computer program based on the proposed methodology...|$|R

50|$|A shed is {{typically}} a simple, single-storey roofed structure {{in a back}} garden or on an allotment that is used for storage, hobbies, or as a workshop. Sheds vary considerably in the complexity of their construction and their size, from small open-sided tin-roofed structures to large wood-framed sheds with shingled roofs, windows, and electrical outlets. Sheds used on farms or in industry can be large structures. The main types of shed construction are <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing</b> over a <b>metal</b> frame, plastic <b>sheathing</b> and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame.|$|R

50|$|Mineral-insulated {{copper-clad}} {{cable is}} {{a variety of}} electrical cable made from copper conductors inside a copper sheath, insulated by inorganic magnesium oxide powder. The name is often abbreviated to MICC or MI cable, and colloquially known as pyro (because the original manufacturer and vendor for this product in the UK was a company called Pyrotenax). A similar product <b>sheathed</b> with <b>metals</b> other than copper is called mineral insulated <b>metal</b> <b>sheathed</b> (MIMS) cable.|$|R
50|$|Metal sheds {{made from}} thin sheet <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing</b> (galvanized steel, aluminium, or {{corrugated}} iron) {{attached to a}} metal frame. Metal sheds are a good choice when long-term strength and resistance to fire, rot, or termites is desired. However, metal sheds may rust over time, particularly if they are constructed from steel that is not galvanized. Be aware that concrete is highly corrosive so care {{needs to be taken}} when assembling your shed to avoid contact with the outside panels.|$|R
5000|$|In the Age of Sail, sailing vessels {{suffered}} severely {{from the}} growth of barnacles and weeds on the hull, called [...] "fouling". Thin sheets of copper or Muntz metal were nailed onto the hull {{in an attempt to}} prevent marine growth. One famous example of the traditional use of <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing</b> is the clipper Cutty Sark, which is preserved as a museum ship in dry-dock at Greenwich in England. Marine growth affected performance (and profitability) in many ways.|$|R

These compilations were novel in that they featured traditionally Ambient and New Age artists alongside Noisier, edgier acts and yet seemed to [...] "work" [...] as cohesive documents. The label has also released numerous special-packaging releases; compact discs in <b>metal</b> <b>sheathes,</b> vinyl records attached to saw blades, water-filled plastic sleeves, etc.|$|R
50|$|The Bowling Eldridge House, {{also known}} as Ridgecrest, is a {{historic}} plantation house located near Lynchburg, Bedford County, Virginia. It was built between 1822 and 1828, and is a two-story, five bay dwelling of mortise-and-tenon frame construction. It has a gable roof with <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing,</b> exterior gable-end brick chimneys, a brick foundation, and beaded weatherboard siding. There is also an integral or earlier two-story ell with an exterior gable-end brick chimney and a pent room. The interior and exterior features Federal style details.|$|R
50|$|The cables are copper conductor, {{cross linked}} {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) insulated, <b>metal</b> <b>sheathed</b> cables with {{high density polyethylene}} over-sheaths. They are about 160 mm in diameter and weigh about 40 kg a metre. Each section of the route is a single circuit, with three separate cables - one for each phase.

50|$|Brooklyn Tobacco Factory, {{also known}} as the Hightower & Barksdale Tobacco Factory, is a {{historic}} tobacco factory located at Brooklyn, Halifax County, Virginia. It was built about 1855, and is a two-story, brick building with a gable roof. It features brick chimney flues projecting above the <b>metal</b> <b>sheathed</b> roof. Also on the property are two contributing pack houses (c. 1880) and the ruins of a log house (c. 1855). The factory was designed and built by Dabney Cosby, Jr., son of the Jeffersonian workman, Dabney Cosby, Sr. The factory remained in operation until 1881.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of reactivity of different sheath metals such as Ag, Fe, Cu, Ni and SS on the superconducting properties of NdFeAsO 0. 6 F 0. 4 wires has been investigated. The observed structural and superconducting {{properties of the}} <b>metal</b> <b>sheathed</b> wires conclude that among the five candidates Ag and Fe are technically compatible {{to be used as}} sheath materials in terms of reactivity. However, the best superconducting properties such as TC and transport JC were exhibited by Ag sheathed NdFeAsO 0. 6 F 0. 4 wires...|$|R
50|$|The O.D. Gunn Trade and Sale Barn is a {{historic}} commercial agricultural building at 10 Anna Street in Quitman, Arkansas. It is a rectangular wood-frame structure with a monitor gabled roof. Its exterior is clad in <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing</b> scored to resemble brick. The roof has exposed rafter ends, and heavy Craftsman style brackets at the front-facing gable end. It was built about 1910 by Offie Dorris Gunn, who used it to deal in horses and mules. It is a particularly well-preserved barn of the type {{used for this purpose}} in the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The plant sits on {{the west}} shore of Portsmouth Mine Pit Lake, {{formerly}} an open mine pit. The plant contained eight structures {{at the time of}} nomination. The sintering structure and trestle consists of a tall, concrete structure, adjacent to a trestle that supported rail cars that were unloaded into the sintering chamber. The machine shops building was located immediately east of the sintering structure and trestle, and is built of steel with corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing.</b> Other buildings include a warehouse/shops building, a garage, an electric transformer building, an oil tank, and a dryhouse.|$|R
50|$|The main {{types of}} shed {{construction}} are <b>metal</b> <b>sheathing</b> over a <b>metal</b> frame, plastic <b>sheathing</b> and frame, all-wood construction (wood frame, wood siding and wood roof), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Each type has various {{advantages and disadvantages}} that a homeowner has to consider. For example, while metal sheds are fire and termite-resistant, they can rust over time, or be severely damaged by high winds or heavy snow loads. Wood sheds are easier to modify or customize than plastic or metal, because carpentry tools and basic carpentry skills are more readily available. Vinyl-sided, wood-framed sheds blend {{the strength of a}} wood frame with the maintenance-free aspect of vinyl siding (it {{does not need to be}} painted or varnished). The International Building Code (IBC) defines a shed as a building or structure of an accessory character; it classifies them under utility and miscellaneous group U (Chapter 3 Section 312).|$|R
