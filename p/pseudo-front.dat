40|$|Microsegregation in an Al- 4 wt % Cu alloy was {{investigated}} experimentally and theoretically {{to disclose the}} importance of accurate liquid diffusion data in models predicting microstructures. Experimentally, directional solidification with a cooling rate of 1 K/s was employed. Theoretically a two-dimensional <b>pseudo-front</b> tracking (PFT) model was used. The experimentally determined distribution of the main microstructural features including its Cu concentration have been compared to microstructure and concentration predictions of a 2 D PFT model. The liquid diffusion coefficient used in the model was varied around recently measured values in order to check {{its impact on the}} microstructure prediction. The results clearly indicate that accurate liquid diffusion data are necessary for predictions comparing well with experiments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, the {{scientific}} community considers the RPAS (remotely piloted aircraft system) as a tool which can help to improve their knowledge of climate and atmospheric phenomena. RPAS equipped with instruments can now conduct measurements {{in areas that are}} too hazardous or remote for a manned plane. RPAS are especially adapted system for observing the atmospheric boundary layer processes at high vertical and temporal resolution. The main objectives of VOLTIGE (Vecteur d'Observation de La Troposphère pour l'Investigation et la Gestion de l'Environnement) are to study the life cycle of fog with micro-RPAS, encourage direct participation of the students on the advancement and development of novel observing systems, and assess the feasibility of deploying RPAS in Météo-France's operational network. The instrumented RPAS flights successfully observed the evolution of small-scale meteorological events. Before the arrival of the warm <b>pseudo-front,</b> profiles show a temperature inversion of a hundred meters, which overlaps a cold and wet atmospheric layer. Subsequent profiles show the combination of the arrival of a marine air mass as well as the arrival of a higher level warm <b>pseudo-front.</b> A third case study characterizes the warm sector of the disturbance. Two distinct air masses are visible on the vertical profiles, and show a dry air above an air almost saturated and slightly colder. The temperature and the relative humidity profiles show < 1 meter vertical resolution with a difference between ascent and descent profiles within ± 0. 5 °C and ± 6 % RH. These results comply with the Météo-France standard limits of quality control. The RPAS profiles were compared with those of the Arome forecast model (an operational model at Météo France). The temperature and wind in the Arome model profiles generally agree with those of the RPAS (less for relative humidity profiles). The Arome model also suggests transitions between air masses occurred at a higher level than those measured by RPAS. These results suggest that forecast models may be improved using high resolution and frequent in-situ measurements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{comprehensive}} {{model has}} been developed for the simulation of microstructure evolution during solidification and homogenization treatments of aluminum alloys. It combines, on the one hand, a <b>pseudo-front</b> tracking method for the prediction of long range diffusion during solidification and homogenization, and, on the other hand, a particle size distribution method for the description of dispersoids. The first method considers {{the formation of the}} cellular primary phase (i. e. the fcc aluminum-rich matrix) from the melt and the secondary intercellular phases resulting from eutectic reactions and solid state phase transformations. The second method is applied to the evolution of the precipitates forming within the supersaturated primary cellular phase. Both methods are directly coupled with Thermo-Calc for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibrium. The model is applied to the prediction of microstructure and segregation in a 3003 aluminum alloy for a typical industrial solidification and heat treatment sequence. The influence of the solidification conditions on the prediction of the precipitate free zone is discussed. The simulation results are compared with experimental data collected in the literature for the same alloy and heat treatment conditions. It is shown that controlling the nucleation undercooling of the secondary phases is essential to retrieve the measured volume fractions of intercellular particles and precipitate free zone...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{comprehensive}} modelling {{approach has}} been developed for the simulation of microstructure formation during solidification and heat treatment in Ni-base superalloys. The microsegregation taking place during solidification is simulated using the <b>pseudo-front</b> tracking (PFT) technique. This finite volume method calculates the concentration profiles in primary γ {{and the proportion of}} liquid and γ′ in the interdendritic regions. The same model is then used to describe the dissolution of the interdendritic γ′ particles during the subsequent solution heat treatment. The concentrations in primary γ predicted with the PFT model are then used to calculate the evolution of the γ′ precipitates and their size distributions at different locations in a dendrite arm during heat treatment. This is achieved with a precipitate size distribution (PSD) model. The classes of the distribution are created and tracked based on classical nucleation theory and a semi-analytical model for the growth of the precipitates as a function of their radius and the matrix supersaturation. The PFT and PSD models are both coupled with Thermo-Calc, which is used for the computation of the concentrations at the γ/liquid and γ/γ′ interfaces, for the Gibbs-Thomson effect in precipitates, and to calculate non-diagonal diffusion matrices based on a mobility database. The precipitation model was applied to a Ni-Al-Cr alloy and the results were compared with experimental data from the literature. Experimental and simulation results are in good qualitative agreement. The main phenomena taking place during precipitation, i. e. nucleation, growth and coarsening, are well reproduced by the precipitation model. Some discrepancies were observed on the precipitate number density, which were attributed to the homogeneous nucleation model. The full modelling sequence was then applied to Ni-Al in order to assess the influence of an incomplete homogenization heat treatment on the formation of γ′ precipitates...|$|E
30|$|There are few {{attempts}} in which cost and resilience considered as twin objectives to optimize network {{with the aim}} of arriving least cost network with best possible performance. Although the formulation of multi-objective problem for water distribution network is simple, solving and arriving Pareto front is found to be challenging. Bolognesi et al. (2014) developed <b>pseudo-front</b> in the hydraulically feasible region in the multi-objective design of water distribution network by combining any two objectives (i.e., cost and performance measures such as deviation from minimum of pressure deficit, deviation of velocity and resilience measure). The formulated problem in three different objectives was solved by genetic heritage and stochastic evolution transmission (GHEST) algorithm. Creaco et al. (2014) formulated a multi-objective optimization problem for phasing design of water distribution system, which has two objectives, one as minimizing the costs of the upgrades converted into value at the initial time and other as maximizing the minimum pressure surplus over time. Ostfeld et al. (2014) used genetic algorithm for the multi-objective optimization of water distribution network considering cost and resilience index as twin objectives of the design and utilized split pipe size method, which assign more than one diameter for each pipe in the network. Piratla (2015) presented a three-objective optimization model to obtain various sustainable and resilient design alternatives. The trade-off among three objectives can help to identify most beneficial solution from Pareto optimal set of solutions. Recently, Wang et al. (2014) applied various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to generate true Pareto front for two-objective model that belongs to optimal design of water distribution network. The various algorithms were tested using 12 benchmark networks available in the literature. The results of study indicate that non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is found to be most promising approach for solving two-objective water distribution network problems. Creaco et al. (2016) proposed three-objective optimization model to minimize the costs and maximize both the resilience and the loop-based diameter uniformity indexes. The study provides an improvement in the NSGA-II algorithm to overcome the difficulties that arises with more than two objectives. Most of the previous studies focused more on generating true Pareto front to the problem in an efficient manner. The aim of the present work is to provide a simple way to decision makers for obtaining best solution while considering both objectives simultaneously with or without due weightage to particular objective function. Further, it brings out {{the way in which the}} resiliency of network gets increased at the expense of cost in optimal manner. Hence, minimizing the cost and maximizing the resilience index are dealt in two different ways as a single objective optimization problem and illustrated with widely used Hanoi water distribution networks.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work a {{comprehensive}} model of the continuous hardening of 3 D-axisymmetric steel components by induction heating has been developed. In the model, the Maxwell and heat flow equations are solved using a mixed numerical formulation : the inductor and the workpiece are enmeshed with finite elements (FE) but boundary elements (BE) are used for the solution of the electromagnetic equations in the ambient air. This method allows the inductor to be moved with respect to the workpiece without any remeshing procedure. The heat flow equation is solved for the workpiece using the same FE mesh. For the thermal boundary conditions, a net radiation method has been implemented to account for grey diffuse bodies and the viewing factors of the element facets are calculated using a "shooting" technique. These calculations have been coupled to a metallurgical model describing the solid state transformations that occur during both heating and cooling. From the local thermal history, the evolution of the various phase fractions are predicted from TTT-diagrams using an additivity principle. A micro-enthalpy method has been implemented in the heat flow calculations in order to account for the latent heat released by the various transformations. At each time step, the local properties of the material, in particular its magnetic permeability, are updated according to the new temperatures and magnetic field. Special attention has been taken for the description of the boundary conditions associated with the water spraying below the inductor. The heat transfer coefficient has been deduced from the inverse modelling of temperatures measured at various locations of a test piece. This preliminary work has been complemented with measurements of the magnetic permeability of the 42 CrMo 4 steel from which the workpieces are made. This part of the study also includes dilatometric measurements for the verification of the additivity principle used in the simulation. The model has been applied to three cases of increasing complexity : induction stream heating of a steel cylinder without quenching, stream quenching of a steel cylinder and, finally, stream quenching of a non-cylindrical workpiece. The results of the simulation have been compared with experimental cooling curves, microstructures and hardness profiles. In the second part of this work, the phase transformations that occur in hypoeutectoid steels during heating have been investigated at the scale of the microstructure according to a microscopic approach. Several models have been developed in order to describe the various steps of the austenitisation process : (i) pearlite dissolution, (ii) transformation of ferrite into austenite and homogenization, (iii) grain growth in austenite. In a first approach, each step has been modeled separately. The dissolution of pearlite has been described using a two-dimensional finite element model with a deforming mesh and a remeshing procedure. The diffusion equation has been solved in austenite (γ) for a typical domain representative of a periodic structure of ferrite (α) and cementite (θ) lamellae. The α/γ and θ/γ interfaces are allowed to move with respect to the local equilibrium condition, including curvature effects via the Gibbs-Thompson coefficient. The model has been used to predict the concentration field and the shape of the interface at different stages of the pearlite dissolution. Maps representing the steady state dissolution rate as a function of the temperature and lamellae spacing have been obtained for small values of overheating. The appearance of a non-steady state regime at higher temperature has been discussed. The transformation of ferrite into austenite has been described using a <b>pseudo-front</b> tracking finite volume approach for solving the diffusion equation in a 1 D, 2 D or 3 D domain. At the start of the computation, the volume is made of ferritic particles and austenitic zones resulting from the pearlite dissolution. The model allows to calculate the kinetics of the phase transformation as a function of the temperature and the initial microstructure. Although the comparison of the transformation kinetics with experimental results was quite satisfactory, it appeared that the calculated kinetics were slightly slower. This effect has been attributed to the other alloying elements which are contained in the Ck 45 steel used for the experiments. This discrepancy has also been explained by a stereological effect which is due to the calculation in a 2 D section instead of a 3 D domain as demonstrated by a comparison of 2 D and 3 D simulations. The austenitic grain growth has been described with two models based respectively on a Monte Carlo technique and a mechanical approach. A methodology for obtaining a correspondence between the simulation time scale and real time has been presented and applied to the Ck 45 steel. The value of the exponent n of the grain growth law d = Κ t 1 /n (where d is the mean diameter and t the time) has been determined for both models. The mechanical model (n= 2) turned out to describe perfectly the case of normal grain growth as it occurs in liquid-gas systems. However the results of the Monte Carlo simulation (n= 2. 3) are in better agreement with the non-ideal behaviour of the Ck 45 steel. The influence of the impurities and particles which are present in real materials should be taken into account in both models if a more quantitative agreement is to be obtained. Finally, a combined model coupling the various steps of the austenitisation process has been proposed. It allowed to show that the assumption consisting in dividing the process in three separate steps is valid in most cases. This combined model is a first attempt for a comprehensive modelling of the austenitisation process...|$|E
