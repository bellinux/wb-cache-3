40|$|Vast {{amounts of}} {{molecular}} data are being generated every day. However, how to properly harness the data remains often {{a challenge for}} many bi-ologists. Firstly, due to the typical large dimension of the molecular data, analyses can either require exhaustive amounts of computer memory or be very time-consuming, or both. Secondly, biological problems often have their own special features, which put demand on specially designed software to obtain meaningful results from statistical analyses without imposing too much requirements on the available computing resources. Finally, the gen-eral complexity of many biological research questions necessitates joint use of many different methods, which requires a considerable expertise in prop-erly understanding the possibilities and limitations of the analysis tools.

40|$|Abstract — Ontological realism aims at the {{development}} of high quality ontologies that faithfully represent what is general in reality and to use these ontologies to render heterogeneous data collections comparable. To achieve this second goal for clinical research datasets presupposes not merely (1) that the requisite ontologies already exist, but also (2) that the datasets in question are faithful to reality in the dual sense that (a) they denote only particulars and relationships between <b>particulars</b> that do <b>in</b> fact exist and (b) they do {{this in terms of}} the types and type-level relationships described in these ontologies.

40|$|ABSTRACT Allostery {{offers a}} highly {{specific}} way to modulate protein function. Therefore, understanding this mechanism is of increasing interest for protein science and drug discovery. However, allosteric signal transmission {{is difficult to}} detect experimentally and to model because it is often mediated by local structural changes propagating along multiple pathways.

Signal propagation was described as information exchange through a network of correlated local motions, mod-eled as transitions between canonical states of protein fragments. The method was used to describe allostery in two-component regulatory systems. <b>In</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>th...</b>|$|R

Right atrial pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume were measured {{before and after}} morphine 5 and 10 mg per 70 kg in 14 subjects. In a further group of eight subjects, forearm blood flow was measured after morphine 10 mg per 70 kg. Total systemic and forearm vascular resistance were derived from these measurements. In spite of wide individual variations, significant decreases in mean arterial pressure occurred {{in most of the}} patients and appeared to be dose related. Significant decreases in mean cardiac index were noted only after morphine 10 mg per 70 kg. Forearm blood flow increased consistently and significantly and there was a corresponding decrease in vascular resistance. The decrease in mean arterial pressure and the change in forearm vascular resistance indicated that vasodilatation was probably the principle cause of the decrease in arterial pressure, whereas the substained decrease in cardiac output seemed to indicate an effect on venous capacitance. The predominant action of morphine appears to be peripheral, causing a decrease in vascular resistance and, possibly, an increase in venous capacitance.

40|$|A growth {{model is}} set up where war, population, and {{technology}} interact endogenously, capturing some trends observed throughout long-run human history. Agents compete for food for their survival. In environments with scarce resources [...] meaning high population density, and/or low levels of technology [...] agents allocate more of their time to fight for resources, which translates into a higher probability of war. Because technology is an input both in food production and conflict, technological progress exerts two opposing effects on killing: on the one hand, it mitigates resource scarcity, making war less likely; on the other hand, if war breaks out it is deadlier the more advanced {{is the level of}} technology. An economy may transit onto a path of peaceful prosperity where standards of living are rising, and the probability of war approaches zero. In the transition, however, it may pass a phase of excessive killing, as rising living standards have not yet made war an improbable event, but rising levels of technology have made war extremely lethal if and when it breaks out. A preliminary quantitative exercise indicates that the model can replicate an inversely U-shaped pattern of war and genocide deaths seen worldwide over the 20 th century.

Human eryth-roleukemia (HEL) cells express megakaryocytic/platelet markers and have been used as a model to study platelet receptors. Therefore, we sought to determine whether adenosine receptors were present in HEL cells. Adenosine agonists produced an accumulation of cAMP in HEL cells, implying the presence of A 2 receptors. Xanthine and nonxanthine adenosine receptor antag-onists blocked this effect in a simple competitive manner (Schild analysis). Therefore, both platelets and HEL cells possess A 2 adenosine receptors.

However, we have recently found that high concentrations of staurosporine up to 1 M can only partially inhibit IL- 3 -stimulated Bcl 2 phosphoryla-tion but completely block PKC-mediated Bcl 2 phosphory-lation in vitro, indicating {{the existence of a}} non-PKC, stau-rosporine-resistant Bcl 2 kinase (SRK).
