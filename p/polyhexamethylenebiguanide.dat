40|$|Two {{different}} cationic antimicrobial molecules, chlorhexidine (CH) and <b>poly(hexamethylenebiguanide)</b> (PH), were adsorbed from {{aqueous solution}} to titanium implant devices surface-modified by the covalent coupling of collagen on a polyanionic acrylic acid overlayer. Results show that more antimicrobial was adsorbed on surface modified implants {{as compared to}} control titanium devices. Moreover, the kinetic of release was affected by {{the interaction between the}} polyanionic overlayer and the cationic antimicrobial, leading to slower kinetic of release in the case of CH and stable adsorption in the case of polycationic PH. These data indicate that biochemically modified collagen coated surfaces could be endowed also by antimicrobial properties, in the spirit of present researches on multifunctional implant surfaces...|$|E
40|$|<b>Polyhexamethylenebiguanide</b> {{hydrochloride}} (PHMB), a {{low molecular}} weight polymer related to chlorohexidine (CHX), is a well-known antibacterial agent. In this study, polylactide (PLA) nanofibers loaded with PHMB were produced by electrospinning to obtain 3 D biodegradable scaffolds with antibacterial properties. PLA fibers loaded with CHX were used as control. The electrospun fibers were studied and analyzed by SEM, FTIR, DSC and contact angle measurements. PHMB and CHX release from loaded scaffolds was evaluated, {{as well as their}} antibacterial activity and biocompatibility. The results showed that the nanofibers became smoother and their diameter smaller with increasing the amount of loaded PHMB. This feature led to an increase of both surface roughness and hydrophobicity of the scaffold. PHMB release was highly dependent on the hydrophilicity of the medium and differed from that determined for CHX. Lastly, PHMB-loaded PLA scaffolds showed antibacterial properties since they inhibited adhesion and bacterial growth, and exhibited biocompatible characteristics for the adhesion and proliferation of both fibroblast and epithelial cell lines.

40|$|Objectives: Antimicrobial {{peptides}} {{are important}} effectors of innate immunity. Bacteria display multiple defence mechanisms against these peptides. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa releases potent proteinases that inactivate the human cathelicidin LL- 37. Hence, in conditions characterized by persistent bacterial colonization, {{such as in}} P. aeruginosa-infected skin wounds, {{there is a need}} for efficient means of reducing bacterial load. Here, the effect of the cationic molecule <b>polyhexamethylenebiguanide</b> (PHMB) was evaluated. Methods: Infection models in human wound fluid and human skin were established. Radial diffusion methods, bacterial growth and bactericidal assays were used for determination of effects of PHMB on bacteria in the presence of plasma, wound fluid or human skin. At the protein and tissue levels, SDS-PAGE, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the effects of P. aeruginosa infection before and after addition of PHMB. Results: PHMB killed common ulcer-derived bacteria in the presence of human wound fluid. Furthermore, elastase-expressing P. aeruginosa completely degraded wound fluid proteins as well as human skin during infection ex vivo. The infection, and consequent protein degradation, was reversed by PHMB. Conclusions: The ex vivo infection models presented here should be helpful in the screening of novel antimicrobials and constitute a prerequisite for future clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBiomaterials {{used during}} surgery and wound {{treatment}} are of increasing importance in modern medical care. In {{the present study}} {{we set out to}} evaluate the addition of thrombin-derived host defense peptides to human acellular dermis (hAD, i. e. epiflex®). Antimicrobial activity of the functionalized hAD was demonstrated using radial diffusion and viable count assays against Gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Electron microscopy analyses showed that peptide-mediated bacterial killing led to reduced hAD degradation. Furthermore, peptide-functionalized hAD displayed endotoxin-binding activity in vitro, as evidenced by inhibition of NF-κB activation in human monocytic cells (THP- 1 cells) and a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in whole blood in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The dermal substitute retained its anti-endotoxic activity after washing, compatible with results showing that the hAD bound a significant amount of peptide. Furthermore, bacteria-induced contact activation was inhibited by peptide addition to the hAD. E.  coli infected hAD, alone, or after treatment with the antiseptic substance <b>polyhexamethylenebiguanide</b> (PHMB), yielded NF-κB activation in THP- 1 cells. The activation was abrogated by peptide addition. Thus, thrombin-derived HDPs should be of interest in the further development of new biomaterials with combined antimicrobial and anti-endotoxic functions for use in surgery and wound treatment...|$|E
40|$|Electrospun {{scaffolds}} from an {{amino acid}} containing poly(ester urea) (PEU) were developed as promising {{materials in the}} biomedical field and specifically in tissue engineering applications. The selected poly(ester urea) was obtained with a high yield and molecular weight by reaction of phosgene with a bis(alpha-aminoacy 1) -alpha,omega-dioldiester monomer. The polymer having L-Ieucine, 1, 6 -hexanediol and carbonic acid units had a semicrystalline character and relatively high glass transition and melting temperatures. Furthermore it was highly soluble in most organic solvents, an interesting feature that facilitated the electrospinning process and the effective incorporation of drugs with bactericidal activity (e. g. biguanide derivatives such as clorhexidine and <b>polyhexamethylenebiguanide)</b> and enzymes (e. g. alpha-chymotrypsin) that accelerated the degradation process. Continuous micro/nanofibers were obtained under {{a wide range of}} processing conditions, being diameters of electrospun fibers dependent on the drug and solvent used.; Poly(ester urea) samples were degradable in media containing lipases and proteinases but the degradation rate was highly dependent on the surface area, being specifically greater for scaffolds with respect to films. The high hydrophobicity of new scaffolds had repercussions on enzymatic degradability since different weight loss rates were found depending on how samples were exposed to the medium (e. g. forced or non-forced immersion). New scaffolds were biocompatible, as demonstrated by adhesion and proliferation assays performed with fibroblast and epithelial cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
