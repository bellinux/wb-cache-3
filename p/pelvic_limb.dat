60|$|Section 83. The {{hind limb}} and its body bones-- <b>pelvic</b> <b>limb</b> and girdle-- {{are shown in}} Figure 2. The limb {{skeleton}} corresponds closely {{with that of the}} fore-limb. The femur (fe.) answers to the humerus, and is to be distinguished from it by the greater distinctness of its proximal head (hd.) and by the absence of an olecranon fossa from its distal end. The tibia (ti = the radius) is fused for the distal half of its length with the fibula (fb. = ulna). A tarsus (tarsalia) equals the carpus.* Two of the proximal tarsalia may be noted: one working like a pulley under the tibia, is the astragalus (as.); one forming the bony support of the heel, is the calcaneum (ca.). There is a series of metatarsals, and then come four digits of three phalanges each.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A 4 {{years old}} mongrel stray bitch, {{weighing}} 16 kg was submitted to physical examination to demonstrated inability of locomotion with the <b>pelvic</b> <b>limbs.</b> Extradural spinal cord compression {{was observed in}} myelotomography of the thoracolumbar segment. The patient was submitted to exploratory hemilaminectomy of T 13 -L 1 and L 1 -L 2, {{in an attempt to}} decompress the medullar segments. During the surgery was observed one adult parasite, identified as Dioctophyma renale, located in the extradural space and causing spinal cord compression. The patient was submitted to postoperative physical therapy, presenting clinical improvement 15 days after surgery, remaining on prone position and able to move the <b>pelvic</b> <b>limbs,</b> but not yet able to walk unassisted. It started walking naturally 60 days after the surgery. With the present clinical report, the erratic migration of the parasite Dioctophyma renale should be added to the list of differential diagnoses for patients with paraparesis and extramedullary lesion pattern, especially in endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|Bipedalism as a preadaptive {{stage for}} bird’s flight is considered. We {{attribute}} {{the formation of}} full bipedalism in bird ancestors with <b>pelvic</b> <b>limbs</b> transition from segmental to parasagittal position. This transition was fast enough. We can assume that the pectoral limbs freed from the support remained while laterally spaced and gave set of transformations with different degrees of reduction. Thus morphologically “winglike” version of the thoracic limbs could appear. Parasagittal <b>pelvic</b> <b>limbs</b> allowed birds ancestors fast and maneuverable running, while the movements of free and highly movable thoracic limbs (feathered unrelated to flight) provided dynamic stability of the animal. In addition, their fluttering movements facilitate hopping from one branch to another and the descent from the trees. On the bottom branches protobirds could jump with perching just by the <b>pelvic</b> anisodactyl <b>limbs,</b> not by thoracic as had supposed earlier. Active interaction of the primary simple feathers with air {{as well as its}} protective function could become an impetus for their transformation into differentiated structures. Unlike gliding (as preadaptive stage for active flight) bipedalism with free feathered forelimbs provides per se parallel development of two autonomous enough locomotor systems of birds (flight and terrestrial locomotion) and extensive adaptive radiation of representatives of the class...|$|R

40|$|Subtle {{lameness}} {{makes it}} difficult to ascertain which is the affected limb. A study was conducted to investigate a change in the thermal pattern and temperature of the thermal image of the paw print in a lame <b>pelvic</b> <b>limb</b> compared to a non-lame <b>pelvic</b> <b>limb</b> of dogs confirmed by orthostatic analysis. Fourteen client owned dogs with a unilateral <b>pelvic</b> <b>limb</b> lameness and 14 healthy employee dogs were examined and the pelvic limbs radiographed. Thermal images of the paw print were taken after each dog was kept in a static position on a foam mat for 30 seconds. Average temperatures and thermographic patterns were analyzed. Analysis was performed in a static position. The asymmetry index for each stance variable and optimal cutoff point for the peak vertical force and thermal image temperatures were calculated. Image pattern analysis revealed 88 % success in differentiating the lame group, and 100 % in identifying the same thermal pattern in the healthy group. The mean of the peak vertical force revealed a 10. 0 % difference between the left and right <b>pelvic</b> <b>limb</b> in healthy dogs and a 72. 4 % between the lame and non-lame limb in the lame dog group. Asymmetry index analysis revealed 5 % in the healthy group and 36. 2 % in the lame group. The optimal cutoff point for the peak vertical force to determine lameness was 41. 77 % (AUC = 0. 93) and for MII 0. 943 % (AUC = 0. 72). The results of this study highlight the change in the thermal pattern of the paw print in the lame <b>pelvic</b> <b>limb</b> compared to a non-lame <b>pelvic</b> <b>limb</b> in the lame group and the healthy group.
