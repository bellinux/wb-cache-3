500|$|Evading Beagle, Cofresí {{returned}} to Jobos Bay; on February 15, 1825, the pirates arrived in Fajardo. Three days later John Low {{picked up a}} six-gun sloop, Anne (commonly known by her Spanish name Ana or La Ana), which he had ordered from boat-builder Toribio Centeno and registered in St. Thomas. Centeno sailed the sloop to Fajardo, where he received <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> at Quebrada de Palmas in Naguabo. As its new owner Low accompanied him, remaining aboard while cargo was loaded. That night Cofresí led a group of eight pirates, stealthily boarded the ship and forced the crew to jump overboard; during the capture, Cofresí reportedly picked $20 from Low's pocket. Despite having to [...] "walk the plank", Low's crew survived and reported the assault to the governor of Saint Thomas. Low probably attracted the pirates' attention by docking near one of their hideouts; {{his work on the}} Beagle rankled, and they were hungry for revenge after the capture of Hernández Morales. Low met Centeno at his hacienda, where he told the Spaniard about the incident and later filed a formal complaint in Fajardo. Afterwards, he and his crew sailed to Saint Thomas. Although another account suggests that Cofresí bought Anne from Centeno for twice Low's price, legal documents verify that the builder was paid by Low. Days later, Cofresí led his pirates to the Humacao shipyard and they stole a cannon from a gunboat (ordered by Miguel de la Torre to pursue the pirates) which was under construction. The crew armed themselves with weapons found on the ships they boarded.|$|E

2500|$|Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd [...] QB 343 {{is a case}} in English {{tort law}} {{covering}} nuisance. The council granted planning <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> Medway (Chatham) <b>Dock</b> Co Ltd <b>to</b> redevelop the Chatham Dockyard as a commercial port, noting that this would have some impact on local residents but authorising it because the economic benefit would far outweigh any potential noise problems. The port's activity called for a large number of heavy duty vehicles moving around the clock, and by 1988 there were almost 750 lorries using the port per day. The Borough Council brought an action against the dock company in public nuisance on behalf of its residents, and the case was heard by Buckley J in the High Court of Justice. Buckley, while rejecting the dock company's arguments that only illegal acts could be public nuisances and that the granting of planning permission authorised the nuisance, held that the dock's activities were not a public nuisance. This was because the commercial dock had significantly changed the character of the area, changing the definition of what was and was not unreasonable behaviour.|$|R

50|$|Specifically, Sterling sought {{confirmation}} that Japanese ports {{would continue to}} be denied to Russian vessels, at least {{for the duration of the}} war, even if this meant that damaged British ships would also be denied <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> in Japan for repairs and re-provision. Assuming that Stirling was in Nagasaki to demand the same concessions as Perry, during discussions in Edo, officials in the Tokugawa shogunate agreed that forming an agreement with the British was not only unavoidable, but that the British could be a powerful force to offset Russian designs on the Kurile islands. Consequently, Sterling was received by the Nagasaki bugyō, Mizuno Tadanori, who had originally been sent by the Tokugawa shogunate to Nagasaki to negotiate with Perry, and who was familiar with the treaty which had already been signed with the Americans. Mizuno’s preconceptions on the British intentions were bolstered by Nishi’s mistranslations, and over the course of three sessions of negotiations (October 4, October 9 and October 14) the outline of a treaty was drafted, which Mizuno, together with metsuke Nagai Naoyuki signed on October 14.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, Armitage left {{active duty}} {{and joined the}} office of the U.S. Defense Attache in Saigon. Immediately prior to the fall of Saigon, he {{organized}} and led the removal of South Vietnamese naval assets and personnel from the country and {{out of the hands of}} the approaching North Vietnamese. Armitage told South Vietnamese naval officers to take their ships to a designated place in the ocean where they would be rescued by U.S. forces and their ships destroyed. When Armitage arrived at the designated location he found 30 South Vietnamese Navy ships and dozens of fishing boats and cargo ships with as many as 30,000 Vietnamese refugees. With transportation options limited for removing the floating city, Armitage, aboard the destroyer escort USS Kirk, personally decided that humanity required him to lead the flotilla of ships over 1000 miles to shelter in Subic Bay, Philippines, in 1975. This went against the wishes of both the Philippine and American governments.

5000|$|Reclassified DDE-508 on 26 March 1949, Cony was {{converted}} to an escort destroyer, specially equipped for antisubmarine warfare, and recommissioned 17 November 1949.

In September 1953, she again cleared on a distant deployment, taking part in North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Operation [...] "Mariner", then exercising with the Royal Navy in antisubmarine operations off Northern Ireland before continuing to a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. In 1955 and 1957, she again served in the Mediterranean, and in September and October 1957, joined in NATO antisubmarine exercises in the English Channel. Local operations and cruises to the Caribbean marked 1958, and in 1959 and 1960, It was reported by a crew member that around this time (1958-1959) the Cony was returning to Norfolk from the duty in the Caribbean and logged an unofficial speed of 37 knots. Upon arrival at port, they requested <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>dock,</b> but were denied. They were ordered to wait {{for the rest of the}} fleet to return.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides an}} account of several months aboard the POLAR PARAGUAY, a refrigerated vessel of the Hamburg-Südamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft, told {{from the perspective of}} the Third Navigating Officier. The year is 1975. Under charter by the Salén Reefer Services of Sweden, the ship has just completed two banana transports from Nicaragua to Long Beach. Now she receives the somewhat unusual order to take a cargo of oranges to the Persian Gulf. Three trial deliveries, carried out by the POLAR PARAGUAY and two new ships of Salén's SNOW class, are intended to prove the feasibility of this technically challenging transport: The trip will take six to seven weeks, including what is normally a long wait for <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>dock</b> at the Iranian port of delivery. Throughout this entire period, a temperature of 4. 5 ºC has to be guaranteed, despite a constant supply of fresh air. A large number of long-unused sea charts must be updated by hand. As it turns out, many of the charts into which a lot of work has been invested are never needed after all: Due to overcrowding at the originally planned port of discharge Khorramshahr on the Shatt al Arab, Bandar Abbas - located at the entrance to the Persian Gulf - is declared the new port of destination. There 'the ship with fresh oranges' is cleared unexpectedly quickly. Only six days after her arrival, the POLAR PARAGUAY is back at sea. The original plans, based on the assumption of a much longer idle period in Iran, had provided for a subsequent transport of apples from South Africa to Europe. This journey is now replaced by the order to take on bananas in the southern Philippines. For the Gulf of Davao a chart has to be specially drawn - on the basis of the officiers’ own measurements and observations - to supplement the existing chart of the 1880 s. Now, in 1975, not only are there official warnings of pirate raids, but due to political unrest on the island of Mindanao, taxi drivers can hardly be persuaded to take on fares after nightfall. All these inconveniences are quickly forgotten, however, thanks to the extremely cordial welcome extended to the crew by the people of Davao. From Japan, where the bananas are discharged, the ship transports a cargo of automobiles to El Salvador and Costa Rica, then taking on bananas in Guayaquil for delivery to Long Beach, where oranges are once again loaded. This time, however, the oranges are destined for Europe and thus apparently of a much more average quality than the wonderful fruits shipped to Iran with the hope of conquering a new market.
