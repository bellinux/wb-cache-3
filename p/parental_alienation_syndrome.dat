There was also a significant relationship between a judge making a finding of <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> and mandating counselling for the alienating parent.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the characteristics and experiences of parents targeted by <b>parental</b> <b>alienation.</b> The aims of the study were to determine target parent experiences of <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> post-separation from the alienating parent, and to investigate common target parent characteristics. This was conducted via an online survey. A total of 225 target parents participated, 120 of whom were female (Mage = 40. 73 years, SD = 7. 05). The current study’s findings revealed that target parents were experiencing extremely high severity of exposure to <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> tactics at the hand of the alienating parent. Target parent gender and target child age were found to significantly predict variance in exposure to <b>parental</b> <b>alienation.</b> Targeted mothers experienced significantly higher severity of exposure to <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> compared to targeted fathers. Finally, the severity of exposure to <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> tactics significantly predicted increases in the appraisal of the <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> situation as threatening. The present findings contradicted previous literature conclusions that fathers are more commonly alienated, and offered new insights into target parent appraisals of their <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> experience.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Few {{ideas have}} {{captured}} the attention and charged the emotions of the public, of mental health and legal professionals as thor-oughly as the concept of <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> and Gardner’s (1987) Paren-tal <b>Alienation</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> For all of this controversy, the alienation concept stands outside developmental theory and without firm empirical support. The present paper explores alienation and its conceptual coun-terpart, alignment, as the necessary and natural tools of child-caregiver attachment (Ainsworth & Wittig, 1969; Bowlby, 1969) and of family system cohesion. This conceptual foundation offers developmentalists, clinicians, and family law professionals alike a common language and Benjamin D. Garber, PhD, provides clinical and forensic psychological services to children and families in transition. His professional writing brings developmental the-ory and practical, child-centered process to psychotherapy, clinical and forensic as-sessment.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} gender bias within Canadian court cases citing <b>parental</b> <b>alienation.</b> This bias was investigated through {{close examination of}} the role of gender of parents (i. e., differences between mothers and fathers), children, legal professionals (i. e., judges) and mental health professionals (i. e., custody evaluators) in identifying the presence of <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> and using that information as a factor in the final court decision. A sample of 100 Canadian court cases citing <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> between 2010 and 2012 were extensively reviewed and coded for extensive predetermined criteria related to gender including, but not limited to: gender of judge, custody evaluator, alienating parent, alienated parent, and children implicated. Therefore, in describing the current trends in <b>parental</b> <b>alienation,</b> the present study investigated three components: (1) whether legal and mental health professionals are using the term, either as a diagnosis, ‘Parental Alienation Syndrome’ or ‘Parental Alienation Disorder’ or are referring to the behaviors presented as <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> but not recognizing them as the components of a syndrome or diagnosis, (2) who, in terms of gender, {{is more likely to be}} the alienating parent (perpetrator) and the alienated parent (victim), and (3) whether there currently exists evidence of gender bias within the court itself, through differential findings based on gender of parent and gender of judge...|$|R

50|$|One concept used {{in regard}} to {{specific}} relationships is that of <b>parental</b> <b>alienation,</b> where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have divorced or separated).

40|$|<b>Parental</b> <b>alienation</b> {{occurs when}} a child is {{unreasonably}} influenced by a parent’s unwarranted views of the other parent, leading to unnecessary refusal or resistance of a relationship with the targeted parent (Garber, 2011). The child will align themselves with the preferred parent without justification, with their behaviour often driven by false beliefs (Bernet & Baker, 2013). There is a current lack of literature regarding effective practice to aid psychologists and courts in terms of supporting the alienating parent, targeted parent, and child. A systematic literature review was undertaken which aimed to identify evidence based practices in response to <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> and to develop a set of best practice recommendations for professionals working with families affected by <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> with a psychological and a legal perspective. Medline, PsycInfo and Embase academic databases were searched from their inception until August 2015. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and conference abstracts were also searched. Articles published in English reporting outcomes relating to an intervention for <b>parental</b> <b>alienation</b> were included. A total of nine articles met criteria for the current review. Broadly, interventions fell into five different categories: change in custody and individual or family therapy/mediation; custodial transfer only; multi-modal family intervention; parallel group therapy; and reunification programs/ retreats/ workshops/ camps. Recommendations suggest that changes in custody to the targeted parent are effective in restoring relationships, and that where there is court involvement, a family therapy approach further helps to reduce distress and improve child-parent relationships...|$|R
