As a major indicator of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome(OSAS) in clinical diagnosis, the monitoring of sleep apnea {{plays an important}} role in medical treatments of modern society. This paper proposes {{a portable}} sleep apnea monitoring system, which is of high-precision and low-power consumption, and capable of performing the long-term monitoring of OSAS patients’multiple physiological parameters in clinical treatments. In the system, the AC modulated detection is adopted, and low amplification ratios are utilized in forestage and a high-resolution AD converter is designed in <b>post-stages.</b> Thus, it is able to acquire, analyze, and process physiological signals in real-time. In addition, ultralow-power chips are used in control system to save the power consumption.

Gemini 10 followed 100 minutes later and entered a 159.9 by 268.9 km orbit. They were 1800 km behind the Agena. Two anomalous events occurred during the launch. At liftoff, a propellant fill umbilical became snared with its release lanyard. It ripped out of the LC-19 service tower and remained attached to the second stage during ascent. Tracking camera footage also showed that the first stage oxidizer tank dome ruptured after staging and released a cloud of nitrogen tetroxide. The telemetry package on the first stage had been disabled at staging, so visual evidence was the only data available. Film review of Titan II ICBM launches found at least seven other instances of <b>post-staging</b> tank rupture, most likely caused by flying debris, second stage engine exhaust, or structural bending.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} scale-up of the residence-time distribution (RID) of particles in bubbling fluidized beds (BFBs) with continuous particle flow. Two approaches were investigated in this study: first, using well-known scaling laws that require changes in particle properties and gas velocity; second, using a simple approach keeping the same particles and gas velocity for different beds. Our theoretical analysis indicates {{it is possible}} to obtain similar RTDs in different BFBs with scaling laws if the plug-flow residence time (t(plug)) is changed as m(0. 5), where m is the scaling ratio of the bed; however, neither approach can ensure similar RTDs if tplug is kept invariant. To investigate RID variations using two approaches without changing t(plug), we performed experiments in three BFBs. The derivatives dE(theta) /d theta (where E(theta) is the dimensionless RID density function and theta is the dimensionless time) in the early stage of the RTDs always varied with m(- 1), which was attributed {{to the fact that the}} particle movement in the early stage were mainly subject to dispersion. Using the simple approach, we obtained similar RTDs by separately treating the RTDs in the early and <b>post-stages.</b> This approach guarantees RID similarity and provides basic rules for designing BFBs.

[p.407] Wady Nakhla, {{as far as}} {{the road}} to Meccah runs through it, is {{described}} as follows: From the ridges with whose declivity the Western watershed begins, you descend into Wady Baubat; it is flanked on the left side by the Sarat mountains, on which Tayif stands, and contains Qarn-almanazil (once the capital of the Minaeans, the great trading nation of antiquity). Three or four miles below Qarn is Masjid Ibrahym, and here the valley assumes the name of Wady Nakhla. At no great distance from the Masjid there rise on the left-hand side of the Wady two high peaks called Jebel Yasum and Jebel Kafw. Both were the refuge of numerous monkeys, who used to invade the neighbouring vineyards. As you go down Wady Nakhla the first place of importance you meet is al-Zayma. Close to it was a garden which, during the reign of Moqtadir, belonged to the Hashimite Prince Abd Allah, and was in a most flourishing condition. It produced an abundance of henna, plantains, and vegetables of every description, and yielded a revenue of five thousand Dinar-mithqals (about £2,860) annually. A canal from Wady (the river) Nakhla feeds a fountain which jets forth {{in the midst of the}} garden, and lower down a tank. In the garden stood a fort (which in a dilapidated condition is extant to this day, and spoken of by Burckhardt). It was built of huge stones, guarded for the defence of the property by the Banu Sa’d, and tenanted by the servants and followers of the proprietor. Below al-Zayma is Sabuha, a post-station where a relay of horses was kept for the transport of Government Despatches. To give an idea of the distances, I may mention that the <b>post-stages</b> were twelve Arabic miles asunder, which on this road are rather larger than an English geographical mile.

Daily, during running, and <b>post-stage</b> energy, macronutrient and water intake variables were observed to be lower with severity of GIS and DI (p[*]<[*] 0.05) throughout the MSUM only.|$|E

Body mass (BM) and urinary ketones were determined pre- and <b>post-stage.</b> Recovery, appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms were monitored daily. Pre-stage BM, total daily energy (overall mean: 3348 kcal/day), protein (1. 5 g/kgBM/day), carbohydrate (7. 5 g/kgBM/day) and fat (1. 4 g/kgBM/day) intakes did not differ between stages in UER. CON presented a daily macronutrient profile closer to benchmark recommendations than UER. Carbohydrate intake pre-stage (102 g), during running (24 g/h) and immediately <b>post-stage</b> (1. 7 g/kgBM), and protein intake <b>post-stage</b> (0. 3 g/kgBM) did not differ between stages, and were below benchmark recommendations {{in the majority of}} UER. <b>Post-stage</b> urinary ketones increased in UER as competition progressed (Stage 1 : 16 % vs. Stage 5 : 32 %). Gastrointestinal distresses and appetite suppression were reported by 85 % and 72 % of UER, respectively, along the MSUM. Correlations between subjective symptomology, energy and carbohydrate intakes were observed in UER (P< 0. 05). Sub-optimal macronutrient profile, carbohydrate intake, and recovery nutrition throughout the MSUM suggests energy quantity and quality may be compromised in ultra-runners along competition; indicating that specialised nutritional education may be beneficial in this population...|$|E
30|$|No acetoacetic acid was {{identified}} in pre-stage urine samples throughout the MSUM and pre-event urine samples in the 24  h. Acetoacetic acid (concentration range 1.5 to 8.0  mmol/l) in <b>post-stage</b> urine samples {{was evident in}} 46  % of participants at some point along the MSUM and 90  % {{of participants in the}} 24  h. No significant differences in pre- and <b>post-stage</b> acetoacetic acid concentration were observed between GIS and no-GIS and DI and no-DI along the MSUM. No significant differences in pre- and post-event acetoacetic acid concentration were observed between GIS and no-GIS in the 24  h.|$|E
40|$|Abstract：Nowadays, in {{the field}} of design thinking, {{designers}} have adopting individual experience and cases to solve the complicated and new design problems. And it has been a common strategy and a generally existing phenomenon. The purpose of this research attempts to know the thinking mode of case adoption in the process of design sketches. This research adopts protocol analysis and experiment observation as the method about the thinking mode of case adoption, and developing an experiment focusing on the behavior mode of designers in the process of sketches to proceed analyzing and observation. All the stages of experiment included three process stages: pro-stage, middle-stage, and post-stage; and the subject, as an example, has space design background to proceed the experiment of protocol analysis. Finally, use the verbal data of the experiment to proceed coding and analyzing. This research intends to know the designers ’ thinking mode of case adoption and design reasoning during the three stages. The conclusions of this research are as followed: First, the case adoption frequency of pro-stage (23 %) and <b>post-stage</b> (20 %) is more than middle-stage (9 %). Second, the influence of case adoption of designers ’ thinking mode in the pro-stage and <b>post-stage</b> is larger than in the middle-stage. Third, the middle-stage is different from other stages in case adoption, that designers’ thinking mode is based on personal opinions, and not influenced by relevant design cases and experience, which designers tend to adopt into the process of thinking by the stimulation and review of cases in the design <b>post-stage.</b> Based on the results of this study, it is desired to be a reference for design method of case adoption, for design teaching...|$|E
