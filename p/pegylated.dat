5|$|Alacizumab pegol is a <b>PEGylated</b> humanized {{antibody}} {{targeting the}} circulatory system.|$|E
5|$|An {{antibody}} can be <b>PEGylated</b> (attached to {{molecules of}} polyethylene glycol) {{to slow down}} its degradation by enzymes and to decrease its immunogenicity; this is shown by the word pegol as in alacizumab pegol.|$|E
5|$|One such {{success is}} related to {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with <b>Pegylated</b> interferon-alpha-2a or <b>Pegylated</b> interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.|$|E
5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the <b>PEGylated</b> version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the <b>PEGylated</b> interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and {{containers}} {{are often}} covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. Doxorubicin {{is also available}} in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (<b>pegylated</b> form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, although these forms must also be given by intravenous injection.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.88 to 32.79 USD per 50mg vial. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £100.12. Versions that are <b>pegylated</b> and in liposomes are also available; however, are more expensive. Doxorubicin was originally made from the bacteria Streptomyces peucetius.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting <b>PEGylated</b> interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E
25|$|Certolizumab is a <b>PEGylated</b> Fab {{fragment}} of a humanized anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody {{that was found}} to have efficacy over placebo in one large trial.|$|E
25|$|The typical dosing {{schedule}} injects at least 3 million units of Interferon-alpha (not <b>pegylated</b> versions) {{three times a}} week, although the original protocol began with six months of daily injections.|$|E
25|$|Plain RNAs may be poor immunogens, but {{antibodies}} {{can easily}} be created against RNA-protein complexes. Many autoimmune diseases see these types of antibodies. There haven’t yet been reports of antibodies against siRNA bound to proteins. Some methods for siRNA delivery adjoin polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the oligonucleotide reducing excretion and improving circulating half-life. However recently a large Phase III trial of <b>PEGylated</b> RNA aptamer against factor IX had to be discontinued by Regado Biosciences because of a severe anaphylactic reaction to the PEG part of the RNA. This reaction led to death in some cases and raises significant concerns about siRNA delivery when <b>PEGylated</b> oligonucleotides are involved.|$|E
25|$|Biomarin is {{currently}} conducting clinical trials to investigate PEG-PAL (<b>PEGylated</b> recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase or ‘PAL’) is an enzyme substitution therapy {{in which the}} missing PAH enzyme is replaced with an analogous enzyme that also breaks down Phe. PEG-PAL is now in Phase 2 clinical development.|$|E
25|$|The {{new drugs}} {{launched}} in Iran {{for the treatment}} of MS include an interferon beta-1b by CinnaGen. Gamma Immunex (recombinant interferon beta 1), Pegaferon (recombinant <b>pegylated</b> interferon (PEG-IFN)) and regenerative human factor VIII are among other recombinant-based medication made in Iran. A generic version of fingolimod by Novartis has been launched as well as a biosimilar version of EMD Serono′s Rebif.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pegylated</b> {{interferon}} (PEG IFN) is dosed {{just once}} a week as a subcutaneous injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon. Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring. PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 {{per year in the}} United States, compared to $2,500-8,700 for the oral medications; however, its treatment duration is 48 weeks as opposed to the oral antivirals, which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum 1 year). PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with <b>pegylated</b> liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or platins.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of the}} {{available}} drugs can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2008, there are seven medications licensed {{for the treatment of}} [...] infection in the United States. These include antiviral drugs lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), tenofovir (Viread), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude), and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and <b>PEGylated</b> interferon alpha-2a (Pegasys). In 2015 the World Health Organization recommended tenofovir or entecavir as first-line agents. Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment.|$|E
500|$|Interferon beta-1a is {{injected}} either weekly (intramuscular injection) {{or three times}} a week (subcutaneous injection) depending on commercial formulations, while interferon beta-1b {{is injected}} subcutaneously every second day. In 2014, a <b>pegylated</b> form of interferon beta-1a was introduced with the brand name Plegridy, which is available as a subcutaneous injection. This peginterferon beta 1-a attaches polyethylene glycol to the interferon molecules allowing longer lasting biological effects in the body while decreasing the frequency of administration to once every two weeks. [...] Interferon beta balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the blood–brain barrier. Overall, therapy with interferon beta leads to a reduction of neuron inflammation. Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of nerve growth factor and consequently improve neuronal survival.|$|E
500|$|There is a <b>pegylated</b> (polyethylene glycol coated) liposome-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, sold as Doxil. It was {{developed}} to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer that causes lesions to grow under the skin, in {{the lining of the}} mouth, nose and throat, or in other organs. The polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome. [...] Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. [...] The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful. [...] In clinical testing at 50mg/m2 dosing every 4 weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin. [...] This form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{different}} types of interferons are approved for use in humans. One was first approved for medical use in 1986. For example, in January 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of <b>PEGylated</b> interferon-alpha in the USA; in this formulation, <b>PEGylated</b> interferon-alpha-2b (Pegintron), polyethylene glycol {{is linked to the}} interferon molecule to make the interferon last longer in the body. [...] Approval for <b>PEGylated</b> interferon-alpha-2a (Pegasys) followed in October 2002. [...] These <b>PEGylated</b> drugs are injected once weekly, rather than administering two or three times per week, as is necessary for conventional interferon-alpha. When used with the antiviral drug ribavirin, <b>PEGylated</b> interferon is effective in treatment of hepatitis C; at least 75% of people with hepatitis C genotypes 2 or 3 benefit from interferon treatment, although this is effective in less than 50% of people infected with genotype 1 (the more common form of hepatitis C virus in both the U.S. and Western Europe). Interferon-containing regimens may also include protease inhibitors such as boceprevir and telaprevir.|$|E
2500|$|Injectable {{interferon}} {{alpha was}} the first therapy approved for chronic hepatitis B. It has several side effects, {{most of which are}} reversible with removal of therapy, but it has been supplanted by newer treatments for this indication. These include long-acting interferon bound to polyethylene glycol (<b>pegylated</b> interferon) and the oral nucleoside analogues.|$|E
2500|$|For platinum-resistant tumors, {{there are}} no high-efficacy {{chemotherapy}} options. Single-drug regimens (doxorubicin or topotecan) do not have high response rates, but single-drug regimens of topotecan, <b>pegylated</b> liposomal doxorubicin, or gemcitabine are used in some cases. Topotecan cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage. Paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen, {{or it may be}} combined with liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, topotecan, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide. ( [...] See also Palliative care below.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to hepatitis A and B, progression to chronic hepatitis C {{is much more}} common. The ultimate goal of hepatitis C treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The best {{way to reduce the}} long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR). SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure. Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs. The indirect acting antivirals include <b>pegylated</b> interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV. Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype. These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas. In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ribavirin is used {{primarily}} to treat hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers (which is an orphan indication in most countries). In this former indication the oral (capsule or tablet) form of ribavirin {{is used in}} combination with <b>pegylated</b> interferon alfa. Including in people coinfected with hepatitis B, HIV and in the pediatric population. Statins may improve this combination's efficacy in treating hepatitis C. Ribavirin is the only known treatment {{for a variety of}} viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection, although data regarding these infections are scarce and the drug might be effective only in early stages. It is noted by the USAMRIID that [...] "Ribavirin has poor in vitro and in vivo activity against the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and the flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, and Kyasanur forest disease)" [...] The aerosol form has been used in the past to treat respiratory syncytial virus-related diseases in children, although the evidence to support this is rather weak.|$|E
