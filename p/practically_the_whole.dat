Though {{some members of the}} IJN command were initially skeptical of such reports, this narrative was carried forward by members of the cabinet until it reached Emperor Hirohito. He congratulated the Navy and Army for their success. Newspapers in particular trumpeted these claims, repeating adnauseam that the U.S. task force was broken and in retreat. Even those unconvinced members of the IJN, up to and including Toyoda, believed some kind of victory had been achieved off Formosa.|$|E

25|$|The {{battalion}} {{had just}} arrived in camp at Eastbourne for annual training on Sunday 2 August 1914 when news reached them of the mobilisation of the Continental Powers. The battalion immediately entrained for London and the men returned to their homes. Mobilisation came on 5 August. The men were accommodated in Curtain Road and Scrutton Street schools, the transport in Broad Street Goods Yard, and the officers at the Armfields Hotel. A week later, the Commanding Officer, Viscount Hood, asked if the men would volunteer for foreign service, and <b>practically</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> battalion did so, making it eligible to be sent overseas. The men who did not so volunteer, or were unfit, were constituted as a second battalion to which the new recruits were directed.

In April 1915 a reserve battalion, named 3/7th Londons, was organised to train and supply drafts to the other battalions serving overseas.|$|E
500|$|When {{the public}} {{performance}} ban was lifted at the Restoration {{of the monarchy}} in 1660, Charles II immediately encouraged the drama and took a personal interest in the scramble for acting licences and performance rights which followed. Two middle-aged pre-Commonwealth playwrights notable for their loyalty during Charles' exile emerged from the struggle with royal Letters Patent for new, or refurbished, patent theatre companies: Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant. Killigrew {{was able to take}} over Michael Mohun's skilled veteran troupe for his [...] "King's Company" [...] and to start with [...] "what was essentially a going concern" [...] (Hume), with the added advantage of the traditional performance rights Mohun brought with him for <b>practically</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> classic repertory of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and the Beaumont and Fletcher team. The competition, Davenant's [...] "Duke's Company", seemed doomed to a secondary position with its young, scratched-together troupe and scarcely any performance rights. They were only allowed to put on abridged and modernized versions of Shakespeare plays, and a few that Davenant had written. However, Davenant, [...] "a brilliant impresario" [...] (Hume), was soon able to turn the tables on Killigrew by realising his old pre-Civil War dream of music, dance, and spectacular visual effects on the public stage.|$|E
500|$|In the 1969–70 NBA season {{under new}} coach Joe Mullaney, the Lakers' season {{began with a}} shock when Wilt Chamberlain seriously injured his knee and missed <b>practically</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> regular season. As after Baylor's injury years before, West stepped into the void, leading the NBA in scoring average with 31.2points per game, and {{averaging}} 4.6rebounds and 7.5assists per game, earning him his first of four All-Defensive First Team vote and another All-NBA First Team berth after two Second Team years. The Lakers won 46 games, and in the 1970 NBA Playoffs, they narrowly beat the Phoenix Suns in seven games and swept the Hawks in four, setting up the first NBA Finals between the Lakers and the rugged New York Knicks, led by Hall-of-Famers, such as Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. L.A. and N.Y. split the first two games, with both games respectively decided by centers Reed and the still-hobbling Chamberlain. In Game 3, DeBusschere hit a mid-range jump shot with three seconds left to put the Knicks ahead 102–100, and the Lakers had no time-outs left. Chamberlain inbounded the ball to West, who raced past Walt Frazier and threw up a 60-foot shot. Frazier later commented: [...] "The man's crazy. He looks determined. He thinks it's really going in!" [...] West incredibly connected, and this basket was later {{called one of the}} greatest moments ever by the NBA. As the three-point line had not been introduced yet, the shot just tied the game. In overtime, West however sprained his left hand and missed all five of his shots, and the Knicks won 111-108. In Game 4, the guard scored 37points and 18assists, and the Lakers won. However, more frustration awaited West in Game 5, when Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed out for the series; instead of capitalising on a double-digit lead and reeling off an easy win, the Lakers committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half and lost 107-100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. After Chamberlain scored 45points and West 31points plus 13assists in a series-equalising 135-113 Lakers win, the Lakers seemed favorites prior to Game 7. However, West had also injured his right hand and received several manual injections, and Reed famously hobbled up court prior to Game 7: the Knicks center scored the first fourpoints, and inspired his team {{to one of the most}} famous playoff upsets of all time. With his injured hands, West still hit nine of his 19 shots, but was outplayed by Walt Frazier, who scored 36points and 19assists and was credited with several crucial steals on Lakers guard Dick Garrett.|$|E
