2500|$|Stereolithography is {{a common}} rapid {{manufacturing}} and rapid prototyping technology for producing parts with high accuracy and good surface finish by utilizing a vat of liquid UV-curable <b>photopolymer</b> [...] "resin" [...] and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. Stereolithography was invented by Chuck Hull in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray <b>photopolymer</b> materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each <b>photopolymer</b> layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid <b>photopolymer</b> resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of rubber plate and sleeve materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct <b>photopolymer</b> laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and dry cycle follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using <b>photopolymer</b> plates. After engraving, the <b>photopolymer</b> is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional <b>photopolymer</b> process requiring photography and chemicals. See below.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, EnvisionTEC started {{producing}} Perfactory printers using Texas Instruments DLP projectors.

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to print objects [...] "bottom up" [...] by using a vat with a transparent bottom, and focusing the UV or deep-blue polymerization laser upward through {{the bottom of the}} vat. For example, the Form 1 stereolithography machine starts a print by lowering the build platform to touch the bottom of the resin-filled vat, then moving upward the height of one layer. The UV laser then writes the bottom-most layer of the desired part upward through the transparent vat bottom, and the <b>photopolymer</b> hardens selectively where the laser strikes. Then the vat is [...] "rocked", flexing and peeling the bottom of the vat away from the hardened photopolymer; the hardened material detaches {{from the bottom of the}} vat and stays attached to the rising build platform, and new liquid <b>photopolymer</b> flows in from the edges of the partially built part. The UV laser then writes the second-from-bottom layer and repeats the process. An advantage of this bottom-up mode is that the build volume can be much bigger than the vat itself, and only enough <b>photopolymer</b> is needed to keep the bottom of the build vat continuously full of <b>photopolymer.</b>|$|E
