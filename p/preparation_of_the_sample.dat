50|$|Fill {{power is}} the most {{frequently}} used measure of down quality. It involves measurements taken of a one-ounce sample of down in a plexiglas cylinder with a weighted piston compressing the down. The test requires controlled temperature, humidity, and <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample.</b> All other things being equal a parka (duvet or sleeping bag) made with high fill power is lighter and more compressible than an equally warm one made with lower quality down. Fill power is expressed as cubic inches per ounce (in³/oz) - a lofting power of 400 - 450 is considered medium quality, 500-550 is considered good, 550 - 750 is considered very good, and 750+ is considered excellent.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{configurations}} {{have the same}} requirements for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> to be examined. First, the substance of interest must be in intimate contact with the known reference material. In other words, the clean solid must be mounted in a reference liquid, one mineral phase must be in intimate contact with the reference mineral phase, or the homogenous liquid must contain the reference solid. Most applications involve a solid mounted in a reference liquid (referred to as the mounting medium). Second, dispersion colors will only be present if the two materials have the same refractive index for some wavelength in the visible spectrum (referred to as λo) and they have very different dispersions curves for the refractive index. Finally, the sample must be properly mounted under a coverslip to minimize any other optical effect that could complicate {{the interpretation of the}} color seen. Once these criteria are met the sample is ready to be examined.|$|E

5000|$|The key {{instrument}} for cryosection is the cryostat, {{which is essentially}} a microtome inside a freezer. The microtome {{can be compared to}} a very accurate [...] "deli" [...] slicer, capable of slicing sections as thin as 1 micrometre. The usual histology slice is cut at 5 to 10 micrometres. The surgical specimen is placed on a metal tissue disc which is then secured in a chuck and frozen rapidly to about -20 to -30 °C. The specimen is embedded in a gel like medium called OCT and consisting of poly ethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol; this compound is known by many names and when frozen has the same density as frozen tissue. At this temperature, most tissues become rock-hard. Usually a lower temperature is required for fat or lipid rich tissue. Each tissue has a preferred temperature for processing. Subsequently it is cut frozen with the microtome portion of the cryostat, the section is picked up on a glass slide and stained (usually with hematoxylin and eosin, the H&E stain). The <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is much more rapid than with traditional histology technique (around 10 minutes vs 16 hours). However, the technical quality of the sections is much lower. The entire laboratory can occupy a space less than 9 sq ft, and minimal ventilation is required compared to a standard wax embedded specimen laboratory.|$|E
5000|$|AMS {{counts the}} atoms of [...] and [...] {{in a given}} sample, {{determining}} the / ratio directly. The sample, often {{in the form of}} graphite, is made to emit C− ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an accelerator. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge. The C3+ ions are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the [...] stream, but since the volume of [...] (and , needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a Faraday cup. Some AMS facilities are also able to evaluate a sample's fractionation, another piece of data necessary for calculating the sample's radiocarbon age.The use of AMS, as opposed to simpler forms of mass spectrometry, is necessary because of the need to distinguish the carbon isotopes from other atoms or molecules that are very close in mass, such as [...] and [...] As with beta counting, both blank samples and standard samples are used.

(flowables), Silux Plus (microfilled) and Z 100 (minifilled) before and after polishing at different times. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, 240 specimens (5 mm diameter, 1. 4 mm high) were prepared. Vickers hardness was determined before and after polishing at different times: immediately, 24 h, 7 and 21 days after <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples.</b> Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and Tukey test. RESULTS: There was no difference in <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> flowable resins, which had lower hardness than the minifilled resin. The minifilled resin showed the highest surface hardness as compared to the other materials (p< 0. 01). All materials exhibited higher hardness after polishing, being more evident after 7 days. CONCLUSION: It may be concluded that, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composite resin, surface hardness was considerably increased when polishing was delayed and performed 1 week after <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R
