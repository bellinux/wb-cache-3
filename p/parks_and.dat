40|$|As a {{multimodal}} travel behavior, <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride includes several trip modes such as car, walking, bus, or railway. And people’s choice of <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride {{is influenced by}} many factors. This paper, based on the <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride behavior survey in Beijing, will analyze {{the relationship between the}} perception of the influencing factors and the behavior intent for <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride by using structural equation modeling. The conclusions suggest that the <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride choice for travelers is a passive behavior which means giving up driving the car is mainly caused by the serious traffic congestion. Furthermore, improving the service level of the <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride facilities and the comfort for riding bus or railway will increase the utilization of <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride facilities. The perceptions of the influencing factors have both direct and indirect effects on the travel intent for <b>park</b> <b>and</b> ride by the interaction among the influencing factors...|$|R
5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Recreation producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but could actually build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced <b>Parks</b> <b>and</b> Recreation would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E

Most of these routes travel in the HOV lane of a freeway during commute hours; METRO was a national pioneer in this type of service.|$|R
