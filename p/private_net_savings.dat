We analyze all these aspects estimating a VAR - between household and (nonfinancial) corporate financial balances (also known as the corporate financing gap), financial markets, and the economic cycle - and imposing restrictions on the matrix A to identify the structural shocks. We find that households and corporate balances react to financial markets as theoretically expected, and that the economic cycle reacts positively to corporate balance, in accordance with the Minskyan view of the operation of the economy that we have embraced...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{with the}} {{liberalization}} of capital account in 1989, speculative capital inflows have significantly raised due {{to the increase in}} interest rates resulting from incremental budget deficits in Turkey. Because of the fact that current account deficit problem has been kept in agenda while the budget deficit in Turkey has got closer to balance, a new potential determinant of current account, namely the gap between <b>private</b> <b>savings</b> and investment, <b>net</b> <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> is proposed recently.

New estimates of saving, developed and measured as the change in real net worth {{based on data from}} the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds National Balance Sheets, differ substantially from the NIPA estimates.

40|$|While the short-run {{financial}} status of Social Security is secure, its long-run {{financial status}} is very uncertain. The retirement and disability {{part of the}} system (OASDI) is projected to be in long-run actuarial deficit under the Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and demographic f 9 recasts. Hospital Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large deficit, beginning in the 1990 s. OASDI is projected to accrue a very large surplus over the next thirty years, peaking at almost 30 % of GNP. Social Security has never accrued a surplus this large; it may well be dissipated for other purposes, such as to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise benefits, or cut taxes. These alternatives may affect <b>net</b> national <b>saving,</b> directly because Social Security surpluses or deficits are part of government sector saving and indirectly through effects on private saving or the non-Social Security part of the federal government budget. This paper documents how various systematic deviations from, or return to, pay-as-you-go finance of the Social Security system may affect <b>net</b> national <b>saving.</b> For example, under base case assumptions with respect to the non-Social Security deficit, a constant <b>net</b> <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> rate of 6 %, and long-run budget balance in the state and local government sector, the Social Security deficit offsets 40 % of other <b>net</b> national <b>saving</b> over the Social Security Administration's 75 -year projection period. In the first 25 -year sub-period, the Social Security surplus adds one-sixth to other net national saving; in the second, it offsets almost one-half; and in the third, it offsets five-sixths of other <b>net</b> national <b>saving.</b> Of course, private saving may respond to changes in Social Security's funding as may the non-Social Security balance in the federal budget. The paper presents several alternative scenarios such as benefits increasing or taxes falling during the OASDI surplus period, various stylized rules concerning the non-Social Security budget deficit, and separate balancing of HI via outlay reductions or tax increases. The results indicate that OASDI may effect <b>net</b> national <b>saving</b> substantially. For example, if benefits ratchet up during what would have been the period of the OASDI surplus, the OASDI system may subsequently offset virtually all of remaining <b>net</b> national <b>saving.</b> On the other hand, if HI is brought into balance and the OASDI surplus is allowed to accrue, Social Security will offset only about 4 % of other <b>net</b> national <b>saving.</b> Changes in private saving may accentuate or ameliorate the swings in the <b>net</b> national <b>saving</b> rate generated by the future financing of OASDHI, but the alternative financing options will be important determinant of <b>net</b> national <b>saving,</b> and therefore of private domestic investment and international capital flows. ...|$|R

The adjusted <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> rate incorporated not just physical capital depreciation, but natural capital depletion and environmental damage, as well as including some human capital formation. In this paper, using a cross‐section of developing economies for 2001 – 2006, determinants of the adjusted <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> rate are estimated.

Also, a basic Solow growth model is extended to incorporate natural resources and to justify a more comprehensive measure of savings, such as the adjusted <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> rate, for modeling economic growth.

Although DOD projects it will realize significant recurring savings from the closures and realignments, Congress continues to raise questions about how much, if any, money has been saved through the base closure process. Two GAO reports issued in late 1998 concluded that <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> from the four closure rounds were substantial but that the cost and savings estimates {{used to calculate the}} <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> were imprecise. This report reviews (1) the basis for DOD's recent increase in <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> projected to be realized from the closure process and (2) GAO's previous observations on the basis for savings from base closure and realignment actions and the precision of the cost and savings estimates. DOD's fiscal year 2001 budget request and documentation show that it now expects <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> of about $ 15. 5 billion through fiscal year 2001 and about $ 6. 1 billion in annual recurring savings thereafter, an increase from the $ 14. 2 billion and about $ 5. 6 billion, respectively, DOD reported in fiscal year 1999. GAO's analysis of the data showed that the <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> increase through fiscal year 2001 was due primarily to an overall reduction of about $ 723 million in reported costs and an increase of about $ 610 million in expected savings resulting from the closures. The <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> for the four rounds of base closures and realignments are substantial and are related to decreased funding requirements in specific operational areas. Reviews by the Congressional Budget Office, the DOD Inspector General, and the Army Audit Agency have affirmed that <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> are substantial after initial investment costs are recouped. However, those same reviews also showed that the estimates are imprecise and should be viewed as a rough approximation of the likely savings. ...|$|R

In the Ronald Reagan era, the US government had a historically large budget deficit due to the Reagan administration tax cuts and increases in military spending. During 1976-80, government revenue was 10.01 percent of potential GNP, and it declined to 8.86 percent during 1981-1985. The ratio of the US government's budget deficit to its potential GNP did not exceed 4 percent from World War II until 1981, and exceeded 4 percent after 1981. The ratio of an inflation- and cycle-adjusted deficit to the potential GNP was 2.56 percent during 1981-1986, and this ratio was the largest between 1958 and 1986. If the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis is true, the rational consumers of the economy, who expect the government to raise taxes, try to reduce their consumption and increase their savings. The reality was that the <b>net</b> <b>private</b> <b>saving</b> {{as a percentage of}} GNP was 8.55 in the 1976-1980 period, and it decreased to 7.47 percent in the 1981-1986 period.

Photocopy. x, 129 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmLittle {{attention}} has been given to possible differences in the growth impact of individual components of aggregate saving and investment finance from both domestic and foreign sources. Essentially, the differential growth effects of national sectoral saving, namely, household saving, private business and public saving, have not been well explored. Additionally, the income growth effect of foreign borrowing has not been focused on much in available studies. The main objective {{of this study is to}} test two hypotheses: (1) individual components of national sectoral saving in Thailand have different growth effects: (2) foreign borrowing in Thailand has a positive income growth effect. Assuming a perfectly elastic supply of foreign borrowing, demand for foreign borrowing reflects an ex ante excess demand gap in the market for goods and services. A macroeconomic model of the investment-saving type and of six structural and five identity equations is developed for a small open economy facing current account deficits under a fixed exchange rate system. Based on this framework, theoretical arguments are carefully developed to rationalize the differential growth effects of national sectoral saving and the positive growth effect of foreign borrowing. The model is fitted to annual time-series data on Thailand for the period 1961 - 1982. The two-stage least squares technique is employed to estimate the model. Three rigorous tests of model validity are performed by using ex post dynamic simulation procedure. Judging from the good statistical fit of each equation and the results of three tests of model validity, the macroeconometric model can be regarded as a reasonable representation of the salient aspects of saving and growth performance of the Thai economy. Major empirical findings are: (1) national sectoral saving has differential growth effects in Thailand. Specifically, household saving has the largest growth effect, <b>private</b> corporate <b>net</b> <b>saving</b> has a negative growth effect, and public saving has virtually no growth effect; (2) foreign borrowing has a positive growth effect in Thailand; and (3) foreign borrowing does not substitute for public saving as has been argued by radical critics.

The relationship between total life-cycle costs and the solar fraction is tested for selected cities to demonstrate how <b>net</b> <b>savings</b> (<b>net</b> losses) change as the solar fraction is increased. In its approach, this report is of interest to solar analysts; in its results, to the solar policy, research, and building communities...|$|R
