500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I {{think a lot of}} Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
2500|$|Although Herodotus {{considered}} his [...] "inquiries" [...] a serious pursuit of knowledge, {{he was not}} above relating entertaining tales derived from the collective body of myth, but he did so judiciously with regard for his historical method, by corroborating the stories through enquiry and testing their probability. While the gods never make personal appearances in his account of human events, Herodotus states emphatically that [...] "many things <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the gods {{take part in the}} affairs of man" [...] (IX, 100).|$|E
2500|$|On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News said to Ellison, [...] "I {{have been}} nervous about this {{interview}} with you, because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you are not}} working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I {{think a lot of}} Americans will feel that way." [...] Ellison replied that his constituents, [...] "know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who's more patriotic than I am, and so you know, I don't need to — need to prove my patriotic stripes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} may! This <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{we have a}} hold on the boy's heart, and I would no more send him away now than I would my own Rob." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him a while in silence. [...] "Do you wish," [...] she demanded at last, [...] "to win my eternal gratitude? <b>Prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I am better than I suppose." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear Count," [...] the Princess said, [...] "to-night has <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it {{is quite}} time Jeanne had some one to look after her. Let me ask you. Are you {{perfectly}} serious in your suit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{of course}} I {{know that you}} are as well aware as I am {{of the nature of the}} transaction. That you can brazen it out without a blush only <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you have got beyond the reach of shame!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly {{we shall}} see. But I retire from the discussion," [...] the Cavaliere added. [...] "I have {{no wish to}} provoke you to attempt to <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I am wrong. You are already excited." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no--it is not that. You know, Swithin, that I {{am always}} sincere, {{and willing to}} own if I am to blame in anything. Now will you <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you are the same by owning some fault to me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They gave me taffy {{about the}} gun--the British use taffy where we use sugar. It's cheaper, and gets there just the same. They sat around and <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my gun was too good, too uniform--shot {{as close as}} a Mannlicher rifle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{him that}} I will act upon his advice. He has before now <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his {{warnings}} {{are not to}} be neglected. You seem by your attire to be an apprentice, young sir, and yet your manner is one of higher degree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] bristlingly {{settling}} his stubble chin in his coon-skins. [...] "Don't try to oil me; the herb-doctor tried that.

6000|$|I {{explained}} to the invisible ones: [...] "'Wilbur,' it is absolutely essential that you should <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> your voice is not dependent upon the vocal chords of the psychic. You see the importance of this, do you not, Mrs. Smiley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told my foster-father; but I {{met with}} neither sympathy nor understanding.

6000|$|... "Now, {{not a word}} more," [...] I said, {{stepping}} in and laying my hand on his cool forehead. It <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this atrocious absurdity was rooted in the man himself {{and not in the}} disease, which, apparently, had emptied him of every power, mental and physical, except that one fixed idea.|$|R
5000|$|Time*Sex*Love sold fewer copies than Carpenter's earlier work, and yielded {{only one}} {{charting}} single, [...] "Simple Life", which peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No. 53.

6000|$|Sir Claude {{looked at}} the moony globe of the lamp; he seemed to see for an instant what seeing Mrs. Beale would consist of.

6000|$|... "Ay--that is to say, {{you have}} hit the mark in your own sage opinion? Lord! Lord! how this world is given to folly!

60|$|She {{was leaning}} with her {{elbows on the}} red plush, {{looking down on the}} dancing-floor.

She didn't have to <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she came from the country. I knew it. She {{was a little bit of}} a thing, old-fashioned looking. She was dressed in grey, with white muslin collar and cuffs, and her hair done simple. She had a black hat.|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} {{sentence}} unfinished. In my {{state of mind}} I doubted {{not in the least}} that she meant to marry the pitcher who won the game, and so I told the Rube. He made one wild upheaval of his arms and shoulders, like an erupting volcano, which <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he believed it, too.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, nephew, to you. Why not? I have no {{relations}} {{living and}} I {{have learned to}} love you, I who thought that I could never care again for any man or woman or child.

6000|$|... "Certainly, if {{you wish}} it," [...] he answered, with {{something}} like a sneer. [...] "The reason why I refused to take your hand, Colonel Quaritch, {{is that you have}} been guilty of conduct which <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you are not a gentleman, and, therefore, not a person with whom I desire to be on friendly terms. Shall I go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wingrave," [...] she said, [...] "I will go away. I will do {{all that}} you tell me; I will wear my chains bravely, and hold my peace. But before I go, for heaven's sake, say a kind word, look at me kindly, kiss me, hold my hands; {{anything}}, anything, anything to <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you are not a}} dead man. I could bear unkindness, reproaches, abuse. I can bear anything but this deadly coldness. It is becoming a horror to me! Do, Wingrave--do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least. You {{see before}} {{you the most}} wretched heroine that ever {{appeared}} {{on the boards of}} any theatre. You may laugh, but it's true. I don't know what I've got to say to Mr. Moss now. If he comes forward in a proper manner, and can <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Madame Socani is not Madame Mahomet M. Moss, I don't know what I can do but accept him. The Adriatic is free to wed another." [...] Then she walked about the room, laughing to prevent her tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Life is too {{precious}} {{to be trusted}} to uncertainties. I leave you, Peyton, unknown to all but Caesar, and I recommend him to your mercy. But there is a care that weighs me to the earth. Look at my aged and infirm parent. He will be reproached for the supposed crime of his son. Look at those helpless sisters that I leave behind me without a protector. <b>Prove</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you love us all. Let the clergyman whom you will bring with you, unite you this night to Frances, and become at once, brother, son, and husband." ...|$|E

60|$|Phil.--The {{information}} we have already received from you <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> chemistry has been your favourite pursuit. I am surprised at this. The higher-mathematics and pure physics appear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> offer much more noble objects of contemplation and fields of discovery, and, practically considered, {{the results of the}} chemist are much more humble, belonging principally to the apothecary's shop and the kitchen.|$|R
60|$|When I had finished, and had related how Mother Anastasia had <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> all {{possible}} connection {{between myself and}} Sylvia Raynor was now at an end, Walkirk was not nearly so much depressed as I thought he ought to be. In fact, he endeavored <b>to</b> cheer <b>me,</b> and {{did not agree with}} Mother Anastasia that there was no hope. At this I lost patience.|$|R
