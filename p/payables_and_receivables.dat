5000|$|Equation {{describes}} {{a firm that}} buys and sells on account. Also, the equation is written to accommodate a firm that buys and sells on account. For a cash-only firm, the equation would only need data from sales operations (e.g. changes in inventory), because disbursing cash would be directly measurable as purchase of inventory, and collecting cash would be directly measurable as sale of inventory. However, no such 1:1 correspondence exists for a firm that buys and sells on account: Increases and decreases in inventory do not occasion cashflows but accounting vehicles (<b>payables</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables,</b> respectively); increases and decreases in cash will remove these accounting vehicles (receivables and payables, respectively) from the books. Thus, the CCC must be calculated by tracing a change in cash through its effect upon receivables, inventory, payables, and finally back to cash—thus, the term cash conversion cycle, and the observation that these four accounts [...] "articulate" [...] with one another.|$|E

40|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970 's the attempt to {{rationalize}} multinational corporations 2 ̆ 019 (MNCs) short-term liquid funds management {{led to the development}} and implementation of so-called "Netting Systems": In order to reduce the costs associated with transferring inter-affiliate payments, the idea behind these systems is to net out <b>payables</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables</b> so that only this netted amount needs be transferred. Depending upon the MNCs' internal payments structure there are two possible ways of determining these fund flows: In case affiliates just sell back and forth to each other, a bilateral netting approach will suffice. Generally, though, more complex interdependencies among MNCs'-subsidiaries call for a multilateral netting system to be presented here. While scientific publications on international cash management problems have brought up applications of a great variety of methodological approaches (1), in my opinion the problem outlined above has proven to be highly suggestive to mathematical programming techniques. Starting out I will therefore describe a classical transportation-type approach (chapter 2), then develop a modified linear program (LP) in chapter 3 along with a numerical example (chapter 4), and finally draw some conclusions in chapter 5...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{decision}} of firms to extend trade credit to customers and its relation with their financing decisions. The authors use a novel firm-level database of Chinese SMEs with unique information on market power in both output and input markets and on the amount, terms, and payment history of trade credit simultaneously extended to customers (accounts receivable) and received from suppliers (accounts payable). The analysis shows that suppliers with relatively weaker market power {{are more likely to}} extend trade credit and have a larger share of goods sold on credit. Examination of the importance of financial constraints reveals that access to bank financing and profitability are not significantly related to trade credit supply. Rather, firms that receive trade credit from their own suppliers are more likely to extend trade credit to their customers, and to"match maturity"between the contract terms of <b>payables</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables.</b> This matching practice is more likely used when firms face strong competition in the product market (relative to their customers), and enjoy strong market power in the input market (relative to their suppliers). These results highlight the importance of supply chain financing for market competition and risk management in credit constrained firms.

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{non-financial}} firms act as intermediaries, by channeling short-term {{funds from the}} financial institutions in an economy, to their best use. Non-financial firms act in this way because {{they may have a}} comparative advantage in exploiting informal means of ensuring that borrowers repay. These considerations suggest that to optimally exploit their advantage in providing trade credit to some classes of borrowers, firms should obtain external financing from financial intermediaries, and markets, when this is efficient. Thus the existence of a large banking system is consistent with these considerations. Using firm-level data for thirty nine countries, the authors compute turnovers in <b>payables,</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables,</b> and examine how they differ across financial systems. They find that the development level of a country's legal infrastructure, and banking system predicts the use of trade credit. Firms'use of bank debt is higher relative to their use of trade credit in countries with efficient legal systems. Bur firms in countries with large, privately owned banking systems, offer more financing to their customers, and take more financing from them. The authors'findings suggest that trade credit is a complement to lending by financial intermediaries, and should not be viewed by policymakers as a substitute.

Interest costs to gross income, number of days in <b>payables</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables</b> have a positive and significant influence on the probability of default. Financial and asset coverage, the investment ratio, return on equity and investment, solidity, variation in gross income and working capital to total assets are negatively related to default. Interest costs to gross income, solidity and working capital to total assets show larger marginal influence on the probability of default compared to return on investment, financial coverage, days in payables, days in receivables, and return on equity. Asset coverage, investment ratio and variation in gross income show relatively low marginal influence. While size influences default positively, age influences default negatively. The analysis of the joint influence of size and accounting ratios shows that size significantly alters the relation and {{the magnitude of the}} marginal influence of the accounting ratios on default. Our findings also indicate that industry and geography influence default. Besides assessing default in privately-held firms, our study identifies the important role of non-accounting information on default prediction and the practical significance of assessing the marginal influence of predictors instead of the classical coefficients. The factors we find as influencing default can be used as early warning signals in policies underlying supervision, and the default probabilities in the assessment of financial pressures in the corporate sector. ...|$|E

We find that enterprise adjustment in Russia has broadly followed the pattern observed in the leading CEE economies in transition. Demand and output have dropped, and many enterprises have changed their product mix in response without substantial new investment; firms are looking for new customers, though progress in terms of exports is still limited; they are containing wage costs and shedding labour, albeit more slowly than firms in the CEE countries; the levels of interenterprise credit (<b>payables</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables)</b> has increased but has stabilized at levels comparable to those observed both in other transition countries {{as well as in}} West European economies; enterprises have been moving payment methods and avoiding extending trade credit if possible. However, there are also signs that adjustment in the enterprise sector is uneven, that the overall pace of adjustment is low by CEE standards, and that governmental transfers are behind this. Whereas financial environment of enterprises is still soft, and the state is the source of this softness. The financial transfers to enterprises take two forms: subsidies, and directed credits. The case of directed state credits is analyzed in some detail, and evidence is presented suggesting that they are allocated accordingly to "need" meaning that the recipient enterprise is in financial difficulties and/or it is politically important...|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this dissertation, {{entitled}} Exchange Rate Exposure Management, addressed the question whether there has been a relationship between changes in exchange rate volatility and financial results of Czech enterprises and therefore foreign exchange exposure management is justified. For this purpose, the empirical data of revenues and exports and imports in CZ-NACE sections were used. Statistically significant results were demonstrated in the Section C - Manufacturing, where it was confirmed that profitability of sales declines with increasing volatility of the exchange rate. The nominal exchange rate CZK/EUR was taken into consideration, while a recent thesis (Klecka, 2016) showed that the use of another type of the exchange rate does not provide a statistically significant difference. In the second part a simple model called Estart was created in order to quantify the maximum impact of unexpected exchange rate changes in the profitability of a company and thus in order to start with the management of the exchange rate exposure. The formula for calculating exchange rate exposure is simple and requires only a few inputs as company total revenues, total expenses, the percentage of revenues in foreign currency and the percentage of expenditure in foreign currency. In order to quantify the maximum impact recommended percentage variations dependent on the time horizon were determined from the historical data of the exchange rate CZK/EUR. The company then receives initial information about the maximum impact of unexpected exchange rate change on their profitability and hence for example the potential maximum amount that makes sense to invest in exchange rate hedging. The model is also suitable for calculating the maximum impact for the specific <b>payables</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables.</b> The Model Estart is for its simplicity usable particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, which currently begin to address the question of the impact of exchange rate change on their profitability for example because of announcements of Czech National Bank concerning the end of the intervention that has been depreciating domestic currency since 2013 and also the complicated situation in the Eurozone. The next necessary step is to use more sophisticated methods in accordance with the principles of foreign exchange rate exposure management in order to quantify the impact of unexpected changes in the exchange rate on the profitability, respectively on the value of the company, mainly because of the management of the operational exposure, which is crucial and which is not addressed by this simple model...|$|E

Using over 2. 5 million observations for 600. 000 firms in 8 euro area countries in the period 1993 - 2009, we show that firms use the trade credit channel to manage growth. In countries where the trade credit channel is more present, the marginal impact is lower, but the total impact is still bigger. Further, firms that are more vulnerable to financial market imperfections, and therefore more likely to be financially constrained, rely more on the trade credit channel to manage growth.
