40|$|SUMMARY The {{inhibitory}} {{effect of the}} three benzimidazole derivatives timoprazole, <b>picoprazole,</b> and omeprazole on histamine and dbcAMP stimulated 14 C-aminopyrine accumulation (=H' secretion) has been studied in isolated and enriched guinea-pig parietal cells. All compounds tested inhibited H ' secretion in a concentration dependent manner with IC 50 values of 85 ± 1. 9 gmol/l for timoprazole, 3. 9 +O 07,umol/l for <b>picoprazole,</b> and 0 13 ± 003,umol/l for omeprazole. The IC 50 of timoprazole, when dbcAMP {{was used as a}} stimulus, did not differ significantly from that of histamine stimulation. The type of inhibition was of a non-competitive nature. The full acid response to histamine after temporary exposure of the cells to the benzimidazoles could be restored by washing the cells twice; this suggests that the inhibition is reversible. The data-among others- indicate that the properties of the benzimidazoles described here would allow these compounds to be used as effective antisecretagogues. Substituted benzimidazoles represent a new class of potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. Typical representatives of this chemical structure have been shown to block acid secretion in experimental animals ' and man, 2 in isolated rabbit gastric glands, 3 and in the isolated guinea-pig gastric mucosa. 45 Substituted benzimidazoles have a mechanism of action which is different from the other anti-secretagogues known so far. There is strong evidence that this new class of compounds interferes with the gastric proton pump, the H ' K+-ATPase, 6 and thereby inhibits acid secretion. It is {{the purpose of the present}} investigation to study the relative potencies of the three substituted benzimidazoles timoprazole, <b>picoprazole,</b> and omeprazole, in isolated and enriched guinea-pig parietal cells and to elucidate the type and stability of inhibition in this preparation...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} and subcellular {{distributions of}} adenosinetriphosphatases (ATPases) {{were examined in}} guinea-pig gastric mucosal cells. All cell types displayed Mg 2 +-ATPase and bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) -stimulated ATPase activity. K+-ATPase was located only in fractions derived from parietal cells. Differential and density-gradient centrifugation of material prepared from parietal cells revealed that K+-ATPase activity was located in a tubulo-vesicular membrane fraction. Enzyme activity was ten fold greater in this fraction than in a crude parietal cell homogenate. The substituted benzimidazoles, omeprazole and <b>picoprazole,</b> inhibited K+-ATPase (IC 50 1. 8 +/- 0. 5 mumol l- 1 and 3. 1 +/- 0. 4 mumol l- 1, respectively). Detailed kinetic analysis indicated that these compounds were non-competitive and reversible inhibitors of the enzyme. In contrast cimetidine and verapamil were without effect on the enzyme. The relevance of the inhibition of K+-ATPase to the antisecretory activity of the benzimidazoles, in experimental animals and man, is discussed...|$|E
