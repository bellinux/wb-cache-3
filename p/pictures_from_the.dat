5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos {{illustrated}} {{descriptions of}} warships {{had a significant}} influence on later naval handbooks and encyclopedias such as the naval section of the Wubei Zhi from circa 1628. These works would incorporate illustrations of ships originally from the Wujing Zongyao. The use of <b>pictures</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wujing Zongyao would continue to appear in Japanese naval texts up until the 18th century. The illustrations were used by both Nishikawa Joken's Ka-i Tsūshō-kō (Studies on the Intercourse and Trade with Chinese and Barbarians) in 1708 and Kanazawa Kanemitsu's Wakan Senyōshū (Collected Studies on the Ships used by the Chinese and Japanese) in 1766.|$|E

25|$|The xhamadan {{originated}} in the northeastern parts of Albania, but is worn {{throughout the country and}} in other territories inhabited by Albanians. The xhamadan appears to be the jacket to which 16th-century English poet Edmund Spenser refers in a line of his Faerie Queene, published in the 1590s, where he mentions the sleeves-dependent, Albanese wise. It is mentioned several times by British travel writers, such as John Foster Fraser, who in the first (1906) edition of his book, <b>Pictures</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, observes the preferences of Albanian men for xhamadans embroidered in gold or silver.|$|E

The exhibition continued until 28January. It was centered on Herman's atelier (studio) where he created most of his paintings. The atelier had been entirely re-built in the museum.

The report showed that the uppercut Jordan landed (which seemed to daze Barry) wasn't an uppercut but an open hand blow. The report also showed that Jordan's fingers found their way into Barry's eyes. Following the uppercut, Barry was trying to protect the eye from the next of Jordan's punches. Barry did not mention that he had been poked in the eye, but <b>pictures</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> day after the fight show that he tapped to strikes three times.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, the Swedish media {{reported}} that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included <b>pictures</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed. The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate {{on the condition that}} the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT. This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Messner {{succeeded in}} {{climbing}} Manaslu {{on what was}} then the totally unknown south face of the mountain, of which there were not even any <b>pictures.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> last high-altitude camp he climbed with Frank Jäger, who turned back before reaching the summit. Shortly after Messner reached the summit, the weather changed and heavy fog and snow descended. Initially Messner became lost on the way down, but later found {{his way back to the}} camp, where Horst Fankhauser and Andi Schlick were waiting for him and Jäger. Jäger did not return, although his cries were heard from the camp. Orientation had become too difficult. Fankhauser and Schlick began to search for him that evening, but lost their way and sought shelter at first in a snow cave. Messner himself was no longer in a position to help the search. The following day, only Horst Fankhauser returned. Andi Schlick had left the snow cave during the night and become lost. So the expedition had to mourn the loss of two climbers. Messner was later criticised for having let Franz Jäger go back down the mountain alone.|$|E
25|$|Winyah {{was one of}} {{the best}} known {{landmarks}} of the vicinity of New Rochelle up until May 5, 1897, when the residence burned to the ground along with its many valuable contents. The mansion was purchased from Col. Richard Lathers by Col. C. H. Green, President of Columbia Construction and Navigation Company. He occupied it with his wife and four-year-old nephew, and three servants including a 'waitress', 'laundress' and cook. In the early morning hours the waitress awoke to the smell of smoke alerting the other occupants to flee the house. The cook ran into New Rochelle village to secure assistance. The Fire Department, with two engines, a horse cart, and a truck, responded, though the mansion was about one and a half miles from the center of town. When they arrived, however, their attempt to get water from a hydrant was unavailable due to pebbles stuck within it. Nearly 100 men came with fire apparatus, but without water they could do nothing to stop the flames. Green offered a reward if anyone could save two <b>pictures</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gallery within the home however nothing could be saved and within two hours the entire structure was in ruins.
