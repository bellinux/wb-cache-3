40|$|Abstract:- Threshing as a <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operation</b> {{is as old}} as man. The {{evolution}} of mechanical threshers to secure the ever growing consumption of cereal has been hindered by several factors which have lead to low performance of several developed threshers. It has been discovered and observed by various researchers that performance of cereal threshers is highly dependent on the value of its working parameters. This work gives an insight into influence of crop, machine and operating parameters on performance of cereal threshers using a computer aided software for simulation of these parameter values. The parameters were varied at six levels and the simulations were performed by varying each parameter while the rest parameters were kept constant. It was observed that threshing efficiency increased for all increasing values of cylinder speed and bulk density, decreased for all increasing values of feed rate and concave clearance, and increased for increasing values of moisture content up to 17 % and decreased after wards. Also threshing loss was found to increase for all increasing values of feed rate and concave clearance, decreased for all increasing values of cylinder speed and bulk density, and decreased for all increasing values of moisture content up to 17 % and then increased after wards, similar effects on the efficiency and losses was observed in the capacity and unthreshed grain cases respectively. Thresher capacity and rate of unthreshed grain also showed significant reactions as these parameters were varied...|$|E

A sample size of 80 women was drawn from Char Ishawrdia village of Mymensingh sadar upazila. This finding showed {{that most of the}} respondents constituted economically active but were not well educated. It was found that the yearly average income and expenditure of the households were Tk. 66656. 25 and Tk. 67238. 75 respectively. It was also found that yearly average income of the respondents was only Tk. 7600. 00. Rural women of the study area were involved in harvesting crops, crop production, livestock rearing, homestead forestry and gardening, <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operation,</b> cooking, cleaning house, washing cloth and caring children. There were some factors relevant to rural women affecting food security. In functional analysis, the Log Linear model was fitted best. In this model, the household food security was significantly influenced by education of respondent, family size, household income, access to credit, and social participation. From the study it was found that women were highly empowered in study area and empowered women had great contribution to ensure the household food security. By the process of empowering women, now respondents have a chance to increase their income, to participate in decision making process, to build up their health and nutritional knowledge, control over capital and participate in social and political activities through which they can easily ensure food security. Findings of the study suggest that government should provide different types of facilities to rural women which will help those women to ensure household food security. Government should also take attempts to change the social attitudes towards the rural women...|$|E
40|$|This in-farm {{research}} study {{was aimed at}} evaluating new strategies {{in the use of}} plastic protective covers in field grown melon in order to expand the production period and reduce costs. Four experiments were set up in 2010 and repeated in 2011 in Central Italy, in an inland region with a temperate climate. We evaluated: i) the use of high tunnels for two growing cycles per year, i. e. for very early and very late production (target transplanting in late winter and mid-summer, respectively), for either one year or two consecutive years, and the use of grafted plants in the second year as an alternative to normal plants to prevent soil born diseases; ii) the use of ethylene-vinyl-acetate film low tunnels alone or combined with non-woven floating row covers for transplanting in early spring; iii) the use of non-woven low tunnels for transplanting in mid-spring; iv) the use of biodegradable and conventional polyethylene ground mulch films, both in the presence of nonwoven low tunnels. As far as the non-woven cover is concerned, we adopted the strategy of removing later with respect to usual practices, i. e. ten days after the onset of first pistillate flowers. This was based on the evidence that covers hamper honeybee circulation, which may be exploited on a farm-scale to delay pollination until an adequate number of pistillate flowers set, in order to shorten scaled fruit ripening and harvest. Our results demonstrate that high tunnels may be used for at least four consecutive melon growing cycles (early and late productions for two years) with good off-season yields and no appreciable drawbacks in terms of disease scale-up, irrespective of the use of normal or grafted plants. The non-woven low tunnel was effective in hampering honeybee circulation and its delayed removal allowed the harvest period to be halved, a more uniform fruit size to be obtained, and labour productivity of harvest to be increased. This had positive implications on the management of irrigation and chemical disease control close to the harvest period, and on the management of harvest and <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operation</b> schedules, including fruit processing, packaging and delivery to markets. In the presence of a non-woven low tunnel, there was no substantial difference in the biodegradable mulch compared to other mulches in terms of effects on harvest dates, yield and weed control, so that its use can be cost-effective and convenient provided that costs are not higher than those for traditional polyethylene films and their usage/disposal...|$|E

40|$|Cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) is an {{important}} African indigenous legume crop for the livelihoods of many relatively poor people residing n less developed countries of the tropics. Rural families derive a nutritious food, animal feed and in income from the production of this crop. Storage of seed is certainly the most important <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operation</b> but the losses incurred are great. These losses, due to an inability to effectively control physical and biological factors, result in problems with storage insects, moisture and associated fungi. Seeds are particularly susceptible to fungal contamination when stored at high ambient temperatures and relative humidities. To determine the storage fungi associated with cowpea seeds, surface-sterilised cowpea seeds (200 seeds from each of nine cultivars) were plated out n malt extract agar. After 5 - 7 days incubation at 25 °C, the most dominant and common fungi recorded were Alternaria spp. followed by Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus and A. niger. The influence of a three-year cold storage period at ± 5 °C on the fungi associated with the seeds was also investigated. Alternaria, Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. appeared to dominate. Some fungal species recorded prior to cold storage were not recorded thereafter. Certain storage fungi are known to produce mycotoxins, which are secondary fungal metabolites that are toxic to both farm animals and humans, under poor storage conditions. The presence of the fusarial mycotoxins, fumonisin BI, B 2 and B 3 in four cowpea cultivars (Bechwana Whit, Glenda, Iron Grey, Rhino) was investigated. The samples were extracted with methanol/water (70 : 30 v/v) and cleaned-up on strong anion exchange solid phase extraction cartridges. High performance liquid chromatography with pre¬column derivatisation using o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) {{was used for the}} detection and quantification of fumonisin Bl, B 2 and B 3. All sampIes were contaminated with FBI, with levels ranging from 81 - 1002 ng g-I. Fumonisin B 2 and B 3 were not detected in any samples. This {{is believed to be the}} first report of fumonisin BI in cowpea seeds. Since the known fumonisin-producing Fusarium species were not found in the six different Fusarium species isolated from these four cultivars, further investigations are required to determine which fungal species are species are responsible species are responsible for the FBI production. An alternative approach to the prevention and control of fungal contamination and mycotoxin production of seeds by treating cowpea seed with essential plant oils was tested. The inhibitory activity of five essential oils (thyme, clove, peppermint, soybean and peanut) was investigated, in vitro and in vivo, on five fungal species (A. flavus, A. niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Fusarium oxysporum and F. equiseti) commonly associated with cowpea seeds and on two cowpea cultivars. Thyme and clove oil significantly inhibited the growth of all five fungal species in vitro at 500 and 1000 ppm, while peppermint oil was successful at 2000 ppm. Peanut and soybean oil did not show any significant inhibition of fungal growth. The in vivo effect of thyme, clove and peppermint oils on naturally infected seed revealed that only thyme at 1000 ppm reduced fungal growth of storage fungi in the PAN 325 cultivar. In the PAN 311 cultivar, thyme and clove oils at 1000 ppm and peppermint oil at 2000 ppm significantIy reduced growth of storage fungi. In artificially infected seed, all three oils significantly inhibited the growth of P. chrysogenum. Thyme reduced the growth of F. oxysporum and F. equisetii, whilst peppermint oil inhibited only F. oxyspomm. These oils did not seem to adversely affect the germination nor emergence of cowpea seed. The storage fungi significantly reduced percentag germination and emergence of the white (IT 93 K 452 - 1) seed but had little or no effect on the brown (CH 14) seed. Furthermore, all three oils significantly inhibited the storage fungi on the white seed, possibly increasing the percentage germination and emergence.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} expressed by consumers toward food products quality {{as well as}} toward their linkage to the territory, has led producers to fit to the continuous rising demand for “typical products”, and to look for new and more efficient production and marketing strategies. An emblematic case is represented by Tropea red onion that, as a typical product, {{plays an important role}} in economical and rural development of the territory to which it is linked. The organoleptic features offered by “Tropea Red Onion”, PGI certified (Calabria), have to be associated as well to the quality of services that accompanies its processing. Technology application in <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations,</b> has certainly contributed to make faster and less tiring all processing tasks. The main problem related to the mechanization of Tropea red onion <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations</b> lies in the removal of the various layers of the external tunic, making it impossible for optical or electronic grader to achieve this task in a satisfactory way since the sensors are not able yet to separate the “bulb” from its involucre.

In spite of this, problems still persist in this industry, including low productivity due to mishandling of raw material in <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> One of the prime causes of this is manual grading/sorting of fresh fruit bunches, which is prone to error and misjudgement, as well as subjectivity. High demand of oil palm establishes its high price in world market, which drives the industry to expand its plantation area to increase production. Ultimately, it compromise forests and agricultural land, resulting stagnation or decline in several food products. Alternatively, before expanding plantation extent, oil extraction productivity of existing plantation can be improved by carefully selecting appropriate FFBs for post-harvest processing through introduction of automation.

Therefore the design of appropriate trade regulation cannot be limited to a discussion on the level of tariff to be applied by the ECOWAS custom union. Trade regulation could be used as buffer mechanisms to mitigate the negative impact of unpredictable world rice market trends on the willingness of private entrepreneur to invest in rice marketing and processing improvement.

40|$|Evaluation of {{mechanical}} and electrical properties of agricultural products {{plays an important}} role in equipment design and optimizing <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> Among the crops, tomato and its products are the major processing industries in the world and its economic importance is increasing. Considering the importance of the quality and various post harvesting uses of tomato, the evaluation {{of mechanical}} properties including rupture force and deformation and the work done to establish the rupture of two tomato cultivars (Petoearly CH and Newton) were studied under penetration test based on the electrical conductivity. These properties were measured at three levels of 1, 3 and 5 days after harvesting. The evaluated mechanical properties of both cultivars were decreased by increasing the storage time. Interaction of cultivar and time were significant at the 1 % level, for all mechanical parameters except the deformation failure in both cultivars. The electrical conductivity of both cultivars was decreased by increasing the storage time. Interaction of cultivar and time on the electrical conductivity of both cultivars were significant at the 1 % level. Significant relationships were found at the 1 % level between electrical conductivity and mechanical properties except for deformation of Petoearly CH cultivar. Among the mechanical parameters, rupture forces and rupture works of both cultivars were highly correlated with the electrical conductivity...|$|R
40|$|The Knowledge of the {{physical}} properties of agricultural products has great importance for the construction and operation of equipment for drying and storage, to achieve increased efficiency in <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> The aim was to determine and analyze {{the physical}} properties of crambe fruits during drying at different temperatures. Crambe fruits with an initial moisture content of 0. 36 (decimal d. b.) which was reduced by drying at 37. 0; 58. 8 and 83. 5 &# 186;C and relative humidity of 29. 4; 11. 2 and 3. 2 %, respectively, to 0. 09 ± 1 (decimal d. b.). At different levels of moisture contents (0. 36; 0. 31; 0. 26; 0. 21; 0. 17; 0. 13 and 0. 09 decimal d. b.), was evaluated the intergranular porosity, the bulk density, the true density {{as well as the}} volumetric shrinkage and the fruit mass. The study was installed by the factorial 3 x 7, and three drying temperatures and seven moisture contents in a randomized design. Data were analyzed using regression. The bulk density and the true density decreases along the drying process; the volumetric shrinkage and the mass increased with lower moisture content and the intergranular porosity decreased sharply with the increasing drying temperature...|$|R
40|$|Project TCP/PDY/ 4506 helped {{formulate}} a programme {{for the establishment}} of a Post-Harvest Centre in Aden, able to provide technical advice on post-harvest matters to parastatal and food aid organizations. The project provided the services of a post-harvest consultant in perishable food crops for one month: detailed recommendations were made for the improvement of the handling of bananas and onions, in particular. Six farms were selected for improvement of threshing and grain storage facilities: concrete threshing floors were provided on some farms, and in others, existing facilities were repaired and enlargedThe project contributed to the establishment of the Centre by training its staff, and by organizing training programmes for technical middle management in the parastatal organizations concerned in the fields of the handling and storage of perishable food crops, pest control techniques, and the improvement of farm storesIt was recommended that future post-harvest activities focus, particularly, on bananas and onions, among perishable produce, and on the programme for the improvement of farm stores. The further mechanization of threshing operations was also recommended; project staff should receive advanced training on <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations</b> for cerals. The role of the proposed Technical Coordinating Committee in the establishment of the Post-Harvest Centre, and in its functioning thereafter, was very important. It was recommended that this Committee begin its work immediately, even before the formal ministerial resolution for its creatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{is strong}} {{advocacy}} for agricultural machinery appropriate for smallholder farmers in South Asia. Such ‘scale-appropriate’ machinery can increase returns {{to land and}} labour, although the still substantial capital investment required can preclude smallholder ownership. Increasing machinery demand has resulted in relatively well-developed markets for rental services for tillage, irrigation, and <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> Many smallholders thereby access agricultural machinery that may have otherwise been cost prohibitive to purchase through fee-for-service arrangements, though opportunity for expansion remains. To more effectively facilitate the development and investment in scale-appropriate machinery, {{there is a need}} to better understand the factors associated with agricultural machinery purchases and service provision. This paper first reviews Bangladesh’s historical policy environment that facilitated the development of agricultural machinery markets. It then uses recent Bangladesh census data from 814, 058 farm households to identify variables associated with the adoption of the most common smallholder agricultural machinery – irrigation pumps, threshers, and power tillers (mainly driven by two-wheel tractors). Multinomial probit model results indicate that machinery ownership is positively associated with household assets, credit availability, electrification, and road density. These findings suggest that donors and policy makers should focus not only on short-term projects to boost machinery adoption. Rather, sustained emphasis on improving physical and civil infrastructure and services, as well as assuring credit availability, is also necessary to create an enabling environment in which the adoption of scale-appropriate farm machinery is most likely...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTPhysical {{properties}} of agricultural materials {{are important for}} the design of appropriate equipment and systems for harvesting and <b>post-harvest</b> <b>operations</b> such as cleaning, conveying and storage. The study was conducted to determine the effect of variety and initial moisture content on some physical {{properties of}} improved Nigerian millet grains. Improved varieties of millet obtained were conditioned to different moisture contents (10, 20 and 30 %) and their physical properties were determined. The grain length, width, thickness and effective geometric mean diameter increased with increasing moisture content irrespective of millet varieties, while aspect ratio (which relates kernel width and length and determines whether grains will slide or roll on their flat surfaces during handling and processing) decreased with increase in moisture content. Static coefficient of friction ranged from 0. 44 – 0. 99, 0. 45 – 0. 82, 0. 40 – 0. 70 and 0. 37 – 0. 67 for wood, mild steel, galvanized steel and glass respectively. The static coefficients of friction (an important parameter in predicting the lateral pressure on a retaining wall in storage bins or design of bins and hoppers for gravity flow) were found to increase as the moisture content increased. The study showed that variety and initial moisture content had significant effect (P< 0. 05) on the physical properties determined. Hence, variety and initial moisture content are critical in the design of equipment for processing, handling and storage of millet grains...|$|R
