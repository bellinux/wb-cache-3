25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels represent Jesus as an exorcist and healer who preached in parables {{about the}} coming Kingdom of God. He preached first in Galilee and later in Jerusalem, where he cleansed the temple. He states that he offers no sign as <b>proof</b> (<b>Mark)</b> or only the sign of Jonah (Matthew and Luke). In Mark, apparently written with a Roman audience in mind, Jesus is a heroic man of action, given to powerful emotions, including agony. In Matthew, apparently written for a Jewish audience, Jesus is repeatedly called out as the fulfillment of Hebrew prophecy.|$|E

"Wopper," [...] {{repeated}} the Professor, [...] "the glacier des Bossons, {{like all the}} other glaciers, seems to remain immovable, though in reality it flows-- ever flows--downward; but its motion is so slow, that it is not perceptible to the naked eye. Similarly, the hour-hand of a watch is to appearance motionless. Do you want <b>proof?</b> <b>Mark</b> it just now; look again in quarter of an hour, and you see that it has moved. You are convinced. It is so with the glacier. Mark him to-day, go back to-morrow--the mark has changed. Some glaciers flow at the rate of two and three feet in the twenty-four hours." ...|$|E

50|$|There are {{penalties}} for non-compliance with proof laws; a fine of £5,000 may be levied for selling an unproofed or out-of proof firearm, more if a number of firearms {{are involved in a}} transaction. Tampering with, or forging, a <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> is regarded as even more serious.|$|E

25|$|Dissatisfied with quality, as {{the guns}} were {{larger than the}} {{historical}} pieces upon which they were based and were covered with numerous <b>proof</b> <b>marks</b> that detracted from their appearance, Harvey contacted Uberti and sent specific instructions regarding the forging of revolver frames, metal polishing and case hardening. He followed this up by sending antique firearms from the time periods he wanted, and had Uberti build those firearms to his specifications. Finally he had the <b>proof</b> <b>marks</b> relocated to less conspicuous areas of the firearms in keeping with Italian law and enhancing their appearance.|$|R
50|$|The Gewehr 43 {{stayed in}} service with the Czechoslovak People's Army {{for several years}} after the war. Likewise the East German border troops and police Volkspolizei or VoPo were issued {{reworked}} G43 rifles, which are recognizable by a sunburst <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> near the serial number and the serial number engraved by electropencil on removable components.|$|E
50|$|Voluntarily testing {{beyond the}} current legally {{required}} standard test benchmark is often also possible for consumers who intend the use their firearms under extreme conditions (hot climates, long strings of shots, etc.). In case a firearm passes such a proof-test a pass mark termed superior <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> is stamped in every successfully tested firearm.|$|E
50|$|The foundry at the Allach {{camp was}} run by a school {{professor}} from the nearby town. Two of his students were on hand assisting him with the manufacture of the swords and daggers.

5000|$|After {{the proof}} test and if successful, {{two or three}} <b>proof</b> <b>marks</b> are always applied to the main (highly stressed) parts of the arm, namely the barrel, the chamber (when {{not part of the}} barrel) and the locking mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|All 9mm P99s {{have always}} been {{completely}} German-made. Some P99 [...]40 components are manufactured under license by S&W. The barrel, slide and frame of all 100% German-manufactured P99s bear an [...] "Eagle over N" [...] <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> of the German Proof House at Ulm. The mark further indicates the pistol was test-fired with a Proof Load; the [...] "N" [...] stands for nitrocellulose.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> is a mark {{specific}} to the manufacturer, importer, or testing facility that is performing the test. [...] It generally {{takes the form of}} a stamp that makes an impression in the metal. Since proof marks are unique and nearly universal, they are often used to identify the origins of firearms that lack normal manufacturer's markings, such as military weapons, which are often produced by large numbers of different manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|A second Army {{variation}} of about 5,000 pistols consisted of pistols whose serial numbers ranged, intermittently, from about 712,000 to about 745,000. These have an Eagle/655 WaA (Army acceptance) {{on the left}} rear trigger guard web and the Eagle/N firing proofs on the right rear trigger guard web and on front of right slide, but have no <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> on the left rear grip tang. The finish on these pistols is also of the first quality.|$|E
25|$|The German {{government}} purchased 7,800 commercial M30 pistols in 1940 {{for use by}} the Luftwaffe. They have Wehrmacht <b>proof</b> <b>marks</b> and the Mauser {{serial numbers}} come from the early- to mid-1930s. The weapon had ceased production in 1937 but the order was filled from remaining stocks.|$|R
50|$|The Permanent International Commission, {{confirming}} that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia {{is no longer}} in existence, declared during the XXII Plenary Session that the <b>proof</b> <b>marks</b> of the <b>Proof</b> House at Kragujevac would no longer be recognised by the C.I.P.

By a mistake, however, it went to Browne instead. Chapman is out of town, and such things have gone wrong in consequence.|$|R
50|$|For both {{small arms}} and heavy weapons, {{the gun is}} fired {{remotely}} and then examined; if undamaged, it {{is assumed to be}} safe for normal use and a <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> is added to the barrel. In the case of revolvers or other multi-chamber firearms, each chamber must be proof tested before the firearm may be marked. Examination of the firearm may be as simple as visually inspecting it (defective components may fail in a spectacular manner, resulting in an explosion of the firearm) or may involve more in-depth examination, at the option of the tester.|$|E
50|$|East German {{refurbished}} Karabiner 98ks featured Russian-style thicker blue finish, a 'sunburst' <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> {{and sometimes}} had the factory designation '1001' applied, {{which was the}} factory where the refurbishment was carried out. Numbers were re-stamped to match the receiver and old numbers barred out. Numbers of East German and Czech refurbished Karabiner 98ks were exported to the West in the late 1980s and early 1990s and {{are now in the}} hands of collectors. Russian Capture Karabiner 98ks were exported to the West in large numbers in the early and mid-2000s.|$|E
50|$|The Proof {{process is}} that of testing a firearm for {{integrity}} using a severely overcharged cartridge, or Proof load which is fired through the gun in an armoured testing chamber. This exposes it to pressures far beyond what it would experience in normal service. It is awarded a stamped <b>Proof</b> <b>Mark</b> if it survives without either being destroyed or suffering damage from the proof load. Larger guns were tested at a shooting range in Bordesley along a railway viaduct; however, {{the expansion of the}} city centre resulted in the closure of the shooting range.|$|E
5000|$|The Susse Frères {{firm was}} also {{engaged in the}} foundry {{business}} and owned a large foundry in Paris. The company {{is well known for}} their fine bronze castings with superbly applied patinas. After the death of Pierre-Jules Mène in 1879, the Susse Frères foundry acquired the rights to reproduce his models and produced posthumous <b>proofs</b> <b>marked</b> [...] "Susse foundeur éditeur, Paris".|$|R
5|$|Rodriguez and Tarantino each {{acted as}} cinematographer on their segments. Although Rodriguez had {{previously}} worked as the cinematographer on {{six of his}} own feature films, Death <b>Proof</b> <b>marked</b> Tarantino's first credit as a cinematographer. The director of photography for Rob Zombie's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the SS was Phil Parmet, whom Zombie had first worked with on The Devil's Rejects. The director of photography for Eli Roth's fake trailer Thanksgiving was Milan Chadima, whom Roth had previously worked with on Hostel.|$|R
50|$|Markings on the Berdan rifle usually {{consist of}} the Imperial Russian double-headed eagle cypher {{on the top}} {{receiver}} flat. The manufacturer's name in Cyrillic, date of manufacture, and rifle serial number, are {{on the top of}} the barrel. Some rifles also show a date of manufacture on the receiver. The serial number was also applied to the bolt. Additional <b>proof</b> <b>marks</b> and property markings are found on the receiver and barrel. There is a factory cartouche on the right side of the buttstock.|$|R

5000|$|A firearm's {{chamber and}} barrel become {{pressure}} vessels for brief periods. In firearm terminology, a proof test {{is a test}} wherein a deliberately over-pressured round is fired from a firearm in order to verify that the firearm is not defective and will not explode on firing. The firearm is inspected after the test, {{and if it is}} found to be in sound condition, then it is marked with a [...] "proof mark" [...] to indicate that it has been proofed (not proven). In many jurisdictions a proof test and valid <b>proof</b> <b>mark</b> are required for the sale of firearms.|$|E
5000|$|Six years later, he {{patented}} a lever-action rifle able {{to shoot}} then-modern guncotton military center-fire cartridges with [...]303-caliber spitzer bullets. This [...] "Model 95" [...] was the direct predecessor {{of the model}} 99. Savage invented a novel rotary magazine rifle. A benefit of this magazine was {{that it had a}} cartridge counter {{on the left side of}} the receiver that enabled the shooter to tell how many cartridges remained in the magazine. Lacking sufficient manufacturing capacity the first 9600 ( [...] plus or minus [...] ) Model 1895 rifles were contracted to be built by Marlin Repeating Arms and are so marked with the JM <b>proof</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

50|$|For {{the case}} of older, side-by-side, Spanish guns, the choke is often marked on the tang of the barrels, {{becoming}} exposed when the wooden forearm is removed, after the double barrels are pivoted off of the break-action, such as when performing a field-stripping and cleaning. The manufacturer's mark, along with the <b>proof</b> <b>marks,</b> {{and the weight of}} the barrels in grams, and the proof test pressures are also stamped alongside the choke marking on the tang of the barrels, near where the shells are inserted into the barrels.|$|R
50|$|Like the Heckler & Koch HK41, the HK43 had a NATO black finish, which {{differed}} from the black phosphate or blue-gray finish of the later HK91/93 series, and came with a short slim forearm grip. Moreover, there were no <b>proof</b> <b>marks</b> on the receiver. Only the rifle’s model and serial numbers, as well as date of manufacture were engraved {{on the left side}} of the receiver. The date code indicated the month and year the rifle was produced. The HK43 was also fitted with an all-plastic MP5 style butt stock with the recoil buffer attached to the bolt carrier.|$|R
