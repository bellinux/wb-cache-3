50|$|Many <b>printers</b> {{supported}} ASA <b>carriage</b> control characters {{which provided}} a limited {{degree of control}} over the paper, by specifying how far to advance the paper between printed lines. Various means of providing vertical tabulation were provided, ranging from a paper <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> loop to fully electronic (software-controllable) tab simulation.|$|R
50|$|While {{replaced}} by an electronic version later on, line printers initially used a piece of looped physical paper punch tape to control {{the movement of the}} paper while printing. This tape is called a <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> and was mounted on the printer. The length of the <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> had to be exactly the same at the length of one sheet of paper. The looped <b>carriage</b> <b>tape</b> was moved synchronously with the stream of endless paper.|$|R
50|$|Tabulator {{functions}} {{were implemented}} with both mechanical and electrical components. Control panels simplified {{the changing of}} electrical connections for different applications, but changing most tabulator's use still required mechanical changes. The IBM 407 was the first IBM tabulator that did not require such mechanical changes; all the 407's functions were electrically controlled and were completely specified by the application's control panel and <b>carriage</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a <b>carriage</b> <b>tape.</b> Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|R

An automatic <b>printer</b> <b>carriage</b> overflow feature is enabled on finding the end of a page on an on-line printer. The routine is based on a REREAD routine published in the IBM installation newsletter...|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 421 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a <b>carriage</b> <b>tape.</b> By means of the control panel, any column of the card could be wired to any print column, by means of a wire link (the end terminals of which were inserted into slots in the control panel). When the control panel wiring was complete, the control panel was inserted into the guides in the machine, and a hand-operated lever moved the control panel so that the wire links made contact with corresponding terminals in the machine.|$|R
5000|$|Systems {{based on}} ASCII or a {{compatible}} character set use either [...] (Line feed, , , 10 in decimal) or [...] (Carriage return, , , 13 in decimal, displayed as [...] "^M" [...] in some editors) individually, or [...] followed by [...] (+, , [...] ). These characters {{are based on}} printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer thus instructed the printer to advance the paper one line, and a carriage return indicated that the <b>printer</b> <b>carriage</b> should return {{to the beginning of}} the current line. Some rare systems, such as QNX before version 4, used the ASCII [...] (record separator, , 30 in decimal) character as the newline character.|$|R
50|$|ASA {{carriage}} control characters are still used for printer output from mainframe applications and software today, {{and are not}} limited to seasoned software or applications dating from the days of the line <b>printer.</b> ASA <b>carriage</b> control characters are interpreted by other software before being printed on modern computer printers.|$|R

50|$|A {{typewriter}} or electromechanical printer {{can print}} characters on paper, and execute operations such as move the carriage {{back to the}} left margin of the same line (carriage return), advance to the same column of the next line (line feed), and so on. Commands to control non-printing operations were transmitted {{in exactly the same}} way as printable characters by sending control characters with defined functions (e.g., the line feed character forced the carriage to move to the same position on the next line) to teleprinters. In modern computing and communications a few control characters, such as carriage return and line feed, have retained their original functions (although they are often implemented in software rather than activating electromechanical mechanisms to move a physical <b>printer</b> <b>carriage)</b> but many others are no longer required and are used for other purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The 402 and 403 were {{primarily}} {{controlled by a}} removable control panel. Additional controls included a <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> and mechanical levers called hammersplits and hammerlocks, that controlled some printing functions. Both the [...] and [...] were considered smaller models of the prior model IBM 405.|$|R
50|$|Like most IBM {{printers}} of the era, the 1403 used fan-folded {{paper with}} perforated edges for tractor feeding. A <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> or, later, a buffer, under program control, specified form length and the form line where printing {{was to begin}} so that paper of various sizes could be used.|$|R
50|$|By {{convention}} {{the position}} {{on a sheet of}} paper where the first print line has to be written was associated with Channel 1. For example, if the first line of text had to always be on physical line 3 for a given form, then the channel 1 hole had to be punched in line 3 of the <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{programmed}} primarily {{with a plastic}} tape that moved synchronously with the typewriter <b>carriage.</b> Each <b>tape</b> would typically handle one application. The tape mechanism was mounted behind the carriage in the typewriter unit. Further programming was provided in the card machines program drums. Programs were only executed as the machine typed or spaced over a column - tabbing or carriage returning was not recognised.|$|R
50|$|The digital glass printer is a flatbed {{digital printer}} {{designed}} with print heads to jet ceramic inks {{directly onto the}} glass. The glass remains stationary while only the <b>printer</b> <b>carriage</b> sweeps across the print table. A key feature of the printer is drop fixation in which ink droplets are dried immediately to prevent drop gain. The fixation of the ink enables a single pass of the print carriage even when printing multi layer and multi color files. The drop fixation makes inline double vision printing possible. Double vision is creating a different vision depending on {{which side of the}} glass is being viewed it is achieved by printing different graphics {{one on top of the}} other.An inline dryer was developed for real time drying to occur and to maximize factory space. A smooth color switching system in included so machine operators can easily shift between print jobs and increase throughput. The high resolution print quality - up to 720 dpi - and the precision of the printers allow glass processors to print anything from fine, sharp, small elements to complex full color images on glasses up to 3.3X18 meters in size.|$|R
50|$|The line {{printers}} had 12 {{sensors to}} recognize 12 independent {{positions on the}} <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape.</b> Each position was called a channel, numbered from 1 to 12. If a hole was punched for a channel, then this hole marked a position that the printer could 'jump to' quickly by advancing until the hole was sensed by the corresponding channel sensor. This is called skip to channel number n.|$|R
50|$|Mainframe {{printers}} {{originally had}} a <b>Carriage</b> control <b>tape,</b> with 12 channels (1 through 9 and A through C) {{that can be}} assigned a fixed position on the page by punching a hole, allowing the printer to skip a variable distance down the page to a fixed location. Newer printers such as the IBM 4248 have done away with the physical tape and use a Forms Control Buffer (FCB) containing {{an image of the}} tape data. Normally only channel 1 is preassigned, {{to the top of the}} page.|$|R

40|$|The use of high-precision {{automated}} {{equipment is}} steadily increasing {{due in part}} to the progressively smaller sizes of electronic circuits.

A model of the micro-stage is derived through analysis of the SMA actuator. The model for the actuator is separated into two portions, an electro-thermal model, and a hysteresis model. The hysteresis model is derived using the Preisach model, and the electro-thermal model through MLS identification.

40|$|Fused Filament Fabrication is an {{additive}} manufacturing {{process by which}} a 3 D object is created from plastic filament. The filament is pushed through a hot nozzle where it melts. The nozzle deposits plastic layer after layer to create the final object. This process has been popularized by the RepRap community. Several printers feature multiple extruders, allowing objects to be formed from multiple materials or colors. The extruders are mounted {{side by side on}} the <b>printer</b> <b>carriage.</b> However, the print quality suffers when objects with color patterns are printed – a disappointment for designers interested in 3 D printing their colored digital models. The most severe issue is the oozing of plastic from the idle extruders: Plastics of different colors bleed onto each other giving the surface a smudged aspect, excess strings oozing from the extruder deposit on the surface, and holes appear due to this missing plastic. Fixing this issue is difficult: increasing the printing speed reduces oozing but also degrades surface quality – on large prints the required speed level become impractical. Adding a physical mechanism increases cost and print time as extruders travel to a cleaning station. Instead, we rely on software and exploit degrees of freedom of the printing process. We introduce three techniques that complement each other in improving the print quality significantly. We first reduce the impact of oozing plastic by choosing a better azimuth angle for the printed part. We build a disposable rampart in close proximity of the part, giving the extruders the opportunity to wipe oozing strings and refill with hot plastic. We finally introduce a toolpath planner avoiding and hiding most of the defects due to oozing, and seamlessly integrating the rampart. We demonstrate our technique on several challenging multiple color prints, and show that our tool path planner improves the surface finish of single color prints as well.

50|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} video-display terminals (VDTs) {{in the mid-1970s}} ushered {{in the second phase}} of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a <b>printer</b> head or <b>carriage</b> can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|Many daisy wheel {{machines}} offer a {{bold type}} facility, accomplished by double- or triple-striking the specified character(s); servo-based <b>printers</b> advance the <b>carriage</b> fractionally for a wider (and therefore blacker) character, while cheaper machines perform a carriage return without a line feed {{to return to}} the beginning of the line, space through all non-bold text, and restrike each bolded character. The inherent imprecision in attempting to restrike on exactly the same spot after a carriage return provides the same effect as the more expensive servo-based printers, with the unique side effect that as the printer ages and wears, bold text becomes bolder.|$|R
50|$|In {{its basic}} form, a tabulating machine would read one card at a time, print {{portions}} (fields) {{of the card}} on fan-fold paper, possibly rearranged, and add one or more numbers punched on the card {{to one or more}} counters, called accumulators. On early models, the accumulator register dials would be read manually after a card run to get totals. Later models could print totals directly. Cards with a particular punch could be treated as master cards causing different behavior. For example, customer master cards could be merged with sorted cards recording individual items purchased. When read by the tabulating machine to create invoices, the billing address and customer number would be printed from the master card, and then individual items purchased and their price would be printed. When the next master card was detected, the total price would be printed from the accumulator and the page ejected {{to the top of the}} next page, typically using a <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>carriage</b> control <b>tape</b> was a loop of {{punched tape}} {{that was used}} to {{synchronize}} rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line printers from unit record days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A pin wheel moved the tape accurately using holes {{in the center of the}} tape. A hole punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form feed switch on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer.|$|R
50|$|The Line Casting Control or LCC product {{generated}} paper tapes for Linotype and Intertype automatic typesetters. In {{addition to}} punching a tape containing {{the text to}} be typeset, it turned on a lamp easily seen by the operator {{to show that the}} text on the line being typed could be typeset—it was within justifiable range. The LCC had a four-wheel rotary escapement, and a set of gears between the carriage rack and the escapement, to permit the smallest unit of spacing at the escapement to be quite small at the <b>carriage.</b> The spring-tensioned <b>tape</b> that moved the carriage had far more tension (possibly 20 lbs?) than did a standard Flexowriter.|$|R
50|$|Progressive {{hardware}} {{improvements to}} impact <b>printers</b> boosted the <b>carriage</b> speed, added more (typeface) font options, increased the dot density (from 60 dpi up to 240 dpi), and added color printing. Faster carriage speeds meant faster (and sometimes louder) printing. Additional typefaces allowed {{the user to}} vary the text appearance of printouts. Proportional-spaced fonts allowed the printer to imitate the non-uniform character widths of a typesetter. Increased dot density allowed for more detailed, darker printouts. The impact pins of the printhead were constrained to a minimum size (for structural durability), and dot densities above 100 dpi merely caused adjacent dots to overlap. While the pin diameter placed a lower limit on the smallest reproducible graphic detail, manufacturers {{were able to use}} higher dot density to great effect in improving text quality.|$|R
