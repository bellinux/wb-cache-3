50|$|CD {{moulding}} {{machines are}} specifically designed high temperature polycarbonate injection moulders. They have an average throughput of 550-900 discs per hour, per moulding line. Clear <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>pellets</b> are first dried at around 130 degrees Celsius for three hours (nominal; this depends on which optical grade resin is in use) and are fed via vacuum transport into {{one end of the}} injection moulder's barrel (i.e., the feed throat) and are moved to the injection chamber via a large screw inside the barrel. The barrel, wrapped with heater bands ranging in temperature from ca 210 to 320 degrees Celsius melts the polycarbonate. When the mould is closed the screw moves forward to inject molten plastic into the mould cavity. When the mould is full, cool water running through mould halves, outside the cavity, cools the plastic so it somewhat solidifies. The entire process from the mould closing, injection and opening again takes approximately 3 to 5 seconds.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{for the first}} time, release rates for CNT from {{polycarbonate}} nanocomposites (containing 1 weight % CNT) were quantified by use of 14 C-labeleled CNT material. Composites were produced by dispersing 14 C-CNT in chloroform and adding <b>polycarbonate</b> <b>pellets</b> afterwards {{in order to produce}} CNT holding PC composites. After evaporation of the chloroform and surface improvement by hot pressing, round samples with a diameter of 18 mm were produced. Two different sample types were prepared for release quantification, composite plates previously degraded by artificial sunlight (1000 MJ/m 2) and fresh prepared plates. Both were subjected to different degradation scenarios; i. e. water, heat, frost-thaw, humic acids, acid rain, disposal site effluent and abrasion, in series. The pre-degraded samples exhibited a much higher CNT release compared to the non-degraded ones (1 % of the CNT material released compared to 0. 03 %). Release of the pre-degraded samples amounted to 18 mg per m 2 and year regarding to Florida irradiation mean. Investigations of the pre-degraded surfaces showed an uncovering of CNT material and the formation of a dense CNT network at the surfaces. This surface decelerated the degradation rate of the matrix material beneath. In the second part of this work, CNT were shown to be bioavailable for the unicellular algae Desmodesmus subspicatus. Cells were exposed to 14 C-CNT suspensions (1 mg/L) within their growth media to determine uptake and association, as well as elimination and dissociation in clear media, afterwards. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was used to determine effects on algae biochemical composition. Differences between the spectra of control and CNT-exposed cells were detected. CNT-cell interactions were visualized by electron microscopy and related to alterations in their cell composition. A concentration factor (CF) of 5000 L/kg dry weight was calculated. However, most of the material agglomerated around the cells, but single tubes were detected in the cytoplasm as well. Computational analyses, i. e. principal component analysis (PCA) and subsequent linear discriminant analysis (LDA), of the ATR-FTIR data showed that CNT treated algae differed from the corresponding controls at all sampling times. No growth inhibition was observed, but CNT exposure changed the biochemical composition of cells. In the third research part of the present study, interactions between CNT and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) and resulting alterations on EE 2 bioavailability to zebrafish (Danio rerio) was taken into account. EE 2 is a highly relevant xeno-estrogen, as it is used in livestock farming for contraception usages, in human birth control pills, and for other medical reasons. It has been detected in the ng/L range in surface waters of various streams. Ethinylestradiol has a high effective potency at its environmentally relevant concentration range and therefore poses a risk for aquatic organisms. The reported hazardous impacts to organisms range from direct toxicity to endocrine disruptor impacts on higher organisms, such as fish. Adsorption of the environmental relevant pollutant EE 2 to CNT was observed in the water phase over time. This interaction might have been influenced by CNT reagglomeration and possible surface modifications as detected in TGA measurements, caused by the ultrasound dispersion of our samples. Further tests should be performed, to draw an entire picture of the interactions, as non predictable results were observed for low EE 2 concentrations. Experiments with zebrafish showed the bioaccumulation of EE 2 in males exposed to a 24 h aged mixture of 1 Âµg 14 C- EE 2 and 1 mg CNT per litre for one week. Maximum EE 2 concentration in the fish was reached after 48 h leading to a BCF of 280 L/kg fish wet weight. In a second experiment, with the same amounts, uptake of EE 2 to different compartments of the fish, i. e. bile, gut, gills, skin and liver, was quantified. In this experiment uptake and effects of EE 2 only and of CNT and EE 2 in combination (24 h pre-aged dispersions) were evaluated. However, only slight differences in the uptake and elimination behaviour of fish exposed to EE 2 with and without CNT material in the media could be outlined. Slightly increased uptake of EE 2 was detected in the presence of CNT material after 48 h, but also better elimination within 72 h when fish were transferred to clear media. A last experiment aimed at the vitellogenin (VTG) induction in male zebrafish which is a reliable marker for estrogenic endocrine activity. EE 2 alone induced a high level of VTG production at 6. 6 ng EE 2 /L, but no induction could be observed in the fish-blood after they were exposed to 2. 2 ng EE 2 /L alone. Remarkably, for both EE 2 treatments (2. 2 and 6. 6 ng EE 2 /L, exposed for 14 d), the VTG induction was low and in the same range in presence of CNT material in the media...|$|E
