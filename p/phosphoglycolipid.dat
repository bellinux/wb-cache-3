40|$|Summary: The {{biosynthesis}} of the <b>phosphoglycolipid</b> antibiotic moenomycin A {{attracts the}} attention of researchers hoping to develop new moenomycin-based antibiotics against multidrug resistant Gram-positive infections. There is detailed understanding of most steps of this biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces ghanaensis (ATCC 14672), except for the ultimate stage, where a single pentasaccharide intermediate is converted into a set of unusually modified final products. Here we report that only one gene, moeH 5, encoding a homologue of the glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) enzyme superfamily, {{is responsible for the}} observed diversity of terminally decorated moenomycins. Genetic and biochemical evidence support the idea that MoeH 5 is a novel member of the GAT superfamily, whose homologues are involved in the synthesis of various secondary metabolites as well as K and O antigens of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Our results provide insights into the mechanism of MoeH 5 and its cou nterparts, and give us a new tool for the diversification of <b>phosphoglycolipid</b> antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{structure}} of a previously uncharacterized phospholipid in the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. This phospholipid, designated lipid 4, was shown by chemical analysis, HF hydrolysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be phosphatidylglyceroylalkylamine. Lipid 4 thus contains the unusual lipid constituents glyceric acid and alkylamines, which have previously been identified in two complex <b>phosphoglycolipids</b> from this organism. By [32 P]phosphate pulse-chase labeling techniques, lipid 4 was shown to be the precursor of the complex <b>phosphoglycolipids</b> alpha-galactosyl- and alpha-N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylglyceroylalkylamine. While phosphatidylglyceroylalkylamine is rapidly biosynthesized from Pi, its subsequent glycosylation occurs much more slowly.

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of archaeal ether-type glycolipids {{was investigated}} in vitro using Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus cell-free homogenates. The sole sugar moiety of glycolipids and <b>phosphoglycolipids</b> of the organism is the β-d-glucosyl-(1 → 6) -d-glucosyl (gentiobiosyl) unit. The enzyme activities of archaeol:UDP-glucose β-glucosyltransferase (monoglucosylarchaeol [MGA] synthase) and MGA:UDP-glucose β- 1, 6 -glucosyltransferase (diglucosylarchaeol [DGA] synthase) {{were found in the}} methanoarchaeon. The synthesis of DGA is probably a two-step glucosylation: (i) archaeol + UDP-glucose → MGA + UDP, and (ii) MGA + UDP-glucose → DGA + UDP. Both enzymes required the addition of K+ ions and archaetidylinositol for their activities. DGA synthase was stimulated by 10 mM MgCl 2, in contrast to MGA synthase, which did not require Mg 2 +. It was likely that the activities of MGA synthesis and DGA synthesis were carried out by different proteins because of the Mg 2 + requirement and their cellular localization. MGA synthase and DGA synthase can be distinguished in cell extracts greatly enriched for each activity by demonstrating the differing Mg 2 + requirements of each enzyme. MGA synthase preferred a lipid substrate with the sn- 2, 3 stereostructure of the glycerol backbone on which two saturated isoprenoid chains are bound at the sn- 2 and sn- 3 positions. A lipid substrate with unsaturated isoprenoid chains or sn- 1, 2 -dialkylglycerol configuration exhibited low activity. Tetraether-type caldarchaetidylinositol was also actively glucosylated by the homogenates to form monoglucosyl caldarchaetidylinositol and a small amount of diglucosyl caldarchaetidylinositol.

40|$|Bacterial {{pathogens}} like Salmonella and Legionella establish intracellular niches in host cells {{known as}} bacteria-containing vacuoles. In these vacuoles, bacteria can survive and replicate. Ubiquitin-dependent selective autophagy is a host defense mechanism to counteract infection by invading pathogens. The Legionella effector protein RavZ interferes with autophagy by irreversibly deconjugating LC 3, an autophagy-related ubiquitin-like protein, from a <b>phosphoglycolipid</b> phosphatidylethanolamine. Using a co-infection system with Salmonella, we show here that Legionella RavZ interferes with ubiquitin recruitment to the Salmonella-containing vacuoles.

In semi-permeabilized cells infected with Salmonella, external addition of purified RavZ protein, but not of its catalytic mutant, induced removal of ubiquitin associated with Salmonella-containing vacuoles.

40|$|International audienceTwo gamma-and UV-radiation-tolerant, Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterial strains, VCD 115 T and VCD 117, {{were isolated}} from {{a mixture of}} sand samples collected in the Sahara Desert in Morocco and Tunisia, after exposure of the sand to 15 kGy gamma radiation. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences and DNA–DNA hybridizations showed that VCD 115 T and VCD 117 {{are members of a}} novel species belonging to the genus Deinococcus, with Deinococcus grandis as its closest relative. The DNA G+C contents of VCD 115 T and VCD 117 are 59 ? 8 and 60 ? 6 mol%, respectively. The major fatty acids (straight-chain 15 : 1, 16 : 1, 17 : 1 and 16 : 0), polar lipids (dominated by <b>phosphoglycolipids</b> and glycolipids) and quinone type (MK- 8) support the affiliation to the genus Deinococcus. The strains did not grow on rich medium such as trypticase soy broth (TSB), but did grow as whitish colonies on tenfold-diluted TSB. The genotypic and phenotypic properties allowed differentiation of VCD 115 T and VCD 117 from recognized Deinococcus species. Strains VCD 115 T and VCD 117 are therefore identified as representing a novel species, for which the name Deinococcus deserti sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain VCD 115 T (=DSM 17065 T =LMG 22923 T) ...|$|R
40|$|Deinococcus radiodurans {{contains}} novel phospholipids {{of which}} the structures of three have been previously described. These three lipids contain both fatty acids and alkylamines. Both the fatty acid and alkylamine constituents {{were found to be}} composed of a mixture of species, of which C 15, C 16, and C 17 saturated and monounsaturated alkyl chains predominated. Alkylamines contained a relatively higher proportion of saturated species. Progression of bacterial growth through the mid-log to stationary phases was accompanied by an increase in the proportions of C 15 and C 17 alkyl chains in both fatty acid and alkylamine constituents. Radiolabeled palmitic acid was found to be rapidly incorporated into both fatty acid and alkylamine components of phosphatidylglyceroylalkylamine, which is the precursor of the more-complex <b>phosphoglycolipids</b> found in major amounts in D. radiodurans. After culturing D. radiodurans {{in the presence of a}} mixture of palmitic acids labeled with 14 C and 3 H in the 1 and 9, 10 positions, respectively, the same 14 C/ 3 H ratio was recovered in both fatty acid and alkylamine constituents, strongly suggesting that alkylamines are derived from intact fatty acids rather than by a de novo pathway. The results identify a novel product of fatty acid metabolism which has not to date been observed in any other organism...|$|R
40|$|MVL 2 {{virus was}} {{purified}} from culture supernatants of infected Acholeplasma laidlawii cells by differential centrifugation, followed by velocity centrifugation in sucrose gradients. The purified virus contained 0. 08 to 0. 1 mumol of lipid phosphorous per ml of viral protein. Thin-layer chromatography of viral lipids revealed {{the presence of}} phospho-, glyco-, and <b>phosphoglycolipids</b> identical with {{those found in the}} host cell membrane, but the relative amount of phosphatidylglycerol was much lower than that in the virus. The fatty acid composition of lipids incorporated into the virus included lipids synthesized before and after infection. The freedom of motion of spin-labeled fatty acids in MVL 2 depended markedly on temperature and on the position of the nitroxide group on the hydrocarbon chain of the probe, suggesting that the local environment of the probe has the properties of a lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, the lipid hydrocarbon chains in MVL 2 appear to be less mobile than those in membranes of the host cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified MVL 2 revealed four major and about five minor polypeptide bands. None of the polypeptide bands gave a positive periodic acid-Schiff reaction. Lactoperoxidase-mediated iodination, followed by proteolytic digestion of intact MVL 2 particles, revealed that at least two major polypeptides are localized on the external surface of the viral envelope...|$|R

Chemotaxonomic and morphological properties of the strain were consistent with its classification in the genus Paenibacillus. Cells were Gram-variable, aerobic, sporulating, motile rods. 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that this novel isolate was unique, showing 94. 6 % sequence similarity to Paenibacillus chitinolyticus NBRC 15660 (T) {{and lower levels of}} similarity to Paenibacillus gansuensis KCTC 3950 (T) (93. 8 %) and Paenibacillus terrigena A 35 (T) (93. 8 %). The novel isolate could be distinguished from the type strains of all of these species based on a range of phenotypic data. The major cellular phospholipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and one unknown <b>phosphoglycolipid.</b> The predominant isoprenologue was an unsaturated menaquinone with seven isoprene units (MK- 7). The major fatty acids of strain CKOBP- 6 (T) were C(16 : 0) (112. 0 %), anteiso-C(15 : 0) (52. 0 %) and iso-C(16 : 0) (116. 4 %). The G + C content of the genomic DNA was 51. 2 mol%.

40|$|Objectives: A {{preliminary}} open label {{study was}} initiated {{to determine if a}} combination oral supplement containing a mixture of <b>phosphoglycolipids,</b> coenzyme Q 10 and microencapsulated NADH could affect fatigue levels in long-term patients with intractable fatigue. Fatigue was determined by the validated Piper Fatigue Scale before, during and after the trial. Participants included 58 patients (30 females and 28 males) with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic Lyme disease or other fatiguing illnesses, such as fibromyalgia syndrome or Gulf War illness. These patients had been symptomatic for an average of 17. 1 ± 0. 6 years, had been seen by many physicians (15. 2 ± 0. 7) and had used many other supplements and drugs (35. 4 ± 2. 7) without apparent reductions in their fatigue. Results: Participants in the study responded to the combination test supplement, showing a 30. 7 % reduction in overall fatigue within 60 days (P 2 = 0. 960). The data also suggested that further reductions were likely if the participants had continued the supplement beyond the 8 -week trial. Males responded slightly better to the combination supplement than females, and the patients with the most severe forms of fatigue responded slightly better than those with milder fatigue, independent of their diagnosis. Conclusions: The combination supplement was a safe and effective method to significantly reduce fatigue in long-term patients with intractable chronic fatigue...|$|R

Strain SEBR 4223 T grew {{on a range of}} carbohydrates, optimally at 37 [*]°C and pH 7, in a medium containing 40 [*]g[*]l− 1 NaCl. Predominant fatty acids were C 14  :  0, C 14  :  0 DMA, C 16  :  0 and C 16  :  1 ω 7 c and the major polar lipids were <b>phosphoglycolipids,</b> phospholipids, glycolipids and diphosphatidylglycerol.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{apparatus and}} a procedure are described {{by which the}} migration of sample components in column chromatography is accelerated by centrifugal force, thereby {{making it possible to}} use beds of densely packed gel prepared with ultrafine silica. This technique was used to resolve components of certain lipid mixtures where other methods have failed, and it has been found generally useful as an adjunct to other methods for the fractionation of lipids. Biologically active <b>phosphoglycolipids</b> from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance from Mycoplasma pneumoniae which formed single spots on thin-layer chromatographic plates were each found to contain a major and several minor components by centrifugal chromatography. The method enabled us to isolate individual components of Wax D from M. tuberculosis rather than a spectrum of components. Minor components were resolved which, although present in insufficient quantity to influence results of chemical analyses, may be responsible for biological activity. The apparatus provides an essentially closed system which reduces highly volatile solvents to minimal evaporation during the chromatographic process. Samples are applied in solution and are not allowed to dry on the columns until after separation has been achieved. Consequently, polar, labile microbial lipids can be resolved without the use of harsh reagents which destroy some of their properties. Single components may be harvested by cutting and removing appropriate segments of the larger chromatograms or by eluting them from the columns...|$|R
