50|$|When {{the racing}} got under way, Carlos Pace led from pole in a Brabham 1-2 but was soon passed by Jody Scheckter and Carlos Reutemann after {{experiencing}} braking problems, and Patrick Depailler soon climbed to third. James Hunt retired {{with a broken}} throttle linkage, Vittorio Brambilla with oil cooler problems and Ian Scheckter crashed. Emerson Fittipaldi was challenging Depailler for 4th place when he suffered a cracked <b>plug</b> <b>lead.</b> Jody Scheckter held on from Reutemann for his only home win.|$|E
5000|$|After Hunt spun {{later on}} the opening lap, Reutemann moved into second, with Fittipaldi, Hailwood, Ickx and Hulme {{completing}} the top six. By lap three, Reutemann took the lead, while Fittipladi visited the pits to have a <b>plug</b> <b>lead</b> reattached. This promoted Hailwood to third. By this stage, Ickx had dropped behind Hulme, but soon both were past the Yardley McLaren. Peterson began to fade due to brake trouble and was overtaken by Hulme and Ickx. By now Ickx was beginning to come {{under pressure from the}} Ferrari of Niki Lauda.|$|E
50|$|De Cesaris {{started from}} an {{unguarded}} pit lane {{ahead of the}} field and led the race briefly, although official lap scoring started his race when he started his second lap. 1984 Australian Drivers' Championship winner and front row qualifier, John Bowe, led the race until lap 9 when overtaken by Moreno after a loose spark <b>plug</b> <b>lead</b> caused his 1.6 litre Ford engine to misfire, with Bowe continuing until pitting for a replacement <b>plug</b> <b>lead.</b> Poor starts by Moreno's team mate for the race Niki Lauda, Rosberg and de Cesaris were overcome as the race progressed. Keen aviators Lauda and Rosberg had actually spent most of practice and qualifying attending an air show at the nearby Essendon Airport, with newly crowned World Champion Lauda stating that he was in Australia mostly for a holiday and just to get away from Europe. Hesnault, running as a team mate to Bowe, retired after a clash with Bruce Connolly. Lauda and Rosberg diced briefly for third before Rosberg and Terry Ryan clashed when Ryan was being lapped with the closely following Lauda also colliding with Ryan, the result being Rosberg and Ryan were able to continue while Lauda was out. Bowe dropped down the field with electrical problems. First Rosberg, then de Cesaris caught and overtook the Tiga FA81/83 of Alfredo Costanzo to fill the podium positions. Bowe finished sixth behind David McMillan.|$|E

50|$|Bowe {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for the 1984 Australian Grand Prix at Calder Park in Melbourne and led {{the race for the}} first 18 laps before a loose spark <b>plug</b> <b>lead</b> caused the 4 cyl Ford engine to misfire and he was passed by defending race winner Roberto Moreno of Brazil who {{went on to win the}} race. Bowe finally stopped on lap 33 and rejoined in 13th place. He would fight his way back to 6th place by the end of the race (2 laps down), setting the 3rd fastest race lap behind Moreno's Ralt and the similar car of Formula One driver Andrea de Cesaris.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} all motorcycles {{must have}} a safety cut out device fitted, this {{is defined as a}} switch that [...] "must cut off the circuit of the electrical supply by the simple action of pulling a lanyard or a non-elastic string (with a maximum length of 30 cm) attached to the rider's right wrist." [...] The high compression ratio of the engine can also assist in slowing down a machine; if the throttle is closed the engine may stop. Riders can stop the bike by deliberately laying down the bike on the track and this technique is used to avoid riders who fall in front of a pursuing colleague. Before cut outs were fitted an engine was stopped in an emergency situation by removing the <b>plug</b> <b>lead</b> from the spark plug or shutting off the fuel supply.|$|E

50|$|Following Peterson's departure, Nilsson {{was thrown}} {{in at the}} deep end - racing the Lotus-Cosworth 77 in the South African Grand Prix. His debut was not an auspicious one; he {{qualified}} last of 25 drivers, in what was attributed to a bad car, which had caught fire during practice. The next was the non-championship, Race of Champions at Brands Hatch. This was more promising: he started from the second row of the grid and stormed into an immediate lead. However, his race only lasted to lap six, when the Cosworth DFV shed a <b>plug</b> <b>lead.</b> Before the other English non-championship race, the BRDC International Trophy, there was the small matter of the US GP West, around the street of Long Beach, California. He had survived a huge first turn accident, only for his rear suspension to break half a lap later, pitching him into the wall at 160 mph.|$|E
50|$|The 16 Valve engine {{features}} individual 'coil over plug' ignition where {{the timing of}} the ignition is controlled directly by the Bosch engine management system, with each coil firing two spark plugs simultaneously. On the earlier CF1 and CF2 16 valve engines each coil fired the plug below it and (via a short <b>plug</b> <b>lead)</b> a plug in the other cylinder that was 360° crankshaft rotation out of phase (i.e. one coil would fire a spark plug in the cylinder nearing the top of the compression stroke, and also the a spark plug in the cylinder nearing the top of the exhaust stroke (in a 4-cylinder 4-stroke engine with a 180° crank pistons 1 & 4 and pistons 2 & 3 rise and fall as pairs). So in this configuration each coil services two spark plugs and each cylinder is serviced by two coils. In case of a coil failure one of two plugs would still work.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the digital circuit for counting {{the number of}} ignitions by which each groupe of the transient current waves can be taken the form of a rectangular pulse. Being impressed on the circuits connected in series with an amplifier, a frequency selecter and a clipper, a groupe of transient waves can be reformed to a rectangular pulse, as shown in the oscillograms. But, as these pulses are tendency to be deformed or distorted corresponding to the changes of R. P. M. of the engine, there is the possibility of causing errors in counting such pulses on the decatron. Therefore, in order to get rid of these errors, the output pulsss at the clipper are sent to differential circuit and next to the multivibrator. The output pulses at the multivibrator are exactly kept rectangular in their form and constant in their pulse-width, so the counter digitally indicates the number of ignitions. The virtues of this arrangement are as follows: (1) It has no mechanical movable. parts. (2) The input impedance of this circuit is extremiy high, so the output power of the engine does not fluctuate when this arrangement is applied to it. (3) The necessary input current to be supplied to the counting circuit is simply induced from the <b>plug</b> <b>lead</b> wire coming out of the engine body. Furthermore, it may be expected that the rectangular pulses gained in the multivibrator can be fed back and put to use for controlling to drive the engine...|$|E

50|$|Initial {{problems}} with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the locking lug.

50|$|Trevithick's {{response}} was to incorporate two safety valves into future designs, only one {{of which could be}} adjusted by the operator. The adjustable valve comprised a disc covering a small hole {{at the top of the}} boiler above the water level in the steam chest. The force exerted by the steam pressure was equalised by an opposite force created by a weight attached to a pivoted lever. The position of the weight on the lever was adjustable thus allowing the operator to set the maximum steam pressure. Trevithick also added a fusible <b>plug</b> of <b>lead,</b> positioned in the boiler just below the minimum safe water level. Under normal operation the water temperature could not exceed that of boiling water and kept the lead below its melting point. If the water ran low, it exposed the <b>lead</b> <b>plug,</b> and the cooling effect of the water was lost. The temperature would then rise sufficiently to melt the lead, releasing steam into the fire, reducing the boiler pressure and providing an audible alarm in sufficient time for the operator to damp the fire, and let the boiler cool before damage could occur. He also introduced the hydraulic testing of boilers, and the use of a mercury manometer to indicate the pressure.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In {{order to}} obtain {{accurate}} EEG inverse solutions in patients subjected to surgery, we have studied the feasibility and influence of incorporating brain and skull defects in realistic head models. Methods: We first measured the conductivity of the methacrylate used for cranioplasty. Then, we designed realistic boundary element method head models with a skull burr hole, a methacrylate plug or a temporal-lobe resection. We simulated the potentials that would be produced at 71 electrode locations (10 / 10 system) by dipoles located near the defects. Then, we fitted dipoles on these potentials using a defect-free head model. We also ran simulations in a noisy situation and with higher skull and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) conductivity. Results: The largest errors were found for burr holes, with a localization error {{up to 20 mm}} for a radial dipole located 30 mm below the hole and an amplification factor of 8. Methacrylate <b>plugs</b> <b>lead</b> to errors up to 5 mm and 0. 5; the resection only lead to errors of 2 mm and 1. 3. Results obtained with noise were consistent with those obtained without noise. Doubling the skull conductivity led to errors that were reduced by 10 – 20 %, while doubling CSF conductivity increased the errors by up to 31 %. Conclusions: We have shown {{that it is important to}} incorporate skull defects in realistic head models when sources are located near the defects and precision is sought.

40|$|Lead-rubber {{hysteretic}} bearings provide in {{a single}} unit the combined features of vertical load support, horizontal flexibility and energy absorbing capacity required for the base isolation of structures from earthquake attack. The lead-rubber hysteretic bearing is a laminated elastomeric bearing of the type used in bridge structures, with a <b>lead</b> <b>plug</b> down its centre. Since {{the invention of the}} lead-rubber bearing, a total of eleven bearings up to a diameter of 650 mm, with <b>lead</b> <b>plugs</b> ranging from 50 to 170 mm in diameter, have been tested under various conditions, including vertical loads to 3. 15 MN, strokes to llOmm, rates from 1 mm/h to 100 mm/s, and temperatures of- 35 °C to + 45 "C. In all of these tests, the lead-rubber bearings behaved satisfactorily and the hysteresis loops could be described reasonably well by assuming that the lead behaved as an elastic-plastic solid with a yield stress in shear of 10. 5 MPa. The bearings showed little rate dependence at- 100 mm/s, though at creep rates of- 1 mm/h the force due to the lead dropped to 30 per cent of that a t typical earthquake frequencies. The effect of many small displacements has been tested with 11 OOO cycles at 3 mm. A total of 92 lead-rubber bearings have been used in New Zealand to base isolate one building and three bridges.
