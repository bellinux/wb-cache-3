25|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1960-1961 {{in the wake}} of the Great Smog of 1952 compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. All subjects were male <b>postal</b> <b>truck</b> drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function (FEV1 and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59. The study controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences.|$|E

50|$|The shootings {{ended with}} the death of USPS postal worker Joseph Santos Ileto (born March 19, 1960) in Chatsworth, a few miles away from the center. Ileto had just {{delivered}} mail to a home and was returning to his <b>postal</b> <b>truck</b> when Furrow asked Ileto to mail a letter for him. As Ileto agreed, Furrow pulled out a Glock 9mm handgun and shot Ileto nine times. Later, Furrow would confess that he murdered Ileto because he thought Ileto was Latino or Asian (Ileto was Filipino American), and because Ileto was a federal employee.|$|E

5000|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{interpretation}} in Kosak v. United States, , {{a case involving}} a claim against the United States Customs Service. The Court in Kosak discussed the postal exception to the FTCA to contrast it from the more general Customs Service exception, noting {{that one of the}} principal purposes behind the FTCA was to waive the government's immunity from liability for car accidents caused by postal employees. The postal service exception was therefore drafted narrowly, such that it did not cover all negligence in the course of mail delivery, because <b>postal</b> <b>trucks</b> could be delivering (and therefore [...] "transmitting") mail when they collide with other vehicles. The Court could find no basis in the text of the statute for distinguishing injuries such as Dolan's that were [...] "caused by the mail itself" [...] from those caused by the negligent driving of postal vehicles. [...] "In both cases the postal employee acts negligently while transmitting mail." ...|$|R

Ernest confused {{the headlights}} of the <b>postal</b> <b>truck</b> {{with those of the}} Blue Custom. The excessive speed of the car bandits causes an accident with the taxi that plunged it into a pond. Ernest then tries to find relief, Mortimer falls in the water and narrowly escapes drowning. Having reached the mainland, hitchhiking allows him to reach his destination. There, after reports of his adventures to his friend, he gives his hypothesis about the causes of climate events: having noticed that only Western Europe is affected by these disasters, he deduces that it is the work of enemies of the West and not from nature.|$|E

5000|$|Starlite befriended future Francis and the Lights {{collaborator}} Jake Rabinbach while {{a student}} at Wesleyan. Starlite attended Wesleyan from 1999 before ultimately dropping out in 2002. While at Wesleyan, they were schoolmates of MGMT's members Andrew VanWyngarden and Benjamin Goldwasser, who they have since toured with. Starlite began traveling across the United States by train {{in an effort to}} find where {{he was going to take}} his life. While on a train traveling from Elkhart, Indiana to New Orleans, Starlite came to the decision that he was going to pursue his passion of music as a career path. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2010, Starlite said, [...] "I had played music and loved it my entire life, but hadn’t fully committed to it. And there was a moment when I wrote down the different things I could do. And then I wrote down, [...] "I think I’ll give the band a go." [...] Shortly afterwards, Starlite returned to his birthplace Oakland, California, where he lived and worked in a rehearsal space at Soundwave Studios and wrote songs for close to a year. Starlite subsequently drove across the U.S. in a decommissioned <b>postal</b> <b>truck</b> to New York City, where he then formed Francis and the Lights. The band rehearsed for an entire year before starting to perform through a series of invitation-only shows at a white fabric draped warehouse space.|$|E

They then meet the Swedish neighbor Labrousse, Monsieur Henri, very embarrassed when he learns that Labrousse {{thought he saw}} his Custom near Geneste pond. Then Blake and Labrousse arrive at Jouy-en-Josas where Blake, discovering that the phone and the car were sabotaged, seeing a blue Custom is parked outside the house and learning that Mr. Henri's real name is Per Enrik Quarnstron, concluded that Mr. HenrI {{is head of the}} network of spies and that the occupants of the Custom will do everything to prevent them from contacting Paris. Blake initially tries to join the station Jouy but having been spotted by Sharkey and Freddy, the occupants of the Custom, he steals the <b>postal</b> <b>truck</b> of Louis and a great pursuit between Peugeot and American car in which the Police will also participate then begins. Finally, Blake takes the train to Massy Palaiseau and it's on the train and then the subway that the pursuit continues. Blake manages to elude his pursuers and returned in Mr. Henry's apartment, who is none other than Olrik. But Sharkey and Freddy are there and Blake leaves. Then it was the turn of Olrik, Sharkey and Freddy being sued because Pradier and his men arrive at Rue Vaugirard. But the three robbers manage to escape through the roof thanks to significant disturbances predicted by the code.|$|E
50|$|While eSolutions {{focused on}} a broad {{spectrum}} of electric car services, one of its main focuses was plug-in technology retrofitting. This involves taking a currently combustion engine powered car and turning it either into a hybrid or a fully electric car. Bright advertised the service specifically for the VW Routan, VW Transporter, and the Dodge Grand Caravan; however, they were able to retrofit essentially any vehicle. In 2010 Bright eSolutions won a contract with the US Postal Service to deliver an all-electric conversion vehicle of a US <b>Postal</b> delivery <b>truck.</b> Bright eSolutions successfully delivered the US Postal Service EV and it has been in operation in Washington DC since 2010.|$|R

40|$|This exegesis {{examines}} the practice-based interrelation between the technical rigging {{aspects of a}} CG character {{and the manner in}} which they affect the animator’s techniques and workflow. It discusses the construction and layering of essential artifacts a rig requires in order to meet the animator’s needs and inhibits the relationships between the two stages of the pipeline to exemplify its findings within a short film entitled Sam. This short comedy demonstrates various emotional stages throughout the frustration and stress overcoming a postman who’s <b>postal</b> <b>truck</b> gets stuck on some train tracks with a steam engine heading his way. Through methodological, theoretical and technical discussion, this project aims to deliver a clear understanding of the complex procedural tasks involved in creating an advanced character rig and how its flexibility, consistency and user-friendliness aids the workflow of an animator. Jason Osipa’s rigging methods are examined and applied to the pipeline to further develop the performance of the character. The project studies several approaches to animating actions based on the work habits of professional animator Jason Schleifer from DreamWorks Animation Studios, and studies how the animator’s workflow varies from shot to shot. It covers the progression of the critical planning, research and development of a character rig and the techniques used to produce convincing animation...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: 2 ̆ 2 [Y]ou are a disgusting {{piece of}} dirt. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Judge Steven Shutter, a county judge in South Florida, used these words to {{describe}} a twenty- four-year-old woman whom he labeled a terrorist 2 and who was condemned by the media. 3 Aside from name-calling, Judge Shutter raised the woman 2 ̆ 7 s bail from 3, 500 to 25, 000 when he learned {{the nature of the}} offense, 2 ̆ 7 just in case 2 ̆ 2 the woman might be able to afford the lower bond. 4 Given the strength of Judge Shutter 2 ̆ 7 s animosity toward her, one might assume that Yasmin Kassima Sealey- Doe had provided assistance to the terrorists who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.

In fact, Sealey-Doe did not participate in, assist, or abet any terrorist activity. 5 This young purported 2 ̆ 2 terrorist 2 ̆ 2 mailed flour and sugar to her ex-boyfriend because she was angry about their breakup. 6 The flour-sugar combination leaked out of the envelope into a <b>postal</b> <b>truck</b> and a hamper in the annex of her building, 7 leading to a day- long decontamination effort. 8 Sealey-Doe immediately confessed. 9 She faced a maximum sentence of fifteen years in prison for her ill- considered prank. 2 ̆ 7...|$|E
5000|$|The company traces its {{evolution}} to the 1920s, when it manufactured {{and sold}} temperature controls for coal-burning furnaces as the Pioneer Heat Regulator Company. That market disappeared {{as the nation}} turned to gas heat. In 1945, the company was changing focus and became Crown Controls Corp. In 1949, as a market for television emerged, Crown began producing television antenna rotators. For two decades, starting in the late 1950s, Crown’s survival and growth were supported by subcontract work, manufacturing mechanical and electrical components for private industry (e.g., Baldwin Pianos and IBM) and the U.S. government, especially the military. [...] Crown entered the material handling industry with niche products in which the major players had no interest. After shipping its first model in 1956, Crown developed several specialty lift trucks, including stockpickers and order pickers for the U.S. government, a hamper-dumper truck for the U.S. <b>Postal</b> Service, and <b>trucks</b> for carrying caskets for funeral parlors. Crown later decided to stop making so many one-of-a-kind trucks and developed two lines of E-Z Lift Trucks: an H series (hand-operated) and a B series (battery-operated). In 1959, when its lift trucks had annual sales of about $50,000, antenna rotators had annual sales of $700,000, but {{the transition to the}} lift truck business was under way. Crown stopped manufacturing the rotators in late 2000.|$|R
