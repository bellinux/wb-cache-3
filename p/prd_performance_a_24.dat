40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} anthropometric and training parameters on race performance in ultra-endurance runners in <b>a</b> <b>24</b> -hour-run. DESIGN: Descriptive field study. SETTING: The 24 -hour-run in Basel 2007. SUBJECTS: Fifteen male Caucasian ultra runners (mean +/- SD; 46. 7 +/- 5. 8 y, 71. 1 +/- 6. 8 kg, 1. 76 +/- 0. 07 m, BMI 23. 1 +/- 1. 84 kg/m 2). INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:Determination of age, body mass, body height, length of lower limbs, skin-fold thicknesses, circumference of extremities, skeletal muscle mass, BMI and percent body fat as well as training volume in 15 successful finishers in order to correlate anthropometric and training parameters with race performance. RESULTS: No significant association (p> 0. 05) {{was found between the}} reached distance and the anthropometric properties. There was also no significant association of the reached distance with the weekly training hours, running years, the number of finished marathons and the number of finished 24 -hour-runs. The reached distance is significantly (p< 0. 05) positively correlated with the personal best marathon performance (r 2 = 0. 40) and the personal best 24 -hour-run distance (r 2 = 0. 58). Furthermore, the personal best marathon performance is highly significantly and positively correlated (p< 0. 01) with the best personal 24 -hour-run distance (r 2 = 0. 76). CONCLUSIONS: Anthropometry as well as training volume {{does not seem to have}} a major effect on race <b>performance</b> in <b>a</b> <b>24</b> -hour-run.

40|$|Abstract—The {{demand for}} {{real-time}} processing of robust feature detection {{is one of}} the major issues in the computer vision field. In order to comply with the requirements, in this paper a parallelization and optimization method to effectively accelerate SURF is proposed. The proposed parallelization method is developed based on a workload analysis of SURF in terms of various aspects, focusing in particular on the load balancing problem. First, the average parallel workload is divided into identical portions using the vertical partitioning method. Then, the load imbalance problem is further resolved using the dynamic partition balancing method. In addition, an optimization method is proposed together with the parallelization method to find and exclude redundant operations in SURF, thus effectively accelerating the feature detection operation when the proposed parallelization method is applied. The proposed method shows a maximum speedup of 19. 21 compared to the single threaded <b>performance</b> on <b>a</b> <b>24</b> -core system, achieving a maximum of 83. 80 fps in a real-machine experiment, enabling real-time processing.

Through the introduction of synchronization primitives, the parallel API allows parallel traversal of an explicitly ordered scene.

As such, phosphodiesterases inhibitors (PDE-Is), which prevent the breakdown of these cyclic nucleotides, represent a potential treatment strategy in memory decline. Recently it has been demonstrated that cGMP and cAMP signaling act in sequence during memory consolidation, with early cGMP signaling requiring subsequent cAMP signaling. Here, we sought to confirm this relationship, and to evaluate its therapeutic implications. Combining sub-efficacious doses of the cGMP-specific PDE type 5 inhibitor vardenafil (0. 1 mg/kg) and cAMP-specific PDE type 4 inhibitor rolipram (0. 01 mg/kg) during the early and late memory consolidation phase, respectively, led to improved memory <b>performance</b> in <b>a</b> <b>24</b> h interval object recognition task. Similarly, such a sub-efficacious combination treatment enhanced the transition of early-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) to late-phase LTP in hippocampal slices. In addition, both object memory and LTP were improved after administration of two sub-efficacious doses of the dual substrate PDE type 2 inhibitor BAY 60 7550 (0. 3 mg/kg) at the early and late consolidation phase, respectively. Taken together, combinations of sub-efficacious doses of cAMP- and cGMP-specific PDE-Is have an additive effect on long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation and might prove a superior alternative to single PDE-I treatment. status: publishe...|$|R

These modulation formats can achieve substantial gains compared with conventional formats such as dual-polarization quaternary phase-shift keying (DP-QPSK) and 16 -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (DP- 16 QAM). For example, polarization-switched QPSK (PS-QPSK) [4], and set-partitioned 128 -ary QAM (SP- 128 QAM) [5], achieve 1. 76 dB and 2. 43 dB gains in asymptotic power efficiency, respectively. Experimental results have demonstrated gains of up to 1. 5 dB in the forward-error correction (FEC) limit regimes [6, 7].

In our study, ocean-type Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were bred using replicated 3 x 3 factorial mating designs to create 18 families to test whether triploidization resulted in changes in growth and ionoregulation performance in freshwater and seawater. Eggs were pressure shocked after fertilization to create triploid offspring in a subset of each family. In spring, freshwater fish were sampled for size and gill Na+, K+- ATPase activity. Plasma chloride and cortisol were measured following <b>a</b> <b>24</b> -h saltwater challenge. Growth performance was monitored for a further four months following transfer to sea water. We found significant effects of ploidy and sire (paternal effect) on smolt weight, {{as well as on}} gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity, although the latter did not correspond with <b>performance</b> in <b>a</b> <b>24</b> -h saltwater challenge. Following four months of ocean growth, diploid animals were consistently larger, with greater circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor- 1 than triploid sibs, although specific growth rates did not differ. Conversely, gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity at that time was significantly higher in triploid than diploid fish. When the phenotypic variance for the various traits was partitioned, triploids exhibited significantly greater additive genetic variance and maternal effects across all traits relative to diploid fish - indicating that gene dosage effects were primarily additive. The strong family effect indicates that genotype has a substantial role in determining the effects of ploidy manipulation on ionoregulatory and growth performance in Chinook salmon.

Several neurotransmitters and signaling events have been shown to regulate the activity of the M-channel, including Ca 2 + and muscarinic receptor-mediated suppression. We found that a change in the configuration of the KCNQ 2 channel complex triggered by elevated intracellular Ca 2 + lowers channel sensitivity to an essential co-factor, phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate, which shuts down the channel. We also identified that a classical mechanism of M-current regulation mediated by muscarinic receptor activation requires KCNQ 2 phosphorylation by PKC and dissociation of calmodulin, an auxiliary subunit of KCNQ 2 channel complex. Based on these findings, we generated a knock-in mouse line that carries an alanine mutation at the key phosphorylation site of KCNQ 2, KCNQ 2 (S 559 A). These mice show attenuated response to muscarinic-mediated M-current suppression, which enables us to address the role of physiological M-current suppression in vivo.

Our mutant mice also showed deficits in long-term social odor memory, while maintaining normal olfactory responses, further implicating the M-current in memory processes mediated by perirhinal cortex. Finally, our behavioral findings were mirrored by a lower level of neuronal activation in perirhinal cortex of KCNQ 2 (S 559 A) mice compared to the wild-type during memory consolidation, as measured by c-fos expression 2 h after novel object recognition training. Our findings provide evidence for the proposed importance of M-current suppression during memory processing and offer a novel perspective on its role in recognition memory consolidation...|$|R
30|$|We also {{investigated}} {{apart from}} the anthropometric and training variables whether age and previous experience (i.e. number of completed half-marathons and personal best time in half-marathon) bi-variately correlated to race time. For both men and women, age and the personal best time in half-marathon correlated to race time, but not the number of completed half-marathons. Age and personal best time have been shown as important predictor variables in marathoners (March et al. 2011) and ultra-endurance athletes (Knechtle et al. 2010 c 2011 bcd). For ultra-marathoners, age has been shown as an important predictor variable in male 100 -km ultra-marathoners (Knechtle et al. 2010 c) where race time might be predicted using the equation 1085.60 - 36.26 [*]× (training speed, km/h) - 1.43 [*]×[*](training volume, km/week)[*]+[*] 2.50 [*]×[*](age, years). Personal best time in a shorter race (i.e. personal best marathon time) has been reported as important predictor variable in 24 -hour ultra-marathoners where <b>performance</b> in <b>a</b> <b>24</b> -hour ultra-marathon might be predicted using the equation 234.7 [*]+[*] 0.481 (longest training session before the 24 -hour run, km) - 0.594 (personal best marathon time, min) (Knechtle et al. 2011 b). Personal best time of the same race distance has been shown as important predictor variable in Triple Iron ultra-triathletes (Knechtle et al. 2011 c) and ultra-endurance mountain bikers (2011 d). In contrast to personal best half-marathon time, the number of completed half-marathons {{was not related to}} performance in both women and men. Regarding other races, the number of completed races might be predictive in ultra-endurance performance. In ultra-triathlon, the number of completed Triple Iron ultra-triathlons was related to race time in a Deca Iron ultra-triathlon (Herbst et al. 2011). In ultra-cycling, the number of completed mountain bike races such as the ‘Swiss Bike Masters’ was not related to race time (Knechtle et al. 2011 d).|$|R
40|$|Ambient sound can impair verbal {{short-term}} memory performance. This finding {{is relevant to}} the acoustic optimization of open-plan offices. Two algorithmic approaches claim to model the impairment during a given sound condition. One model {{is based on the}} Speech Transmission Index (STI). The other approach relies on the hearing sensation fluctuation strength (F). Within the scope of our consulting activities the approach based on F can hardly be applied and the model based on the STI is often misinterpreted in terms of semanticity. Therefore we put to test the two models and elucidate the relevance of temporal-spectral variability and semanticity of background sound with regard to impairment of <b>performance.</b> <b>A</b> group of <b>24</b> subjects performed <b>a</b> {{short-term memory}} task and rated perceived annoyance during eight different speech and speech-like noise conditions, which varied with regard to STI and F. The empirical data is compared to the model predictions, which only partly cover the experimental results. Speech impairs performance more than all other sound conditions and variable speech-like noise is more impairing than continuous speech-like noise. Sound masking with continuous speech-like noise provides relief from the negative effect of background speech. This positive effect is more pronounced if the signal to noise ratio is - 3 dB(A) or even lower...|$|R

This finding {{raises the question of}} whether similarities exist between male recreational 24 -hour ultramarathoners and male recreational marathoners. Methods: The association between age, anthropometric variables (ie, body mass, body height, body mass index, percent body fat, skeletal muscle mass, limb circumference, and skinfold thickness at the pectoral, mid axillary, triceps, subscapular, abdominal, suprailiac, front thigh, and medial calf sites), previous experience and training characteristics (ie, volume, speed, and personal best time), and race time for 79 male recreational 24 -hour ultramarathoners and 126 male recreational marathoners was investigated using bivariate and multivariate analysis. Results: The 24 -hour ultramarathoners were older (P &lt; 0. 05), had a lower circumference at both the upper arm (P &lt; 0. 05) and thigh (P &lt; 0. 01), and a lower skinfold thickness at the pectoral, axillary, and suprailiac sites (P &lt; 0. 05) compared with the marathoners. During training, the 24 -hour ultramarathoners were running for more hours per week (P &lt; 0. 001) and completed more kilometers (P &lt; 0. 001), but were running slower (P &lt; 0. 01) compared with the marathoners. In the 24 -hour ultramarathoners, neither anthropometric nor training variables were associated with kilometers completed in the race (P &gt; 0. 05). In the marathoners, percent body fat (P &lt; 0. 001) and running speed during training (P&nbsp;&lt; 0. 0001) were related to marathon race times. Conclusion: In summary, differences in anthropometric and training predictor variables do exist between male recreational 24 -hour ultramarathoners and male recreational marathoners for race performance.

This study examined if the BRBV leader proteinase (Lpro) could functionally replace that of FMDV. <b>A</b> mutant <b>A</b> <b>24</b> LBRV 3 DYR FMDV engineered with the BRBV Lpro and an antigenic marker in the 3 D polymerase exhibited growth properties and eIF 4 G cleavage similar to parental <b>A</b> <b>24</b> WT virus.

40|$|Alisma canaliculatum is a herb {{commonly}} used in traditional Korean medicine, and {{has been shown in}} scientific studies to have antitumor, diuretic hepatoprotective, and antibacterial effects. Recently, the anti-osteoclastogenesis of alisol <b>A</b> <b>24</b> -acetate from Alisma canaliculatum was investigated in vitro. However, the influence of alisol <b>A</b> <b>24</b> -acetate on osteoporosis in animals has not been investigated. The present study was undertaken to investigate the anti-osteoporotic effect of alisol <b>A</b> <b>24</b> -acetate on bone mass in ovariectomized (OVX) mice and to identify the mechanism responsible for its effects. OVX mice were treated daily with 0. 5 or 2 μg/g of alisol <b>A</b> <b>24</b> -acetate for <b>a</b> period of six weeks.
