25|$|Masturbation is {{the sexual}} {{stimulation}} of one's own genitals for sexual arousal or other sexual pleasure, usually {{to the point}} of orgasm. The stimulation may involve hands, fingers, everyday objects, sex toys such as vibrators, or combinations of these. Mutual masturbation (mutual manual stimulation of the genitals between partners) can be a substitute for sexual penetration. Studies have found that masturbation is frequent in humans of both sexes and all ages, although there is variation. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship is known between masturbation and any form of mental or <b>physical</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Advocates of {{expanded}} {{mental health}} treatment assert that mental disorders are as disabling as <b>physical</b> <b>disorders,</b> but little evidence supports this assertion. AIMS: To establish the disability and treatment of specific mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> in high-income and low- and middle-income countries. METHOD: Community epidemiological surveys were administered in 15 countries through the World Health Organization World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative. RESULTS: Respondents in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries attributed higher disability to mental disorders than to the commonly occurring <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> included in the surveys. This pattern held for all disorders and also for treated disorders. Disaggregation showed that the higher disability of mental than <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> was limited to disability in social and personal role functioning, whereas disability in productive role functioning was generally comparable for mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Despite often higher disability, mental disorders are under-treated compared with <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> in both high-income and in low- and middle-income countries. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Most {{health and}} work {{productivity}} {{studies have focused}} on individual conditions without considering comorbidity. We illustrate the implication of this neglect by examining the effects of comorbid mental disorders on role impairment (number of sickness absence and work cut-back days in the past month) among people with chronic <b>physical</b> <b>disorders.</b> A nationally representative household survey of 5877 respondents assessed current mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> and role impairments. Four <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> were sufficiently common to be studied: hypertension, arthritis asthma and ulcers. All,, 4 <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> were associated with significant role impairments in bivariate analyses. However, further analysis showed that these impairments were almost entirely confined to cases with comorbid mental disorders. Effectiveness trials in workplace samples are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating comorbid mental disorders among workers with chronic <b>physical</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Associations between {{positive}} and negative affect {{and a range of}} 12 -month <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> were investigated in the Midlife Development in the United States Survey, a nationally representative sample of 3, 032 adults ages 25 – 74. These associations were examined, controlling for relevant sociodemographic and psychiatric covariates. High positive affect was associated with decreased risk of <b>physical</b> <b>disorders,</b> whereas high negative affect was associated with increased risk. However, associations between positive affect and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> were partially attenuated following adjustment for concurrent negative affect. Additionally, high affect balance was associated with decreased risk of <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> before and after adjustments. These findings underscore the relevance of affective disposition in health status, suggesting that both {{positive and}} negative affect may serve as viable health risk parameters...|$|R
500|$|Eddy and 26 {{followers}} {{founded the}} Christian Science church in 1879 in Boston, Massachusetts, following {{the publication of}} Eddy's book Science and Health (1875). In the book Eddy argued that disease is a mental error rather than a <b>physical</b> <b>disorder,</b> and {{that it should be}} treated not by medicine, but by a form of silent prayer that corrects the mistaken beliefs.

500|$|Eddy {{described}} Christian Science as {{a return}} to [...] "primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing." [...] There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of other branches of Christianity. In particular, adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism, believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion. This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than <b>physical</b> <b>disorder,</b> and that the sick should be treated not by medicine, but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.|$|E
500|$|Consequently, it {{is likely}} that Lambert's weight gain was caused not by a <b>physical</b> <b>disorder</b> but by a {{combination}} of overeating and a lack of exercise. Although heavily built in his teens, he began to gain weight only when he took up the relatively sedentary job of prison keeper. A biography of Lambert published during his lifetime recounted that [...] "it was within a year of this appointment that his bulk received the greatest and most rapid encrease". Although he claimed to eat little, and to abstain from alcohol, {{it is likely}} that a man with his lifestyle and position in society would have eaten large amounts of meat, and drunk beer at social events.|$|E
40|$|Background Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the rates of <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> in those with recurrent depression. Aims To examine self-reported <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> in people with recurrent depression compared with a psychiatrically healthy control group. Method As part of a genetic case–control association study, 1546 participants with recurrent depression and 884 controls were interviewed about lifetime ever treatment for 16 different <b>physical</b> health <b>disorders.</b> Results The cases group had a significantly higher frequency of 14 <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> and more obesity than the control group. After controlling for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and multiple testing, those in the cases group had significantly higher rates of gastric ulcer, rhinitis/hay fever, osteoarthritis, thyroid disease, hypertension and asthma. Conclusions People with recurrent depression show high rates of many common <b>physical</b> <b>disorders.</b> Although this can be partly explained by BMI, shared aetiological pathways such as dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis may have a role...|$|R
40|$|Background Mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{associated}} with total disability, but their effects on days with partial disability (i. e. the ability to perform some, but not full-role, functioning in daily life) are not well understood. Aims To estimate individual (i. e. the consequences for an individual with a disorder) and societal effects (i. e. the avoidable partial disability in the society due to disorders) of mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> on days with partial disability around the world. Method Respondents from 26 nationally representative samples (n= 61 259, age 18 +) were interviewed regarding mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders,</b> and day-to-day functioning. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3. 0 (CIDI 3. 0) {{was used to assess}} mental disorders; partial disability (expressed in full day equivalents) was assessed with the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule in the CIDI 3. 0. Results Respondents with disorders reported about 1. 58 additional disability days per month compared with respondents without disorders. At the individual level, mental disorders (especially post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and bipolar disorder) yielded a higher number of days with disability than <b>physical</b> <b>disorders.</b> At the societal level, the population attributable risk proportion due to <b>physical</b> and mental <b>disorders</b> was 49 % and 15 % respectively. Conclusions Mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> have a considerable impact on partial disability, at both the individual and at the societal level. <b>Physical</b> <b>disorders</b> yielded higher effects on partial disability than mental disorders...|$|R

2500|$|Mihai Eminescu died at 4am, on 15 June 1889 at the Caritas Institute, a {{sanatorium}} run by Dr. Suțu {{and located}} on Plantelor Street Sector 2, Bucharest. Eminescu's last wish was {{a glass of}} milk, which the attending doctor slipped through the metallic peephole of the [...] "cell" [...] where he spent the last hours of his life. In response to this favor he {{was said to have}} whispered, [...] "I'm crumbled". The next day, on 16 June 1889 he was officially declared deceased and legal papers to that effect were prepared by doctors Suțu and Petrescu, who submitted the official report. This paperwork is seen as being ambiguous, because the poet's cause of death is not clearly stated and there was no indication of any other underlying condition that may have so suddenly resulted in his death. In fact both the poet's medical file and autopsy report indicate symptoms of a mental and not <b>physical</b> <b>disorder.</b> Moreover, at the autopsy performed by Dr. Tomescu and then by Dr. Marinescu from the laboratory at Babeș-Bolyai University, the brain could not be studied, because a nurse inadvertently forgot it on an open window, where it quickly decomposed.|$|E

Results: All <b>physical</b> <b>disorders,</b> except injury caused by accident, were significantly related to anxiety and mood disorders, but only weakly related to substance use <b>disorders.</b> Both <b>physical</b> and mental <b>disorders</b> were significantly related to work-loss; mental disorders more so than <b>physical</b> <b>disorders.</b> Physical-mental (PM) comorbidity leads to a mainly additive increase in work-loss.

6000|$|It {{follows that}} in order to deal {{intelligently}} with the criminal impulse in our afflicted fellow-citizens we must discover the bacillus of crime. To that end I think that the bodies of hanged assassins and such persons of low degree as have been gathered to their fathers by the cares of public office or consumed by the rust of inactivity in prison should be handed over to the microscopists for examination. The bore, too, offers a fine field for research, and might justly enough be examined alive. Whether there is one general--or as the ancient and honorable orders prefer to say, [...] "grand"--bacillus, producing a general (or grand) criminal impulse covering a multitude of sins, or an infinite number of well defined and several bacilli, each inciting to a particular crime, is a question to the determination of which the most distinguished microscopist might be proud to devote the powers of his eye. If the latter is the case it will somewhat complicate the treatment, for clearly the patient afflicted with chronic robbery will require medicines different from those that might be efficacious in a gentleman suffering from constitutional theft or the desire to represent his District in the Assembly. But it is permitted to us to hope that all crimes, like all arts, are essentially one; that murder, arson and conservatism are but different symptoms of the same <b>physical</b> <b>disorder,</b> back of which is a microbe vincible to a single medicament, albeit the same awaits discovery.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{manuscript}} {{examines the}} impact of mental health state and specific mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> on work role disability {{and quality of life}} in six European countries. METHOD: The ESEMeD study was conducted in: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Individuals aged 18 years and over who were not institutionalized were eligible for an in-home computer-assisted interview. Common mental disorders, work loss days (WLD) in the past month and quality of life (QoL) were assessed, using the WMH- 2000 version of the CIDI, the WHODAS-II, and the mental and physical component scores (MCS, PCS) of the 12 -item short form, respectively. The presence of five chronic physical disorders: arthritis, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes and neurological disease was also assessed. Multivariate regression techniques were used to identify the independent association of mental and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> while controlling for gender, age and country. RESULTS: In each country, WLD and loss of QoL increased with the number of disorders. Most mental disorders had approximately 1. 0 SD-unit lower mean MCS and lost three to four times more work days, compared with people without any 12 -month mental disorder. The 10 disorders with the highest independent impact on WLD were: neurological disease, panic disorder, PTSD, major depressive episode, dysthymia, specific phobia, social phobia, arthritis, agoraphobia and heart disease. The impact of mental vs. <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> on QoL was specific, with mental disorders impacting more on MCS and <b>physical</b> <b>disorders</b> more on PCS. Compared to <b>physical</b> <b>disorders,</b> mental disorders had generally stronger 'cross-domain' effects. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that mental disorders are important determinants of work role disability and quality of life, often outnumbering {{the impact of}} common chronic <b>physical</b> <b>disorders.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
