5000|$|As {{a payment}} card is swiped through a card reading device, {{referred}} to as a point of interaction (POI) device, at the merchant location or point of sale, the device immediately encrypts the card information. A device that is part of a PCI validated P2Pe solution uses an algorithmic calculation to encrypt the confidential payment card data. From the POI, the encrypted, indecipherable codes are sent to the payment gateway or processor for decryption. The keys for encryption and decryption are never available to the merchant, making card data entirely invisible to the retailer. Once the encrypted codes are within the secure data zone of the payment processor, the codes are decrypted to the original card numbers and then passed to the issuing bank for authorization. The bank either approves or rejects the transaction, depending upon the card holder's <b>payment</b> <b>account</b> status. The merchant is then notified if the payment is accepted or rejected to complete the process along with a token that the merchant can store. This token is a unique number reference to the original transaction that the merchant can use should they ever be needed to perform research or refund the customer without ever knowing the customer's card information (tokenization).

However, the average value of consumers’ perceived risk was 5.06, indicating that consumers were still willing to make online payments and try online financial products even if the perceived risk existed. In tandem with the rapid development of online transaction and payment systems and the increased popularity of online payments, our respondents also indicated a higher frequency of use of online payments. In addition, most respondents were young people aged 20 – 30 years who are more prone to be impulsive and willing to try new financial management options of online financial products. Finally, the security risk of online financial products was mainly reflected in <b>payment,</b> <b>account,</b> and privacy security. Perceived risk is less important today for consumers already accustomed to the use of online and mobile payment methods and who have deemed online payments as an essential part of their lives.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC), along with revised 2008 SCPC data. In 2009, the average U. S. consumer held 5. 0 of the nine payment instruments available, including cash, and used 3. 8 of them during a typical month. Between the 2008 and 2009 surveys, a period that includes the trough of the latest recession, consumers significantly increased their use of cash and close substitutes for cash, such as money orders and prepaid cards. At the same time, consumers reduced their use of credit cards and (to a lesser extent) debit cards, as well as payments made using a bank account number. Weaker economic conditions, new government regulations, and bank pricing of payment card services all likely contributed to the shift back toward cash. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine how much each of these factors contributed, and whether the shift is transitory or permanent, without more data and research on consumer payment choice. In 2009, one in three consumers had a prepaid card and nearly as many had a nonbank <b>payment</b> <b>account</b> online, while 3 percent made a mobile payment. By focusing on payments by consumers only, the SCPC complements the recent 2010 Federal Reserve Payment Study, which describes the entire noncash payments economy.
