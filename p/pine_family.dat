25|$|The {{division}} name Pinophyta {{conforms to}} the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), which state (Article 16.1) that the names of higher taxa in plants (above the rank of family) are either formed from the name of an included family (usually the most common and/or representative), in this case Pinaceae (the <b>pine</b> <b>family),</b> or are descriptive. A descriptive name in widespread use for the conifers (at whatever rank is chosen) is Coniferae (Art 16 Ex 2).|$|E
60|$|THE {{appearance}} of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made {{a great deal of}} way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast. Grey-coloured woods covered {{a large part of the}} surface. This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the <b>pine</b> <b>family,</b> out-topping the others--some singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad. The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock. All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in tree growth and branchlet carbon isotope composition (13 C), nitrogen (N) isotope composition (15 N) and nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn) concentration of 11 -year-old hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D. Don) half-sib families were examined at two contrasting sites (31 families with 8 blocks sampled at a wet site and 27 families with 9 blocks at a dry site) in south-east Queensland, Australia. Genetic correlations were determined between the tree growth traits, between the physiological traits, {{and between the}} physiological and growth traits. The potential of using these tree physiological traits was evaluated for assisting in selection of elite hoop <b>pine</b> <b>families</b> with improved water-use efficiency (WUE) as reflected in branchlet 13 C, nutrient (particularly N) -use efficiency (NUE) and tree growth. At the wet site there was significant genetic {{variation in}} tree growth, branchlet 13 C, nutrient concentration and mineral concentration among the 11 -year-old hoop <b>pine</b> <b>families,</b> with heritability estimates ranging from 0. 26 to 0. 72. At the dry site, there was also significant genetic variation {{in some of the}} corresponding variables with heritability estimates ranging from 0. 26 to 0. 54. There seemed to be significant family variation in branchlet 15 N at the dry site (P= 0. 068), with a moderate heritability estimate of 0. 21, but not at the wet site. Some strong genetic correlations were also found between the tree growth traits, between the physiological traits, and between the tree growth and the physiological traits. Tree WUE and branchlet nutrient concentrations were significantly influenced by rainfall and soil fertility. Branchlet 15 N at the wet site was significantly lower than that at the dry site, suggesting that soil microbial–plant interactions might play a role in discriminating soil available 15 N in favor of 14 N for tree uptake (lower 15 N in plant tissues) at the wet site. Branchlet 13 C 15 N and nutrient (particularly N) concentration show promise as physiological and nutritional traits for assisting in the selection of elite hoop <b>pine</b> <b>families</b> with improved tree WUE, NUE and growth for the more water- and nutrient-limited environments in subtropical Australia. ...|$|R
