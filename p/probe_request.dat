40|$|Zone-level {{occupancy}} counting is {{a critical}} technology for smart buildings {{and can be used}} for several applications such as building energy management, surveillance, and public safety. Existing occupancy counting techniques typically require installation of large number of occupancy monitoring sensors inside a building as well as an established network. In this study, in order to achieve occupancy counting, we consider the use of WiFi <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> that are continuously transmitted from WiFi enabled smart devices. To this end, WiFi Pineapple equipment are used for passively capturing ambient <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> from WiFi devices such as smart phones and tablets, where no connectivity to a WiFi network is required. This information is then used to localize users within coarsely defined occupancy zones, and subsequently to obtain occupancy count within each zone at different time scales. An interacting multi-model Kalman filter technique is developed to improve occupancy counting accuracy. Our numerical results using WiFi data collected at a university building show that utilization of WiFi <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> can be considered a viable solution tool for zone-level occupancy counting in smart buildings.

40|$|Whenever our {{smartphones}} {{have their}} WiFi radio interface on, they periodically try {{to connect to}} known wireless APs (networks the user has connected to in the past). This is done through WiFi <b>Probe</b> <b>requests</b> - special wireless frames that contain the MAC address of the sending device and, {{in most of the}} cases, the human-readable name-string (SSID) of the known AP. This semantic information, inherent to the network protocol, is sent in the clear and, if sniffed, can help discover important information and phenomena of people and human nature {{that have nothing to do}} with technology. In this paper we present the idea of exploiting WiFi <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> to de-anonymize the origin of participants in large events. We make use of several, publicly available datasets containing more than 11 M of <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> collected in scenarios that are of citywide, national (two political meetings), and international religion-related relevance. We show how, by exploiting the semantic information brought by the relative WiFi probes, we are able to discover with high accuracy the provenance of the crowds in each event.

Early reservation systems, including both immediate reservation and advance reservation, {{have taken an}} "all-or-nothing" approach in which both QoS and temporal parameters of requests are inflexible. This paper describes a new probe-based adaptive reservation approach using <b>Probing</b> <b>Requests</b> that exploits the potential flexibility in reservation requests to increase resource utilization and reduce rejection rates. Compared to other approaches that support exibility, the probe-based approach is more efficient in finding alternatives, and it causes less signaling overhead and incurs a lower computational load on the often busy resource providers. The <b>Probing</b> <b>Request</b> mechanism has been implemented {{as part of our}} inter-domain bandwidth broker, can also be applied to other resource reservation schemes...|$|R
50|$|Active {{scanning}} is {{done through}} sending multiple <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> and recording the probe responses. The probe response received normally contains BSSID and WLAN SSID.

50|$|Using {{wireless}} access points in SSID-hidden mode (see network cloaking), a mobile wireless device may not only disclose its own MAC address when traveling, {{but even the}} MAC addresses associated to SSIDs the device has already connected to, if they are configured to send these as part of <b>probe</b> <b>request</b> packets. Alternative modes to prevent this include configuring access points to be either in beacon-broadcasting mode, or probe-response with SSID mode. In these modes, probe requests may be unnecessary, or sent in broadcast mode without disclosing the identity of previously-known networks.|$|E

The information captured from the probe requests is used to identify and localize WiFi users with a single UAV, which can be instrumental in search and rescue applications.

40|$|International audienceMAC address {{randomization}} is {{a common}} privacy protection measure deployed in major operating systems today. It is used to prevent user-tracking with <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> that are transmitted during IEEE 802. 11 network scans.

This attack relies on a signature based on inter-frame arrival times of <b>probe</b> <b>requests,</b> {{which is used to}} group together frames coming from the same device although they use distinct MAC addresses. We propose several distance metrics based on timing and use them together with an incremental learning algorithm in order to group frames. We show that these signatures are consistent over time and {{can be used as a}} pseudo-identifier to track devices. Our framework is able to correctly group frames using different MAC addresses but belonging to the same device in up to 75 % of the cases. These results show that the timing of 802. 11 probe frames can be abused to track individual devices and that address randomization alone is not always enough to protect users against tracking...|$|R
30|$|Landmarks can be {{categorized}} depending on {{their participation in the}} verification process. Deployment of location verification may involve two types of landmarks: active and passive.

All approaches analyzed in this paper use active landmarks except the one proposed in [23], which deploys only passive landmarks and measurements are performed by a virtual machine located on CSP.|$|R
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} a new intelligent approach to recognise <b>probe</b> <b>request</b> attacks in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). In WLANs, management frames facilitate wireless stations (STA) {{to establish and}} maintain communications. In infrastructure WLANs, any mobile STA can send a <b>probe</b> <b>request</b> management frame when it needs information from an Access Point CAP). AP replies to any <b>probe</b> <b>request</b> from a STA with a known Medium Access Control (MAC) address, with a probe response management frame with capability information, and supported data rates. The next step is to establish its identity with the AP through authentication messages. Once authentication is completed, STAs can associate (register) with the AP to gain full access to the network. <b>Probe</b> <b>request</b> and response management frames are unprotected, so the information is visible to sniffers. MAC addresses can be easily spoofed to bypass AP access lists. Probe requests can be sent by anyone with a legitimate MAC address, as association to the network is not required at this stage. Attackers take advantage of these vulnerabilities and send a flood of <b>probe</b> <b>request</b> frames that can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) to legitimate STAs. The research investigates and analyses delta-time, sequence number, Signal Strength Indicator (SSI), and frame sub-type of traffic captured on a home WLAN, and uses a feed forward supervised Neural Network (NN) sensor/classifier, with four input neurons, a single hidden layer, and an output neuron, to determine the results. The research also utilises self-consistency test to measure the fitness of the data in the sensor/classifier, and 5 -fold cross-validation method to evaluate the sensor/classifier with unseen data. Five Genetic Algorithms (GA) are utilised to optimise the NN using training, validation, and testing sample percentages and number of neurons of the hidden layer. The most optimised NN classifier, with training, validation and test, and sample sizes 40 %, 59 %, 1 %, and hidden neurons 29, produced 100 % accuracy on a test sample.

40|$|Abstract — Wireless {{network is}} the network which {{is easy to}} deploy and very easy to access that network and that network is user friendly. The main reason behind {{wireless}} lan is gaining popularity because it provide benefits, like easy installation, flexibility, mobility, scalability and reduced cost of ownership. But drawback in these wireless networks is that it doesn't provide security as much as required, due to that user faces attacks of various types which are damageable to user information. Spoofing with falsified IP-MAC pair {{is the first step}} in most LAN based attacks. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is stateless, which is the main cause that makes spoofing possible. Several network level and host level mechanisms have been proposed to detect and mitigate ARP spoofing but each of them has their own drawback. In this proposed work a new technique is developed for detecting identity attacks or spoofed MAC attack exploited in 802. 11 wireless network. Current methods of device identification includes only <b>probe</b> <b>request</b> packets which results in large amount of false positive. In our proposed work the algorithms are developed upon three frames which are required in three section of connectivity phase and that frames are <b>probe</b> <b>request</b> frame, authentication frame and association frame. The proposed scheme is successfully verified under all possible attack scenarios. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed with various attack scenarios and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

But drawback in these wireless networks is that it doesn't provide security as much as required, due to that user faces attacks of various types which are damageable to user information. One of the serious attack is Identity based attacks which steals the identity of some other user in that network and performed some other attack. The available present security tools to detect such these identity(spoofed MAC) based attacks are quite limited.

30|$|At the data-link layer, frame {{error rate}} [13], {{transmission}} rate [16 – 18], and contention level [19] are usually taken as the performance indicators for AP selection. Due to {{the popularity of}} multimedia services, QoS is becoming critical. QoS typically refers to low frame error rate or high transmission rate at the data-link layer. Both of these can be calculated by transmitting frames or by retrieving objects in a related management information base via {{simple network management protocol}} [20]. The disadvantage of this QoS measure is the huge time overhead in data collection. In [19], mean probe delay (MPD) was proposed and used as an indicator of an AP's load. The MN delivers four <b>probe</b> <b>requests</b> in sequence and measures the elapsed time of the respective responses. The AP with the lowest time delay is selected.|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} noticing that without {{guarantees}} that any server replying to <b>probing</b> <b>requests</b> {{is the right}} one, collected RTT measurements are useless to location verification process. As shown in Table  1, only two solutions include Proof of Data Possession protocols. It is surprising that PDP protocols are not prevalent in existing approaches. As already outlined, PDP protocols provide powerful mechanisms to trust collected measurements regarding RTT. One challenge would be an analysis of PDP cost regarding frequency of PDP checks. In particular, adequately increasing frequency of PDP checks makes it economically unprofitable for a malicious CSP to move data between two PDP checks. Indeed, a malicious CSP, which {{is aware of the}} period between two successive PDP checks, when this period is very high—e.g., more than one month—would be tempted to move data to another location between two PDP checks. Doing so, a malicious CSP would bring back data just when a possession proof is to be built and then it relocates data.|$|R
