5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E

40|$|Background: The role of placebos {{is often}} misunderstood, leading both to {{overvaluation}} and to inappropriate disdain. The {{effect of a}} placebo that contains no <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is often confused with the effect of administration by a physician. The aim {{of this article is}} to review the current data on placebos, evaluate these data critically, and provide a well-founded and understandable explanation of the effects that placebos do and do not possess. Methods: Selective literature review. Results: Recent studies employing modern imaging techniques have provided objective correlates of the effect of placebo administration for certain indications. A recent paper even suggested a genetic basis for it. Two main mechanisms underlie the effect of placebo administration: conditioned reflexes, which are subconscious, and the patient's expectations, which are conscious. Further factors include the physician's personality and the setting in which the treatment takes place. Conclusions: The mechanisms of action of placebo administration, with which positive therapeutic effects can be achieved with little effort, should be consciously exploited by physicians when giving their patients <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> medications as well...|$|R

Nicotine, a <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in tobacco, {{has been identified}} as a major risk factor for lung diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects of curcumin on tissue lipid peroxidation and antioxidants in nicotine-treated Wistar rats. Lung toxicity was induced by subcutaneous injection of nicotine at a dose of 2. 5 mg/kg (5 days a week, for 22 weeks). Curcumin (80 mg/kg) was given simultaneously by intragastric intubation for 22 weeks. The enhanced level of tissue lipid peroxides in nicotine-treated rats was accompanied by a significant decrease in the levels of ascorbic acid, vitamin E, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase. Administration of curcumin significantly lowered the level of lipid peroxidation and enhanced the antioxidant status.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{epidemiological}} {{studies suggest that}} coffee drinking {{is associated with a}} slower progression of fibrogenesis in patients with chronic, particularly alcoholic, liver disease. However, a causal, mechanistic explanation was pending. New results indicate that the methylxanthine caffeine, major component of coffee and the most widely consumed <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the world, might be responsible for this phenomenon as it inhibits the synthesis of Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN 2) in liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, primarily by inducing degradation of Smad 2 (and to a much lesser extent Smad 3). In particular paraxanthine has been identified as the most potent inhibitor of CTGF synthesis among the three primary metabolites of caffeine, i. e. paraxanthine, theophylline, and theobromine. CTGF plays {{a crucial role in the}} fibrotic remodeling of various organs which has therefore frequently been proposed as therapeutic target in the management of fibrotic disorders.

40|$|Although the hmmodynamic {{responses}} to cigarette smoking have been extensively studied, considerable controversy still exists {{as to the}} presence or degree of deleterious effects on the circu-latory system (Roth and Shick, 1958). There is, however, general agreement that nicotine is the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in tobacco smoke (Comroe, 1960; Haag, 1940; Roth, 1960). From 1 to 4 mg. of nicotine is absorbed into the blood stream during the smoking of one cigarette when the smoke is inhaled (Pierce, 1941). Excitation of the adrenal medulla and peripheral sym-pathetic ganglia occurs with a resultant tachycardia and a rise of the circulating epinephrine level followed by stimulation of the supra-optic nuclei with the subsequent release of posterior pituitary hormone causing mild pressor effects (Burn, 1960).

For residues of <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> and environmental contaminants such as heavy metals or dioxins, Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) and Maximum Levels are set, which must not be exceeded in food of animal origin. The aim of food control as part of the NRCP and the ICP is, to check that these MRLs and Maxiumum Levels are complied with, to detect non-compliant use of substances (e. g. prohibited or non-allowed <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances)</b> and to investigate the causes of increased levels of residues and contaminants. The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) has presented the findings from the 58998 samples which were monitored by the official control laboratories of the federal states as part of the NRCP 2012 and from the 1338 samples of the ICP in 2012. In 350 findings (0. 59 %) of the NRCP samples, residues and contaminants were noncompliant. The rate is thus lower than the findings of the year 2011 (0, 73 %).

Objective: We examined the associations of maternal caffeine intake, {{on the basis of}} coffee and tea consumption, with fetal growth characteristics measured in each trimester of pregnancy and the risks of adverse birth outcomes. Design: Associations were studied in 7346 pregnant women participating in a population-based prospective cohort study from early pregnancy onward in the Netherlands (2001 - 2005). Caffeine intake in the first, second, and third trimesters was on the basis of coffee and tea consumption and was assessed by questionnaires. Fetal growth characteristics were repeatedly measured by ultrasound. Information about birth outcomes was obtained from hospital records. Results: We observed no consistent associations of caffeine intake with fetal head circumference or estimated fetal weight in any trimester. Higher caffeine intake was associated with smaller first-trimester crown-rump length, second- and third-trimester femur length, and birth length (P for trend < 0. 05). Offspring of mothers who consumed ≥ 6 caffeine units/d tended to have increased risks of small-for-gestational-age infants at birth. Conclusions: Our results suggest that caffeine intake of ≥ 6 units/d during pregnancy is associated with impaired fetal length growth.

40|$|Background: Nicotine {{is a major}} <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in {{cigarette}} smoke. It {{is mainly}} metabolized in liver and causes devastating effects. Crocin is the chemical ingredient primarily responsible for the color of saffron. It has different pharmacological effects such as antioxidant and anticancer. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the protective role of crocin against nicotine on the liver of mice. Methods: Forty-eight mice were equally divided into 8 groups; control (normal saline), nicotine (2. 5 mg/kg), crocin (12. 5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) and crocin plus nicotine treated groups. Saline, crocin, nicotine and crocin/nicotine (once a day) were intraperitoneally injected for 4 weeks. The liver weight and histology, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and serum nitric oxide levels have been studied. Results: The results indicated that nicotine administration significantly decreased liver weight (48. 37 %) and increased the mean diameter of hepatocyte (239 %), central hepatic vein (28. 45 %), liver enzymes level (ALP 29. 43 %, AST 21. 81 %, ALT 21. 55 %), and blood serum nitric oxide level (57. 18 %) compared to saline group (P < 0. 05). However, crocin and crocin plus nicotine administration significantly boosted liver weight (49. 54 %) and decreased the mean diameter of hepatocyte (40. 48 %), central hepatic vein (15. 44 %), liver enzymes (ALP 22. 02 %, AST 19. 05 %, ALT 23. 11 %), and nitric oxide levels (35. 80 %) in all groups compared to nicotine group (percentages represent the maximum dose) (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Crocin showed its partly protective effect against nicotine-induced liver toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Uncarinic acid C (URC) is triterpene {{isolated}} from Uncaria rhynchophylla {{and is a}} <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b> The induction of dendritic cells (DC) is critical for the induction of Ag-specific T lymphocyte responses and may be essential {{for the development of}} human vaccines relying on T cell immunity. DC might be a potential target for URC. We demonstrate that URC activates human DC as documented by phenotypic and functional maturation, and altered cytokine production. The expression of CD 1 a, CD 38, CD 40, CD 54, CD 80, CD 83, CD 86, HLA-DR and CCR 7 on URC-primed DC was enhanced. The production of IL- 12 p 70 by URC-primed DC was higher than that of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -primed DC. The production of IL- 12 p 70 by URC-primed DC was inhibited by the anti-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) monoclonal antibody (mAb), but partially abolished by anti-TLR 2 mAb. mRNA coding for TLR 2 and TLR 4 was expressed in URC-primed DC. URC-primed DC induced the NF-κB transcription factor. Naïve T cells co-cultured with URC-primed DC turned into typical Th 1 cells that produced large quantities of IFN-γ depending on IL- 12 secretion. URC enhanced the T cell stimulatory capacity in an allo MLR. In the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte assay (CTL) assay, DNA fragmentation assay and 51 Cr release on URC-primed DC were more augmented than that of TNF-α-primed DC. DC matured with URC had an intermediate migratory capacity towards CCL 19 and CCL 21. These results suggest that URC modulates DC function in a fashion that favors Th 1 polarization via the activation of IL- 12 p 70 dependent on TLR 4 signaling, and may be used on DC-based vaccine for cancer immunotherapy...|$|R
