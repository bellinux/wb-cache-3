5|$|The {{dynamics}} of gender inequity are related with the ideological principles {{held by the}} ruling political regime. The imperial era was dominated by the social paradigm of Confucianism, which was a pervasive philosophy throughout the Orient. Confucian ideals emphasized morality, character, social relationship, and the status quo. Confucius preached jen (humanity) and the equality and educability of all people; Neo-Confucianists and Imperial leaders used his beliefs in social hierarchy, particularly in the family setting, for the <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> oppression of women. As the Chinese government began to re-assimilate themselves into the global community in the late 19th to early 20th century, it shifted away from conventional Confucian ideals and women's role in society changed as well. After Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in 1949, a change in traditional gender roles came about. Mao's death {{marked the beginning of}} the current communist administration, and an influx of international communications in the areas of commerce, politics and social ideals. Since the 1980s, under the new communist party, the women's rights movement has gained momentum and has become a national issue as well as a sign of modernization.|$|E

The paper outlines a conceptual framework with libraries as integrative interfaces across <b>physical,</b> digital, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> affordances <b>and</b> users that mix convergent (goal-directed) and divergent (exploratory) information behaviour. Ten design dimensions that enable and trigger divergent behaviour are outlined. Implications for persuasive design are discussed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} I examine the {{foundations}} of <b>physical</b> externalism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> externalism <b>and</b> argue that these foundations are incompatible. Physical externalism {{is based on a}} direct reference theory of natural-kind terms, while social externalism is based on a description theory of natural-kind terms. Thus, <b>physical</b> externalism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> externalism are incompatible just {{in the same way that}} the direct reference theory of proper names is incompatible with the description theory of proper names. My argument will proceed as follows. In Section One, I shall explain what the two theses say and spell out my suspicion. In Section Two, I shall take a look at the initial setups for <b>physical</b> externalism <b>and</b> <b>social</b> externalism by examining Putnam’s and Burge’s original arguments. Finally in Section Three, I shal...|$|R
