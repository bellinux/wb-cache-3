40|$|Extreme folding {{damage of}} {{open-ended}} tubular piles could occur during piling in onshore practices. Amazonehaven unique quay wall removal gave {{the opportunity to}} study king pile’s failure close to toe. King piles are primary piles in a combined wall system, exposed to static and dynamic load. It is argued that the unexpected <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> failure {{have been caused by}} dynamic load because of the uniaxial direction of the extreme deformations. However, research into <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> failure in Amazonehaven shows that hammer-induced driving stresses are significantly lower than material’s yield stress close to <b>pile</b> <b>toe,</b> given Amazonehaven soil condition. Therefore, the dynamic load has not been solely detrimental to the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> integrity. The main reasons for <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> failure are discussed to be (1) pile imperfection, (2) pile inclination and (3) pile inhomogeneous strength. Bear in mind that, <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> failure to such extent when not limited might lead to dysfunction of the asset during its technical lifetime. Therefore, counteractions must be taken to assure quay wall’s safety and stability while operating. The remedies when such a piling risk event occur could be: replacement, early maintenance, or a reduction in its designed storage capacity. The reactive solutions will bring financial consequences of <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> failure forward. In other words, the client will experience a reduction in its revenues due to asset’s malfunction. However, when proactive process-based alternatives are implemented in the current procedure in piling industry, the probability of occurrence of the failure is to be reduced. Therefore, financial consequences of piling risk event will remain limited.

40|$|When a long pile is {{interacting}} with the soil, the combined force applied to the pile head is distributed among the side face and the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> inhomogeneously. The toe gets not more than 30 % from the general force, which doesn’t let using the reserves of the bearing capacity of relatively firm soil under the fifth pile.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Impact {{driving of piles}} is {{a complex}} process which depends on the {{interaction}} of the stress wave progressing down the pile and on the dynamic soil resistance along the shaft and at the toe. Pile driving vibrations can adversely affect adjacent structures, and the intensity of ground vibrations depends on the dynamic resistance along the pile rather than on the energy applied to the pile. The viscous damping factor, Jc, is one of the fundamental parameters when the static pile resistance is determined from dynamic tests. Theoretical analyses and field observations show that the Jc-factor is not solely a soil parameter, but a function of the ratio of pile impedance and soil impedance at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> Consequently, the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> damping factor for an open-toe pipe pile would be different when no plug develops in the pile and when the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> is fully plugged. Moreover, the mentioned aspect needs to be considered when the results of a test pile of one pile type are applied to a construction pile of a different type. Viscous damping along the pile shaft and at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> is the source of ground vibrations. The vibration magnitude is governed by the interactive nature of dynamic pile-soil resistance, which {{is a function of the}} ratio between the pile impedance and the soil impedance for P-waves. It is shown that the vibration transmission efficacy and the dynamic resistance are inversely linearly proportional to the pile impedance, and that energy transmission efficacy correctly reflects the vibration emission from the pile t...|$|E

Typically the <b>pile</b> <b>toes</b> are designed to penetrate into stiff or dense soil formations to achieve sufficient base resistance. Recent research at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia has discovered that the in situ stress conditions in stiff to hard clays is directly related to pile installation rates, which in turn are a function of the piling rig capacity and ground conditions. With adequate and constant pile penetration rates in situ stress conditions in the stiff to hard clay are increased by about 40 %, resulting in significantly higher pile capacities. If pile penetration rates are too slow the in situ stress conditions are reduced considerably by remoulding and shearing of the clay.

In this preliminary study, the behaviour of an axially loaded pile under thermal cycles was investigated using a physical model. After applying the axial load by dead weights on the pile's head, the pile was heated from 25 °C to 50 °C and subsequently cooled to 25 °C. Four tests (corresponding to four values of axial load) were performed and two temperature cycles were undertaken in each test. The pile's temperature and the pile head displacement were monitored. When low axial loads were applied, the heating induced heave and cooling induced settlement of the pile's head. In this case, the displacement-temperature curve was found to be reversible and similar to the thermal expansion curve of the pile. However, in the case of higher axial loads, the heave of the pile's head, obtained during heating, was lower than the thermal expansion of the pile demonstrating the settlement of the <b>pile's</b> <b>toe.</b> Reversible settlement of the pile's head was also observed after these thermal cycles...|$|R

40|$|In densely built areas, the {{development}} of underground transportation systems often involves twin tunnels, which are sometimes unavoidably constructed adjacent to existing piled foundations. Because soil stiffness degrades with induced stress release and shear strain during tunnelling, {{it is vital to}} investigate the pile responses to subsequent tunnels after the first tunnel in a twin-tunnel transportation system. To gain new insights into single pile responses to side-by-side twin tunnelling in saturated stiff clay, a three-dimensional coupled-consolidation numerical parametric study is carried out. An advanced hypoplasticity (clay) constitutive model with small-strain stiffness is adopted. The effects of each tunnel depth relative to pile are investigated by simulating the twin tunnels either near the mid-depth of the pile shaft or adjacent to or below the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> The model parameters are calibrated against centrifuge test results in stiff clay reported in literature. It is found the second tunnelling in each case resulted in larger settlement than that due to the first tunnelling with a maximum percentage difference of 175 % in the case of twin tunnelling near the mid-depth of the shaft. This is because of the degradation of clay stiffness around the pile during the first tunnelling. Conversely, the first tunnelling-induced bending moment was reduced substantially during the second tunnelling. The most critical location of twin tunnels relative to the pile was found to be the tunnels below the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> This is because the entire pile was located within the major influence zone of the twin tunnelling. Two distinct load transfer mechanisms can be identified in the pile, namely downward load transfer in case of tunnels near mid-depth of the pile shaft and next to the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> and upward load transfer in case of twin-tunnelling below the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> These two transfer mechanisms can be useful for practitioner to assess the pile performance due to twin tunnelling.

To study the effect of the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> condition on the dynamic response of pile and pile groups, a three-dimensional finite element modeling of the soil–pile–slab dynamic interaction is presented. The soil and piles are represented as continuum solids and the slab by structural elements. Quiet boundaries are placed at the boundaries of the model to avoid wave reflection. The formulation is based on the substructuring method. The dynamic response is obtained in terms of the dynamic impedances. In this study the dynamic response of the floating, rested, and anchored piles are analyzed and the group effect is shown.

Their predictability for high capacity long driven H-piles in weathered soils is in doubt. In this thesis, the final sets of 4, 278 H-piles of 28 - 80 m long, dynamic measurements of 255 of them and static loading tests of 13 instrumented piles from a site are studied. Pile behaviours caused by a hammer impact and under static test load are compared with 361 H-piles of 14 - 25 m long from another site and theoretical predictions. Measured data revealed that the load-transfer mechanism varied with pile length and applied load. Piles deformed almost linearly with increased load and might fail in buckling with or without large plastic deformation. Unit side resistance degraded after prolonged hard driving. Maximum impact forces at final set were scatter but their means were insensitive to hammer type, ram weight, ram drop and pile length. Maximum impact compression of pile and affected pile length existed. Creep settlement and set-up effect in weathered soils were quantified. Geotechnical design parameters for local soils were calibrated. Factors affecting dynamic soil parameters were explained. Two improvements to {{the prediction}}s were proposed. The energy-based equation uses the final sets and energy transferred to pile head to estimate the affected pile length. Piles longer than the length estimated will be considered as long piles and existing theories have to be applied with caution. If this length is used instead of full pile length in Hiley formula, predictability of the formula can be improved. The advantages of this modification to Hiley formula are its simplicity to use in field and the low cost compared with the stress-wave monitoring techniques. The new Case damping model approximates the Case damping factor as the sum of hysteretic damping of pile and viscous damping of surrounding soil. Based on this model, the effects of variation in load-distribution along pile shaft and set-up of pile in layered soils, and the incomplete mobilization of soil at <b>pile</b> <b>toes</b> to the Case damping factor can be explained...|$|R
40|$|Any {{tunnelling}} process inevitably induces {{changes in}} {{stress in the}} ground and may adversely affect nearby pile foundations. The interaction between tunnelling and an existing pile has been investigated by researchers and a certain amount of fundamental understanding has been gained. However, the effects of different tunnel excavation sequences on an adjacent pile remain to be understood. In this paper, a series of three-dimensional centrifuge model tests and numerical back-analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of construction sequence of twin tunnels on an existing pile in dry sand. Two tunnelling sequences were investigated: (i) a sequence involving tunnelling near the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> followed by tunnelling near the mid-depth of the pile shaft (i. e., test TS); (ii) sequence involving tunnelling near the mid-depth of the pile shaft followed by tunnelling near the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> (i. e., test ST). The measured cumulative pile settlement was about 33 % larger for tunnelling sequence ST than for tunnelling sequence TS. Due to different tunnelling sequences, the apparent losses of pile capacity were 40 % and 29 % for sequences ST and TS, respectively. Although the computed reductions in normal stress acting on the pile induced by twin tunnelling were almost the same in tests TS and ST, tunnelling near the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> induced a larger decrease in the end-bearing and shaft resistances at {{the lower part of the}} pile in test ST than in test TS.

40|$|A three-dimensional, elasto-plastic, coupled-consolidation {{numerical}} {{analysis was conducted}} to investigate the effects of an advancing open face tunnel excavation on an existing, loaded pile. Based on the ground conditions, geometry, and tunnel construction method simulated, a significant zone of influence can be identified one tunnel diameter ahead and one behind the tunnel excavation face. Within this zone of influence, the settlement of the pile {{is greater than the}} ground settlement due to the plastic yielding at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> A computed ground sur-face settlement profile simulated by a normal Gaussian distribution does not accurately reflect pile head settlement and a significant nonlinear distribution of subsurface settlement with depth is induced by tunnel excavation. Under plane strain conditions. other empirical and analytical methods predicted similar trends in the subsurface settlements, but gave larger magnitudes of subsurface settlements. The open face tunnel excavation induces complex distributions of relative subsurface settlements and both positive and negative side shear stresses along the pile. Within the zone of influence of the tunnel excavation, excess positive and negative pore-water pressures are generated at the pile head and <b>pile</b> <b>toe,</b> respectively. At the <b>pile</b> <b>toe,</b> the pore-water pressure was reduced to 40 % of its initial hydrostatic value. At 10 days after the tunnel face passed the pile, the excess pore-water pressures at the pile recovered to within 20 % of initial hydrostatic values. Due to the additional settlement of the pile that occurred during tunneling, the soil resistance factor of safety for the pile can be regarded as decreasing from 3. 0 to 1. 5, according to a displacement-based failure load criterion.

40|$|In densely built urban areas, it is {{inevitable}} that tunnels will be constructed near existing pile groups. The bearing capacity of a pile group depends on shear stress along the soil-pile interface and normal stress underneath the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> while the two would be adversely affected by the unloading process of tunneling. Although extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of tunnel construction on existing single piles, the influence of twin tunnel advancement on an existing pile group is merely reported in the literature. In this study, a series of three-dimensional centrifuge tests were carried out to investigate the response of an existing pile group under working load subjected to twin tunneling at various locations in dry Toyoura sand. In each twin tunneling test, the first tunnel is constructed near the mid-depth of the pile shaft, while the second tunnel is subsequently constructed either next to, below or right underneath the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> (Tests G_ST, G_SB and G_SU, respectively). Among the three tests, the 2 nd tunnel excavated near the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> (Test G_ST) results in the smallest settlement but the largest transverse tilting (0. 2 %) of pile group. Significant bending moment was induced at the pile head (1. 4 times of its bending moment capacity) due to the 2 nd tunnel T. On the contrary, tunneling right underneath the toe of pile (i. e., Test G_SU) results in the smallest tilting but largest settlement of the pile group (4. 6 % of pile diameter) and incremental mobilisation of shaft resistance (13 %). Due to stress release by the twin tunneling, the axial force taken by the front piles close to tunnels was reduced and partially transferred to the rear piles.

Therefore twenty two pile case histories have been compiled including static loading tests performed in uplift, or in push with separation of shaft and toe resistances at sites which comprise CPT or CPTu sounding. Sensitivity analysis of the derived polynomial model has been carried out to study the influence of input parameters on model output.

40|$|Uncertainty {{exists in}} signal-matching techniques. The quake and damping {{obtained}} {{may not be}} the actual response of the soil. In this paper, the final sets, strain gauge readings, pile driving analyzer, and Case pile wave analysis program of 12 high-capacity long H-piles at the end of initial driving as well as two of them at restrike are studied. Measured and deduced data show that the soil response underneath the pile toes has limited movement and yielding despite the piles being set using very heavy hammer rams and large ram drops. The quake and damping decrease with increased shearing strain and shearing stress, but are influenced by pile whipping, rebounded stress wave, and load-transfer mechanism. The lumped Case damping factor decreases with increased side resistance to total resistance ratio. This factor can decrease or increase with time due to changes in the load-transfer mechanism after set-up, thus affecting the proportion of viscous damping of soil along the pile shaft and at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> A Case damping model is proposed that approximates the lumped Case damping factor as the sum of hysteretic damping of the pile and viscous damping of the surrounding soil.

40|$|Modeling {{pile driving}} {{is a complex}} process, {{including}} vibrations generated from the driving hammer, propagating further through the pile and transferred to the surroundings at the pile-soil interface. The vibrations propagating through the ground interact with structures, potentially causing damage to both underground and structures at surface level or potentially disturbing their inhabitants. Prediction models of ground vibrations focus on estimating the vibrations at ground surface level. The prediction of vibration amplitude at different depths can be more useful at sites with sensitive ground conditions. A model predicting these subsurface vibrations, easily applicable in engineering practice is currently not available or not validated. One of the impediments in developing a model for predicting ground vibrations at different depths {{is the lack of}} field data for validation. The purpose of this thesis is to find a prediction model for ground vibrations at different depths below the surface level. The study is focused on vibrations induced by impact driving of open ended steel tubular piles. A literature study was conducted to gain theoretical knowledge on pile driving and ground vibrations. The model developed by Massarsch and Fellenius [15] was found in the literature and although it predicts ground vibrations at surface level, the adaptation of the model for predicting vibrations at different depths was studied. Vibration measurements from the field test performed in the Caland Canal have been analyzed. The soil profile at the site consists of sandy clay and clay layers overlying a dense sand layer. First, large diameter dolphin piles were driven by a vibratory hammer. When the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> reached the dense sand layer, the driving process was changed to impact hammering in order to change the characteristics of the vibrations transmitted through the soil. The pile driving was extensively monitored and particle velocities were recorded by 3 D geophones placed up to depths of NAP - 22 m (9. 50 m embedment depth). The prediction model of Massarsch and Fellenius [15] makes a distinction between the velocities of different wave types emitted from piles during impact driving. These waves are the shear waves propagating with a cylindrical wave front along the pile shaft and compression waves emitted at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe,</b> propagating with a spherical wave front. Surface waves resulting from wave reflection at ground surface are not considered in this thesis, as this research focuses on vibrations at different depths. Wave velocities are calculated from the hammer input energy, taking into account ground conditions and considering the vibration transmission efficacy which defines the amount of energy transmitted at the pile-soil interface. The model is adapted for open ended tubular piles. Due to the large diameter of the dolphin piles and the present soil conditions, the soil plugging effect and its contribution to dynamic soil resistance at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> are ignored. Dynamic soil resistance at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> is considered the source of spherical waves, while the soil resistance along the pile shaft is the source of cylindrical waves. The ratio between the pile cross section and the total area delimited by the external diameter is taken into account when calculating the dynamic soil resistance at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe,</b> resulting particle velocities of spherical waves smaller than unity. Therefore the cylindrical waves propagating from the pile shaft are considered the main source of ground vibrations. The results of the prediction model have been compared to vibration values measured in the field test. The predicted vibration amplitudes are a good approximation of the vibration levels measured in the sandy clay and clay layers. The predicted vibrations are of higher magnitude compared to the amplitude of vibrations recorded by the sensors placed in the dense sand layer.

40|$|Impact driving {{technique}} {{is commonly used}} in offshore environments to install pipe piles. This technique consists in striking the pile head with a hammer to reach the required installation depth. The quest for offshore wind energy demands that pipe pile foundations be installed in increasingly challenging geotechnical conditions. To reach final installation depth, the pile has now to be driven through very dense soil with high resistance and even into rock layers. This increases the difficulty of pile driving while avoiding its damage during hammering. The objective of this thesis is to portray stresses in a pipe pile during driving into rock layer and to assess the structural integrity of the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> An analytical approach has been attempted first {{to solve the problem}} for the static case. On one hand, an original analytical solution of a pipe pile subjected to non-axial static loading has been developed based on the Airy stress function. This solution gave results approaching those of Boussinesq’s plane strain solution for the case of large diameters. On the other hand, two novel closed-form solutions for cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion in a rock mass governed by a particular case of the Hoek-Brown yield criterion were developed and validated numerically. Two numerical methods were implemented to simulate dynamic pipe pile driving into rock: the Lagrangian method consisting in an axisymmetric modelling based on the “zipper type” technique and the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian method (CEL- 3 D). Stresses in tubular piles during impact driving were evaluated, allowing the structural integrity of the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> to be assessed. To validate the proposed numerical models, a 1 g reduced scale model was built, featuring different synthetic rock resistances. The developed experimental model is able to simulate pipe pile driving into rock. Comparison between numerical simulations (CEL- 3 D) and experimental tests showed similar results in terms of strains at the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> level. Based on numerical simulations and experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn: • The power form of the Extended Drucker-Prager yield criterion can emulate the mechanical behaviour of rock mass governed by the Hoek-Brown yield criterion. • The “zipper-type” {{technique is}} applicable to quasi-static cone penetration into dense sand and fully coring penetration of pipe pile undergoing driving. • Pipe pile driving into good quality rock mass (σc> 20 MPa) entails a significant risk of damaging the pile toe; the use of high steel grade is recommended.

40|$|Strain gauges are {{normally}} {{used to monitor}} the shortening or compression of pile during static pile load test. For concrete spun pile, the technique used either by incorporating high temperature-resistant strain gauges into the heat-cured production process of the spun piles or by installing an instrumented steel pipe into the hollow core of the spun piles followed by cement grout infilling. The former is extremely unpopular due to high cost of these gauges and the uncertainty over their ability to survive the pile production and driving processes. The shortcoming of the other technique is the infilling of cement grout substantially alters the structural properties of the piles, thus rendering their load-response behaviour significantly {{different from that of}} the actual working piles. To address the difficulties of the above techniques a new method was recently developed by the authors, which uses retrieval sensors instead of strain gauges (which have to be sacrificed in every test). The method also has the ability to monitor loads and displacements at various levels along the <b>pile</b> shaft and <b>toe</b> of instrumented <b>piles.</b> Results of field tests show high quality, reliable and consistent data, clearly far exceeding the capability of both conventional and approximate methods of using strain gauges...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Drill {{cuttings}} {{with various}} characteristics and sizes are produced in any offshore {{oil and gas}} exploration and production (EP) drilling of the seabed. Drill cuttings may be transported to shore for land disposal or they may be disposed off into the sea after proper treatment on site. Offshore disposal of treated drilling muds and rock cuttings is operationally the simplest option available and economically the least expensive. Appropriate environmental measures, however, must be taken to ensure that the marine environment is not unduly polluted by the discharged drill cuttings. Further, the disposed drill cuttings will ultimately deposit onto the seabed to form <b>piles</b> around the <b>toe</b> of the platform that might hinder optimal pipe laying and maintenance. To enable proper assessment of the impacts of drill cuttings on the seabed and the marine environment, model simulations are performed to analyze the transport, dispersion and deposition of drilling muds and rock cuttings. For this purpose, a simulation model known as TUNA-PT has been developed to model the transport and deposition of drill cuttings subject to various climatic conditions, coastal environments and cuttings characteristics. This paper presents simulation results of cuttings pile formation patterns on the seabed and the distribution of suspended sediments in the top water column for an offshore EP platform in the South China Sea.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} development of an improved method for the static and dynamic analysis of driven piles for both forward and inverse solutions. Wave propagation in piles, which is the result of <b>pile</b> head (or <b>toe)</b> impact and the distributed mass and elasticity of the pile, was analyzed in two ways: forward (the hammer is modeled and the pile response and capacity for a certain blow count is estimated) or inverse (the force-time and velocity-or displacement-time history from driving data is used to estimate the pile capacity.) The finite element routine developed was a three dimensional model of the hammer, pile and soil system using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, Newmark 2 ̆ 7 s method for the dynamic solution and a modified Newton method for the static solution. Soil properties were aggregated to simplify data entry and analysis. The three-dimensional model allowed for more accurate modeling of the various parts of the system and phenomena that are not well addressed with current one-dimensional methods, including bending effects in the cap and shaft response of tapered piles. Soil layering was flexible and could either follow the grid generation or be manually input. The forward method could either model the hammer explicitly or use a given force-time history, analyzing the pile response. The inverse method used an optimization technique to determine the aggregated soil properties of a given layering scheme. In both cases the static axial capacity of the pile was estimated using the same finite element model as the dynamic method and incrementally loaded. The results were then analyzed using accepted load test interpretation criteria. The model was run in test cases against current methods to verify its features, one of which was based on actual field data using current techniques for both data acquisition and analysis, with reasonable correlation of the results. The routine was standalone and did not require additional code to use...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{model is}} suggested herein {{to explore the}} interaction between a boulder and a pile being driven, {{taking into account the}} properties of the rock forming the boulder and the embedding geological formation. A one-dimensional model is considered as a first attempt, with a view to integrate it into a classical one-dimensional wave-equation representation of the pile being driven. A typical case of a tubular pile driven into stiff glacial till by a hydraulic hammer is investigated. The proposed model is shown to highlight the influence of pile dimensions, boulder size, and hammer energy on the potential damage to the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> Conclusions can be drawn in terms of an optimal range of hammer operational setting, depending on expected boulder size...|$|E
40|$|The {{context of}} this thesis is the {{installation}} of driven piles in clay. Pile driving is an installation method which consists of repeatedly striking the pile head with a mass until desired embedment is attained. Driving brings severe distortions to the soil which has to accommodate for the penetrating pile. At the end of installation, the soil is left in a distressed state, which progressively tends to equilibrium with time, leading {{to a change in}} pile capacity. This phenomenon referred to as pile set-up. The objective of this thesis was to implement a numerical model which could account for pile installation and subsequent set-up in clayey soils. Focus was placed on behaviour round the pile shaft. The particularity the developed model is that it accounts for the cycles of shaft-soil shearing occurring during driving. Supported by experimental evidence, the original model developed in this work outlines the following conclusions: • During installation, total stress at pile wall decreases with vertical distance from <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> (the h/R effect) due to (a) stress relief away from the <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> and (b) fatigue from the accumulation of driving blows; • After installation, the radial distribution of pore pressure presents a peak a few radii away from the pile shaft. This peak value increases with overconsolidation ratio (OCR) while the pore pressure at the pile wall decreases with OCR; • The shape of pore pressure distribution after installation leads to a short term minimum in radial effective stress (therefore in pile capacity) during set-up. Furthermore, the model yielded the following additional conclusions, which were outside of the scope of the available experimental data: • The soil effective stress response during installation and set-up is mainly governed by overconsolidation ratio, rather than soil strength or stiffness; • There is a critical hammer velocity for which the soil offers maximum adherence to the pile; • Although shaft capacity after set-up was comparable for the open-ended and the closed-ended piles, open-ended set-up time was four times shorter.

30|$|The <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> {{condition}} on a stiffer {{soil layer}} {{plays an important}} role to transmit loads from the superstructure to the soil. Given the complexity of the soil–pile–slab interaction problem and the strong coupling between the different elements forming this foundation system, a three-dimensional finite element numerical modeling with absorbing boundaries is proposed. The aim of this modeling is to analysis the influence of the fixing conditions of the piles in the hard soil on the dynamic response of soil–pile–slab systems. To model the soil and piles, volumic elements are considered and the slab is considered using structural elements. The dynamic impedances are calculated from the displacements obtained at the point of application of the exciting force. Floating, rested and anchored piles in a hard soil layer are analyzed and the effect of groups is also studied. The vertical and horizontal dynamic impedance are presented for different configuration.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{examine how}} partial {{embedment}} of a helical screw pile into a bearing layer affects on its penetrability and load-settlement behavior. Both large-scale model tests and field tests had been conducted taking embedment length into account. For model tests, two layered sand deposits with different relative densities were prepared in a calibration chamber. The test results show the following {{regardless of the}} test scale; a torque profile and a penetration rate start change just before reaching a <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> into a bearing layer. Embedment length equal to a screw diameter, which is commonly required in practice, yields effective mobilize of the end-bearing resistance beneath the helical screw, while less resistance tends to mobilize beneath the pile shaft as embedment length increases. As far as the bearing capacity of a pile is concerned, however, no significant influence {{can be observed in}} terms of embedment length into a bearing layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of driven piles on rock has been practiced {{for years in}} Hong Kong. However, detailed field studies to investigate the performance {{of this type of}} foundation are still limited. A well instrumented driven H-pile was recently installed and founded on granite. The load transfer mechanism and the pile performance are studied based on comprehensive pile tests. Analyses show that the pile design is controlled by the structural capacity of the pile section but not the engineering properties of the bedrock. The <b>pile</b> <b>toe</b> resistance back-calculated from strain gauges is found to be considerably higher than the allowable values for bored pile design. The Hiley formula commonly used in Hong Kong is found to underestimate the ultimate pile capacity of the pile founded on rock. A more rational wave equation analysis is performed and shows consistent results with PDA tests and the CAPWAP analysis...|$|E
40|$|Driven piles are {{the main}} {{foundation}} system for offshore oil and gas facilities. They are installed through the jacket legs or {{at the bottom of}} the structure. Driven piles can, however, experience premature refusal. In this case, drilling solutions may be needed, such as drilling to remove the plug ahead and below the <b>pile</b> <b>toe.</b> Because time is important during offshore operations, offshore bored piles are rarely used. Unlike pile drivability analysis, which is based on wave analysis and hence reliable, there is no established pile-drillability assessment. This paper extends the findings of previous research in which the specific excavation energy (SEE) was estimated in subsoils from Turin, Italy, at a small scale. Two subsoil classes were considered and compared in this study. The SEE was linked to different friction-angle and cohesion values, and using the Nishimatsu and Evans cutting models, preliminary theoretical net drilling penetrations were estimated. The results should be considered as theoretical values...|$|E
