5|$|Doggett {{returns to}} the X-Files office, where, to his surprise, he meets The Lone Gunmen. They {{tell him about the}} history of the third eye. While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{a copy of a}} desk calendar chronicling all of Ron Swanson's meetings {{from the}} episode was placed on the official Parks and Recreation website. That site also featured three deleted scenes from the episode. In the first, 80-second clip, Leslie and Jessica get into a fight about the gazebo, and Jessica reveals she has trimmed the mansion's historic hedges into the shape of elephants. The second clip, which lasted one minute, features several more of Ron Swanson's meetings, including one where he tries to literally will a man away with his mind. Andy also tells Ron he accidentally agreed to sell the recreation center to the Quiznos fast food restaurant chain. In the third, 90-second clip, Leslie tries to end Nick Newport Sr.'s birthday party by pulling the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lights, but accidentally disconnects his breathing machine instead.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of November 30, 2000, the NPSL officially pulled the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Drillers franchise. After two weeks of trying to find suitable local ownership, it became very apparent {{that there were no}} takers willing to absorb the substantial losses that would be encountered as a result of taking over the club at this point.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, the TV program Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters premiered on NBC. In {{addition}} to hosts Barbara, Louise, and Irlene, the show featured musical guests and comedy sketches. Each broadcast also {{closed with a}} gospel song, which led to Mandrell recording her own inspirational album, He Set My Life to Music (1982). As {{a result of her}} busy schedule, she began suffering from vocal strain, and on doctor's orders, pulled the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television program in 1982. (Variety shows were also falling out of favor at the time; the series was NBC's last variety series to date.) She received one award (People's Choice) and two nominations (Golden Globe and TV Land Award) for her work on the show. In 1983, she premiered The Lady Is a Champ, a Las Vegas stage show.|$|E
25|$|Highway58A {{passes through}} the Townline Tunnel, {{one of the three}} tunnels under the Welland Canal. The {{majority}} of the route follows Townline Road, although a short section at the eastern end travels along Reaker Road and Netherby Road. Beginning at the northern terminus of the southern section of Highway58, the highway travels east, parallel with two railway lines. The road intersects Canal Bank Road (north) / The Kingsway (south) after crossing an earth <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old Welland Canal, now the Welland Recreational Waterway. It then curves slightly southwards and begins descending towards the Townline Tunnel. It encounters Humberstone Road and then passes beneath a railway prior to entering the tunnel. At the eastern end of the tunnel, the route encounters Rusholme Road before passing beneath Highway140. It turns north onto Reaker Road and then west onto Netherby Road to end at an at-grade intersection with Highway140.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1965, the 200 engines were {{upgraded}} to seven main bearings to reduce harmonic vibrations and increase durability. The 1965 and later engine {{can be identified}} by five freeze (core) <b>plugs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the block and the casting code C5DE-H. Starting in 1966, a six-bolt bell housing flange block was introduced.|$|R
50|$|The 200 cu in I-6 {{engine model}} was {{introduced}} in the middle of 1963 with 3.685 by 3.126 in (93,472 by 79,4004 mm) bore and stroke, and shared the four main bearing design used in the 170 engine. Early 200s can be identified by three freeze (core) <b>plugs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the block.|$|R
50|$|The C was {{replaced}} within {{just a few}} months by the C2, with a geared coupling between the rangefinder and the lens, greatly accelerating focusing and making the camera much more convenient to use. Finally, in 1939 the C3 was introduced, with electrical <b>plugs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cameras left side for a battery-powered flash, synchronized to the shutter.|$|R
25|$|At New Hampshire for the Camping World RV Sales 301, Johnson {{qualified}} second, {{but failed}} post-qualifying inspection after {{his car was}} found to be too low, and started the race in 43rd, {{the first time in his}} career he started dead last. In the race, Johnson passed seven cars in the first four laps and reached the Top 20 by lap 50, while reaching the top ten by lap 165; Johnson would finish sixth. He almost won the pole position at Indianapolis but was bumped to second by Ryan Newman. Johnson led the most laps and almost won, but a slow final pit stop cost him the race to Newman. The following week at Pocono, Johnson won another pole position, setting another track qualifying record. He led 43 of the first 80 laps before he cut a right front tire that knocked a spark plug loose and affected the handling of the car. Johnson's pit crew worked hard to repair the car, fixing the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last pit stop, and managing to salvage a 13th-place finish after racing near the back of the pack for most of the race.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Scorsese {{began work}} on a long-cherished {{personal}} project, The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the 1951 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis that retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms. Barbara Hershey recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming Boxcar Bertha. The film was slated to shoot under the Paramount Pictures banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount pulled the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by Taxi Driver and Raging Bull veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation. Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with Mary Magdalene in a Satan-induced hallucination while on the cross.|$|E
500|$|In April 1969 Davies helped {{negotiate}} {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, {{which allowed}} plans for a North American tour. Davies went into a state of depression, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was [...] "sick of it all" [...] at a gig in White City Stadium. A review of the concert published in Melody Maker stated: [...] "Davies swore on stage. He stood at The White City and swore that he was 'F...... sick of the whole thing'... He was 'Sick up to here with it'... and those that heard shook their heads. Mick just ventured a disbelieving smile, and drummer on through 'Waterloo Sunset. Davies proceeded to try to announce that the Kinks were breaking up, but this attempt was foiled by the group's publicity management, who pulled the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> microphone system.|$|E
50|$|Between 1929 and 1940, DKW {{produced}} a less well remembered but technically intriguing series of rear-wheel drive cars called (among other names) Schwebeklasse and Sonderklasse with two-stroke V4 engines. Engine displacement was 1,000 cc, later 1,100 cc. The engines had two extra cylinders for forced induction, so they appeared like V6 engines but without spark <b>plugs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front cylinder pair.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, Clark was {{diagnosed}} with bone cancer. He continued announcing for Wheel of Fortune {{for as long as}} he was able to up until the end of the 1987-1988 season.

50|$|In 1928 Connecticut {{suspended}} his pilot {{license for}} trying to fly under the Whittemore Memorial Bridge in Naugatuck. According to local Naugatuck tradition, the wing span of his aircraft was much longer than {{the width of the}} center arch of the bridge. The flight may have been a publicity stunt, as there was an advertisement for Splitdorf Spark <b>Plugs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fuselage.|$|R
500|$|... "Worlds Apart" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen noted {{that with the}} closing of the bridge, [...] "Fringe effectively pulled the <b>plug</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creative idea that defined the best years of the show. [...] I don't think we can understate the passing of the parallel world premise." [...] While he said he would miss the lost characters, especially Fauxlivia, the series [...] "got the emotions [...] just right." [...] He added his hope that the characters would be revisited. In an interview, Pinckner said that they had spoken to Fox executives about closing off the bridge, to which one executive partner reportedly said, [...] "I was so sad. [...] I had tears in my eyes when we closed the door". The executive added that despite having initially thought the idea of doppelganger characters as a poor one, she admitted that she [...] "was so wrong".|$|E
