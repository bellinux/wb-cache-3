40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the physiological influences of the respiratory metabolisms and the cell-membrane activities of the supraoesophageal ganglions on the PAS-positive granules of the peculiar cells (PAS-cells) in the prawn, Penaeus japonicus B [...] For the respiratory measurements the cultivations of the ganglions were performed during 4 hours under the different compositions of the <b>physiological</b> <b>salines</b> and then the medium-effects upon the granules were investigated, too, after the above tissues were prepared histologically. Effects of the different concentrations of the D-glucose (3 mg/dl and 0. 03 mg/dl) {{and the difference between}} the D-glucose and the D-galactose (3 mg/dl) were no observed on the O_ 2 consumptions of the tissues and the quantities of the granules. For the <b>physiological</b> <b>salines</b> of the 107 mM K and the 3 mM K the former showed only the suppressed effects on the granules. Similarly for the 20 mM Ca and the 8 mM Ca the latter showed only, too, the suppressed effects on the granules and in addition the accelerative effects on the O_ 2 consumptions. Both of the recuperative cultivations during 3. 5 hours after the treatments during 30 minutes with the <b>physiological</b> <b>salines</b> of the 107 mM K and the 8 mM Ca showed the accelerative effects on the granules respectively. Between the O_ 2 consumptions and the quantities of the granules there were no correlations. In conclusion it seems that the granules may have a physiological role on the maintenance of the membrane activities of the PAS-cells. 1. クルマエビにおける食道上神経節の後部腹面正中線上の細胞集団に所在するPAS細胞に関して,当該細胞の含有顆粒の生理的意義を該当神経節の呼吸代謝および膜活動等,神経生理的機能の一側面より検討した。 2. 食道上神経節は気密容器内で 4 時間, 18 - 20 °C条件のもとに組織培養を行ない,培養終了の後,組織標本として該当部位に出現した顆粒像を複写計量法により計量した。他方,培養液は微量WINKLER法により溶存酸素の減少量を求めて呼吸量を算出した。 3. 培養液はKUSANO液を基本とし,栄養分の効果実験としてはグルコースの 3 mg/dlと 0. 03 mg/dlの 2 区さらにガラクトースの 3 mg/dl区を設定した。グルコースに関しては両区の間でPAS顆粒量と呼吸量との各々に著しい差異は認められず,ガラクトースについてもグルコースにおける両値との相違は各々明瞭ではなかった。 4. イオン組成の変動効果実験としてはparameterにKとCaを選びKUSANO液の両成分に関して,前者は 107 mMと 3 mM,後者は 20 mMと 8 mMの各 2 区を設定し,各々グルコースを添加して 3 mg/dlの条件で培養した。K= 107 mMとCa= 8 mMの両区においてPAS顆粒は出現を抑えられた結果を示し,他方,呼吸量は後者にのみ著しい活性が示されその平均値は 0. 99 ml/g/ 4 hr. で平常値(0. 50 ml/g/ 4 hr) の約 2 倍であった。なお補足実験としてK= 107 mMとCa= 8 mMの両区に関して 30 分間の短期培養の後,イオン組成が平常の培養条件に戻して 3. 5 時間の継続培養を行ない,PAS顆粒量を調べた。両者とも当該顆粒には著しい量的増加が確認された。 5. 上記実験の諸結果においてPAS顆粒量と呼吸量との間には特定の相関性は認められず,よって当該顆粒は神経節の呼吸代謝とは直接的には生理的関連を有さないものと考えられ る。 6.

40|$|The {{ability of}} a frog {{olfactory}} receptor neurone (ORN) to respond to odorous molecules depends on its resting membrane properties, including membrane resistance and potential. Quantification of these properties is difficult because of a shunt conductance at the membrane–pipette seal that is in parallel with the true membrane conductance. In <b>physiological</b> <b>salines,</b> the sum of these two conductances averaged 235 pS. We used ionic substitution and channel blockers to reduce the membrane conductance as much as possible. This yielded a lower limit for the membrane conductance of 158 pS. The upper limit of resting membrane resistance, then, is 6 GΩ. The membrane is permeable to K+ and, to a lesser extent, other cations. No resting Cl− conductance was detectable. Correcting measured zero-current potentials for distortion by the shunt suggests that the resting membrane potential is no more negative than − 75 mV.

40|$|Aquaporins {{are known}} as water channels; however, an {{additional}} ion channel function has been observed for several including aquaporin- 1 (AQP 1). Using primary cultures of rat choroid plexus, a brain tissue that secretes CSF and abundantly expresses AQP 1, we confirmed the ion channel function of AQP 1 and assessed its functional relevance. The cGMP-gated cationic conductance associated with AQP 1 is activated by an endogenous receptor guanylate cyclase for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Fluid transport assays with confluent polarized choroid plexus cultures showed that AQP 1 current activation by 4. 5 μM ANP decreases the normal basal-to-apical fluid transport in the choroid plexus; conversely, AQP 1 block with 500 μM Cd²⁺ restores fluid transport. The cGMP-gated conductance in the choroid plexus is lost with targeted knockdown of AQP 1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA), as confirmed by immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch electrophysiology of transiently transfected cells identified by enhanced green fluorescent protein. The properties of the current (permeability to Na⁺, K⁺, TEA⁺, and Cs⁺; voltage insensitivity; and dependence on cGMP) matched properties characterized previously in AQP 1 -expressing oocytes. Background K⁺ and Cl⁻ currents in the choroid plexus were dissected from AQP 1 currents using Cs-methanesulfonate recording salines; the background currents recorded in <b>physiological</b> <b>salines</b> were not affected by AQP 1 –siRNA treatment. These results confirm that AQP 1 can function as both a water channel and a gated ion channel. The conclusion that the AQP 1 -associated cation current contributes to modulating CSF production resolves a lingering concern as to whether an aquaporin ionic conductance can have a physiologically relevant function.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{study the}} effects of {{intra-articular}} injection of magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) on the development of osteoarthritis (OA) and to examine concomitant changes in the nociceptive behavior of rats. MethodsOA was induced in Wistar rats with intra-articular injection of collagenase (500 U) in the right knee; the left knee was left untreated. In the OA+MgSO 4 group (n= 7), the treated knee was injected with 500 -μg (0. 1 -ml) MgSO 4 twice a week for 5 consecutive weeks starting at 1 week after collagenase injection; in the OA group (n= 7), the same knee was injected with the same amount of <b>physiological</b> normal <b>saline.</b> In the MgSO 4 group (n= 6), naïve rats received only MgSO 4 injections; in the control group (n= 6), naïve rats received only <b>physiological</b> normal <b>saline</b> injections. Nociceptive behavior (mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia) on OA development was measured before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after collagenase injection, following which the animals were sacrificed. Gross morphology and histopathology were examined in the femoral condyles, tibial plateau, and synovia. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to examine the effect of MgSO 4 on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 1 phosphorylation (p-NR 1) and apoptosis in the articular cartilage chondrocytes. ResultsOA rats receiving intra-articular MgSO 4 injections showed a significantly lower degree of cartilage degeneration than the rats receiving saline injections. MgSO 4 treatment also suppressed synovitis. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia showed significant improvement in the OA+MgSO 4 group as compared to the OA group. Moreover, MgSO 4 attenuated p-NR 1 and chondrocyte apoptosis in OA-affected cartilage. ConclusionsOur results indicate that local intra-articular administration of MgSO 4 following collagenase injection in an experimental rat OA model (1) modulates chondrocyte metabolism through inhibition of cell NMDA receptor phosphorylation and apoptosis, (2) attenuates the development of OA, and (3) concomitantly reduces nociception...|$|R
40|$|Elevation of {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) {{is essential}} for platelet function. Despite the established role of shear stress in haemostasis and thrombosis, the possible contribution of mechanosensitive (MS) Ca 2 +-permeable ion channels to platelet activation remains unknown. One well-established Ca 2 +-permeable ion channel which enhances platelet responses at high shear is the ATP-gated P 2 X 1 channel. The relative contribution of this channel to platelet function was studied following the activation of the FcγRIIa immune receptor. qRT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that human platelets and a megakaryocytic cell line, Meg- 01, express the MS cation channel Piezo 1. To investigate Ca 2 +-permeable MS channel activity, single platelets and Meg- 01 cells were loaded with the Ca 2 + indicator Fluo- 3, and exposed to arterial shear in flow chambers which induced increases in [Ca 2 +]i in both cell types in <b>physiological</b> <b>salines.</b> The MS channel blocker GsMTx- 4 inhibited these responses and reduced thrombus formation over collagen, whereas Piezo 1 channel agonist Yoda 1 potentiated platelet shear-induced Ca 2 + transients. In Fura- 2 -loaded platelet suspensions, the GsMTx- 4 -sensitive shear-evoked responses were shown to be independent of P 2 X 1, Orai 1 and TRPC 6. FcγRIIa-mediated [Ca 2 +]i elevations and aggregation were monitored using ratiometric [Ca 2 +]i measurements and light transmission, respectively. The contribution of P 2 X 1 channels was assessed following inhibition by NF 449, and inactivation by pre-addition of α,β-meATP or apyrase exclusion. These treatments significantly reduced antibody- or bacteria-induced FcγRIIa-mediated responses, indicating a significant P 2 X 1 channel contribution. Phosphorylation assays indicated that P 2 X 1 amplifies FcγRIIa-mediated responses via direct Ca 2 + influx, rather than via a feedforward effect on early tyrosine phosphorylation. In conclusion, this thesis provides evidence that platelets express functional MS Piezo 1 channels which can provide a direct route for Ca 2 + entry under normal and pathological arterial shear, and contribute to thrombus formation. Additionally, P 2 X 1 channels were shown to amplify FcγRIIa-mediated platelet Ca 2 + signalling and aggregation, which can contribute to platelet activation under shear in infective endocarditis...|$|R

40|$|Sol–gel {{coatings}} which elute bioactive silver ions {{are presented}} as a potential {{solution to the problem}} of biofilm formation on indwelling surfaces. There is evidence that high-temperature processing of such materials can lead to diffusion of silver away from the coating surface, reducing the amount of available silver. In this study, we report the biofilm inhibition of a Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm using a low-temperature processed silver-doped phenyltriethoxysilane sol–gel coating. The incorporation of a silver salt into a sol–gel matrix resulted in an initial high release of silver in de-ionised water and <b>physiological</b> buffered <b>saline</b> (PBS), followed by a lower sustained release for at least 6 days—as determined by graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS). The release of silver ions from the sol–gel coating reduced the adhesion and prevented formation of a S. epidermidis biofilm over a 10 -day period. The presence of surface silver before and after 24 h immersion in PBS was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

50|$|The {{difference}} between osmolarity and molarity {{can be easily}} explained by an example. A <b>physiological</b> <b>saline</b> solution {{can be made by}} 9 g of sodium chloride dissolved in 1 liter of water, or 50 grams of glucose in 1 liter. Salt has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol, glucose of 180.15 g/mol. 50 grams of glucose results in 278 millimoles of glucose. 9 g of sodium chloride correspond to 154 millimoles of sodium chloride. The osmolarity of the solution of sodium chloride, however, is 308 milliosmoles / liter. This difference is due to the number of particles after solvation: one molecule of sodium chloride in water splits into two ions. Glucose, however, remains one molecule after dissolvation. As a result, the osmolarity of 50 g of glucose in 1 liter of water is approximately equal to 9 g of sodium chloride in 1 liter of water.|$|E

Considering the effects of these and other (i. e., Cd and Ni) ion channel blockers, we conclude that: 1) the higher frequency locus reflects conduction by voltage-sensitive ion channels in the axolemmal membrane, which contains at least four ion channels selective for sodium, calcium, and potassium (delayed rectifier and calcium-dependent), and 2) the lower frequency locus reflects voltage-insensitive channels in the septal membrane, which separates adjacent MGFs...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{possible variations}} of impedance values in samples of sodium chloride solution (sodium chloride 0. 9 %) with glucose at different concentrations, ranging from 5000 to around 75 [*]mg/dL. The sodium chloride solution (either <b>saline</b> <b>physiological</b> solution) was chosen {{since it has}} similarities to blood but no cell components, which may be confounding factors in this study. Special focus was {{on the effect of}} stirring and of temperature variations on the impedance spectrum of samples at different glucose concentrations. We found that variations in glucose concentration directly affect the impedance modulus of the sample both in static conditions and in dynamic conditions due to stirring, as well as at both room temperature and at increased temperature. In fact, even if the impedance variations were often small (around 3 - 4 [*]mΩ per mg/dL), they were usually clearly measurable. These findings may be the basis for possible development of a new approach, based on impedance technology, for the noninvasive monitoring of glycaemia...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ameliorative effect of Lawsonia inermis Linn used traditionally against trypanosomosis. Twenty-five adult Wistar rats of both sex were individually infected intraperitoneally (IP) with 106 Trypanosoma congolense per ml of blood. Following establishment of infection, the rats were randomly divided into five groups of 5 rats each. Rats in groups I, II, and III were treated with 125, 250 and 500  mg/kg of the extract, respectively, while rats in groups IV and V were treated with 3. 5  mg/kg and 2  ml/kg of diminazene aceturate (DM) once and <b>physiological</b> buffered <b>saline,</b> respectively. All treatments except DM were given orally for 7  days IP. The antitrypanosomal effect of the plant was assessed by observing the level of parasitaemia daily, packed cell volume (PCV) weekly, erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration on day 21. Phytochemical screening of the extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, carbohydrates, triterpenes, steroids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, tannins and flavonoids. The extract significantly (P    0. 05) in extract treated groups but significantly higher (P <  0. 05) in group II at week 2 when compared to group V. Rats in group II had significantly lower values of EOF and MDA when compared with groups IV and V. Thus, the leaf of L. inermis has in addition to an antitrypanosomal effect against T. congolense in rats, an attenuating effect on the trypanosomosis pathology probably mediated via protection of the erythrocyte membrane against trypanosome-induced oxidative damage to the erythrocytes...|$|R
