On 12October, United States and Argus parted from the {{squadron}} {{for their own}} patrols. On 10October, President chased , but failed to overtake her. On 17October President captured the British packet ship Swallow, which carried {{a large amount of}} currency on board. On 31October, <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> began pursuit of , which was escorting two merchant ships. The chase lasted about three hours, and in that time Congress captured the merchant ship Argo. Meanwhile, President kept after Galatea and drew very close, but lost sight of her in the night. Congress and President remained together, but did not find any ships to capture during November. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the Virginia capes; they arrived in Boston on 31December, having taken nine prizes. <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> found themselves blockaded there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v.

Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E

By June, not having come across a single ship, President turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway, on 27June to replenish her drinking water. Sailing soon after, President captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores. On 10 June President captured the outward-bound Falmouth packet Duke of Montrose, Captain Aaron Groub Blewett, which managed to throw her mails overboard before President could send a prize crew aboard. President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of Presidents prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth {{under the command of}} an American officer. When Duke of Montrose arrived at Falmouth the British Government abrogated the cartel {{on the grounds that they}} had advised the American Government that the British would not recognize agreements entered into on the high seas.|$|E

25|$|Later on {{election}} night, after Obama {{was named the}} winner, he picked up several more wins in swing states in which the polls had shown a close race. These included Florida, Indiana, Virginia, and the western states of Colorado and Nevada. All of these states had been carried by Bush in 2004. North Carolina and the bellwether state of Missouri remained undecided for several days. Eventually Obama was declared the winner in North Carolina and McCain in Missouri, with Obama pulling out a rare win in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district. This put the projected electoral vote count at 365 for Obama and 173 for McCain. Obama's victories in the populous swing states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia contributed to his decisive win. The presidential electors cast their ballots for President and Vice <b>President,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> tallied these votes on January 8, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Concerning Reconstruction, the <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> {{were deeply}} divided. Johnson, {{even when his}} amnesty policy had come under heavy criticism, had obdurately {{supported}} and continued it. Radical Republicans in Congress, however, came to prefer Stanton's military occupation proposal. The President's support from moderate Republicans dwindled after the gruesome anti-Negro riots in Memphis and New Orleans. The public seemed to be against Johnson as well. In the 1866 congressional elections, Republicans made sweeping gains on their Democratic rivals. In both the House and Senate elections, Republicans gained a two-thirds plurality of the seats. In the new year, some Republicans sought to use their majority to oust Johnson. They presented the Tenure of Office Bill, written with Stanton in mind. The President had long considered dismissing Stanton and replacing him with Maj. Gen. Sherman; the Tenure of Office Bill would have made this illegal without the advice and consent of Congress, which was unlikely to be given for Stanton, who was firmly supported by and cooperating with Radical Republicans. When the bill reached the President's desk, he vetoed it. His veto was overridden the same day.|$|E

25|$|Congressional {{and local}} {{support for the}} {{redevelopment}} of Lafayette Square waned significantly. Over the next few years, the <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress</b> established several new agencies to supervise the approval, design, and construction of new buildings in the District of Columbia: The Commission of Fine Arts in 1910 (to approve the design of new structures), the Public Buildings Commission in 1916 (to make recommendations regarding the housing of federal agencies and offices), and the National Capital Parks and Planning Commission in 1924 (to oversee planning for the District). In the mid-1910s, Congress appropriated and the government spent $7 million to acquire land on Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th and 15th Streets NW and several blocks south. But no demolition or construction was conducted, and the government merely collected rent from the tenants in the area. In 1924, the Public Buildings Commission recommended that {{a new series of}} federal office buildings be built near the White House. The plan called for a complex of buildings to be built at Murder Bay—a muddy, flood-prone, malaria-ridden, poverty-stricken region lacking in paved roads, sewer system, and running water and almost exclusively home to numerous brothels and an extensive criminal underclass.|$|E
25|$|On March 25, 1965, President Johnson issued Executive Order No. 11210, which {{established}} the Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Temporary Commission {{was charged with}} analyzing the engineering, financial, planning, and other relevant considerations essential to ensuring the adoption {{and implementation of the}} 1964 master plan, as well as recommending appropriate legislation to the <b>President</b> <b>and</b> <b>Congress.</b> The Temporary Commission was also instructed to coordinate its efforts with the National Capital Planning Commission's master plan for the city. The Temporary Commission was an interim measure designed to ensure that no buildings incompatible with the plan were built until legislation regarding the master plan was passed. Although certain aspects of the master plan were controversial among some groups, the District of Columbia enacted zoning changes to permit mixed-used development and buildings which conformed to the Owings plan in April 1965. Construction of the first private building under the master plan, 451 12th Street NW, began in August 1965. Legislation to make the Temporary Commission permanent and give it extensive powers was introduced in October 1965, but strong opposition to the proposed National Plaza emerged and hindered passage of the bill. The size of the plaza remained intact into late 1967, and a large new arts and office building (to be built between 11th and 13th Streets NW on E Street NW) was proposed.|$|E
