40|$|ABSTRACT According to David Lewis, {{alteration}} is "qualitative {{difference between}} temporal <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>something.</b> " It follows that moments, {{since they are}} simple and lack temporal parts, cannot alter from future to present to past. Here then {{is another way to}} put McTaggart's paradox about change in tense. I will appeal to my theory of Aspects to rebut the thought behind this rendition of McTaggart. On my theory, it is possible that qualitatively differing things be numerically identical. I call these differing, numerically identical things "aspects. " I will argue that alteration can be a qualitative difference between temporal aspects <b>of</b> <b>something</b> that lacks temporal parts. So a moment can alter in tense. By rejecting Lewis's assumption my theory can solve this version of McTaggart's paradox...|$|R

500|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza, Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening, and Ushkowitz, from the Broadway revival of The King and I. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. Colfer had no previous professional experience, but reminded Ryan {{of the character of}} Kurt from The Sound of Music, and was thus cast as Kurt Hummel. He originally auditioned for Artie with the song [...] "Mr. Cellophane", however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him.

50|$|Peinado {{could be}} {{described}} as a disc jockey with his continue use of samplers: smileys, disco balls, surf and skateboards, Tetris or Rubik's cube blocks and such are recurrent images in his works. His bootleg-session type of proposals also references pop, minimalist and suprematism art. By twisting these now-iconic images through juxtaposition, they become <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> new, making a kind of a complex organic system, a parallel world within the exhibition space, rather like a snow globe shaken by artificial weather in a self-contained landscape. Peinado's multidirectional works comment on each other, much as pop culture does with itself, and even the simplest sculpture or image may hold a wide variety of meanings in his hands. For example, one of his best known pieces, One Big World, 2001, representing a Michelin Man posing like a black panther, spoke about the employees firing that the company was heading at the time. On the other hand, by turning the white character into a black one, Peinado acknowledge the real color of tires and the fact that international companies would never have an African originated man representing them.|$|R

BuzzFeed's Aylin Zafar described [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as [...] "an anthem for anyone who has ever felt they were on the outside, looking into a place ... that they yearned to be a part of."

500|$|The album's title, Nimrod, is {{the name}} of a {{character}} from the Bible that in American English became a term for a stupid or dimwitted person. After three art directors were rejected by the band and pressing was behind schedule, Green Day asked the help of Chris Bilheimer, a friend of Armstrong who had done covers for another group signed by Warner Bros. Records, R.E.M. Having just the album title to work on, Bilheimer had some ideas, with the one that went through being inspired by a photograph Bilheimer saw, where a politician’s poster had had his face removed. He felt the image was [...] "striking" [...] and seemed to fit the band by featuring [...] "a typical middle-age male, corporate politician American kind of guy, and someone had completely taken his identity away through vandalism." [...] Following that line of thought, Bilheimer took an encyclopedia picture of men in suits and ties and put colored circles reading [...] "nimrod."

500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

Something and other {{at the moment of}} limit show themselves as finite, since they both negate each other as the negation of negation.
