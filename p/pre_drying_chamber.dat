When required preserve food for a time, a dry or dehydrate alternative is removing the water contained therein. There are several ways to achieve this issue, the simplest is to exposed the food into a stream of air with certain conditions of temperature, humidity and velocity. There are several types of solar dryers to achieve proper product treatment. The two basic elements of a solar dryer are manifold where solar radiation heats the air and the <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> where the product is dried by the air passing through it, these elements can be designed to integrate the team in different forms. In an indirect solar dryer the two elements are separated, the air is heated in the manifold so that no solar radiation incident on the product placed inside the opaque <b>drying</b> <b>chamber,</b> in this type of dryers the process control drying is simpler. Having a separate <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> manifolds facilitates handling of the product and the work of loading and unloading. Since the <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> is opaque, this system conveniently dry products that can be damaged by direct sunlight. This project works with an indirect solar dryer having a solar air heater built into its structure with plywood wood 1 ‚Äù thick, both the base and sides, with dimensions of 140 cm long and 60 cm width, a cover glass thickness of 3 mm and an inclination of 17. 5 ¬∞ to the horizontal. The main element is a coil of copper foil matt black painted placed inside the structure, isolated base and on all four sides with fiberglass wool, has thirteen channels 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm, which means a final length of 5 m in the warm air path, giving a conservative 0. 01 m 3 /s flow and a 1 m/s natural convection speed. The <b>drying</b> <b>chamber</b> is constructed of plywood wood ¬Ω‚Äù thickness and dimensions of 60 cm long, 40 cm wide and 55 cm high with four nylon mesh trays, allowing initial drying mass about 2 kg.
