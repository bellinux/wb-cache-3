50|$|As an {{original}} worker, Kundt was especially {{successful in the}} domains of sound and light. In 1866, he developed a valuable method for the investigation of aerial waves within pipes, {{based on the fact}} that a finely divided powder, lycopodium for example, when dusted over the interior of a tube in which is established a vibrating column of air, tends to collect in heaps at the nodes, the distance between which can thus be ascertained. An extension of the method renders possible the determination of the velocity of sound in different gases. This experimental apparatus is called a Kundt's Tube. In 1876 at Strasbourg in collaboration with Emil Warburg, Kundt proved that mercury vapour is a monatomic gas. In light, Kundt's name is widely known for his inquiries in anomalous dispersion, not only in liquids and vapours, but even in metals, which he obtained in very thin films by means of a laborious process of electrolytic deposition upon <b>platinized</b> <b>glass.</b> He also carried out many experiments in magneto-optics, and succeeded in showing what Faraday had failed to detect, the rotation under the influence of magnetic force of the plane of polarization in certain gases and vapours.|$|E
40|$|Lead based relaxor {{ferroelectric}} {{thin films}} {{have been of}} technological importance due to excellent properties for several commercial applications. However subtleness and high cost of fabrication have plagued of these materials. In this work a systematic study of PMN-PT thin films grown on LCMO buffered <b>platinized</b> <b>glass</b> substrates has been undertaken. The films were grown at room temperature using RF magnetron sputtering. Single phase PMN-PT films could be obtained by exsitu thermal annealing in air for 2 h at temperatures 550 and 650 degree C. The films annealed at temperatures lower than 550 degree C and films without buffer layer showed presence of pyrochlore. Effect of annealing temperature on the microstructure, dielectric and ferroelectric properties of the PMN-PT films has been investigated. Scanning electron micrographs of single phase PMN-PT films show a bimodal grain size distribution for films annealed at 550 and 650 degree C. A high dielectric constant of 1300 and a remnant polarization (2 Pr) of 17 micro C/cm 2 were observed for film annealed at 650 degree C...|$|E
40|$|According to {{classical}} electrodynamics, sunlight that is passed through an iron layer {{can be detected}} {{with the naked eye}} only if the thickness of the layer is less than 170 nm. However, in an old experiment, August Kundt was able to see the sunlight with the naked eye even when it had passed an iron layer with thickness greater than 200 nm. To explain this observation, we propose a second kind of light which was introduced in a different context by Abdus Salam. A tabletop experiment can verify this possibility. August Kundt [1] passed sunlight through red glass, a polarizing Nicol, and <b>platinized</b> <b>glass</b> which was covered by an iron layer. The entire experimental setup was placed within a magnetic field. With the naked eye, Kundt measured the Faraday rotation of the polarization plane generated by the transmission of the sunlight through the iron layer. His result was a constant maximum rotation of the polarization plane per length of 418, 000 ◦ /cm or 1 ◦ per 23. 9 nm. He verified this result until thicknesses of up to 210 nm and rotations of up to 9 ◦. In one case, on a very clear day, he observed the penetrating sunlight for rotations of up to 12 ◦. Unfortunately, he has not given the thickness of this particular iron layer he used. But if his result of a constant maximum rotation per length can be applied, then the corresponding layer thickness was ∼ 290 nm. Let us recapitulate some classical electrodynamics to determine the behavior of light within iron. The penetration depth of light in a conductor is δ = λ, (1) 2 πγ where the wavelength in vacuum can be expressed by its frequency according to λ = 1 / √ ν 2 ε 0 µ 0. The extinction coefficient is γ = n ⎡ (...|$|E

40|$|We present novel sea-urchin-like ZnO {{nanoparticles}} synthesized using {{a chemical}} solution method. Solution approaches to synthesizing ZnO nanostructures have several advantages including low growth temperatures and high potential for scaling up. We investigated {{the influence of}} reaction times on the thickness and morphology of sea-urchin-like ZnO nanoparticles, and XRD patterns show strong intensity in every direction. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were developed using the synthesized ZnO nanostructures as photoanodes. The DSSCs comprised a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass with dense ZnO nanostructures as the working electrode, a <b>platinized</b> FTO <b>glass</b> as the counter electrode, N 719 -based dye, and I-/I 3 -liquid electrolyte. The DSSC fabricated using such nanostructures yielded a high power conversion efficiency of 1. 16 % with an incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) as high as 15. 32 %. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to investigate the characteristics of DSSCs. An improvement in the electron transport in the ZnO photoanode was also observed...|$|R
