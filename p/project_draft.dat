50|$|On 27 March 1985 SFR {{presented}} the Transport Department {{with a new}} <b>project</b> <b>draft.</b> This was met with a positive response from the political parties and associations; the Neue Zürcher Zeitung called the concept attractive, flexible and evolutionary. The aim of the concept was to connect the main hub stations {{in less than an}} hour (particularly Zürich, Bern and Lausanne) so that trains could arrive before the hour or half hour and depart again shortly thereafter. Trains therefore would have to run as fast as necessary to meet this object, not as fast as possible.|$|E
5000|$|The loan (and {{eventual}} grant) of {{the majority}} of RM2 funds from DRC to WSX meant that construction would not start on DRC as scheduled. Although an administrative draft of the <b>project</b> <b>draft</b> environmental impact statement (DEIS) was completed in late 2009, the detailed engineering studies kept forecasting increased cost and decreased projected ridership. By 2010, the estimated cost of DRC had increased again to [...] Besides the increased cost estimates, other issues had emerged, including negotiations with Union Pacific to reroute freight traffic onto the Niles subdivision and purchase of the Oakland subdivision for DRC service. In addition, the alignment of the proposed California High-Speed Rail service was still wavering between the Altamont Pass (which would route HSR over the Dumbarton Cut-off) and the Pacheco Pass (which would route HSR through San Jose up the Peninsula Corridor to San Francisco).|$|E

5000|$|The {{establishment}} of the new regime had resulted in the reorganization of the Neapolitan armed forces and the reform also involved training institutions. Consequently, the Nunziatella {{was hit by a}} decree of suppression as a military college; nevertheless it remained active in the building of Pizzofalcone as a school of theoretical and practical artillery, which served as a point of leverage for the reopening of the college. Interior Minister André-François Miot asked the inspector general of artillery Giuseppe Fonseca Chavez to submit a project dedicated to that end: the plan, presented May 10, 1806, proposed Nunziatella to be the only recruitment institute for the four Armies, like it was before 1799. Giuseppe Parisi himself wrote a <b>project</b> <b>draft</b> for Fonseca, proposing a [...] "decree on the formation of the Military Academy." [...] Under the new system they would be admitted to the Nunziatella 160 students aged 11 to 14 and 60 day students 15 years of age. The management would be guaranteed by 62 employees (24 officers, three administrative, 2 priests, 4 health, 19 professors and 10 masters), waiters, sergeants, Trabants and 10 horses. A total of 50 among the students would be selected for the school of application of artillery and engineering.Parisi's proposal was seconded by the one prepared by Vito Caravelli, a former professor of Nunziatella, that through Parisi transmitted it to the minister of war Mathieu Dumas, establishing school programs for science, design, Italian, French, English and practical training.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{decade since}} the {{publication}} of the Human Genome <b>Project</b> <b>draft</b> has ended with the discovery of hundreds of genomic markers related to diseases and phenotypes. However, the project has not yet delivered on its promise to tailor treatments for individuals. The number of genomic markers in clinical practice is very small. The number of markers to guide treatment decisions is even smaller. In order to speed up discovery and validation of genomic treatment selection markers, we call for considering the brilliant potential of randomized clinical trials. If biomedical research community can collaborate in organizing large-scale consortium of clinical trials associated with well-designed biobanks, these studies would soon act as huge laboratories for investigating genomic medicine; a big step forward towards personalizing medicine...|$|E

The next key step is uniform and consistent application of the Guidance.

40|$|This project {{examined}} local perceptions {{regarding the}} factors that contributed to community vitality or the lack thereof during {{the decade of the}} 1990 s in order to provide lessons learned, best practices and innovative ideas for other community leaders in Iowa and other states. Researchers identified eight non-metro communities ranging in population from 1, 100 to 11, 000. Two communities of similar size were selected from each regional quadrant of the state. One of the two communities from each quadrant exceeded the state average population growth rate for the decade of the 1990 s. The other lost population. An interdisciplinary assessment team conducted on-site interviews with a cross-section of local leaders from local government, economic development, education, and healthcare in each community. A total of 75 community leaders from the eight communities were interviewed for this <b>project.</b> <b>Draft</b> reports were developed from field notes and local interviewees were given an opportunity to review the drafts for their community prior to publication.

40|$|This site {{observational}} {{work plan}} (SOWP) {{is one of}} the first Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Ground Water Project documents developed to select a compliance strategy that meets the UMTRA ground water standards for the Grand Junction site. This SOWP applies information about the Grand Junction site to the compliance strategy selection framework developed in the UMTRA Ground Water <b>Project</b> <b>draft</b> programmatic environmental impact statement. This risk-based, decision-making framework identifies the decision logic for selecting compliance strategies that could be used to meet the ground water standards. The US Department of Energy (DOE) goal is to implement a cost-effective site strategy that complies with the ground water standards and protects human health and the environment. Based on an evaluation of the site characterization and risk assessment data available for the preparation of this SOWP, DOE proposes that the most likely compliance strategy for the Grand Junction site is no remediation with the application of supplemental standards. This proposed strategy is based on a conceptual site model that indicates site-related contamination is confined to a limited-use aquifer as defined in the ground water standards. The conceptual model demonstrates that the uranium processing-related contamination at the site has affected the unconfined alluvial aquifer, but not the deeper confined aquifer...|$|E
