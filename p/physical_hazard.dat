More powerful armour-piercing weapons were required, so the casemates were provided with four 12.5-inch and thirteen 11-inch RMLs with a range of about [...] A further three 9-inch RMLs were emplaced in the open battery. They were mounted on metal traversing platforms that could be elevated and traversed using hand-operated gearing devices. Operating the guns presented significant challenges; the 12.5-inch RMLs weighed up to [...] apiece, used a charge weighing [...] to fire a shell weighing [...] to their maximum range, and broke windows half a mile away when they were fired. The detonations and clouds of choking black smoke generated when firing them presented a serious <b>physical</b> <b>hazard</b> to the gun crews.|$|E
2500|$|One Bayfront Plaza was {{originally}} proposed as a [...] office and hotel tower. The design included [...] of office space, a 650-room hotel and a 3,000 space parking garage. However, {{due to the}} height limits for buildings in downtown Miami {{and the possibility of}} interference with aviation traffic going into and coming out of Miami International Airport, it was unlikely that the building would be approved for construction with the proposed height. The FAA conducted hundreds of impact surveys in the downtown area and negotiated with many building developers during the mid-2000s boom to lower the planned heights of their buildings. One example is 900 Biscayne Boulevard, located just a few blocks {{to the north of the}} OBP site, which was reduced from [...] to [...] The FAA reasoned that the skyscrapers interfered with their radar, in addition to being a <b>physical</b> <b>hazard</b> to landing planes. The redesigned One Bayfront Plaza was approved at its exceptional height of 1,049 feet due to its determination by the city as a significant landmark and because it got a Major Use Special Permit (MUSP).|$|E

The songs chart their youthful heroines' transition from secure maternal households to the dangerous world of men and their violently possessive female kin, at whose hands the protagonists risk not merely rejection but sometimes mutilation or even death. The ballads speak of murderous sexual rivalry between female siblings and hint at infanticide {{as a form of}} revenge upon treacherous males. Adventures in the magical greenwood, a metaphor for transgressive sexuality, have a strong appeal but usually alarming consequences.
