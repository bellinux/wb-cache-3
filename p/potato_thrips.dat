50|$|Thrips tabaci is {{a species}} of very small insect in the genus Thrips in the order Thysanoptera. It is {{commonly}} known as the onion thrips, the <b>potato</b> <b>thrips,</b> the tobacco thrips or the cotton seedling thrips. It is an agricultural pest that can damage crops of onions and other plants, and it can additionally act as a vector for plant viruses.|$|E

TSWV is naturally spread to <b>potato</b> by <b>thrips</b> of which Thrips tabaci {{is the most}} important. Prior studies indicated possible non-preference of potato cultivars to T. tabaci. Select potato cultivars were assessed for non-preference to T. tabaci in paired and group choice trials. Cultivars 'Bismark', 'Tasman' and 'King Edward' were less preferred than 'Atlantic', 'Russet Burbank' and 'Shepody'. Green leaf volatiles were sampled using solid-phase microextraction from the headspace of potato cultivars of two ages that differed in T. tabaci preference. Analysis of headspace volatile data using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves identified individual volatiles associated with T. tabaci preference and non-preference, young and old plants and individual cultivars. These data {{could be used to}} inform breeding programs for selection of T. tabaci resistance to assist with TSWV management, and biological testing of novel thrips management compounds...|$|R
50|$|In 1922 complete, concise {{and clear}} acts dealing with {{agriculture}} {{were placed on}} the Bermuda statute book; inspection of produce was initiated; and seed testing began. Local seedsmen were registered in 1923. Mr McCallan, the Agricultural Director reorganised the Agricultural Exhibition for 1923. Seed potatoes were gradually improved after much investigation with US experts. A local farmers' market started in 1923.For a year in 1921-23, Professor H H Whetzel of Cornell University advised remedies for the cash crop diseases of <b>potato</b> blight, onion <b>thrips,</b> celery leaf spot, lily Botritis, melon mildew etc. He suggested that the colony should appoint a full-time plant pathologist.|$|R
