5|$|With {{the choice}} of statues settled, a {{competition}} was run in Adelaide in 1903 to find the design for the <b>pedestal.</b> A total of 12 entries were received, with the submission by Garlick, Sibley and Wooldridge being selected as the winner. The <b>pedestal</b> is 12feet in height, and was constructed from granite quarried from {{the nearby town of}} Murray Bridge.|$|E

40|$|Bridge girder {{bearings}} rest on <b>pedestals</b> {{to transfer}} the loading safely to the pier headstock. In spite {{of the existence of}} industry guidelines, due to construction complexities, such guidelines are often overlooked. Further, there is paucity of research on the performance of <b>pedestals,</b> although their failure could cause exorbitant maintenance costs. Although reinforced concrete <b>pedestals</b> are recommended in the industry design guidelines, unreinforced concrete and/ or epoxy glue <b>pedestals</b> are provided due to construction issues; such <b>pedestals</b> fail within {{a very short period of}} service. With a view to understanding the response of <b>pedestals</b> subject to monotonic loading, a three-dimensional nonlinear explicit finite element micro-model of unreinforced and reinforced concrete <b>pedestals</b> has been developed. Contact and material nonlinearity have been accounted for in the model. It is shown that the unreinforced concrete <b>pedestals</b> suffer from localised edge stress singularities, the failure of which was comparable to those in the field. The reinforced concrete <b>pedestals,</b> on the other hand, distribute the loading without edge stress singularity, again conforming to the field experience...|$|R

40|$|Overheight vehicle {{impact to}} bridge decks {{is a major}} problem in the {{transportation}} networks in the United States. An important factor that causes this problem is inadequate vertical clearance of bridges. Using steel <b>pedestals</b> to elevate bridge decks is an efficient and cost-effective solution for this problem. So far, steel <b>pedestals</b> have been used in the low seismic regions of the United States and therefore, their design has been based on providing enough strength to carry vertical loads and the lateral behavior of bridges elevated with <b>pedestals</b> have not been a major concern. But even in low seismic zones the seismic hazard should not be completely ignored. Also there might be some bridges in medium or high seismic regions that need to be elevated {{because of the lack of}} enough vertical clearance and using steel <b>pedestals</b> can be considered as an option for elevating those bridges. To address the mentioned needs, this dissertation proposes a framework to determine the structural reliability of bridges elevated with steel <b>pedestals</b> by developing probabilistic capacity and demand models for the slab-on-girder bridges subjected to lateral loads. This study first compares the behavior of previously tested <b>pedestals</b> with the behavior of elastomeric bearings in low seismic regions using statistical tests. Then, to provide a general framework, which can be applied to all bridges that are elevated with steel <b>pedestals,</b> this dissertation develops probabilistic capacity and demand models for steel <b>pedestals</b> considering all the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties of the problem. Using the developed probabilistic models along with the available models for other components of bridges, seismic fragility curves for elevated bridges are obtained and used to determine the structural reliability. Finally, this study uses the developed framework in a decision analysis that helps the engineering community and decision makers to check if the installation of steel <b>pedestals</b> on a specific bridge has financial justification or not. Results show that for a typical two-span slab-on-girder bridge, the use of steel <b>pedestals</b> has financial justification only in low seismic regions and if the societal benefits of elevating the bridge can at least cover the installation cost of <b>pedestals...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, the Parliamentary {{authorities}} undertook a three-week conservation project to repair and restore the statue. It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax, repatinating the bronze surface to return it to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on the <b>pedestal</b> were also cleaned and treated, as was the <b>pedestal</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|It {{stands on}} a granite <b>pedestal</b> also {{designed}} by Marochetti and made by Freeman & Co. of Penryn, Cornwall. Bas-relief panels showing Crusaders fighting the Saracens at the Battle of Ascalon and Richard on his deathbed pardoning Bertran de Born, the archer who fatally shot him in 1199, {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the <b>pedestal</b> in 1866–67. As the statue cannot be accessed by the general public – the area around it is used as the House of Lords car park – the west-side scene showing Richard and Bertran is the only one visible from the street. According to Marochetti, the two bas-reliefs were designed in the style of Lorenzo Ghiberti's doors at the Florence Baptistry. Bronze letters {{on the front of the}} <b>pedestal</b> bear the inscription RICHARD I CŒUR DE LION / 1189–1199.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. Low-carbon corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the <b>pedestal</b> or statue, showing off various details. Access to the <b>pedestal,</b> which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the <b>pedestal.</b> An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Amenemhat IV is {{responsible}} for the completion of a shrine at the temple of Hathor in the Sinai and may also have undertaken works in Karnak where a <b>pedestal</b> for a sacred barque inscribed with Amenemhat III and IV names was found in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the <b>pedestal</b> was not {{completed}} until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete <b>pedestal</b> and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the <b>pedestal,</b> {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate <b>pedestal</b> for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that <b>pedestal</b> for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

The monument is a bronze figure of Benavides on a <b>pedestal</b> facing the old campus in Intramuros. The base of the statue has the name of the sculptor and year of the make: Tony Noël, 1889. The <b>pedestal</b> was decorated with the seals of the Dominican Order and the university, as well as plaques on which were written the history of UST and a brief biography of the archbishop.|$|E
40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli O 157 :H 7 (EHEC) form {{characteristic}} lesions on infected mammalian cells called actin <b>pedestals.</b> Each {{of these}} two pathogens injects its own translocated intimin receptor (Tir) molecule into the plasma membranes of host cells. Interaction of translocated Tir with the bacterial outer membrane protein intimin is required to trigger the assembly of actin into focused <b>pedestals</b> beneath bound bacteria. Despite similarities between the Tir molecules and the host components that associate with <b>pedestals,</b> recent work indicates that EPEC and EHEC Tir are not functionally interchangeable. For EPEC, Tir-mediated binding of Nck, a host adaptor protein implicated in actin signaling, is both necessary and sufficient to initiate actin assembly. In contrast, for EHEC, <b>pedestals</b> are formed independently of Nck, and require translocation of bacterial factors in addition to Tir to trigger actin signaling...|$|R
