5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by <b>Pete</b> <b>Domenici</b> in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|On March 5, 2008, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1424, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007, {{by a vote}} of 268-148. It was {{sponsored}} by Representatives Patrick Kennedy (D-Rhode Island) and Representative Jim Ramstad, (R-Minnesota), both of whom are recovering alcoholics. The narrower Senate bill S. 558, passed earlier, was introduced by Kennedy's father, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Massachusetts), <b>Pete</b> <b>Domenici,</b> (R-New Mexico), and Mike Enzi, (R-Wyoming).|$|E

The concept was that unnecessary spending (which is hard to define in a law) can be taxed by taxing income minus all net investments and savings, and minus an allowance for essential purchases, thus making funds available for investment.|$|E
25|$|While Senator <b>Pete</b> <b>Domenici</b> had {{declared}} that he would seek re-election in New Mexico, {{he changed his mind}} and announced on October 4, 2007 that he was retiring {{at the end of his}} current term due to a degenerative brain disorder. Domenici normally would have been expected to win re-election easily, having won his current term with the support of two out of three New Mexico voters; however, he is to be investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for his role in firing U.S. Attorney David Iglesias. Domenici's role in the developing scandal had reduced the probability he would have been re-elected, and a SurveyUSA poll showed his approval ratings at 41%, with 54% disapproving. The potential scandal may have also contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.|$|E

[...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator <b>Pete</b> <b>Domenici</b> thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress.

500|$|Congress {{eventually}} {{passed a}} watered-down {{version of the}} original plan put forward by Bedell and Senator <b>Pete</b> <b>Domenici.</b> The compromise version enacted a tax on the gasoline barges used {{and put it into}} a [...] "trust" [...] for waterway projects. While other supporters of waterway usage fees, including Domenici, backed the compromise, Bedell gave a passioned plea for his colleagues to oppose it. He viewed it as lacking a crucial element of the original plan - that of capital recovery. The trust was optional, and the Government could spend money on waterway projects irrespective of the trust. The compromise was eventually signed by Jimmy Carter. Bedell's original plan never made it through the House of Representatives, but he continued to introduce it in succeeding sessions. It would not, however, get a floor vote in succeeding sessions.|$|E

Due to serving alongside Domenici, the longest-serving Senator in New Mexico's history, Bingaman spent 26 years as New Mexico's junior Senator, {{though he had}} more seniority than {{all but a few}} of his colleagues.

Anderson said he was fascinated [...] "to see that word [...] among all this official testimony and terminology" [...] to explain the complicated process of oil drainage. In 2013, an independent attempt to locate the statement in Fall's testimony proved unsuccessful—an article published in the Case Western Reserve Law Review suggested that the actual source of the paraphrased quote may instead have been remarks in 2003 by Sen. <b>Pete</b> <b>Domenici</b> of New Mexico during a debate over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
