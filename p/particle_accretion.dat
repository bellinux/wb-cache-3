40|$|Modelling AGN {{feedback}} in numerical simulations is both technically and theoretically challenging, {{with numerous}} approaches having {{been published in}} the literature. We present a study of five distinct approaches to modelling AGN feedback within gravitohydrodynamic simulations of major mergers of Milky Way-sized galaxies. To constrain differences to only be between AGN feedback models, all simulations start from the same initial conditions and use the same star formation algorithm. Most AGN feedback algorithms have five key aspects: black hole accretion rate, energy feedback rate and method, <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> algorithm, black hole advection algorithm, and black hole merger algorithm. All models follow different accretion histories, with accretion rates that differ by up to three orders of magnitude at any given time. We consider models with either thermal or kinetic feedback, with the associated energy deposited locally around the black hole. Each feedback algorithm modifies the gas properties near the black hole to different extents. The <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> algorithms usually (but not always) maintain good agreement between the mass accreted by Ṁ dt and the mass of gas particles removed from the simulation. The black hole advection algorithms dampen inappropriate dragging of the black holes by two-body interactions. Advecting the black hole a limited distance based upon local mass distributions has many desirably properties. The black holes merge when given criteria are met, and we find a range of merger times for different criteria. Using the M_BH-σ relation as a diagnostic of the remnants yields three models that lie within the one-sigma scatter of the observed relation and two that fall below it. The wide variation in accretion behaviours of the models reinforces the fact that there remains much to be learnt about the evolution of galactic nuclei.

The results indicate that astrophysical accretion flows can be partitioned into distinct classes depending upon whether the accretion rate lies above or below a critical value of a few times 10 to the - 7 th stellar masses/yr. When the particle transport is convection-dominated, both classes of accretion flows exhibit a spectral index appropriate for first-order Fermi acceleration at a plane shock {{in the absence of}} losses.

40|$|We {{carry out}} {{radiation}} hydrodynamical simulations {{of the formation}} of massive stars in the super-Eddington regime including both their radiative feedback and protostellar outflows. The calculations start from a prestellar core of dusty gas and continue until the star stops growing. The accretion ends when the remnants of the core are ejected, mostly by the force of the direct stellar radiation in the polar direction and elsewhere by the reradiated thermal infrared radiation. How long the accretion persists depends on whether the protostellar outflows are present. We set the mass outflow rate to 1 % of the stellar sink <b>particle's</b> <b>accretion</b> rate. The outflows open a bipolar cavity extending to the core's outer edge, through which the thermal radiation readily escapes. The radiative flux is funneled into the polar directions while the core's collapse proceeds near the equator. The outflow thus extends the "flashlight effect", or anisotropic radiation field, found in previous studies from the few hundred AU scale of the circumstellar disk up to the 0. 1 parsec scale of the core. The core's flashlight effect allows core gas to accrete on the disk for longer, {{in the same way that}} the disk's flashlight effect allows disk gas to accrete on the star for longer. Thus although the protostellar outflows remove material near the core's poles, causing slower stellar growth over the first few free-fall times, they also enable accretion to go on longer in our calculations. The outflows ultimately lead to stars of somewhat higher mass. Comment: accepted for publication at Ap...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2009 Royal Astronomical SocietyWe {{report the}} {{statistical}} properties of stars, brown dwarfs and multiple systems {{obtained from the}} largest hydrodynamical simulation of star cluster formation to date that resolves masses down to the opacity limit for fragmentation (a few Jupiter masses). The simulation is essentially identical to that of Bate, Bonnell & Bromm except that the initial molecular cloud is larger and more massive. It produces more than 1250 stars and brown dwarfs, providing unprecedented statistical {{information that can be}} compared with observational surveys. The calculation uses sink particles to model the stars and brown dwarfs. Part of the calculation is rerun with smaller sink <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> radii and gravitational softening to investigate the effect of these approximations on the results. We find that hydrodynamical/sink particle simulations can reproduce many of the observed stellar properties very well. Multiplicity {{as a function of the}} primary mass, the frequency of very low mass (VLM) binaries, general trends for the separation and mass ratio distributions of binaries and the relative orbital orientations of triples systems are all in reasonable agreement with observations. We also examine the radial variations of binarity, velocity dispersion and mass function in the resulting stellar cluster and the distributions of disc truncation radii due to dynamical interactions. For VLM binaries, because their separations are typically close, we find that their frequency is sensitive to the sink <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> radii and gravitational softening used in the calculations. Using small accretion radii and gravitational softening results in a frequency of VLM binaries similar to that expected from observational surveys (≈ 20 per cent). We also find that VLM binaries evolve from wide, unequal-mass systems towards close equal-mass systems as they form. The two main deficiencies of the calculations are that they overproduce brown dwarfs relative to stars and that there are too few unequal-mass binaries with K- and G-dwarf primaries. The former of these is likely due to the absence of radiative feedback and/or magnetic fields...|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from three cosmological simulations, only differing in gas metal-licity, {{that focus on}} the impact of metal fine-structure line cooling on stellar cluster {{formation}} in a high-redshift atomic cooling halo. Sink particles allow the process of gas hydrodynamics and accretion onto cluster stars to be followed for ∼ 4 Myr cor-responding to multiple local free-fall times. At metallicities at least 10 − 3 Z, gas is able to reach the CMB temperature floor and fragment pervasively resulting in a stel-lar cluster of size ∼ 1 pc and total mass ∼ 1000 M. The masses of individual sink particles vary, but are typically ∼ 100 M, consistent with the Jeans mass at TCMB, though some solar mass fragments are also produced. Below 10 − 4 Z, fragmentation is strongly suppressed on scales greater than 0. 01 pc and total stellar mass is lower by a factor of ∼ 3 than in the higher metallicity simulations. The sink <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> rates, and thus their masses, are determined by the mass of the gravitationally unsta-ble gas cloud and prolonged gas accretion over many Myr, exhibiting features of both monolithic collapse and competitive accretion.

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple model {{to predict the}} radial {{distribution}} of planetesimal formation. The model {{is based on the}} observed growth of dust to millimeter-sized particles, which drift radially, pile-up, and form planetesimals where the stopping time and dust-to-gas ratio intersect the allowed region for streaming instability-induced gravitational collapse. Using an approximate analytic treatment, we first show that drifting particles define a track in metallicity-stopping time space whose only substantial dependence is on the disk's angular momentum transport efficiency. Prompt planetesimal formation is feasible for high <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> rates (relative to the gas, (M) over dot(p) /(M) over dot greater than or similar to 3 x 10 (- 2) for alpha = 10 (- 2)), which could only be sustained for a limited period of time. If it is possible, it would lead to the deposition of a broad and massive belt of planetesimals with a sharp outer edge. Numerically including turbulent diffusion and vapor condensation processes, we find that a modest enhancement of solids near the snow line occurs for centimeter-sized particles, but that this is largely immaterial for planetesimal formation. We note that radial drift couples planetesimal formation across radii in the disk, and suggest that considerations of planetesimal formation favor a model in which the initial deposition of material for giant planet cores occurs well beyond the snow line...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of Desmoscolecoidea {{are characterized by}} ring-shaped accumulations of mineral particles on the cuticle resulting in {{the impression of a}} peculiar body articulation. Live observations made during the extraction of desmoscolecoids from mud sampled in the Swedish Gullmar fjord suggested new ideas pertinent to the <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> and the likely functional significance of the prominent rings. Undisturbed desmoscolecoids were observed to perform perpetual, vigorous, stationary undulations with their body. In our opinion these undulations affect the distribution of particles adhering to the cuticle by pushing them from soft, pliable cuticular sections to comparably stiff rings thus generating distinct concretion rings and naked interzones. The prominent concretion rings are assumed to increase positive mechanical effects of the undulations on the productivity of ubiquitous microbial populations residing on ambient sediment particles. The microbial production boosted by this kind of bioturbation may be of nutritional importance for the desmoscolecoids. An electron-microscopic investigation (TEM) of Tricoma sp. from the Gullmar fjord revealed the concretion rings to consist of stacks of clay mineral platelets in the submicrometer size range. A perusal through contributions of other authors suggests that such clay mineral aggregates are the basic component (granular component sensu Timm 1970) in the concretion rings of all desmoscolecoids. In a number of species these aggregates contain a specifically determined admixture ofconspicuous other mineral grains...|$|E
40|$|We {{implemented}} sink {{particles in}} the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamics code FLASH. Sink particles are created in regions of local gravitational collapse, and their trajectories and accretion can be followed over many dynamical times. We perform {{a series of tests}} including the time integration of circular and elliptical orbits, the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere and a rotating, fragmenting cloud core. We compare the collapse of a highly unstable singular isothermal sphere to the theory by Shu (1977), and show that the sink <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> rate is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. To model eccentric orbits and close encounters of sink particles accurately, we show that a very small timestep is often required, for which we implemented subcycling of the N-body system. We emphasize that a sole density threshold for sink particle creation is insufficient in supersonic flows, if the density threshold is below the opacity limit. In that case, the density can exceed the threshold in strong shocks that do not necessarily lead to local collapse. Additional checks for bound state, gravitational potential minimum, Jeans instability and converging flows are absolutely necessary for a meaningful creation of sink particles. We apply our new sink particle module for FLASH to the formation of a stellar cluster, and compare to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with sink particles. Our comparison shows encouraging agreement of gas properties, indicated by column density distributions and radial profiles, and of sink particle formation times and positions. We find excellent agreement in the number of sink particles formed, and in their accretion and mass distributions.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{migration}} of planetesimals {{in a young}} protoplanetary disc are fundamental to planet formation. In all models of early growth, there are several processes that can inhibit grains from reaching larger sizes. Nevertheless, observations suggest that growth of planetesimals must be rapid. If {{a small number of}} 100 km sized planetesimals do manage to form in the disc, then gas drag effects could enable them to efficiently accrete small solids from beyond their gravitationally focused cross-section. This gas drag-enhanced accretion can allow planetesimals to grow at rapid rates, in principle. We present self-consistent hydrodynamics simulations with direct particle integration and gas drag coupling to estimate the rate of planetesimal growth due to pebble accretion. Wind tunnel simulations are used to explore a range of particle sizes and disc conditions. We also explore analytic estimates of planetesimal growth and numerically integrate planetesimal drift due to the accretion of small solids. Our results show that, for almost every case that we consider, there is a clearly preferred <b>particle</b> size for <b>accretion</b> that depends on the properties of the accreting planetesimal and the local disc conditions. For solids much smaller than the preferred <b>particle</b> size, <b>accretion</b> rates are significantly reduced as the particles are entrained in the gas and flow around the planetesimal. Solids much larger than the preferred size accrete at rates consistent with gravitational focusing. Our analytic estimates for pebble accretion highlight the timescales that are needed for the growth of large objects under different disc conditions and initial planetesimal sizes.

This allows the investigation of internal structures in carbonate tablets and tower biocrystals in the nacre of mollusc shells, and it provides details on the calcite-aragonite polymorph interface in bivalves. Within the aragonite tablets of Mytilus edulis nacre we find a mesoscale crystallographic mosaic structure with a misorientation distribution of 2 full width at half maximum. Selective etching techniques with critical point drying reveal an organic matrix network inside the nacre tablets. The size scales of the visible aragonite tablet subunits and nanoparticles correspond {{to those of the}} open pore system in the organic matrix network. We further observe by EBSD that crystal co-orientation spans over tablet boundaries and forms composite crystal units of up to 20 stacked co-oriented tablets (tower crystals). Statistical evaluation of the misorientation data gives a probability distribution of grain boundary misorientations with two maxima: a dominant peak for very-small-angle grain boundaries and a small maximum near 64, the latter corresponding to 1 1 0 twinning orientations. However, the related twin boundaries are typically the membrane-lined 0 0 1 flat faces of the tablets and not 1 1 0 twin walls within tablets.

Most of the {{calculations are done}} with a two-fluid model for diffusive shock acceleration, but we provide also comparisons between a typical shock computed that way against calculations carried out using the more complete, momentum-dependent, diffusion-advection equation. We also illustrate a test showing that these simulations evolve to dynamical equilibria consistent with previously published steady state analytic calculations for such shocks. In order to improve understanding of the dynamical role of magnetic fields in shocks modified by CR pressure we have explored for time asymptotic states the parameter space of upstream fast mode Mach number, M(sub f), and plasma beta. We compile the results into maps of dynamical steady state CR acceleration efficiency, epsilon(sub c). We have run simulations using constant, and nonisotropic, obliquity (and hence spatially) dependent forms of the diffusion coefficient kappa. Comparison of the results shows that while the final steady states achieved are the same in each case, the history of CR-MHD shocks can be strongly modified by variations in kappa and, therefore, in the acceleration timescale. Also, the coupling of CR and MHD in low beta, oblique shocks substantially influences the transient density spike that forms in strongly CR-modified shocks. We find that inside the density spike a MHD slow mode wave can be generated that eventually steepens into a shock. A strong layer develops within the density spike, driven by MHD stresses.

The thermodynamic impact of metals is expected to induce a transition leading to clustered, low-mass Population II star formation. In this work, we present results from three cosmological simulations, only differing in gas metallicity, that focus on the impact of metal fine-structure line cooling on the formation of stellar clusters in a high-redshift atomic cooling halo. Introduction of sink particles allows us to follow the process of gas hydrodynamics and accretion onto cluster stars for 4 Myr corresponding to multiple local free-fall times. At metallicities at least 10 ^- 3 Z_, gas is able to reach the CMB temperature floor and fragment pervasively resulting in a stellar cluster of size ∼ 1 pc and total mass ∼ 1000 M_. The masses of individual sink particles vary, but are typically ∼ 100 M_, consistent with the Jeans mass when gas cools to the CMB temperature, though some solar mass fragments are also produced. At the low metallicity of 10 ^- 4 Z_, fragmentation is completely suppressed on scales greater than 0. 01 pc and total stellar mass is lower by a factor of 3 than in the higher metallicity simulations. The sink <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> rates, and thus their masses, are determined by the mass of the gravitationally unstable gas cloud and the prolonged gas accretion over many Myr. The simulations thus exhibit features of both monolithic collapse and competitive accretion.

Crystal settling is viable in static magma chambers. however in thin carbonatite dykes as seen on San Vicente, turbulent flow velocities preclude vertical particle transfer against the flow of liquid, and favour fractionation by rapid crystal growth in a boundary layer close to the dyke margins, and <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> to the dyke walls.

O 18 o and O 13 C of the carbonatites on San Vicente are decoupled, however calcite and dolomite may have equilibrated with seawater at temperatures close to 100 °C. Fractionation of calcite and apatite from a carbonatite magma, produces cumulate microsovite and conjugate evolved carbonatite liquids which form the ferrocarbonatite suite. Trace element variations within the ferrocarbonatite suite indicate that the unstained ferrocarbonatites (unaltered 'quench' carbonatite) are heterogeneously metasomatized and mineralized by evolved (contaminated) orange ferrocarbonatites to produce brown-black ferrocarbonatites. The degree of dolomitization of the Camile dyke on San Vicente, relates to the activity of Ba 2 + released during recrystallization of the original carbonate minerals.

In order to improve understanding of the dynamical role of magnetic fields in shocks modified by CR pressure we have explored for time asymptotic states the parameter space of upstream fast mode Mach number, M(f), and plasma beta. We compile the results into maps of dynamical steady state CR acceleration efficiency, epsilon(c). Since the models are simplifications, such maps {{should not be used}} to predict quantitatively epsilon(c) in real shocks; however, they are internally consistent, so that they can enable us to compare various competing dynamical effects. The maps, along with additional numerical experiments, show that epsilon(c) is reduced through the action of compressive work on tangential magnetic fields in CR-MHD shocks. Thus epsilon(c) in low beta, moderate M(f) shocks tends to be smaller in quasi-perpendicular shocks than it would be for high beta shocks of the same M(f). This result supports earlier conclusions that strong, oblique magnetic fields inhibit diffusive shock acceleration. For quasi-parallel shocks with beta < 1, on the other hand, epsilon(c) seems to be increased at a given M(f) when compared to high beta shocks. The apparent contradiction to the first conclusion results, however, from the fact that for small beta quasi-parallel shocks, the fast mode Mach number is not a good measure of compression through the shock. That is better reflected in the sonic Mach number, which is greater in these instances, Acceleration efficiencies for high and low beta having comparable sonic Mach numbers are more similar. Time evolution of CR-MHD shocks is qualitatively similar to CR-gasdynamical shocks. However, several potentially interesting differences are apparent. We have run simulations using constant, and nonisotropic, obliquity (and hence spatially) dependent forms of the diffusion coefficient kappa. Comparison of the results shows that while the final steady states achieved are the same in each case, the history of CR-MHD shocks can be strongly modified by variations in kappa and, therefore, in the acceleration timescale. Also, the coupling of CR and MHD in low beta, oblique shocks substantially influences the transient density spike that forms in strongly CR-modified shocks. We find that inside the density spike a MHD slow mode wave can be generated that eventually steepens into a shock. A strong shear layer develops within the density spike, driven by MHD stresses. We conjecture that currents in the shear layer could, in nonplanar flows, result in enhanced <b>particle</b> <b>accretion</b> through drift accelerationopen 9...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} accretion {{of solid}} materials onto circumplanetary disks from heliocentric orbits rotating in protoplanetary disks, {{which is a}} key process {{for the formation of}} regular satellite systems. In the late stage of gas-capturing phase of giant planet formation, the accreting gas from protoplanetary disks forms circumplanetary disks. Since the accretion flow toward the circumplanetary disks affects the particle motion through gas drag force, we use hydrodynamic simulation data for the gas drag term to calculate the motion of solid materials. We consider wide range of size for the solid particles ($ 10 ^{- 2 }$-$ 10 ^ 6 $m), and find that the accretion efficiency of the solid particles peaks around 10 m-sized particles because energy dissipation of drag with circum-planetary disk gas in this size regime is most effective. The efficiency for particles larger than 10 m size becomes lower because gas drag becomes less effective. For particles smaller than 10 m, the efficiency is lower because the particles are strongly coupled with the back-ground gas flow, which prevent <b>particles</b> from <b>accretion.</b> We also find that the distance from the planet where the particles are captured by the circumplanetary disks is in a narrow range and well described {{as a function of the}} particle size.

40|$|Two {{particle}} collisions {{close to}} the horizon of the rotating nonextremal black hole are analyzed. It is shown that high energy {{of the order of}} the Grand Unification scale in the centre of mass of colliding particles can be obtained when there is a multiple collision - the <b>particle</b> from the <b>accretion</b> disc gets the critical momentum in first collision with the other particle {{close to the}} horizon and then there is a second collision of the critical particle with the ordinary one. High energy occurs due to a great relative velocity of two particles and a large Lorentz factor. The dependence of the relative velocity on the distance to horizon is analyzed, the time of movement from the point in the accretion disc to the point of scattering with large energy as well as the time of back movement to the Earth are calculated. It is shown that they have reasonable order. Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures, added some formulas and one referenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of grains {{grown by}} accretion and coagulation is revaled {{by a new}} laboratory method of synthesizing cosmic dust analogs. Submicron carbon <b>particles,</b> grown by <b>accretion</b> of carbon atoms from a gas, have a spherical shape with a cauliflower-like surface and an internal micro-structure of radial columns. This shape is probably common for grains grown by accretion at a temperature well below the melting point. Coagulated grains, consisting of spheres that collided to form irregular strings, were also synthesized. Another shape we produced had a bumpy non- spherical morphology, like an interplanetary particle collected in the terrestrial stratosphere. Besides these isolated grains, large spongy aggregates of nanometer-size particles were also found for various experimental conditions. Grains were synthesized using ions to sputter a solid target, producing an atomic vapor at a low temperature. The ions were provided by a plasma, which also provided electrostatic levitation of the grains during their growth. The temporal development of grain growth was studied by extinguishing the plasma after various intervals...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{quasi-periodic}} oscillations (QPOs) of X-ray flux {{observed in the}} stellar-mass black hole binaries can provide {{a powerful tool for}} testing of the phenomena occurring in strong gravity regime. The high frequency (HF) QPOs usually come in pairs of double peaks which have a frequency ratio close to $ 3 : 2 $. In addition to HF QPOs, some sources display simultaneous existence of the low frequency (LF) QPOs in Fourier power spectra. We demonstrate that the explanation of these phenomena can be well related to the epicyclic oscillations of charged <b>particles</b> in <b>accretion</b> disks orbiting Kerr black holes immersed in external large-scale magnetic fields. Magnetized versions of the standard geodesic models of QPOs can explain the observationally fixed data from the three microquasars. We perform a successful fitting of the HF QPOs observed in three microquasars, GRS 1915 + 105, XTE 1550 - 564 and GRO 1655 - 40, containing black holes, for magnetised versions of both epicyclic rezonance and relativistic precession models and discuss the corresponding constraints of parameters of the model, which are the mass and spin of black hole and the parameter related to the external magnetic field. Assuming the main source of synchrotron radiation producing X-rays are the relativistic electrons, we estimate the magnetic field {{in the vicinity of the}} black hole in the three sources to be of order $ 10 ^{- 5 }$ Gs which can serve as possible signature of the Galactic magnetic field magnitude. For heavier particles (protons, ions) larger magnetic fields are necessary for fitting the data. Comment: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) is {{initiated by the}} oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the gas phase whose products subsequently partition to the particle phase. Non-volatile molecules have a negligible evaporation rate and grow particles at their condensation rate. Semi-volatile molecules have a significant evaporation rate and grow particles at a much slower rate than their condensation rate. Particle phase chemistry may enhance particle growth if it transforms partitioned semi-volatile molecules into non-volatile products. In principle, changes in molecular composition {{as a function of}} particle size allow non-volatile molecules that have condensed from the gas phase (a surface-limited process) to be distinguished from those produced by particle phase reaction (a volume-limited process). In this work, SOA was produced by β -pinene ozonolysis in a flow tube reactor. Aerosol exiting the reactor was size-selected with a differential mobility analyzer, and individual particle sizes between 35  and 110  nm in diameter were characterized by on- and offline mass spectrometry. Both the average oxygen-to-carbon (O ∕ C) ratio and carbon oxidation state (OSc) were found to decrease with increasing particle size, while the relative signal intensity of oligomers increased with increasing particle size. These results are consistent with oligomer formation primarily in the <b>particle</b> phase (<b>accretion</b> reactions, which become more favored as the volume-to-surface-area ratio of the particle increases). Analysis of a series of polydisperse SOA samples showed similar dependencies: as the mass loading increased (and average volume-to-surface-area ratio increased), the average O ∕ C ratio and OSc decreased, while the relative intensity of oligomer ions increased. The results illustrate the potential impact that particle phase chemistry can have on biogenic SOA formation and the particle size range where this chemistry becomes important...|$|R
40|$|High energy {{astrophysics}} {{has made}} {{good use of}} combined high energy (X-ray, gamma-ray) and radio observations to uncover connections between outbursts, <b>accretion,</b> <b>particle</b> acceleration and kinetic feedback to the local ambient medium. In the field of microquasars the connections have been particularly important. However, radio astronomy has been relying on essentially the same facilities for the past ~ 25 years, whereas high-energy astrophysics, in particular space-based research, has {{had a series of}} newer and more powerful missions. In the next fifteen years this imbalance is set to be redressed, with a whole familiy of new radio facilities under development en route to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in the 2020 s. In this brief review I will summarize these future prospects for radio astronomy, and focus on possibly the most exciting of the new facilities to be built in the next decade, the Low Frequency Array LOFAR, and its uses in high energy astrophysics.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that planets are formed by aggregation of dust particles suspended in the turbulent gas forming accretion disks around developing stars. We describe a mechanism, termed ‘Stokes trapping’, which limits the growth of aggregates of dust particles, so that their Stokes number, a dimensionless measure of the damping of their motion relative to the gas, remains close to unity. We discuss possible mechanisms for avoiding this barrier to further growth: none of these are satisfactory {{in the context of}} a steady-state theory. Subject headings: Planet formation, accretion, turbulence, caustics. 1. Background It {{is believed}} that planets are formed by aggregation of dust <b>particles</b> in an <b>accretion</b> disk surrounding a growing star; the fact that solar planets have orbits which are roughly circular and coplanar with the Sun’s equator is hard to explain in other ways. Planet formation must be a two-stage process (Armitage 2007). The final stages must be driven by gravitational forces, but initially the density of dust particles is not sufficiently high for gravitationa...|$|R
40|$|The zodiacal cloud is a thick circumsolar disk {{of small}} debris {{particles}} produced by asteroid collisions and comets. The relative proportion {{in which these}} two source populations contribute to the zodiacal cloud and the exact physical mechanism that generates the bulk of observed dust were unknown. Here we model the IRAS observations of thermal emission from asteroid and cometary particles to explain {{the origin of the}} zodiacal cloud. We find that � 90 % of the observed mid-infrared emission is produced by particles from the Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). We suggest that spontaneous disruptions of JFCs, rather than the usual cometary activity driven by sublimating volatiles, is the main mechanism that liberates cometary particles into the zodiacal cloud. Our results imply that JFC <b>particles</b> dominate the <b>accretion</b> rate of micrometeorites by Earth. Since their atmospheric entry speeds are typically low (13. 9 km s − 1 mean), many large JFC grains should survive frictional heating and land on the Earth’s surface. This explains why most antarctic micrometeorites have primitive carbonaceou...|$|R
40|$|The compact, nonthermal {{radio source}} Sgr A * at the Galactic Center {{appears to be}} {{coincident}} with a ∼ 2. 6 × 106 M ⊙ point-like object. Its energy source may be the release of gravitational energy as gas from the interstellar medium descends into its deep potential well. However, simple attempts at calculating the radiative spectrum and flux based on this picture have come tantalizingly close to the observations, yet have had difficulty in accounting for the unusually low efficiency in this source. Regardless of whether the radiating <b>particles</b> in the <b>accretion</b> flow are thermal or nonthermal, there now appear to be two principal reasons for this low conversion rate of dissipated energy into radiation: (1) the plasma separates into two temperatures, with the protons attaining a significantly higher temperature {{than that of the}} radiating electrons, and (2) the magnetic field B is sub-equipartition, which reduces the magnetic bremsstrahlung emissivity, and therefore the overall power of Sgr A*. In this paper, we investigate the latter with a considerable improvement over what ha...|$|R
