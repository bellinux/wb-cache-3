40|$|Reward related {{behaviour}} {{is linked}} to dopaminergic neurotransmission. Our aim was to gain insight into dopaminergic involvement in the human reward system. Combining {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} with dopaminergic depletion by α-methylparatyrosine we measured dopamine-related brain activity in 10 healthy volunteers. In addition to blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast we assessed the effect of dopaminergic depletion on prolactin response, peripheral markers for dopamine and norepinephrine. In the placebo condition we found increased activation in the left caudate and left cingulate gyrus during anticipation of reward. In the α-methylparatyrosine condition there was no significant brain activation during anticipation of reward or loss. In α-methylparatyrosine, anticipation of reward vs. loss increased activation in the right insula, left frontal, right parietal cortices and right cingulate gyrus. Comparing placebo versus α-methylparatyrosine showed increased activation in the left cingulate gyrus during anticipation of reward and the left medial frontal gyrus during anticipation of loss. α-methylparatyrosine reduced levels of dopamine in urine and homovanillic acid in plasma and increased prolactin. No significant effect of α-methylparatyrosine was found on norepinephrine markers. Our findings implicate distinct patterns of BOLD <b>underlying</b> <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> following dopamine depletion, suggesting a role of dopaminergic neurotransmission for anticipation of monetary rewar...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although cocaine {{dependence}} (CD) involves abnormalities in drug-related, reward-based decision making, it is {{not well}} understood whether these abnormalities generalize to nondrug-related cues and rewards and how neural functions <b>underlying</b> <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> in cocaine abusers relate to treatment outcome. METHODS: Twenty CD patients before treatment and 20 matched healthy control (HC) subjects participated in {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} while performing a monetary incentive delay task. Outcomes through 8 weeks were assessed via percent cocaine-negative urine toxicology, self-reported cocaine abstinence, and treatment retention. RESULTS: Among the whole sample, anticipation of working for monetary reward (i. e., reward anticipation) was associated with activation in the ventral striatum (VS), medial frontal gyrus, thalamus, right subcallosal gyrus, right insula, and left amygdala. Cocaine dependence compared with HC participants exhibited greater activation during notification of rewarding outcome (i. e., reward receipt) in left and right VS, right caudate, and right insula. In CD participants during reward anticipation, activation in left and right thalamus and right caudate correlated negatively with percent cocaine-negative urine toxicology, activation in thalamus bilaterally correlated negatively with self-reported abstinence measures, and activation in left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus correlated negatively with treatment retention. During reward notification, activation in right thalamus, right VS, and left culmen correlated negatively with abstinence and with urine toxicology. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in treatment-seeking CD participants, corticolimbic reward circuitry is relatively overactivated during monetary incentive delay task performance and specific regional activations related to <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> may predict aspects of treatment outcome and represent important targets for treatment development in CD...|$|R
40|$|Background Reward {{behavior}} in animals {{is influenced by}} circadian genes, including clock-pathway genes such as Period 2 (PER 2). Several forms of psychiatric illness are associated with both altered reward function and disturbances in circadian function. The PER 2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs 2304672 {{has been associated with}} psychiatric illnesses involving reward dysfunction. Associations among circadian genes, function in neural reward circuits, and circadian-influenced behavior have not yet been studied in humans, however. Methods 90 healthy adolescents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a guessing task with monetary reward, genotyping for two PER 2 SNPs (rs 2304672, rs 2304674), and actigraphy to measure sleep in their home environments. Weekend sleep midpoint, a behavioral index of circadian function, was derived from actigraphy. Puberty was measured by physical exam. Results The rs 2304672 SNP predicted blood oxygenation level-dependent response to monetary reward as constrained by sleep midpoint. Later sleep midpoint was associated with reduced activity in a key component of reward circuitry, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; Brodmann area 9 / 10 / 32), to reward outcome (pcorrected <. 05). G allele carriers showed reduced activity in mPFC relative to CC homozygotes. Conclusions Our findings are the first to indicate that circadian genes have a significant impact upon circadian-relevant reward circuitry in humans. These findings have the potential to elucidate gene-brain-behavior relationships <b>underlying</b> <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and psychopathology...|$|R

The minor allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs 11764590 in MAD 1 L 1 {{was associated with}} bipolar disorder. Both diseases, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, are linked to functional alterations in the reward system. We aimed at investigating possible effects of the MAD 1 L 1 rs 11764590 risk allele on reward systems functioning in healthy adults. A large homogenous sample of 224 young (aged 18 - 31 years) participants was genotyped and underwent {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMR 1). All participants performed the 'Desire-Reason Dilemma' paradigm investigating the neural correlates that <b>underlie</b> <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and active <b>reward</b> dismissal in favor of a long-term goal. We found significant hypoactivations of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the bilateral striatum and bilateral frontal and parietal cortices in response to conditioned reward stimuli in the risk allele carriers compared with major allele carriers. In the dilemma situation, functional connectivity between prefrontal brain regions and the ventral striatum was significantly diminished in the risk allele carriers. Healthy risk allele carriers showed a significant deficit of their bottom-up response to conditioned reward stimuli in the bilateral VTA and striatum. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and prefrontal areas exerting top-down control on the mesolimbic reward system was reduced in this group. Similar alterations in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and disturbances of prefrontal control mechanisms on mesolimbic brain circuits have also been reported in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Together, these findings suggest the existence of an intermediate phenotype associated with MAD 1 L 1...|$|R
40|$|Senescence {{affects the}} ability to utilize {{information}} about the likelihood of rewards for optimal decision-making. In a human {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study, we show that healthy older adults have an abnormal signature of expected value resulting in an incomplete reward prediction error signal in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region receiving rich input projections from substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) dopaminergic neurons. Structural connectivity between SN/VTA and striatum measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was tightly coupled to inter-individual differences in the expression of this expected reward value signal. The dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA) increased the task-based learning rate and task performance in some older adults to a level shown by young adults. Critically this drug-effect was linked to restoration of a canonical neural reward prediction error. Thus we identify a neurochemical signature <b>underlying</b> abnormal <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> in older adults and show this can be modulated by L-DOPA...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{reward systems}} mediate liking and wanting for food reward. Here, we explore the {{differential}} {{involvement of the}} following structures for these two components: the ventral and dorsal striatopallidal area, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior insula, and anterior cingulate. Twelve healthy female {{participants were asked to}} rate pleasantness (liking of food and non-food odors) and the desire to eat (wanting of odor-evoked food) during event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The subjective ratings and fMRI were performed in hunger and satiety states. Activations of regions-of-interest were compared as a function of task (liking vs. wanting), odor category (food vs. non-food), and metabolic state (hunger vs. satiety). We found that the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum were differentially involved in liking or wanting during the hunger state, which suggests a reciprocal inhibitory influence between these structures. Neural activation of OFC subregions was correlated with either liking or wanting ratings, suggesting an OFC role in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> magnitude. Finally, during the hunger state, participants with a high body mass index exhibited less activation in neural structures <b>underlying</b> food <b>reward</b> <b>processing.</b> Our results suggest that food liking and wanting are two separable psychological constructs and may be functionally segregated within the cortico-striatopallidal circuit...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDopamine {{function}} and <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> are highly interrelated and involve common brain regions afferent to the Nucleus Accumbens, within the mesolimbic pathway. While dopamine {{function and}} reward system neural activity are impaired in most psychiatric disorders, {{it is unknown}} if alterations in the dopamine system <b>underlie</b> variations in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> across a continuum encompassing health and these disorders. We explored the relationship between dopamine function and neural activity during reward anticipation in twenty-seven participants including healthy volunteers and psychiatric patients with schizophrenia, depression or cocaine addiction, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) multimodal imaging with a voxel-based statistical approach. Dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was assessed with PET and [11 C]PE 2 I as a marker of presynaptic dopamine function, and reward-related neural response was assessed using fMRI with a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task. Across all the participants, DAT availability in the midbrain correlated positively with the neural response to anticipation of reward in the Nucleus Accumbens. Moreover, this relationship was conserved in each clinical subgroup, despite the heterogeneity of mental illnesses examined. For the first time, a direct link between DAT availability and reward anticipation was detected within the mesolimbic pathway in healthy and psychiatric participants, and suggests that dopaminergic dysfunction is a common mechanism underlying the alterations of <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> observed in patients across diagnostic categories.

Dopamine (DA), oxytocin (OT), and arginine vasopressin (AVP) all have been implicated in the regulation of social attachment in monogamous voles. Therefore, we used radiolabeled ligands to examine dopamine D 1 - and D 2 -like, OT, and AVP V 1 a receptor binding densities in the mPFC of monogamous and promiscuous voles. Species differences were found; monogamous voles had higher densities of D 2 -like and OT receptor binding and lower densities of D 1 -like and V 1 a receptor binding than did promiscuous voles. Sex differences also were found; females had higher densities of OT receptor binding but lower densities of V 1 a receptor binding than did males in both species. Further, the laminar distribution of receptor binding indicates {{the possibility of an}} interaction between DA and OT systems in the mPFC in the regulation of social attachment.

Given the increasing focus on studying environmental and genetic regulation of DA function in mouse models, {{it is important}} to establish the effects of 6 -OHDA DA depletion in mice, in terms of <b>reward</b> and aversion <b>processing.</b> This mouse study investigated effects of 6 -OHDA-induced NAcc DA depletion using the operant behavioural test battery of progressive ratio schedule (PRS), learned non-reward (LNR), learned helplessness (LH), treadmill, and in addition Pavlovian fear conditioning. 6 -OHDA NAcc DA depletion, confirmed by ex vivo HPLC-ED, reduced operant responding: for gustatory reward under effortful conditions in the PRS test; to a stimulus recently associated with gustatory non-reward in the LNR test; to escape footshock recently experienced as uncontrollable in the LH test; and to avoid footshock by physical effort in the treadmill test. Evidence for specificity of effects to NAcc DA was provided by lack of effect of medial prefrontal cortex DA depletion in the LNR and LH tests. These findings add significantly to the evidence that NAcc DA is a major regulator of behavioural responding, particularly at the motivational level, to both reward and aversion. They demonstrate the suitability of mouse models for translational study of causation and reversal of pathophysiological DA function underlying motivation psychopathologies...|$|R

Methods: A two-wave panel design of adolescent offspring of unipolar depressed parents where complete data on <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and psychopathology were available on two occasions spaced one year apart (N= 197). We examined longitudinal relationships between symptoms of adolescent depression and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety) with <b>reward</b> <b>processing.</b> We also examined associations between adolescent <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and severe parental unipolar depression (an episode requiring hospitalization or GAF score <= 30) Results: Adolescent depressive symptoms were associated with decreases in risk-adjustment over time (β=-. 15, p=. 03) while social anxiety symptoms were associated with increases in risk-adjustment over time (β=. 22, p<. 01). Followup analyses suggested that depression was associated with reductions in rewardseeking at highly favorable reward contingencies only, whereas social anxiety led to reductions in reward-seeking in low probability contingencies only. Parent depression severity was associated with lower adolescent reward seeking at highly favorable reward contingencies (r= -. 162, p=. 03).

40|$|Addiction {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{disabling}} diseases in the world. An important neurotransmitter system that has recently been implicated in addiction is the endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system consists of cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoid ligands that work on these receptors. Animal studies have shown that blocking the cannabinoid system prevents relapse to addiction, while activating the cannabinoid system with an agonist evokes relapse. Still, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in addiction in humans remains unclear. The current thesis aimed to clarify the role of the endocannabinoid system in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> in nicotine addiction in humans. Brain function during <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> was assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). In the first study described in this thesis, we have shown that both chronic nicotine and cannabis use attenuates reward-related brain activity in the nucleus accumbens, a brain area well known for its involvement in <b>reward</b> <b>processing.</b> Next, the endocannabinoid system was challenged using the partial cannabinoid agonist THC, the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis. When comparing nicotine users with non-using controls, we showed that a THC challenge did not affect <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> in the nucleus accumbens in controls, while it was attenuated in nicotine users. Thus, altered <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> as is found in nicotine addiction is associated with increased sensitivity of the cannabinoid system. In contrast, the endocannabinoid system seems to play a limited role in normal <b>reward</b> <b>processing.</b> Together, these data indicate that the endocannabinoid system is involved in addiction, and possibly other diseases in which <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> is impaired, such as depression and ADHD...|$|R

Therefore this study examined the heterogeneity in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> of children and adolescents with attention problems. A group of 276 participants with attention problems, consisting of 150 participants with ADHD and 126 participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and a comparison group of 176 typically developing participants performed a neuropsychological guessing task that tested the effect of reward magnitude and frequency on performance.

Thomas. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 135 pages, appendix p. 113 - 135 Executive function (EF) involves {{the integration of}} cognitive processes {{in order to support}} and sustain goal-directed behaviors that are crucial in the development of behavioral regulation (Sergeant, Geurts, & Oosterlaan, 2002). Motivational and rewarding information may alter the underlying cognitive processes surrounding the implementation of these goal-directed behaviors. Previous research indicates that both behavior and brain systems associated with reward and executive function (EF) processes may be interacting in children with ADHD (Luman, Van Meel, Oosterlaan, Sergeant, & Geurts, 2009 b; Scheres, Milham, Knutson, & Castellanos, 2007). However, little research has been conducted within middle childhood to explore the intersection of EF and <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> in typical development. Furthermore, little is know about the degree to which <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> may be interacting with low EF ability on a behavioral and neural level during middle childhood. The current study examined behavioral performance as well as functional and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data to address the degree to which executive function (EF) ability may be related to <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> behaviors and brain circuitry in middle childhood.

A critical aspect of this work is that age-related differences are evident in neuronal processing of reward-related events across multiple brain regions even when adolescent rats demonstrate behavior similar to adults. These include differences in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> between adolescent and adult rats in orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. Surprisingly, minimal age related differences are observed in ventral striatum, which has been a focal point of developmental studies. We go on to discuss the implications of these differences for behavioral traits affected in adolescence, such as impulsivity, risk-taking, and behavioral flexibility. Collectively, this work suggests that reward-evoked neural activity differs as a function of age and that regions such as the dorsal striatum that are not traditionally associated with affective processing in adults may be critical for <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and psychiatric vulnerability {{in adolescent}}s...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{schizophrenia}} propose that abnormal {{functioning of the}} neural reward system is linked to negative and psychotic symptoms, by disruption of <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and promotion of context-independent false associations.

Abnormal interaction between the insula-ACC system and <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> regions may help explain abnormal reinforcer processing and symptoms. Here we use fMRI to assess the neural correlates of <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> in schizophrenia. Furthermore we investigated functional connectivity between the dopaminergic midbrain, a key region for the processing of reinforcers, and other brain regions. In response to rewards, controls activated task related regions (striatum, amygdala/hippocampus and midbrain) and the insula-ACC salience network. Patients similarly activated the insula-ACC salience network system but failed to activate task related regions. Reduced functional connectivity between the midbrain and the insula was found in schizophrenia, with the extent of this abnormality correlating with increased psychotic symptoms.

A key question is the feasibility of reversing or modifying maladaptive patterns of <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> to therapeutic ends. *Refine and augment the evidential database for tried and tested therapies such as Contingency Management and Behavioral Activation by focusing on core cognitive processes mediating rewards. *Provide a potential dimensional approach for <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> deficits that can be of trans-diagnostic importance in clinically relevant disorders, including depression and addiction * Investigate the subjective experience of pleasure- the hedonic aspect of reward seeking and consumption – and how this can be distinguished from the motivational, sometimes compulsive, component of reward pursuit. This promises more nuanced and effective interventions. Depression, for instance, could be seen as the restricted pursuit of pleasure rather than blunted pleasure experience; addiction can be viewed as accentuated drug seeking despite diminished consummatory pleasure. This aims to place motivation centre stage in both scenarios, emphasising the transdiagnostic theme of the Topic. *Temporal discounting of future rewards, whereby smaller, more immediate rewards are chosen even when significantly more valuable deferred rewards are available, is another trans-diagnostic phenomenon of interest in the in the present context. Factors that influence this, such as discounting of future reward are thought to reflect compulsion in the addictive context and hopelessness on the part of people experiencing depression. The executive cognitive processes that regulate this decision making are of both scientific and clinical significance. Empirical findings, theoretical contributions or commentaries bearing on cognitive or executive control were therefore welcome...|$|R
40|$|Dysfunctional reward {{from the}} pursuit of {{thinness}} presents a major challenge to recovery from Anorexia Nervosa (AN). We explore the neuroscientific basis of aberrant reward in AN, {{with the aim of}} generating novel hypotheses for translational investigation, and elucidate disease mechanisms to inform the development of targeted interventions. Relevant neuroimaging and behavioural studies are reviewed. These suggest that altered eating in AN may be a consequence of aberrant <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> combined with exaggerated cognitive control. We consider evidence that such aberrant <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> is reflected in the compulsive behaviours characterising AN, with substantial overlap in the neural circuits implicated in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and compulsivity. Drawing on contemporary neuroscientific theories of substance dependence, processes underpinning the shift from the initially rewarding pursuit of thinness to extreme and compulsive weight control behaviours are discussed. It is suggested that in AN, weight loss behaviour begins as overtly rewarding, goal-directed and positively reinforced, but over time becomes habitual and increasingly negatively reinforced. Excessive habit formation is suggested as one underlying mechanism perpetuating compulsive behaviour. Ongoing research into the behavioural and neural basis of aberrant reward in AN is required to further elucidate mechanisms. We discuss clinical and transdiagnostic implications, and propose that future treatment innovation may benefit from the development of novel interventions targeting aberrant <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> in AN...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} linked deficits in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> as a {{potential}} endophenotype for major depressive disorder. Neural and behavioral evidence demonstrated that reduced reward sensitivity is more characteristic of depression than other internalizing psychopathologies such as anxiety disorders. However, emerging evidence indicates the presence of <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> abnormalities across different anxiety disorders, including generalized and social anxiety disorders. Differences across studies may in part {{be due to the}} heterogeneity within anxiety disorders. We sought to explore differences in patterns of reward sensitivity across distinct internalizing symptoms dimensions on two laboratory paradigms: social and monetary reward. ERPs were recorded to isolate distinct neural indicators of anticipatory and consummatory <b>reward</b> <b>processing.</b> The results showed that depressive and anhedonic symptomatology were unique predictors of attenuated neural indicators of anticipatory reward sensitivity to uncertain social outcomes (i. e., Stimulus Preceding Negativity) and the early evaluation of social rewards (i. e., Reward Positivity). We also found that neural sensitivity of monetary and social reward was predicted by multiple interrelationships of distinct internalizing symptom dimensions. The results are discussed in the context of previous work on <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and psychiatric conditions. The findings underlines the significance of attending to the heterogeneity of reward and symptom dimensions. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} progress in investigating the underlying mechanisms of alcohol addiction. Animal experiments suggested that the development and maintenance of alcohol dependence is associated with dysfunctional <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and learning, particularly with increased salience attribution to alcohol-associated stimuli as well as Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer, which establishes an effect of alcohol-associated cues on operant alcohol seeking and consumption. The subject of this dissertation is the neurobiological genesis of such <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and learning anomalies in humans. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined alcohol-dependent patients and healthy controls and assessed the influence of personality factors such as impulsivity. We observed that alcohol-dependent patients display dysfunctional <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and an increased attention allocation for alcohol-related cues. Diminished processing of non alcohol-associated stimuli, which indicate upcoming reward, was correlated with increased impulsivity, thus identifying a neuronal correlate of temporal discounting of delayed rewards...|$|R
40|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the degeneration of dopaminergic pathways projecting to the striatum. These pathways are implicated in reward prediction. In this study, we investigated <b>reward</b> and punishment <b>processing</b> in young, never-medicated Parkinson's disease patients, recently medicated patients receiving the dopamine receptor agonists pramipexole and ropinirole and healthy controls. The never-medicated patients were also re-evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment with dopamine agonists. <b>Reward</b> and punishment <b>processing</b> was assessed by a feedback-based probabilistic classification task. Personality characteristics were measured by the temperament and character inventory. Results revealed that never-medicated patients with Parkinson's disease showed selective deficits on <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and novelty seeking, which were remediated by dopamine agonists. These medications disrupted punishment processing. In addition, dopamine agonists increased the correlation between <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and novelty seeking, whereas these drugs decreased the correlation between punishment processing and harm avoidance. Our finding that dopamine agonist administration in young patients with Parkinson's disease resulted in increased novelty seeking, enhanced <b>reward</b> <b>processing,</b> and decreased punishment processing may shed light on the cognitive and personality bases of the impulse control disorders, which arise as side-effects of dopamine agonist therapy in some Parkinson's disease patients...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{lines of}} {{research}} suggest that both testosterone and maladaptive <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> can modulate behavioral dysregulation. Yet to date, no integrative account {{has been provided}} that systematically explains neuroendocrine function, dysregulation of reward, and behavioral dysregulation in a unified perspective. This is particularly important given specific neuroendocrine systems are potential mechanisms underlying and giving rise to reward-relevant behaviors. In this review, we propose a forward thinking approach to study the mechanisms of reward and behavioral dysregulation from a positive affective neuroendocrinology (PANE) perspective. This approach holds that testosterone increases <b>reward</b> <b>processing,</b> which {{increases the likelihood of}} behavioral dysregulation. Additionally, the PANE framework holds that <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> mediates the effects of testosterone on behavioral dysregulation. We also explore sources of potential sex differences and the roles of age, cortisol, and individual differences within the PANE framework. Finally, we discuss future prospects for research questions and methodology in the emerging field of affective neuroendocrinology...|$|R
40|$|The last {{sixty years}} of {{research}} has provided extraordinary advances of {{our knowledge of the}} reward system. Since its discovery as a neurotransmitter by Carlsson and colleagues (1), dopamine (DA) has emerged as an important mediator of <b>reward</b> <b>processing.</b> As a result, a number of electrochemical techniques have been developed to measure DA in the brain. Together, these techniques have begun to elucidate the complex roles of tonic and phasic DA signaling in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and addiction. In this review, we will first provide a guide for the most commonly used electrochemical methods for DA detection and describe their utility in furthering our knowledge about DA's role in reward and addiction. Second, we will review the value of common in vitro and in vivo preparations and describe their ability to address different types of questions. Last, we will review recent data that has provided new mechanistic insight of in vivo phasic DA signaling and its role in <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> and reward-mediated behavior...|$|R
40|$|Stress may {{promote the}} onset of {{psychopathology}} by disrupting <b>reward</b> <b>processing.</b> However, {{the extent to which}} stress impairs <b>reward</b> <b>processing,</b> rather than incentive processing more generally, is unclear. To evaluate the specificity of stress-induced <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> disruption, 100 psychiatrically healthy females were administered a probabilistic stimulus selection task (PSST) that enabled comparison of sensitivity to reward-driven (Go) and punishment-driven (NoGo) learning under either “no stress” or “stress ” (threat-of-shock) conditions. Cortisol samples and self-report measures were collected. Contrary to hypotheses, the groups did not differ significantly in task performance or cortisol reactivity. However, further analyses focusing only on individuals under “stress ” who were high responders with regard to both cortisol reactivity and self-reported negative affect revealed reduced reward sensitivity relative to individuals tested in the “no stress ” condition; importantly, these deficits were reward-specific. Overall, findings provide preliminary evidence that stress-reactive individuals show diminished sensitivity to reward, but not punishment, under stress. While such results highlight the possibility that stress-induced anhedonia might be an important mechanis...|$|R
40|$|Although {{previous}} neuroimaging {{research has}} identified overlapping correlates of subjective value across different reward {{types in the}} ventromedial pFC (vmPFC), {{it is not clear}} whether this “common currency ” evaluative signal extends to the aesthetic domain. To examine this issue, we scanned human participants with fMRI while they made attractiveness judgments of faces and places—two stimulus categories that are associated with dif-ferent <b>underlying</b> <b>rewards,</b> have very different visual properties, and are rarely compared with each other. We found overlapping signals for face and place attractiveness in the vmPFC, consistent with the idea that this region codes a signal for value that applies across disparate reward types and across both economic and aesthetic judgments. However, we also identified a subregion of vmPFC within which activity patterns for face and place attractive-ness were distinguishable, suggesting that some category-specific attractiveness information is retained in this region. Finally, we observed two separate functional regions in lateral OFC: one region that exhibited a category-unique response to face attrac-tiveness and another region that responded strongly to faces but was insensitive to their value. Our results suggest that vmPFC supports a common mechanism for reward evaluation while also retaining a degree of category-specific information, whereas lateral OFC may be involved in basic <b>reward</b> <b>processing</b> that is specific to only some stimulus categories. ...|$|R
