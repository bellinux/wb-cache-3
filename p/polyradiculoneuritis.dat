5000|$|<b>Polyradiculoneuritis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the nerve roots. The most common type is Coonhound paralysis. This is similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome in humans. Coonhound paralysis seems to be secondary to a raccoon bite, probably due to some factor in the saliva. However, it can also occur without any interaction with a raccoon. It can happen in any breed of dog. When associated with a raccoon bite, the symptoms start 7 to 11 days after the bite, and include rear leg weakness progressing rapidly to paresis, and decreased reflexes. When not associated with a raccoon bite, the same symptoms occur, with the paresis taking about 3-4 days to reach its maximum effect. Severe cases have a loss of bark, trouble breathing, and an inability to lift the head. Typically, {{the duration of the}} paralysis is 2 to 3 months, but can last up to 6 months. Treatment is proper nursing care, and the prognosis is good in mild cases. In bad cases, the dog does not completely recover the initial muscular capability but still is able to live for years. In very bad cases, breathing can be impaired, and unless the dog is placed on a ventilator, suffocation will occur. <b>Polyradiculoneuritis</b> has also been seen 1-2o weeks after vaccination in dogs and cats. [...] It can also be caused by toxoplasmosis.|$|E

40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2004. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 13). Acute, severe, diffuse {{neuromuscular disease}} {{is characterized by}} distinct neurologic signs and the primary differential diagnoses include Coonhound paralysis/acute <b>polyradiculoneuritis,</b> organophosphate toxicity, fulminant myasthenia gravis, botulism, tick paralysis, and polymyositis. In the case presented in this paper, history and diagnostics were used to identify acute <b>polyradiculoneuritis</b> as the most likely cause of clinical signs. Coonhound paralysis is an acute <b>polyradiculoneuritis</b> that {{is believed to be}} caused by an immune-mediated reaction to an antigen present in the saliva of a raccoon. Acute idiopathic <b>polyradiculoneuritis</b> is an identical syndrome except that there is no history of exposure to a raccoon. In the latter case, it is presumed that another foreign antigen is responsible for the immune response. In either case, the foreign antigen resembles the individual's own gangliosides such that antibodies formed against the foreign antigen attack both that antigen and the patient's neural tissue. The result is an acute inflammation of the ventral nerve roots and subsequent demyelination with or without axonal degeneration. This results in the clinical signs of diffuse neuromuscular disease. Treatment is supportive, including adequate cushioning, frequent turning, and feeding in an upright position. The majority of dogs will recover in weeks to several months.

Routine CSF parameters [leukocyte count, protein, lactate and albumin concentrations, CSF/serum quotients of albumin (QAlb), IgG, IgA and IgM, and oligoclonal IgG bands] and the Borrelia burgdorferi (BB) -specific antibody index were retrospectively studied in relation to the clinical presentation in patients diagnosed with acute LNB. A total of 118 patients with LNB were categorized into the following groups according to their symptoms at presentation; group 1 : <b>polyradiculoneuritis</b> (Bannwarth’s syndrome), group 2 : isolated facial palsy and group 3 : predominantly meningitic course of the disease. In addition to the CSF of patients with acute LNB, CSF of 19 patients with viral meningitis (VM) and 3 with neurolues (NL) were analyzed. There were 97 patients classified with definite LNB, and 21 as probable LNB. Neck stiffness and fever were reported by 15. 3 % of patients. Most of these patients were younger than 50  years. <b>Polyradiculoneuritis</b> was frequently found in patients older than 50  years. Lymphopleocytosis was found in all patients. Only 5 patients had a CSF lactate ≥ 3. 5  mmol/l, and the mean CSF lactate level was not elevated (2. 1  ±  0. 6  mmol/l). The patients with definite LNB had significantly higher lactate levels than patients with probable LNB. Elevated lactate levels were accompanied by fever and headache. In the Reiber nomograms, intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was found for IgM in 70. 2 % followed by IgG in 19. 5 %. Isoelectric focussing detected an intrathecal IgG synthesis in 83 patients (70. 3 %). Elevated BB AIs in the CSF were found in 97 patients (82. 2 %). Patients with VM showed lower CSF protein concentration and CSF/serum quotients of albumin than LNB patients. In acute LNB, all patients had elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte counts.
