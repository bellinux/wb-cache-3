25|$|The company {{commander}} of C Company, (Newry), 3 UDR, was the former {{commander of the}} TA unit and was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> virtually all of his TA soldiers were on parade, in the TA Centre, {{in exactly the same}} drill hall as they had previously used, for the first night of the new regiment. He noted there were some former B Specials in the room and observed they did not initially associate with the others – not on the grounds of religion but because the former TA soldiers all knew each other socially and sat together on canteen breaks whereas the former specials kept to their group of comrades, but within a week both had melded together.|$|E

[...] "I was very <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he [...] brought it along in fine style," [...] he said. Kelley noted that his own ambition to direct had deserted him after seeing difficulties Nimoy faced directing the previous two Star Trek films.|$|E

[...] "Will you <b>please</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I have a comfortable room, Maria; and one for my maid, next me? I will thank you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> yourself," [...] the Empress of Kew said, pointing with her stick, before which many a time the younger lady had trembled.|$|R
500|$|There was {{opposition}} within Saudi Arabia to {{the concept}} of women representing the country at the Olympics. Ultimately the Saudi government gave in to international pressure from sport and women's rights activists to include women or face possible sanctions. [...] The IOC president Jacques Rogge said of Shahrkhani's and Attar's inclusion, [...] "The I.O.C. has been working very closely with the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee and I am <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> our continued dialogue has come to fruition." ...|$|E

Jackman was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the script allowed Wolverine to expand his character choices, as instead of [...] questioning whether he would remain a loner or join the X-Men, Logan now is asked if he will play a leadership role in the X-Men.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation, described the episode as [...] "very classic Trek". She was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> some character depth was being {{introduced into the}} new Xindi characters, and compared Gralik to Captain Dathon from the [...] episode [...] "Darmok" [...] but thought that Gralik didn't get developed quite enough {{to be on the}} same level. Overall, she described the episode as [...] "a very solid hour of entertainment, with very few nitpicks... a slick package with the values I consider to be real Trek". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] wasn't enthusiastic about a particularly [...] "lackluster" [...] action scene which he felt was a bad cross between [...] and Andromeda. However, he was pleased with the other aspects of the plot and praised the clever scripting. He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E

And then, an in depth interview have beenconducted among general managers and marketing managers of Turkish textile, marble and metalgoods export companies in Denizli, about frequently encountered bribery and other questionablepractices in international markets. In this research, it has been <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> bribery and other questionable business practices arealso serious problem for Turkish export companies.

500|$|The New York {{magazine}} {{said that}} the film's premise of four high-school friends videotaping their senior year [...] "sounds like a fluffy reality show"; Bill Weber of Slant Magazine said, [...] "putting the trials of MTV reality-show prima donnas in perspective, the middle-class quartet will be relatable to this BBC/HBO production's audience in their easy embrace of Western kid stuff ... Directors Ivan O'Mahoney and Laura Winter balance [...] an everyday sense of the adolescents' wartime anxiety with the more commonplace juvenile relief." [...] Similarly, The Huffington Post raised comparisons with MTV reality shows, but was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Iraqi boys did not play to the cameras because {{they had not been}} exposed to programmes such as [...] or The Paper. That juvenile relief was commented on by many; The Washington Post highlighted Mohammad's adoption of an unwelcome mouse in the house. Hale described a scene where Mohammad and Ali act like hostage and captor. [...] "Suddenly Ali is holding a large knife. 'He's being naughty!' Mohammad says. Ali holds the knife near Mohammad and says, a little too unemotionally: 'Allah! This is the first hostage. I'm going to slaughter him this way.' Mohammad tells him to stop fooling around. Ali relents. 'O.K. He just got a presidential pardon. He can live'." [...] Reuters also commented on this, and more banter between Ali and Mohammad. [...] "Ali is shown making a pretend hostage video with Mohammad, and then teasing his friend for his smelly feet. 'If Chemical Ali really wanted to destroy the north he should have fired a rocket with Mohammad's socks in it'." ...|$|E
2500|$|...There are, in fact, two {{monitoring}} collections for 1948: one {{compiled by}} the BBC, the other by the CIA, both from Cyprus. There is considerable overlapping between these collections but {{in the interests of}} “checking” and “rejection” they should be studied separately. Both collections give detailed daily coverage of broadcasts from Arab capitals and of such Zionist radios as Haganab Radio (in Hebrew, English, and Arabic); the Free Hebrew Station (Stern) and the Voice of Fighting Zion (Irgun). I was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the researchers of Mr. Childers in the British Museum confirm my own findings. I can report now that the complete CIA collection here in Princeton also overwhelming ...|$|E
2500|$|The final {{revelation of}} Snape's loyalty in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was viewed {{positively}} by fans and critics alike. Daniel Radcliffe, who portrays Harry Potter {{in the movie}} series, expressed his delight, saying he was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his theory that Snape would {{end up being a}} sort of tragic hero came through. Elizabeth Hand from The Washington Post wrote, [...] "The much-maligned loner Snape does not come onstage until the latter part of [...] "Deathly Hallows," [...] but when he does the book becomes his: Snape's fate, more than Voldemort's, perhaps more even than Harry's, is the most heartbreaking, surprising and satisfying of all of Rowling's achievements." ...|$|E

40|$|The sound {{absorption}} property of polyurethane (PU) foams loaded with natural tea-leaf fibers and luffa cylindrica (LC) has been studied. The results show {{a significant improvement}} in the {{sound absorption}} property parallel {{to an increase in}} the amount of tea-leaf fibers (TLF). Using luffa-cylindrica as a filler material improves sound absorption properties of soft foam at all frequency ranges. Moreover, an increase in the thickness of the sample resulted in an improvement of the sound absorption property. It is <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> adding tea-leaf fibers and luffa-cylindrica to the polyurethane foam demonstrate a significant contribution to sound absorption properties of the material and it encourages using environmental friendly products as sound absorption material in further studies...|$|R

2500|$|On 9 October 1803 Atalante pursued two ketches and a brig at Saint Gildas Point. The quarry ran ashore {{near the}} mouth of the Pennerf river. Mansfield then sent in his boats on a cutting out expedition. One boat {{captured}} one of the ketches but couldn't bring her off; while they were so engaged they endured fire from soldiers on board the other ketch and troops with two field guns on the beach. The boarding party then abandoned their vessel and went to the assistance of the party that had boarded the brig. That party had killed six of the 10 or 12 soldiers on the brig, thrown two over board, and driven the rest and the crew below decks. The boarding party was unable to get the brig off the shore so they abandoned her without setting her on fire in consideration of the men below decks. Atalante lost one man killed and two wounded in the operation. Next day Masefield was <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the brig was on a ridge of rocks and [...] "apparently bilged".|$|E

Then some one sternly called [...] "Silence!" [...] and the {{examination}} commenced again.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the {{carnival}} season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, {{for he had}} been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.

40|$|This edited {{book has}} clearly been {{produced}} {{to respond to}} a developing interest in the application of wisdom to business. It is divided into five sections, each of four chapters, dealing with logic, ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, and meta-physics, followed by a synthesizing commentary of two chapters. While it is <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the concept of wisdom is now sufficiently well established in organizational and managerial studies to warrant a substantial book of read-ings by a strong academic publisher, the quality of its engagement with wisdom is patchy. There are some significant contributors. Robert Sternberg, a co-author here, for example, has produced a massive literature on the psychology of wis-dom since his 1990 book Wisdom: Its Nature, Origins and Development. Although many of the other authors do not have substantial records of wisdom writing, it is encouraging <b>to</b> <b>see</b> there are important management scholars such as Robert Chia, Stewart Clegg, Jay Conger, Dennis Gioia, Robert Hooijberg, and Peter Vaill providing chapters for the book, and Karl Weick providing the fore-word.
