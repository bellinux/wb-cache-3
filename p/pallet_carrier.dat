50|$|The {{straddle}} carrier {{was invented by}} H. B. Ross in 1913 as a road-going vehicle that could easily transport lumber around mills and yards. Lumber was stacked on special <b>pallets</b> known as <b>carrier</b> blocks; the carrier would then straddle the stack, grasp and lift the carrier block, and drive off with the load. Because a {{straddle carrier}} is open at both front and rear, it can transport lumber much longer than the carrier itself, over 30 m in length.|$|R

Forskningsfrågor Fråga 1 : Vilka aspekter för införande av plastpall som lastbärare mellan Volkswagen Parts Logistics och dess återförsäljare behövs tas hänsyn till vid lagring, {{distribution}} och retur av deras reservdelar? Fråga 2 : Vilka blir de ekonomiska påföljderna vid lagring, distribution och retur av att införa plastpall som lastbärare för reservdelar hos Volkswagen Parts Logistics? Syfte Syftet med studie är att utveckla ett ramverk för införande av plastpall som lastbärare för reservdelar till eftermarknaden i bilindustrin. Metod Utförd studie genomfördes som en fallstudie, den empiri som samlades in för att användas i studie utfördes genom att respondenter valdes utifrån bekvämlighetsurval och snöbollsurval. Respondenter deltog i semi- och ostrukturerade intervjuer och författare genomförde även observationer som deltagare. Slutsats Det finns ett antal aspekter och påföljder som Volkswagen Parts Logistics behöver ta hänsyn till vid plastpalls införande: (1) Retursystem (2) Tredjepartsleverantör (3) Avtal (4) Materialrelaterade (5) Prestationsmått (6) Transaktions- och Säkerhetslager (7) Miljö och Hållbarhet (8) Kalkylering. De ekonomiska påföljderna av att införa plastpall är till stor del beroende av vilken grad som RFID-teknik implementeras. Med nuvarande situation hos VPL, det vill säga sämsta möjliga förutsättningar och endast träpall byts ut mot plastpall utan RFID, uppnås en kostnadsbesparing på i snitt 620 000 kronor per år vid normalt utfall av känslighetsanalys och kräver en grundinvestering på 3 000 000 kronor med break-even tid 6 – 7 år. Motsvarande vid beräkningar av realistiska förutsättningar uppnås en snittbesparing på 1 200 000 kronor per år utan RFID med break-even tid på 3 – 4 år med normalt utfall i känslighetsanalys och en grundinvestering på 2 250 000 kronor. Samma förutsättningar med RFID ger 575 000 kronor i snittbesparing per år med normalt utfall i känslighetsanalys, uppskattat till break-even tid över 8 år med en grundinvestering på 7 250 000 kronor.  Authors Henrik Nordh and Robin Klasson. Research Questions Question 1 : Which aspects are to {{be considered}} with implementation of plastic <b>pallets</b> as load <b>carriers</b> between Volkswagen Parts Logistics and its resellers regarding stocking, distribution and return of their spare parts? Question 2 : What are the economic impacts regarding stocking, distribution and return of implementing plastic <b>pallets</b> as load <b>carriers</b> for spare parts at Volkswagen Parts Logistics? Purpose The {{purpose of the study}} is to develop a framework for implementing plastic <b>pallets</b> as load <b>carriers</b> for spare parts in the aftermarket of the automotive industry. Method The study was performed as a case study, the information {{to be used in the}} conducted study was gathered through a number of respondents who were chosen from a comfort- and snowball selection. The respondents participated in semi- and unstructured interviews and the authors also conducted observations as participants. Conclusion There are a number of aspects and impacts for Volkswagen Parts Logistics to consider with implementing plastic pallets. (1) Return system (2) Third party logistics provider (3) Agreement (4) Material related (5) Performance measure (6) Transaction- and Safety stock (7) Environment and sustainability (8) Calculation. The economic impacts of implementing plastic pallets are in great extent depending of what degree of RFID- technology is to be used. If current situation at VPL exists, with the worst situation possible and only wooden pallets {{are to be}} substituted without RFID- technology, savings can be made up to 620 000 kronor on average per year at normal results in the sensitivity analysis, demanding an investment of 3 000 000 kronor and 6 – 7 -year breakeven time. Corresponding calculations of realistic result, savings can be made on average 1 200 000 kronor a year without RFID and break-even time of 3 – 4 years with normal sensitivity analysis and an investment of 2 250 000 kronor. The same conditions with RFID results in average 575 000 kronor in savings a year with the normal sensitivity analysis, break-even time over 8 years and an investment of 7 250 000 kronor. ...|$|R
40|$|The Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier (SLIC) Grant {{consists}} of two separate but related phases. The first phase of this grant was conducted under a separate Institute for Scientific Research, Inc. (ISR) subcontract to FMW Composite Systems, Inc., of Bridgeport, West Virginia. FMW conducted early design and engineering associated with the future development of a stronger and lighter Space Shuttle <b>carrier</b> <b>pallet.</b> This improved pallet is intended to support the next and last planned Shuttle servicing mission for the on-orbit Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The salient characteristics of this carrier are increased performance, together with significantly reduced mass. As the next servicing mission is the last planned upgrade mission for the HST, this lighter and stronger pallet will enable greater payload delivery to the HST, potentially increasing the servicing mission effectiveness and science lifetime of the telescope. The second phase of this grant, conducted by ISR, consisted of a data systems study to exploit further {{the potential of the}} HST servicing pallet for other space missions, specifically for application of semi-permanent placement of science payloads on the International Space Station (ISS). As {{in the case of the}} HST, a lightweight and more rigid pallet could be employed to increase science return for the ISS. A data systems study intended to complement the current ISS s Institutional data system holds the potential of increasing the science return for data efficiency, just as the lightweight pallet serves to increase payload mass efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Usachov next flew on STS-101, {{the third}} Shuttle mission devoted to International Space Station (ISS) construction. On 9 May 2000 at 6:11 a.m. EDT [...] lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. Usachov {{served as a}} Mission {{specialist}} and was seated down on Atlantis middeck for both entry and landing. The primary mission objectives for STS-101 was to deliver supplies to the International Space Station, with the supplies hauled up using a Spacehab double module and Spacehab Integrated Cargo <b>Carrier</b> <b>pallet,</b> perform a spacewalk and then reboost the station from 230 to 250 statute miles (370 to 402 km). Usachov and NASA astronaut Susan Helms were the first crew members to enter the station. On Flight Days 5 and 6 of the mission, Usachov and Helms replaced two of six batteries in the Zarya module along with some associated battery-charging electronics. Usachov and Helms also installed a new Radio Telemetry System in the Zarya module, a memory unit that can store data on board when the station is not in communications with the ground. The new memory unit replaced one that was {{nearing the end of}} its planned operational lifetime. On Flight Day 8, he and Helms began backing out of the ISS by closing five hatches behind them. On the day, Usachov also took some time to talk with Russian media gathered at the Russian Mission Control Center. On the next day Usachov with other shuttle crewmembers continued stowing away equipment used over their time in orbit.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} perspectives {{as to what}} is actually considered LTL. Full Truck Load carriers can put anywhere from 2 to 6 different people's shipments on a trailer and since each shipment is technically “less than a truckload” they would consider that to be LTL. There are also freight companies who do not specialize in truck loads, but rather, consolidate larger volume shipments from about 2 to 12 pallets (or about 4000 to 24000 pounds) and consider themselves LTL Carriers. Finally, the most commonly referenced LTL is shipped via “common” carriers who handle freight above what would normally ship via FedEx Ground, or UPS or U.S. Mail parcel services (about 150 pounds) to just under what would usually be considered a Truck Load at about 20,000 pounds or more than 14 <b>pallets.</b> LTL common <b>carriers</b> {{are also more likely to}} accept loose (non-palletized) cargo than the other two. LTL shipments typically weigh between 151 and 20000 lb. Less than Truckload carriers use [...] "hub and spoke" [...] operations where small local terminals are the spokes ('end of line') and larger more central terminals are the hubs (also called Distribution Centers or DC's). Spoke terminals collect local freight from various shippers and consolidate that freight onto enclosed trailers for transporting to the delivering or hub terminal where the freight will be further sorted and consolidated for additional transporting (also known as linehauling). In most cases, the end of line terminals employ local drivers who start the day by loading up their trailers and heading out to make deliveries first. Then when the trailer is empty they begin making pickups and return to the terminal for sorting and delivery next day. Because of the efficiency of this order of operations most deliveries are performed in the morning and pickups are made in the afternoon.|$|R
