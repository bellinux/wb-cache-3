A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago.

Among the buildings destroyed include a furniture store, pharmacy, warehouse, hotel, school, and an ironworks, while many other structures were unroofed. All of the theaters in the city were damaged. The Kettler Theater, the first theater built in West Palm Beach, suffered severe damage, totaling about $125,000.

500|$|Other {{media outlets}} {{received}} the broadcast more positively. Film critic Roger Ebert noted that Rock [...] "opened on a high-energy quick-talking note" [...] He also added, [...] "Chris Rock {{hit a home}} run with his opening monologue, which was surprisingly pointed, topical, and not shy of controversy." [...] Television critic Frazier Moore commented that Rock's performance was a [...] "needed pick-me-up, presiding over the broadcast with saucy finesse." [...] He added, [...] "In sum, the broadcast felt brisk, though not rushed. It felt modern and refreshingly free of chronic self-importance." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety gave an average review of Rock but remarked, [...] "For all the hand-wringing about the awards descending into the muck, the 77th Academy Awards proved a classy affair, with <b>precious</b> <b>little</b> red meat to satiate Hollywood bashers." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, but wrote: [...] "Flashes of brilliance aside, the result sounds {{an awful lot}} like something Yorke dashed off to pass the time before delving into the new Radiohead album." [...] Mark Beaumont of the Guardian called it [...] "deviously understated", but found that its unconventional release was [...] "more impactful than the product." [...] Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork wrote: [...] "There's <b>precious</b> <b>little</b> to grab on to in terms of melody and feeling, and you won't find yourself humming along to anything here. That said, certain elements of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, if given the right amount of attention, can be enjoyable to luxuriate in." [...] Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times found the album too similar to Yorke's 2006 solo album The Eraser and his work with Atoms for Peace, writing that [...] "it’s just a bit disappointing that Yorke's path seems short on new directions." ...|$|E
500|$|James Oldham of NME saw Hail to the Thief as [...] "a good {{rather than}} great record... {{the impact of}} the best moments is dulled by the {{inclusion}} of some indifferent electronic compositions." [...] Qs John Harris felt that some of the material [...] "comes dangerously close to being all experimentalism and <b>precious</b> <b>little</b> substance". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that while [...] "you could never describe Hail to the Thief as a bad record", it was [...] "neither startlingly different and fresh nor packed with the sort of anthemic songs that once made [...] the world's biggest band." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that while its melodies and guitar work are [...] "never as elegiac and lyrical" [...] or [...] "articulate and demented" [...] as those of OK Computer, he felt it [...] "flows better" [...] and later awarded it a one-star [...] "honourable mention". In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked Hail to the Thief the 89th best album of the 2000s, writing that [...] "the dazzling overabundance of ideas makes Hail to the Thief a triumph." ...|$|E

5000|$|The book {{received}} predominantly favorable reviews, {{with some}} exceptions. In The Guardian, Jude Rogers wrote, [...] "Complex, quick-witted and stack-full of raw talent: this isn't how {{people like to}} see Carly Simon. After all, Simon was also the long-legged, hyena-mouthed lover of many famous men (William Donaldson, writer of the Henry Root letters, Kris Kristofferson, Mick Jagger and Jack Nicholson, for starters), and the wayward daughter of a publishing icon Richard, the Simon of Simon & Schuster. These boys in the trees, and many more, follow her, dog her and haunt her. Her process of shaking them free forms the foundations of this brilliant memoir." [...] Similarly, in The Independent, Fiona Sturges found Boys in the Trees a [...] "hugely affecting memoir", describing Simon's recounting [...] "as, for the most part, heartfelt and remarkable in its detail...Similarly impressive is the fearlessness, frankness and wisdom with which she chronicles half a lifetime of pain." [...] However, in The New York Times, Janet Maslin found the [...] "book’s style recalls that of Simon's songs: a <b>little</b> <b>precious,</b> a <b>little</b> redundant, a little too much." ...|$|R

500|$|While their author {{continued}} to receive praise for his main contributions, the erotic tales were most often kept {{hidden from the}} public eye. George Călinescu summarized this contrast by stating: [...] "The 'corrosives' left by Creangă are not known publicly." [...] An exception to this rule was Kirileanu's Creangă reader of 1938, published by Editura Fundațiilor Regale as the first critical edition of his entire literature. According to critic Adrian Solomon, the Romanian tradition of silencing obscene language and sexually explicit literature through censorship made [...] "The Tale of All Tales" [...] circulate [...] "rather like a samizdat", which left writers with [...] "no solid tradition to draw on, and <b>precious</b> <b>little</b> chance to evade... the vigilant morals of a straitlaced public." [...] The nationalist aspects of Ion Creangă's public discourse were however approved of and recovered by the far right of the 1920s and '30s. High-ranking Orthodox cleric Tit Simedrea referred to Creangă as a predecessor when, in 1937, he urged his congregation to refrain from purchasing merchandise sold by Jews (a measure which he believed was a practical alternative to the Jews' forced eviction). In 1939, {{as part of a}} press campaign targeting Călinescu's work, the fascist journal Porunca Vremii accused the literary historian of having exposed Creangă's biography for the sake of compromising the [...] "genial Moldavian" [...] by turning him into [...] "an unfrocked epileptic and a drunk." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985, the French filmmaker Maurice Pialat {{featured}} {{a section of}} the third movement in the ending credits of his movie Police. When the work was later repackaged as a [...] "soundtrack album", it sold well. Although Gorecki's name was featured prominently on the front cover, the sleeve notes on the back provided <b>precious</b> <b>little</b> information about the work, and Górecki's name appeared in smaller type than those of the main actors. In the mid-1980s, British industrial music group Test Dept used the symphony as a backdrop for video collages during their concerts, recasting the symphony as a vehicle for the band's sympathy with the Polish Solidarity movement, which Górecki also supported (his 1981 piece Miserere was composed in part as a response to government opposition of Solidarity trade unions). During the late 1980s, the symphony received increasing airplay on US and British classical radio stations, notably Classic FM. The fall of communism helped to spread the popularity of Polish music generally, and by 1990 the symphony was being performed in major cities such as New York, London and Sydney. A 1991 recording with the London Sinfonietta, conducted by David Zinman and featuring the soloist Dawn Upshaw, was released in 1992 by the Elektra imprint Nonesuch Records. Within two years, the recording had sold more than 700,000 copies worldwide; the recording climbed to number 6 on the mainstream UK album charts, and while it did not appear on the US Billboard 200, it stayed {{at the top of the}} US classical charts for 38 weeks and stayed on for 138 weeks. The Zinman/Upshaw recording has sold over a million copies. It probably counts as the best selling contemporary classical record of all time.|$|E

Pressed for time as 12:35 approached, O'Brien taped the show outside, after dark, despite the cold weather, on a makeshift set with the Prometheus statue and 30 Rock serving as a backdrop. Furthering the unfortunate nature of the evening's circumstances was the final guest, Julie Scardina, who brought along wild animals, including birds that Conan explained had to be kept tied up, as they could not be freed outside. Earlier in the show, O'Brien and Richter walked into Brookstone (located in the lobby of Rockefeller Center), camera crew in tow, and bought a massaging leather recliner for the first guest, Samuel L.
