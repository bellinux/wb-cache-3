40|$|Background: <b>Perforating</b> {{disorders}} of the skin, is {{an often}} overlooked entity characterized by transepidermal elimination of {{material from the}} upper dermis and are classified histopathologically according {{to the type of}} epidermal disruption {{and the nature of the}} eliminated material. They include Kyrle′s disease, <b>perforating</b> folliculitis, reactive <b>perforating</b> collagenosis, and elastosis perforans serpiginosa. Aim: The aim of this study was to delineate the clinical and histopathological features of <b>perforating</b> disorders of the skin. Materials and Methods: In our study, we reviewed last 2 years skin biopsies received by us. Hematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined and histochemical stainings (elastic van Gieson and Masson trichrome stains) were also used for histopathological evaluation. Results: We reviewed five cases of <b>perforating</b> disorders of skin which included two cases of Kyrle′s disease, two cases of reactive <b>perforating</b> collagenosis and a single case of <b>perforating</b> folliculitis.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesEndoscopic {{ligation}} of <b>perforating</b> veins {{is useful}} in treatment of <b>perforating</b> vein incompetence. Over {{the last few years}} the topic of interest has been the medial side of the lower leg; however, laterally located venous ulcers (10 % of all) are of equal importance. Our poor results with lateral subfascial endoscopic <b>perforating</b> vein surgery (SEPS) procedures led us to study the anatomy of the <b>perforating</b> veins in the lateral leg. The presence of persistent insufficient <b>perforating</b> veins in our patients suggests that our procedure failed because of misinterpreted perforator anatomy. Methods and resultsAnatomic dissection was performed in 16 cadavers in two stages, subcutaneously and subfascially. <b>Perforating</b> veins were classified relative to the short saphenous vein and intermuscular septa, with coordinates. Three hundred fifty-one <b>perforating</b> veins were found, for an average of 21. 9 <b>perforating</b> veins per leg. The results showed that there is alignment of the <b>perforating</b> veins according to the septa between the anterior and peroneal compartment and between the peroneal compartment and the superficial dorsal compartment. Most of the <b>perforating</b> veins did not correlate with the short saphenous vein.

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins play an {{important}} role in the etiologic mechanism of venous ulceration and recurrent varicose veins. The anatomic and functional status of the venous system can be evaluated by duplex ultrasonography. To determine the value of this technique in the identification of competent and incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins, a prospective study was performed. Methods: In patients who underwent subfascial exploration for venous ulceration of the lower leg, the preoperative findings of duplex ultrasonography were compared with the findings at surgical exploration. Results: In 20 consecutive patients, 42 incompetent and 8 competent <b>perforating</b> veins were detected by duplex ultrasonography. During operation the location of all 50 <b>perforating</b> veins appeared to be predicted correctly. Eleven additional <b>perforating</b> veins that had not been detected by duplex ultrasonography were found during operation. The sensitivity and specificity of duplex ultrasonography in predicting the site of <b>perforating</b> veins at the medial side of the lower leg in our study were 79. 2 % and 100 %, respectively, for incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins and 82 % and 100 %, respectively, for competent and incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins. Conclusion: These figures indicate that duplex-guided local exploration of the lower leg in patients with venous ulceration as a result of incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins would miss a substantial number of <b>perforating</b> veins, possibly leading to incomplete healing or recurrent ulceration.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of subfascial endoscopy by use of a mediastinoscope in the identification and ligation of incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins in patients with venous ulceration of the lower leg. Methods: All patients who underwent subfascial endoscopy for venous ulceration between Jan. 1, 1994, and Mar. 1, 1995, at the Sint Franciscus Gasthuis in Rotterdam underwent duplex ultrasound scans of the lower leg before and 6 weeks after operation. The number and localization of the <b>perforating</b> veins on the mediodorsal side were compared with the findings during subfascial endoscopy. Results: In 20 patients, preoperative duplex examination showed 46 incompetent and six competent <b>perforating</b> veins. During operation the site of 43 incompetent and all competent <b>perforating</b> veins was confirmed. Five additional <b>perforating</b> veins were found at operation (false-negatives). Postoperative duplex ultrasound scans showed six incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins (four persisting and two recurring <b>perforating</b> veins) in four patients, of which the ulcers did not heal in three. The ulcers of the other 17 patients healed. Conclusions: Subfascial endoscopy is an efficient technique in identifying incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins in patients with chronic ulceration of the lower leg. The persistence of incompetent <b>perforating</b> veins is related to failure of ulcer healing. (J Vasc Surg 1997 26 : 255 - 9. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Perforating</b> arteries are {{commonly}} involved during the surgical dissection and clipping of intracranial aneurysms. Occlusion of <b>perforating</b> arteries {{is responsible for}} ischemic infarction and poor outcome. The goal {{of this study is}} to describe the usefulness of near-infrared indocyanine green videoangiography (ICGA) for the intraoperative assessment of blood flow in <b>perforating</b> arteries that are visible in the surgical field during clipping of intracranial aneurysms. In addition, we analyzed the incidence of <b>perforating</b> vessels involved during the aneurysm surgery and the incidence of ischemic infarct caused by compromised small arteries. METHODS: Sixty patients with 64 aneurysms were surgically treated and prospectively included in this study. Intraoperative ICGA was performed using a surgical microscope (Carl Zeiss Co., Oberkochen, Germany) with integrated ICGA technology. The presence and involvement of <b>perforating</b> arteries were analyzed in the microsurgical field during surgical dissection and clip application. Assessment of vascular patency after clipping was also investigated. Only those small arteries that were not visible on preoperative digital subtraction angiography were considered for analysis. RESULTS: The ICGA was able to visualize flow in all patients in whom <b>perforating</b> vessels were found in the microscope field. Among 36 patients whose <b>perforating</b> vessels were visible on ICGA, 11 (30 %) presented a close relation between the aneurysm and <b>perforating</b> arteries. In one (9 %) of these 11 patients, ICGA showed occlusion of a P 1 <b>perforating</b> artery after clip application, which led to immediate correction of the clip confirmed by immediate reestablishment of flow visible with ICGA without clinical consequences. Four patients (6. 7 %) presented with postoperative <b>perforating</b> artery infarct, three of whom had <b>perforating</b> arteries that were not visible or distant from the aneurysm. CONCLUSION: The involvement of <b>perforating</b> arteries during clip application for aneurysm occlusion is a usual finding. Intraoperative ICGA may provide visual information with regard to the patency of these small vessels...|$|R

5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a <b>perforated</b> steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E
