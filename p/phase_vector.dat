40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} for image reconstruction from local phase vectors in the monogenic scale space. The local <b>phase</b> <b>vector</b> contains {{not only the}} local phase but also the local orientation of the original signal, which enables the simultaneous estimation of the structural and geometric information. Consequently, the local <b>phase</b> <b>vector</b> preserves a lot of important information of the original signal. Image reconstruction from the local phase vectors can be easily and quickly implemented in the monogenic scale space by a coarse to fine way. Experimental results illustrate that an image can be accurately reconstructed based on the local <b>phase</b> <b>vector.</b> In contrast to the reconstruction from zero crossings, our approach is proved to be stable. Due to the local orientation adaptivity of the local <b>phase</b> <b>vector,</b> the presented approach gives a better result when {{compared with that of}} the Gabor phase based reconstruction. ...|$|E

40|$|Edge Detection Methods Based on Differential Phase Congruency of Monogenic Image Abstract: Edge {{detection}} {{has been}} widely used in medical image processing and automatic diagnosis. Some novel edge detection algorithms,based on the monogenic scale-space, are proposed by detecting points of local extrema in local amplitude, the local attenuation and modified differential phase congruency methods. The monogenic scale-space is obtained from a known image by Poisson and conjugate Poisson filtering. In mathematics, it is the Hardy space in the upper half-space. The boundary value of the monogenic scale-space representation is a monogenic image. In the monogenic scale-space, the definitions involving scale, such as local amplitude,local attenuation, local phase angle, local <b>phase</b> <b>vector</b> and local frequency (phase derivatives) are proposed. Using Clifford analysis, {{the relations between the}} local attenuation and the local <b>phase</b> <b>vector</b> are obtained. These study will be improved the understanding of image analysis in higher dimensional spaces. Experimental results are shown by using some typical images. Comment: 18 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

Also, PTS needs M times IDFT operations for each data block, and the number of required side information bits is log 2 (KM- 1) to send to the receiver.

As measuring devices of microsatellite positions are used magnetometer and Sun sensor. The magnetometer and Sun sensor model of measuring is also examined in variations. On the basis of the got relationships the algorithm of extended Kalman filteris offered, for the estimation of efficiency of which the design of microsatellite motion is executed. Efficiency of using of the extended and linear Kalman filters is compared in microsatellitecontrol system.
