50|$|The 1/8 rate gating on {{the reverse}} {{fundamental}} channel (R-FCH) is the method used for gated transmission in a CDMA communication system. A mobile station (mobile phone) in the CDMA communication system transmits a reverse <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> at a reverse gating rate which is different from a forward gating rate in a gated mode, and a base station transmits a forward <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> at the forward gating rate different from the forward gating rate in a gated mode.|$|E

5000|$|In telecommunications, a <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> is a signal, {{usually a}} single frequency, {{transmitted}} over a communications system for supervisory, control, equalization, continuity, synchronization, or reference purposes.|$|E
30|$|Note that {{to perform}} {{decoding}} of the contending signals, the receiver (BS) {{has to get}} {{the identity of the}} contending devices to estimate the channel matrices from them. In this regard, we assume that all devices have orthogonal <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> and that channels are perfectly acquired at the receiver side. The effect of a limited number of orthogonal <b>pilot</b> <b>signals,</b> non-orthogonal <b>pilot</b> <b>signals,</b> and imperfectly acquired channels is out of the scope of the paper and is left as interesting future work.|$|R
30|$|More {{sophisticated}} {{versions of}} this attack have been proposed, targeting the downlink <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> used by the UE to estimate the channel for signal equalization[17]. However, Release 10 of the LTE standard covers the concepts of heterogeneous networks (HetNets), with strong enhancements in the <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> to avoid strong interference between the pilots sent by different overlaying cells (macrocells and pico/femto/metrocells)[18]. As {{a consequence of the}} inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) efforts of Release 10, the downlink (DL) <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> might experience an enhancement in their resiliency against jamming.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} {{high performance}} systems utilizing smart antenna transmission techniques, increased <b>pilot</b> <b>signaling</b> becomes problematic when more transmit antennas are added. Herein, we propose a scheme where the <b>pilot</b> <b>signaling</b> {{is restricted to}} {{a subset of the}} transmit antennas, and the total signal strength of these antennas is fed back to the transmitter. This potentially reduces the required <b>pilot</b> <b>signaling</b> and feedback so it becomes comparable to that of single antenna systems. By combining the feedback with channel statistics, known to the transmitter, substantial spatial information is gained. Herein, this information is used to develop elaborate scheduling and beamforming techniques. I...|$|R

3000|$|... 7 It {{is to be}} {{emphasized}} that we use packet preamble for packet detection, OFDM symbol timing determination, carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation, and channel estimation. No separate <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> of any patterns or any <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> embedded {{as a part of}} the desired signal are used for symbol timing determination, CFO estimation, and channel estimation.|$|R
25|$|Some of the sub-carriers {{in some of}} the OFDM symbols {{may carry}} <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> for {{measurement}} of the channel conditions (i.e., the equalizer gain and phase shift for each sub-carrier). <b>Pilot</b> <b>signals</b> and training symbols (preambles) may also be used for time synchronization (to avoid intersymbol interference, ISI) and frequency synchronization (to avoid inter-carrier interference, ICI, caused by Doppler shift).|$|R
30|$|In both {{conventional}} (without relaying) {{and cooperative}} (relay-assisted) networks, different users' <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> {{are separated by}} orthogonal frequencies or different time slots to avoid interference as shown in [20, 21]. However, in ANC, the users transmit simultaneously during the first time slot, and, {{as a result of}} this, the <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> interfere with each other. Consequently, the relay cannot estimate the CSIs of different users.|$|R
50|$|The control <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> is {{designed}} to be easily processed by analog electronics, eliding the use of digital electronics, which can be unreliable in automotive settings. The EVSE starts in state A and applies +12 V to the control pilot. On detecting 2.74 kΩ across CP and PE, the EVSE moves to state B, and applies a 1 kHz ±12 V peak-to-peak square wave <b>pilot</b> <b>signal.</b> The EV can then request charging by changing the resistance across CP and PE to 246 Ω or 882 Ω (with and without ventilation, respectively); if the EV requests ventilation, the EVSE will only enable charging if it is in a ventilated area. The EVSE communicates the maximum available charging current to the EV by pulse width modulation of the pilot signal: 16% duty cycle is 10 A, 25% is 16 A, 50% is 32 A, and 90% flags a fast charge option. The line wires are not made live until an EV is present, and has requested charging; i.e., state C or D.|$|E
50|$|Analog QAM {{suffers from}} the same problem as Single-sideband modulation: the exact phase of the carrier is {{required}} for correct demodulation at the receiver. If the demodulating phase is even a little off, it results in crosstalk between the modulated signals. This issue of carrier synchronization at the receiver must be handled somehow in QAM systems. The coherent demodulator needs to be exactly in phase with the received signal, or otherwise the modulated signals cannot be independently received. This is achieved typically by transmitting a burst subcarrier or a <b>Pilot</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Middle 20th century analog carrier systems had Carrier Group Alarms {{by which}} {{the failure of a}} <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> was alerted to {{telephone}} exchange equipment, imposing an automated make-busy condition so the trunks carried by the failed system would not be used. The improved AIS originated with the T-carrier system, and became a standard feature of subsequent plesiochronous and synchronous circuit-based communication systems, and is also part of the ATM standards.As the use of Ethernet for long-distance data links has increased, the need for a similar end-to-end OA&M function has {{led to the development of}} a similar Ethernet alarm indication signal (EthAIS).|$|E

Phone networks use this system to identify an individual subscriber. The device emits a <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> made to appear stronger than that from the service provider cell tower, which forces all phones within its range to broadcast their IMSI number and electronic serial number (ESN). Encryption does not prevent this process. Furthermore, the devices can retrieve the encryption session keys for a cellphone {{in less than a}} second with success rates of 50 to 75% (in real world conditions)".|$|E

Striped border effects, as used in the standard loader or more complex ones (see below) {{can also be found}} on games written for other 8-bit computers, such as the Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128 (which, as it used the same CPU, often received ports of loading routines originally for the Spectrum) and the Commodore C64/128.|$|E

5000|$|In 1958, Harman Kardon {{introduced}} one of {{the first}} stereo receivers, the Festival TA230, once again aimed at non-technical users with the intention of making high-fidelity stereo widely available. Stereo sound was achieved by using one channel from the AM band, and one channel from the FM band. This early form of stereophonic reception was called simulcast stereo. Early FM broadcast signals did not have the stereo carrier (<b>pilot)</b> <b>signal</b> that carried the stereo left and right channels. After the stereo signal standard was established, a stereo multiplex circuit connected to or built into the receiver was used to decode the stereo signal. (The first true FM Multiplex Stereo Receiver was sold by H.H. Scott in 1961 with introduction of the Model 350 tuner.) ...|$|E
50|$|A first-order low or {{high pass}} filter has a {{standard}} response curve which reduces the unwanted frequencies well above or below the cutoff frequency with a slope of 6 dB per octave. A second-order filter will reduce those frequencies with a slope of 12 dB per octave and moreover may be designed with a higher Q or finite zeros in order to effect an even steeper response around the cutoff frequency. For instance, a second-order low-pass notch filter section only reduces (rather than eliminates) very high frequencies, but has a steep response falling to zero at a specific frequency (the so-called notch frequency). Such a filter might be ideal, for instance, in completely removing the 19 kHz FM stereo subcarrier <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> while helping to cut even higher frequency subcarrier components remaining from the stereo demultiplexer.|$|E
5000|$|MTS features, {{including}} {{stereo and}} SAP, travel on subcarriers {{of the video}} carrier, much like color for television. It is not carried on the audio carrier {{in the manner of}} stereo sound for an FM radio broadcast, however, as it only has a frequency deviation of ±25 kHz, whereas regular FM broadcasting has a deviation of ±75 kHz. The SAP subcarrier is located at 78.670 kHz, which is five times the 15.734 kHz corresponding to the MTS <b>pilot</b> <b>signal.</b> In turn, the MTS pilot is locked to the horizontal sync frequency of the video carrier for stability. The SAP channel contains mono audio which has been dbx-encoded for noise reduction, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The SAP audio has a bandpass from 60 Hz to 12 kHz, which is less than the [...] "regular" [...] audio channel which runs from 50 Hz to 15 kHz.|$|E

5000|$|A {{distributed}} approach for interference networks with link rates that {{are determined by}} the signal-to-noise-plus-interefernce ratio (SINR) can be carried out using randomization. [...] Each node randomly decides to transmit every slot t (transmitting a [...] "null" [...] packet if it currently does nothave a packet to send). The actual transmission rates, and the corresponding actual packets to send,are determined by a 2-step handshake:On the first step, the randomly selected transmitter nodes send a <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> with signal strength proportionalto that of an actual transmission. On the second step,all potential receiver nodes measure the resulting interference and send that information back to thetransmitters. The SINR levels for all outgoing links (n,b) are then known to all nodes n,and each node n can decideits [...] and [...] variables based on this information.The resulting throughput is not necessarily optimal. However, the random transmission process {{can be viewed as a}} part of the channel state process (provided that null packets are sent in cases of underflow, so that the channel state process does not depend on past decisions). Hence, the resulting throughput of this distributed implementation is optimal over the class of all routing and scheduling algorithms that use such randomized transmissions.|$|E
