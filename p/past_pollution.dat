40|$|For {{more than}} ten years, {{formerly}} centrally-planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have endeavoured to redress their environmental problems. For most CEE countries, the record of accomplishments is mixed. One of the least successful areas of reform has been cleanup and restoration of state-owned properties that were severely contaminated during the Communist era. In the early 1990 s, concern was expressed that prospective foreign investors would shy away from these damaged properties for fear of incurring liabilities for cleanup and third party damages. The authors show that while aggregate levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) to CEE have not been greatly affected by environmental liability, prospective foreign purchasers have avoided investing in dirty industries and in sites harbouring serious contamination. To manage the cleanup of <b>past</b> <b>pollution</b> effectively, CEE governments must consider prospects for brownfields revitalisation. The authors have shown previously that the public resource requirements for brownfields revitalisation are impractical in the CEE context. In light of these constraints, in the near future, the most promising sources of financing for cleanup of <b>past</b> <b>pollution</b> are from external public actors. Several of these actors and their relevant programs are considered...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{ambient air}} {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} and common public health concern associated with growing morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the last decades, the adverse effects of air pollution on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems have been well established {{in a series of}} major epidemiological and observational studies. In the recent <b>past,</b> air <b>pollution</b> has also been associated with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders. It has been demonstrated that various components of air pollution, such as nanosized particles, can easily translocate to the CNS where they can activate innate immune responses. Furthermore, systemic inflammation arising from the pulmonary or cardiovascular system can affect CNS health. Despite intense studies on the health effects of ambient air pollution, the underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests that air pollution-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, microglial activation, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and alterations in the blood-brain barrier contribute to CNS pathology. A better understanding of the mediators and mechanisms will enable the development of new strategies to protect individuals at risk and to reduce detrimental effects of air pollution on the nervous system and mental health...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Phthalate Acid Esters (PAE), {{commonly}} named Phthalates, are toxics {{classified as}} endocrine-disrupting compounds; they are primarily used as additives {{to improve the}} flexibility in polyvinyl chloride. Occurrence: Many studies have reported the occurrence of phthalates in different environmental matrices, however none of these studies has yet establish a complete overview for those compounds in the water cycle within an urban environment. This review summarizes PAE concentrations for all environmental media throughout the water cycle, from atmosphere to receiving waters. Once the occurrences of compounds have been evaluated for each environmental compartment (urban wastewater, wastewater treatment plants, atmosphere and the natural environment), data are reviewed {{in order to identify}} the fate of PAE in the environment and establish whether geographical and historical trends exist. Indeed, geographical and historical trends appear between Europe and other countries such as USA/Canada and China, however they remain location-dependent. Discussion: This study aimed at identifying both the correlations existing between environmental compartments and the processes influencing the fate and transport of these contaminants into the environment. In Europe, the concentrations measured in waterways today represent the background level of contamination, which provides evidence of a <b>past</b> diffuse <b>pollution.</b> In contrast, an increasing trend has actually been observed for developing countries, especially for China...|$|R

The proposed DDH mechanism enables participating nodes to self-decide whether {{to process the}} received data or not, thus, reducing the on-board processing load.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} dealing with traditional water-monitoring methods {{is the need to}} collect water samples at the precise moment that faecal contamination is actually present; for this reason, the use of Mytilus galloprovincialis as an indicator of previously high bacteria concentrations in coastal seawaters was examined. These molluscs are able to integrate the fluctuations in pollutants, they are good representatives of the sampling area because they are sedentary, and they offer the advantage of being resistant to pollution. The research was conducted from September 2001 to October 2002, twice a month, in two coastal areas of Salento (Apulia, Italy), near the discharge channels. We analysed both natural and cultivated mussels. The latter were placed in cages, after checking their starting level of microbiological pollution. Bacteriological analyses were conducted simultaneously on mussels and their ambient water to detect total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The abundance of bacteria investigated was always higher within mussels than in the surrounding water where levels were sometimes undetectable. These results confirm the ability of mussels to concentrate and to retain bacteria into their tissues (recorders of present or even <b>past</b> microbiological <b>pollution).</b> Therefore, mussels can enable to detect a bacterial contamination that might be missed by standard water-monitoring methods, and we suggest they be included in routine microbiological investigations of coastal seawaters even in areas where these species aren’t widely distributed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Not {{long after}} Franklin’s iconic studies, an {{atmospheric}} electric field {{was discovered in}} “fair weather” regions, well away from thunderstorms. The origin of the fair weather field was sought by Lord Kelvin, through development of electrostatic instrumentation and early data logging techniques, but was ultimately explained through the global circuit model of C.

New insights into the relevance of fair weather atmospheric electricity to terrestrial and planetary atmospheres are now emerging. For example, there is a possible role of the global circuit current density in atmospheric processes, such as cloud formation.
