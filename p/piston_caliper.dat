50|$|Early {{versions}} had conventional suspension, {{consisting of}} hydraulically damped telescoping front forks and dual coil-over shocks at the rear. Later versions had air-assisted forks and featured Honda's Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension. US bikes (except GL500I, GL650I and Turbo) were {{equipped with a}} single front disc brake whereas all other bike possess dual front disc brakes. Besides the 'vanilla' CX500B, models after 1980 sport dual piston calipers replacing the single <b>piston</b> <b>caliper</b> of the earlier models. For the Turbo and Eurosport models the rear drum was replaced with a dual <b>piston</b> <b>caliper</b> and disc. All models feature steel tube frames with a large backbone, with the engine used as a stressed member. The dual shock models use a single tube backbone whereas the later Pro-Link models employed a triple tube backbone.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} and second iteration, the bike had a 270 mm single disc with dual piston {{calipers}} in the front and a 220 mm single disc single <b>piston</b> <b>caliper</b> at the rear, both the brake systems being made by Nissin of Japan. The front suspension was a twin telescopic fork and the rear is a linked type single shock suspension. The bike has dual headlights like the other bikes of the YZF-R series.|$|E
50|$|Key {{differences}} between the X-Runner and the other packages include tweaks to the suspension, hood scoop, ground effects kit, driving lights, sports wheel and tires, and a 3.15 final drive ratio (3.73 for V6 PreRunner and 4X4). Toyota added a rear-mounted X-Brace to stiffen up the rear end (hence the name X-Runner). The chassis was further stiffened by adding two more support braces to the frame. An optional big brake kit by TRD is also available on the X-Runner; which consists of a 332 mm slotted rotor and 4 <b>piston</b> <b>caliper.</b> The BBK (big brake kit) was designed by StopTech.

50|$|The front brakes {{remained}} as 4 opposed <b>piston</b> <b>calipers</b> but the trailing pistons were increased in diameter from 25.4 mm to 27 mm (the leading pistons remained at 30 mm).|$|R
50|$|The {{front brake}} rotors of the RC45 were 310 mm in {{diameter}} and are actually the same rotors and hats as used on the NR750. A four piston two piece opposed <b>piston</b> <b>caliper</b> was used along with asbestos-free pads. The rear brake used a 220 mm rotor and Nissin two piston sliding caliper also fitted with asbestos-free pads. This caliper was used on many different Hondas including the RC45’s little brother, the NC35 RVF400. There is nothing special about the brakes other than they were adequate for the time; many have later installed Brembo brakes or if the budget doesn’t stretch that far, the excellent Nissin caliper used on the 954 Fireblade and SP-1 VTR1000 can be bolted straight up with a marked improvement in braking response and feel.|$|E
40|$|The mode of {{vibration}} of a noisy {{disc brake}} is always diametral with a noise frequency marginally less than the free {{mode of vibration}} of the disc. Wheel speed {{does not affect the}} frequency but if brake pressure is altered then the noise frequency changes accordingly an increasing pressure resulting in an increasing frequency over a specified range. Such observations have been made of a variety of different disc brake designs from single piston sliding fist type calipers to four piston opposed rigid calipers with it being possible to relate the noise frequency to the free mode of vibration of the disc in all cases. If the characteristics controlling this behavior can be identified then the same principles and criteria may be used to predict the noise propensity of any brake at the design stage. The paper proposes, and shows, that the preferred frequencies of excitation of any disc brake system may be related directly to the free mode frequency of the disc. In addition it is shown that the interface geometry of the pad, the effective rubbing diameter of the disc and the effective working length of the pad are all important features regarding the frequency generated. It is demonstrated that this relationship allows the probable instability frequencies of a disc brake to be predicted and shows that the frequency will vary over a computable range {{as a result of the}} brake pressure. The principle is successfully extended to consider a braking system arrangement employing two calipers working on one wheel. The proposal suggests that brake noise be as much a basic design problem as a material selection problem and answers questions such as why chamfers on pads changes the propensity of a noisy brake to generate noise. A case study of a heavy vehicle using a four opposed <b>piston</b> <b>caliper</b> on the rear and a pair of four opposed piston calipers on each front wheel goes some way to validate the proposal. The study and tests show that angular positioning of the front wheel caliper pair has a significant influence on the propensity of the brake to generate noise and the frequencies that were subsequently emitte...|$|E

50|$|Often used in disc brakes, {{the brake}} caliper {{assembly}} consists {{of one to}} two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel <b>pistons</b> (<b>caliper</b> <b>pistons).</b> Brake <b>calipers</b> {{are one of the}} most important parts of a vehicle and are essential for your car's ability to stop.The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels using the friction they create with metal disks (rotors). They work by taking the pressure given by the master cylinder to force the pistons against the rotor. The development and use of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902. In a disc-braking system the rotors are attached to the car's wheels and spin together.|$|R
