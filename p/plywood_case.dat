5000|$|As of 2003, {{the store}} was the [...] "oldest active {{business}} in town," [...] according to the St. Petersburg Times, which added:The reluctance to modernize is evident everywhere. The ceiling is high, made of elaborately patterned tin {{and in need of}} paint. The freight elevator {{in the back of the}} store is powered by hand.A tall, darkly stained <b>plywood</b> <b>case</b> that holds bolts and screws in its dozens of drawers, was built, according to a little brass label on one corner, by A.R. Brown on May 7, 1901.|$|E
50|$|The Model 52 mine is a Swedish {{circular}} <b>plywood</b> <b>cased</b> anti-tank blast mine. It is {{in service}} with the Swedish army. The mine can be {{fitted with a}} number of different fuzes and pressure plates including a three pronged plate and a pentagonal pressure spider and a tilt-rod fuze.|$|R

50|$|Confined {{more or less}} to the Vaikom area of the district, is a {{thriving}} coir processing industry, processing coir and making coir products. Consisting of more than twenty co-operatives, it employs around 20,000 people. In the hand loom sector, eight co-operative societies provide employment to 2100 persons. The district has a rich forest wealth with good availability of softwood and other varieties of timber providing raw material {{for a number of}} small enterprises in the production of <b>plywood,</b> packing <b>cases,</b> splints, veneers and furniture.|$|R
3000|$|The {{conducted}} {{comparative analysis}} shows {{the need to}} use the formulae presented in the paper instead of those found in the literature. As was shown, this is particularly important in case of columns with small slenderness and cross-section, composite wide I-sections and wide box sections made of wood and <b>plywood.</b> In this <b>case,</b> the percentage differences between the compared factors k [...]...|$|R
40|$|The Chair Archive study expands on from 'Sustaining Desire, the Chair as Cultural, Ecological and Visual Narrative an AHRB Innovation Award {{research}} project jointly developed by Ralph Ball and Maxine Naylor. It also makes an alternative proposition to our recent deconstructive study Chair Anatomy and extends our investigation into how reflective design articulated directly through artefacts {{may be used}} rhetorically to bring sustainable issues and a revaluing what we already have into critical focus. Where Chair Anatomy dissects, Chair Archive encloses. In Chair Archive a random collection of discarded chairs are partially encased and re-presented to frame questions about our relationship to obsolescence, sustainability and value. 7 well-used, abandoned chairs are each ambiguously ‘contained’ in <b>plywood</b> <b>cases.</b> The encasing follows, {{with varying degrees of}} coverage, the rudimentary contours of each selected chair. The ambiguity of the relationship of case to content is exploited to stimulate speculation. Are they archaeological specimens, packing cases, cocoons, embryos or the skins of newer chairs growing over older ones? In consequence each study draws contrasting attention simultaneously to the underlying generic chair form and to the unique patina of each particular chair. The paradoxical uniqueness of the mass produced object is preserved and celebrated. An experimental method, analogous to the way that nature ‘archives’ the man made by ‘covering over’, was used. Abandoned chairs metaphorically lost from appreciation because of their ‘dead’ condition were, in a kind of structural mummification, blurred and constructed over in order to re-mystify and re-engage interest. Archival encasing presents the chair as both object and museum. A paradoxical 'enclose to expose', 'conceal to reveal' strategy evolved. Chair parts displayed and covered were specifically responsive to the examined object’s formal nature enabling newly visible chair constructs and embodying authentic visual narratives...|$|R
5000|$|To protect {{themselves}} from these threats, American troops began reinforcing their Humvees, LMTVs and other vehicles with whatever was available, including scrap metal, kevlar blankets and vests, compromised ballistic glass and <b>plywood.</b> In some <b>cases</b> they relied on Iraqis {{to assist them in}} these efforts, and referred to the result as [...] "Hajji" [...] armour. They were also officially advised to line the floors of their Humvees with sandbags to deaden the impact of land mine explosions.|$|R
40|$|Green roofs {{on top of}} the {{commonly}} used roofing system design are becoming mandatory in major cities around the world 1. One of the potential benefits of green roofs is touted to be the noise reduction of the added mass of the green roof structure. The transmission class of the green roofs has become a major research project in acoustics 2, 3. There are also skeptics who question the noise reduction potential of green roofs 4. A model of an extensive green roof was investigated as to its noise reduction potential as part of an undergraduate thesis. Details of green roof types are presented in Lagstorm 4. The noise reduction of different layers of the green roofs was measured in a mock-up 2 m X 2 m green roof model. The results of the noise measurement are presented in this paper. 2. THE EXPERIMENT The green roof mock-up is shown in Figure 1. A cube of two metres is built as a box with a parapet to include green roof details on the top. An access door is also built {{into the side of the}} box to place a sound source within it. Images of the different layers that constitute green roof body are also shown in Figures (b) and (c). The two base cases of the set-up consist of a typical roof over the <b>plywood</b> roof-deck. Base <b>case</b> 1 consists of a 2 ” thick extruded polystyrene insulation, water proofing membrane and thick gravel. Base case 2 increases the insulation to 4 ” thick extruded membrane. 2. 1 Green Roof Details Three configurations of the extensive green roofs were tested in the current experiment. The green roof consists of: 2 ” retention panels (Figure 1 b); bio-void, bio filter cloth (Figure 1 c); 2 ” (or 4 ” or 6 ”) layer of Bio-Mix Ecoblend soil. The green roof details are shown in Figure 2. Only two of the three extensive green roof configurations are shown in Figure 2...|$|R
