40|$|The {{present study}} investigates why some women, {{before and during}} delivering, request <b>peridural</b> <b>analgesia</b> or, on the contrary, refuse it. On {{the basis of a}} {{literature}} review and of an empiricial study involving 57 women, a psychological differentiation is attempted to discriminate users from non-users of <b>peridural</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Pain perceptions, health locus of control, when internal (IHLC), family and couple adaptability appear to be discriminating factors. Our results indicate a higher chance locus of control (externality) in non-users then in users, as well as a more rigid couple functioning. The incidence of Internal Health Locus of Control of pain perception is outlined...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{maternal}} and perinatal results, after {{the use of}} continuous peridural versus combined rachidian and <b>peridural</b> <b>analgesia</b> in primiparous parturients. METHODS: Randomized clinical trial with 128 primiparous pregnant women in labor, divided into two groups: <b>peridural</b> <b>analgesia</b> (CPA) with 65 women, and combined continuous rachidian and <b>peridural</b> <b>analgesia</b> (CRPA) with 63, all of them admitted in the pre-labor period at two maternities in Jundiai, {{in the state of}} São Paulo. The variables studied were: latency of analgesia onset, pain intensity, total time until complete dilation, Apgar index at the first and fifth minutes, labor duration, degree of motor blockade, adverse effects such as vomiting, pruritus, arterial hypotension and degree of maternal fulfillment. Inclusion criteria were: primiparous, physical condition ASA 1 and 2, an only foetus, cephalic presentation, term delivery, 3 to 6 cm cervical dilation, and analgesia required by the obstetritian. Women with morbidity, membrane rupture, fetal abnormality and use of opioids up to four hours before were excluded. The Mann-Whitney test was used for the statistical analysis of non-parametric continuous variables, and Fisher's exact and Pearson's χ tests, for the categoric variables. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups concerning the length of cervical dilation, labor duration, maternal hemodynamic parameters, newborn vitality, analgesic complementation during labor and type of delivery. Analgesia onset was quicker in the CRPA group, and the CPA group presented less motor blockade. Differences concerning adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and hypotension have not been observed, but hypotension was more frequent in the CPA group (6. 3 versus 3. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques have proved to be safe and efficient, but CRP has provided an earlier onset, with quicker pain relief. The lesser motor blockade in the CPA group has allowed the parturients more active movements in bed and more effective collaboration during the expulsion period. Most women were pleased with the analgesia they got. The doses of local anesthetics and opioids used in both analgesic techniques and the complementary doses, equal in both groups, neither had any significant adverse effect nor affected newborn vitality...|$|E

40|$|A s(+) cetamina Ã o isÃmero levÃgiro da cetamina, antagonista do {{receptor}} NMDA para glutamato que estÃ envolvido na gÃnese e manutenÃÃo do processo doloroso. A analgesia multimodal consiste na utilizaÃÃo de combinaÃÃo de fÃrmacos objetivando controle adequado da dor com reduÃÃo dos efeitos adversos. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar a eficiÃncia da s(+) cetamina isoladamente e da associaÃÃo morfina/cetamina comparadas Ã morfina isoladamente combinadas a mistura enantiomÃrica de bupivacaÃna (R 75 l 25 %) na anestesia <b>peridural</b> e <b>analgesia</b> pÃs-operatÃria em pacientes submetidas Ã histerectomia abdominal. Foi realizado estudo prospectivo, duplo cego e aleatÃrio, com aprovaÃÃo do ComitÃ de Ãtica e Pesquisa da Universidade Federal do CearÃ. Participaram do estudo 36 pacientes ASA I ou II com idade de 20 a 60 anos submetidas Ã histerectomia abdominal com anestesia peridural. As pacientes foram alocadas em trÃs grupos: Grupo 1 - Grupo Cetamina (GC) : administraÃÃo de mistura enantiomÃtrica (R 75 -S 25) de bupivacaÃna associada Ã s(+) cetamina; Grupo 2 â Grupo Morfina (GM) : administraÃÃo de mistura enantiomÃtrica (R 75 -S 25) de bupivacaÃna associada Ã morfina e Grupo 3 - Grupo Cetamina/Morfina(GCM) : administraÃÃo de mistura enantiomÃtrica (R 75 -S 25) de bupivacaÃna associada Ã morfina e s(+) cetamina. Foram avaliados nÃvel de bloqueio motor e sensitivo, grau de sedaÃÃo e parÃmetros hemodinÃmicos: pressÃo arterial e frequÃncia cardÃaca a cada 15 minutos durante a cirurgia. No perÃodo pÃs-operatÃrio foi avaliado o consumo de analgÃsicos em 6 e 24 horas, alÃm da incidÃncia de nÃuseas, vÃmitos e prurido. A anÃlise estatÃstica foi realizada utilizando os softwares graphpad prisma 4. 0 e Excel 2007. NÃo houve diferenÃa entre a idade, tempo cirÃrgico e o estado fÃsico (ASA) entre os grupos (p< 0, 05). A frequÃncia cardÃaca e pressÃo arterial mantiveram-se dentro dos valores estabelecidos como normal sem variaÃÃo significativa entre os grupos. A avaliaÃÃo da incidÃncia de efeitos adversos (nÃuseas, vÃmitos e prurido) nÃo foi diferente entre os grupos. A analgesia pÃs-operatÃria avaliada por consumo de analgÃsicos nas primeiras 6 horas nÃo foi diferente entre os grupos. Houve maior grau de bloqueio motor no grupo Cetamorf no tempo T 15. Houve conversÃo para anestesia geral em 4 pacientes por falha de bloqueio, nos grupos cetamina-morfina (02 pacientes) e morfina (02 pacientes). Os dados sugerem que a adiÃÃo de s(+) cetamina e morfina nas doses avaliadas Ã segura, eficaz e permite a reduÃÃo de 50 % na dose da morfina epidural mantendo-se o perfil de controle de dor no pÃs operatÃrio. No entanto, nÃo se verificou reduÃÃo da incidÃncia de nÃuseas, vÃmitos e prurido. The {{association of}} drugs with different mechanisms of action in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord decreases postoperative pain, with {{a reduction in the}} incidence of side effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate some intraoperative parameters as well as postoperative analgesia and sedation by epidural morphine, S(+) ketamine and S(+) ketamine- morphine associated with Bupivacaine Enantiomeric Mixture (R 75 L 25 %) for abdominal hysterectomy. In this prospective, randomized, and double-blinded clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of the administration of epidural S(+) ketamine alone or with morphine were compared with epidural morphine alone (control group) for efficacy and safety comparisons after abdominal hysterectomy. 36 female patients, physical status ASA I and II, participated in this study. These patients were randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups for having the following drugs administered epidurally: 1. Ketamine Group - Bupivacaine Enantiomeric Mixture (R 75 L 25 %) associated with S(+) ketamine (0. 4 mg. kg- 1); 2. Ketamine-Morphine Group - Bupivacaine Enantiomeric Mixture (R 75 L 25 %) associated S(+) ketamine (0. 4 mg. kg- 1) and morphine (1 mg) 3. Morphine Group, Bupivacaine Enantiomeric Mixture (R 75 L 25 %) was associated with morphine (2 mg). During the intraoperative period the parameters analyzed were: blood pressure, heart rate, motor blockade level, sensitive level, intraoperative use of vasoconstrictor and sedation level. The time interval between each dada collection was 15 minutes. In the postoperative period, analgesia were evaluated using analogue visual scale 2 h, 6 h and 24 h after the end of the surgery as well as the total amount of analgesics drugs requirement during the first 24 postoperative hours. Values were analyzed statistically using GraphPad Prisma 4. 0 and Excel 2007. There were no differences between the three groups with respect to age, sex, weight, or duration of the surgical procedures (p< 0, 05). No differences were found between the groups during intraoperative analysis related to blood pressure, heart rate, Ramsay scores, vasoconstrictor use, and sensitive blockade level. Bromageâs scores were lower in the morpine/s+ketamine group during the first fifteen minutes analysis. Sedation scores were similar in both groups. The epidural blockade alone was not enough for surgical anesthesia resulting in conversion to general anesthesia in 4 patients who belong to Ketamine-morphine (02 patients) and Morphine (02 patients) groups, respectively. None of the patients in either group developed respiratory depression. Other side effects, such as pruritus, nausea, and vomiting, were also similar in both groups. The addiction of s(+) ketamine was safety and efficient to Bupivacaine Enantiomeric Mixture (R 75 L 25 %) in comparison with morphine...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of peridural anaesthesia (PDA) on foetal vital parameters for the periods of 1998 - 2000 (I) and 2009 - 2010 (II), using material from the Frauenklinik (women’s clinic) at the Klinikum Berlin Lichtenberg hospital. During these periods of investigation, the number of births at the Frauenklinik Berlin Lichtenberg rose from around 1, 500 /year (I) to approximately 2, 400 /year (II). The {{mean age of the}} mothers rose by 1. 3 years, from 26. 7 (I) to 28 (II) years. The mean age of first-time mothers rose during this period from 24. 6 (I) to 26. 6 (II) years. These increases in age between the two periods are significant. Reflecting the general trend, the use of peridural anaesthesia to control pain increased significantly within the two periods of investigation by 3. 9 % for (I) and by 15. 8 % for (II). Patients who received PDA were on average younger, had fewer children (80 % were first-time mothers), had longer pregnancies (4 days), and gave birth to considerably larger children (+ 91 g) than those in the non-PDA group. Delivery times for PDA patients were significantly longer, namely on average two to three times longer. Under these specific conditions (younger mothers, longer pregnancies, etc.) the foetal outcomes of umbilical cord pH, ABE (actual base excess), and APGAR 1 and 5 for the group of all children born under PDA (n= 833) were significantly lower on average than for the group of all children born without PDA (including caesarean sections) (n= 8314) in this study. The two cohorts did not show significant differences for APGAR 10. All the mean outcome parameters for the two cohorts lay within the medically normative range. For the subsequent propensity-score analysis the maximum number of matched pairs was found for patients with and without PDA (n= 718 each). The following key factors of influence for the birth process were selected: mother’s age, number of births, pregnancy duration, child’s weight, delivery duration; the starting conditions also showed a greater percentage of (secondary) caesarean sections and breech presentations. The foetal outcome parameters of the children from these 718 matched pairs were analysed. No significant differences appeared between the two cohorts for any of the years under study. All of the outcome parameters: umbilical cord pH, ABE, APGAR 1, 5 and 10 for the PDA and non-PDA groups were equally good. Given these results, this study indicates that PDA has no effect, and in particular no negative effect, on foetal outcome. Especially for pregnancies of longer duration, for children expected to be of large size and for the understandable desire for a normal vaginal delivery, factors in favour of this process include not only the wish to control pain but also the uncomplicated transition from <b>peridural</b> <b>analgesia</b> to peridural anaesthesia as well as the option of a caesarean section under peridural regional anaesthesia...|$|E
