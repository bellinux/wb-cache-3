Apu {{explains}} that if Proposition 24 passes, he will have to leave the United States, as his visa expired many years earlier. Apu is forced to go to Fat Tony to obtain a false United States citizenship. However, feeling guilty and embarrassed about taking the fraudulent route, he realizes he has disgraced his <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> turning his back on his Indian heritage, and tears up the fake passport.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu scriptures stress Rati's {{beauty and}} sensuality. They depict {{her as a}} maiden who {{has the power to}} enchant the god of love. When the god Shiva burnt her husband to ashes, it was Rati, whose beseeching or penance, leads to the promise of Kama's resurrection. Often, this resurrection occurs when Kama is reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna. Rati – under the name of Mayavati – plays a {{critical}} role in the upbringing of Pradyumna, who is separated from his parents at birth. She acts as his nanny, as well as his lover, and tells him the way to return to his <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> slaying the demon-king, who is destined to die at his hands. Later, Kama-Pradyumna accepts Rati-Mayavati as his wife.|$|E
5|$|Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's {{eyesight}} failed further due to retinitis pigmentosa. By that time, {{there were}} ten {{children in the}} Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from sudden infant death syndrome, his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently {{spent much of his}} youth in various children's homes, and was a serial truant from school. His mother had taught him to shoplift as a child, and he was involved in petty crime throughout his youth in Manchester. At nine years old, he began training at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played football for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> the time Armstrong was 17.|$|E
40|$|Parents {{around the}} world engage in the {{practice}} of <b>parenting</b> <b>by</b> lying, which entails lying to manipulate children’s emotional states and behavior. The current study is the first to examine whether exposure to <b>parenting</b> <b>by</b> lying in childhood is associated with later dishonesty and psychosocial maladjustment in adulthood. Female undergraduate adults retrospectively reported their experiences of <b>parenting</b> <b>by</b> lying during childhood, the current frequency at which they lie to their parents, and their current psychosocial functioning. We found that adults who recalled relatively high levels of <b>parenting</b> <b>by</b> lying during childhood both lie to their parents more often and experience greater psychosocial adjustments problems in adulthood than adults who recalled relatively low levels of <b>parenting</b> <b>by</b> lying during childhood. This study is the first to suggest that <b>parenting</b> <b>by</b> lying during childhood may be associated with negative moral and social outcomes later in life...|$|R

25|$|The {{words of}} Jesus and the {{teaching}} of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> providing for material needs. In the gospels, Jesus is portrayed as angry with some people who avoided materially providing for their <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> claiming the money they would have used was given to God (Matthew 15:3–8, Mark 7:9–12. In these passages, Jesus quotes Isaiah 29:13) According to the Gospel of John, when Jesus was on the cross, he provided for his natural mother by giving the Apostle John the charge to care for her, which John accepted.|$|E
25|$|Psychological theory {{through the}} 1960s placed much greater {{focus on the}} {{possibility}} that a bedwetting child might be acting out, purposefully striking back against <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> soiling linens and bedding.

25|$|The 'origin of the soul' has {{provided}} a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include soul creationism, traducianism, and pre-existence. According to creationism, each individual soul is created directly by God, either {{at the moment of}} conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes from the <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human embryos have souls from conception, or there is a point between conception and birth where the fetus acquires a soul, consciousness, and/or personhood. Stances in this question might more or less influence judgements on the morality of abortion.|$|E
25|$|The Founding of Lesbos: twentyone hexameters were {{quoted by}} Parthenius {{under the title}} Lesbou ktisis. The author's name was not given but modern {{scholars}} attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, Peisidice, who betrayed her countrymen and her <b>parents</b> <b>by</b> opening the city gates to the man she loved, Achilles. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning {{at the hands of}} the Argives. It can be argued that Peisidice's viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with Argonautica, epic material has been used unconventionally as a window into the female psyche.|$|E
