The decentralized equilibrium always leads to unlimited growth, but optimal growth is often limited (the negative effect of pollution dominating the positive effect of learning by doing). In this case, the optimal policy which leads the decentralized economy to follow the optimal growth path is to tax capital; in contrast with the optimal subsidy policy in an economy without pollution.

The model explicitly links economic growth {{to the health of the}} environment. The stock of natural resources is affected by the rate of pollution flows, through their impact on the regenerative capacity of the natural resource stock. This can shed useful insights into pollution control strategies, particularly in developing countries where environmental resources are crucial for production in many sectors of the economy. Simulation exercises suggested that, under plausible assumptions, it is possible to reverse undesirable transient dynamics through pollution control expenditure, but this is dependent upon the strategies used for control.

40|$|Among {{the diverse}} human {{influences}} upon tropical Asian rivers, three threats stand out: 1) Degradation of drainage basins (particularly through deforestation and overgrazing) leads to increased suspended sediment loads and extensive flooding. Excessive floodplain siltation alters habitats causing species decline or disappearance. 2) River regulation and control has been practised widely {{in the region}} for centuries but, with the planned development of massive projects on the Yangtze and Mekong Rivers, the potential for environmental damage has increased. Fish breeding migrations may be disrupted, because dams block migration routes or changed flow regimes fail to stimulate reproduction. 3) River pollution is pervasive throughout the region. Untreated sewage is a particular problem in densely-populated areas, and pollution by industrial effluents and mining wastes is becoming more important. These threats have led to declines and range constrictions of aquatic animals and those terrestrial species associated with riparian corridors and floodplains. River dolphins and certain crocodilians are particularly threatened, but declines in species of waterfowl, floodplain deer, a host of fishes, macrophytes, and invertebrates have been documented.

We compared the native macrophytes colonizing patches dominated and non-dominated by this invader species. We surveyed eight streams in Northwest Paraná State (Brazil). In each stream, we recorded native macrophytes' richness and biomass in sites where U. arrecta was dominant and in sites where it was not dominant or absent. No native species were found in seven, out of the eight investigated sites where U. arrecta was dominant. Thus, we found higher native species richness, Shannon index and native biomass values in sites without dominance of U. arrecta than in sites dominated by this invader. Although difficult to conclude about causes of such differences, we infer that the elevated biomass production by this grass might be the primary reason for alterations in invaded environments and for the consequent impacts on macrophytes' native communities. However, biotic resistance offered by native richer sites could be an alternative explanation for our results. To mitigate potential impacts and to prevent future environmental perturbations, we propose mechanical removal of the invasive species and maintenance or restoration of riparian vegetation, for freshwater ecosystems have vital importance for the maintenance of ecological services and biodiversity and should be preserved...|$|E

Monitoring of the ecological state of the Ural River showed the presence of anthropogenic pollution. The hydrochemical regime of the reservoir is subject to changes in seasonal variations in water composition. In spring, with flood waters, the main pollution enters the river, however in other seasons, the quality of water leaves much to be desired.

The donor country balances environmental benefits against the social costs of aid which results from possible erosion of competitiveness in the export market.

As the scope of environmental aid that improves China's energy efficiency is limited by trade competition, the change in composition of bilateral environmental aid may reflect {{a means by which}} a solution to the trans-border pollution issue can be found. The second chapter shows that the dynamic properties of the pollution-income relationship under an optimal pollution tax depends on three key factors, namely the degree of temporal and inter-temporal flexibility in consumption and the elasticity of substitution among production inputs.

Finally, the third chapter examines environmentally sustainable growth with reference to climate change assuming two final outputs and two factors of production, accounting for both <b>pollution</b> <b>flow</b> and stock effects. If the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption is greater than one, an optimal pollution tax ensures sustainable growth without any further government intervention. Otherwise, either a high temporal elasticity of substitution in production or consumption is required for sustainability.

Fresh waters also are hotspots for human activities {{that have led}} to widespread habitat degradation, <b>pollution,</b> <b>flow</b> regulation and water extraction, fisheries overexploitation, and alien species introductions. These impacts have caused severe declines in the range and abundance of many freshwater species, so that they are now far more imperiled than their marine or terrestrial counterparts. Here, we review progress in conservation of freshwater biodiversity, with a focus on the period since 1986, and outline key challenges for the future. Driven by rising conservation concerns, freshwater ecologists have conducted a great deal of research over the past 25 y on the status, trends, autecology, and propagation of imperiled species, threats to these species, the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, metapopulation dynamics, biodiversity hotspots, reserve design, habitat restoration, communication with stakeholders, and weaknesses of protective legislation. Nevertheless, existing efforts might be insufficient to stem the ongoing and coming multitude of freshwater extinctions. We briefly discuss 4 important challenges for freshwater conservation. First, climate change will imperil both freshwater species and human uses of fresh water, driving engineering responses that will further threaten the freshwater biota. We need to anticipate both ecological and human responses to climate change, and to encourage rational and deliberate planning of engineering responses to climate change before disasters strike. Second, because freshwater extinctions are already well underway, freshwater conservationists must be prepared to act now to prevent further losses, even if our knowledge is incomplete, and engage more effectively with other stakeholders.

40|$|Hydrothermal {{systems are}} {{important}} for a myriad of reasons. Life itself may have begun in hydrothermal ecosystems, and in more modern times these environments are serving as refugia for many unique and vulnerable species. In the Great Basin region of North America, regional aquifer hydrothermal springs support {{a disproportionate number of}} endemic species, some of which live in only one hydrothermal spring. Many of these organisms appear to be relict species that may have had far wider distributions in the past when climatic conditions were wetter and large pluvial lakes covered vast areas within the Great Basin. Today, regional aquifer hydrothermal springs provide important information regarding regional biogeography, paleohydrological connectivity, and climate change. However, these unique ecological hotspots also face many anthropogenic threats including groundwater depletion and <b>pollution,</b> <b>flow</b> diversions, and the introduction of exotic species. The unique physical and geochemical characteristics of hydrothermal systems may also protect some vulnerable amphibian species from pathogens. In Arizona and Nevada, several species of frogs and toads inhabit hydrothermal ecosystems, and the elevated temperatures in these environments appear to be protecting them from the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the potentially fatal disease chytridiomycosis. The Dixie Valley toad, a yet undescribed species currently restricted to four thermal spring-fed wetlands within Dixie Valley NV, appears to be a relict member of the western toad (Anaxyrus boreas) species group. We surveyed populations of Dixie Valley toads between 2009 - 2012, and also tested individuals for Bd in 2011 - 12. While none of the toads tested positive for Bd, the prevalence of Bd infections among nearby populations of introduced American bullfrogs increased significantly. This unique and vulnerable species also faces threats from increased exploitation of nearby geothermal energy resources.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} how pollution affects economic activities. Chapters 2 considers {{effects of}} pollution on humans' health. In an overlapping generation model with capital accumulation, agents' status is negatively affected by pollution. Individuals may invest in private health {{to reduce the}} burden of the environmental degradation, but this reduces the aggregate savings. Lower savings reduce the capital accumulation dynamic, reducing the optimal growth of the economy. The government can intervene to improve agents' health with public health spending, which crowds out private health investment and is complementary to savings. This work shows that, according to the initial level of capital of the economy and to the “net dirtiness", i. e. the difference of the pollution elasticity with respect to output minus the public health spending elasticity, the economy experiences different longrun growth equilibriums. Chapter 3 evaluates and compare the capacity of an emission tax and of free issued (non-auctioned) permits in terms of the incentives in investing in emission abatement research and in the social welfare. In the model, firms compete a la Cournot with knowledge spillovers. There are two different timing of the game: one where the government can credibly commit to the level of environmental policy; and the second timing where the government cannot credibly commit, and adjust optimally the policy after the firms innovate. This work shows that firms invest more in research when the government can credibly commit to the chosen level of policy. Chapter 4 investigates the role of pollution as a source of income inequality. Blackburn and Chivers (2015), in an overlapping generation model without credit market imperfections but in presence of loss aversion and uncertain return of investment, model agents that inherited from their parent and leave as a bequest to their offspring a positive amount of human capital. If the human capital is below a certain threshold, the loss aversion strongly influence agents, thus avoiding the investment. This reduces their possibility of realising profits and agents may end up in a low-income growth equilibrium with persistent income inequality. We extend their model introducing the <b>pollution</b> <b>flow,</b> which reduces the productivity of human capital and an abatement policy, which mitigates the negative effect of pollution. This work shows that in the presence of pollution, income inequality may increase and that the government can mitigate it through pollution abatement...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{in the past have}} come up in order to explain and verify the {{observation}} made by Grossman and Kruger that that there may exist an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental pollution and income. While some studies have found this relationship to hold true for certain pollutants, other studies have rejected this hypothesis based upon empirical observations of certain other pollutants. Further, most of these results have been derived from cross-sectional observation of such patterns across countries and therefore have given rise to further sckepticism. Though a number of empirical estimates of this relationship exist in the literature, there have been very few attempts to explain a theoretical basis for such a pattern. Primarily, there have been two arguments to justify such a relationship. The first one hinges upon the assumption that people have preference for environmental quality that rises disporportionatley as income increases. The other explanation is based upon a pollution-reducing technological progress that causes pollution levels to fall as income rises. This argument makes the assumption that a threshold level of income exists beyond which less polluting technologies could be used efficiently. However, in absence of conclusive empirical estimates these theories have been subjected to severe criticisms and counter-theories. One such argument that has been made against the existence of any such inverted relationship between environmental pollution and income is by Suri and Chapman. They contend that the observed relationship holds true mostly in developed countries and primarily so because they shift production of pollution-intensive goods to developing countries thus reducing their own emissions. Therefore, if international trade is factored in these theroies, the EKC may not exist. Further, the concern against any pollution-reducing technological progress has been that though such technologies may reduce the emissions of one type of pollutant, they lead to other kinds of toxic accumulations in the long run. It seems that the major emphasis of the prior literature is on establishing either the existence of such a relationship or rejecting it altogether. Obviously, the intention of most of such studies is to derive a threshold level of income beyond which pollution starts falling and then suggest the fastest growth paths to achieve that target income level. The hope has been that with the discovery of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) the focus could be again shifted back to economic growth. However, this focus seems to ignore the possibility that even if EKC exists it may still be desirable not to wait until the threshold level of income is achieved in order for pollution levels to go down. It is possible to explain the observed discrepancies in the literature on EKC through an alternative approach. One reason EKC may not be observed in some cases is that even though there may exist a relationship between pollution levels and income, the observable indicators of environmental quality may still keep degrading due to stock effects. A simple example is the case of diminishing biodiversity all over the world. The existence of EKC, in such cases, then depends upon the type of environmental indicators chosen. This explains the conflicting nature of observations made by studies in the past. A consequential implication of this explanation is that perhaps one must not put too much emphasis on proving the existence of EKC, because it may give misleading policy implications. Pollution may reduce over time with technological advances or increasing preferences for environmental qualities, but there may be stock effects from such emissions which may be irreversible and subject to hysteresis. A suitable example would be the global warming problem. In this paper we build upon the existing theoretical models in the literature to incorporate such irreversibilities and hysteresis effects that may exist between flow of pollution and environmental quality. In our model the incorporation of hysteresis between environmental quality and the flow of pollution implies that it may not be optimal to increase the pollution {{all the way up to}} the threshold level implied by a conventional EKC relationship. This is primarily due to the fact that once the pollution level crosses a threshold beyond which hysteresis sets in, the cost of reducing pollution in terms of income may become excessively high beyond that point. Consequently, even though a conventional EKC may exist between <b>pollution</b> <b>flow</b> and income, there may not exist a similar relationship between certain indicators of environmental quality and income. We further perform numerical simulations to derive parameter values for which existence of conventional EKC also implies existence of EKC for all other quality indicators and values for which it does not. We then incorporate the hysteresis and irreversibility effects into the theoretical model to derive the adjusted threshold levels of incomes beyond which pollution starts falling. Further, we derive lessons for the currently industrializing economies from these thresholds. Most of these economies are characterized by a heavy emphasis on capital accumulation with little or no regard for environmental degradation. Environmental concerns in such economies arise only after sufficient capital accumulation and a serious degradation of the environment. However, hysteresis and irreversibility may make such concerns futile as it may be extremely costly, if not impossible, to revert back to pristine states. For given initial endowments of capital and environmetal quality, we derive 'points of no return' for such economies. An untested hypothesis that exists in the EKC literature is that it may be possible to 'tunnel' through the EKC, i. e., accumulate high levels of capital and yet preserve the environment. Our analysis demonstrates that, when stock effects associated with pollution are taken into consideration, this tunnel may not exist. However, 'tunneling' may be feasible if there are significant pollution-reducing technological advances. Incorporation of both the technological progress argument and environmental preferences argument in the model makes the threshold income levels highly sensitive to parameter values, though many interesting implications arise from this caseEnvironmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

As a result, formal stocking programs have seen the introduction of five of the world’s top 100 invasive species into South Africa (Dudgeon et al. 2006). According to Dudgeon et al. (2006) freshwater ecosystems are the most endangered ecosystem in the world. The threats to freshwater biodiversity, according to Dudgeon et al. (2006), can be grouped into five categories that interact with one another: overexploitation, water <b>pollution,</b> <b>flow</b> modifications, destruction of habitat and invasion by exotic species. This PhD study {{took place in the}} Amatola region of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The Amatola region is a rural area with no large-scale mining or industrial developments, only localised settlements. These developments are mainly situated around impoundments, because of the resources such as water and food that they provide. Thus the dams within the Amatola region should theoretically have no major industrial stressors on them. The three impoundments studied were Binfield Park, Sandile and Wriggleswade Dams. Binfield Park Dam is a 260 ha impoundment. It impounds the Tyume River and is used by both subsistence anglers from the local communities and occasionally by recreational bass anglers. Sandile Dam is a 146 ha impoundment and is the smallest of the three dams in this study. It impounds the Wolf and Keiskamma Rivers. Wriggleswade Dam is a 1000 ha impoundment used extensively by recreational bass and carp anglers, and impounds the Kubusi River. There is a paucity of information regarding the health of the indigenous and alien fish species from the study region, {{as well as on the}} parasite diversity of these various fish species. In order to fill the gaps in the information the following hypothesis was proposed. That the necropsy based and histology based fish health assessment can be successfully implemented as tools to assess the effects of heavy metal pollution and alien fish parasites in freshwater fish from selected impoundments in the Amatola region, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. In order to achieve this hypothesis the main aim of this study will be to use the necropsy- and histology- based fish health assessment to determine the health status of the fish species in these impoundments as well as to understand the potential threat of water pollution and fish parasites. Fish were sampled with the aid of gill nets, fyke nets and by angling from each of the three impoundments over three surveys in July 2011, and March and August 2012. Following capture fish were transported to a field laboratory in aerated containers. At the field laboratory the fish were examined and dissected using the methods recommended by Adams et al. (1993) for a necropsy-based fish health assessment. Gills, livers, kidneys and gonads samples were also collected for histological analysis. Macroscopic and histology-based fish health assessment index was used, as well the analysis of muscle tissue of Micropterus salmoides and surface water and sediment from Binfield Park, Sandile and Wriggleswade Dams. It was shown that, according to the macroscopic fish health assessment index, M. salmoides in Wriggleswade Dam had a higher FHAI score compared to those in Binfield Park and Sandile Dam, there were no significant differences between the FHAI scores. However, the cause of the higher FHAI in the Wriggleswade Dam was because of the external skin damage caused by the presence of the alien parasite Lernaea cyprinacea. The histology-based fish health assessment index, however, showed that M. salmoides from Binfield Park had significantly higher histology Fish Index (IFISH) scores compared to those in Sandile and Wriggleswade Dams. The main contributors to the high IFISH score of Binfield Park were the significantly high Liver Index (IL) and Kidney Index (IK). The increased severity of the alterations observed in the liver and kidney tissue of the Binfield Park M. salmoides samples may have been as a result of the high concentration of mercury found in the muscle tissue of M. salmoides. The water quality and metals detected in the water of Binfield Park, Sandile and Wriggleswade Dams were all below the target water quality guideline values, as well as below those of previous research into the nutrients and presence of metals in these impoundments. The sediment metal analysis showed that the levels of Co, Mn and Ni were above the target guideline levels for Binfield Park, Sandile and Wriggleswade Dams, Cu was above target guidelines levels for Sandile Dam, and uranium was above the target guideline concentrations for Wriggleswade Dam. Binfield Park Dam had significantly high levels of mercury in the muscle tissue of M. salmoides, while Sandile Dam had significantly high levels of zinc in the muscle tissue of M. salmoides. It was shown that M. salmoides from each of the three impoundments are in a healthy state according to the parameters assessed. However, the presence of heavy metals, particularly mercury, uranium and zinc, do indicate the presence of human activities. The indigenous parasites of Anguilla mossambica have been well documented including the gastrointestinal nematode Paraquimperia africana, and the stomach nematode Heliconema africanum. Indigenous parasites such as the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola papernai had no effect on the condition factor of infected and uninfected eels. However, the damage caused by the alien parasites were evident, including the first documented effects of the alien gill monogenean Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae on indigenous wild populations of the longin fin eel A. mossambica from the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Histological observations indicated that an alien gill monogenean caused hyperplasia, increase in mucous cells, rupture of pillar cells as well as telangiectasia. This alien parasite has invaded the Keiskamma and Kei River systems in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. According to the macroscopic fish health assessment index, A. mossambica from Binfield Park, Sandile and Wriggleswade Dams are in a healthy state. However, the histology-based health assessment highlighted that the effects on P. anguillae have a severe negative impact on the health of A. mossambica. Using the macroscopic and histology-based fish health assessment, a comprehensive investigation into the fish health status of Mugil cephalus and Myxus capensis from Binfield Park Dam revealed that human effects and parasites are not the only threats to freshwater fish. Nephrocalcinosis is a non-infectious kidney disease which is characterised by abnormal calcium deposition in the kidneys of humans and some fish species. According to the macroscopic and histology-based fish health assessment, the M. cephalus and M. capensis are not in a healthy condition. The macroscopic and histology-based fish assessment indices are not stressor-specific, and therefore the cause of the poor health state of these two fish species could not be determined. A possible suggestion for the poor health of these two species is the age of the species. Because the two mullet species were stocked into Binfield Park Dam, Ellender et al. (2012) could successfully age them accurately to ten years of age, which is the upper limit of the life span for these species. Macroscopic and histology-based fish heath assessments were conducted on Labeo umbratus from Sandile Dam in order to determine the health of this species. Macroscopic and histology-based fish health assessment indicated that its L. umbratus are in a healthy state. The March 2012 survey specimens had a significantly higher macroscopic FHAI score than those from the July 2011 survey. The increased FHAI score was because of parasite infections, as well as discoloured livers and increased total blood plasma protein levels, which are indicators of nutritional state. However, the presence of the anchor worm parasite Lernaea barnimiana in low numbers had no significant impact on the health of L. umbratus. The effect of the alien anchor worm parasite Lernaea cyprinacea was shown on the transloacted small mouth yellowfish Labeobarbus aeneus. It was also shown that L. aeneus are, according the macroscopic FHAI and the histology-based fish health assessment index, in a healthy state. However, the high scores observed in the macroscopic fish health assessment index were primarily as a result of the presence of the alien parasite L. cyprinacea and its associated affects on the fish host. Because of the significant impact of this alien parasite species on the translocated host species, it can be assumed that this alien parasite species will have a negative effect on the health of indigenous fish species in the Great Kei River. It is clear from the results presented in this study that the necropsy based and histology based fish health assessment can be successfully implemented as tools to assess the effects of heavy metal pollution and alien fish parasites in freshwater fish from selected impoundments in the Amatola region, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, thus the original hypothesis of this thesis is accepted. Based on work done in this research the gaps in research have been identified. Due to the high levels of mercury indentified in the muscle tissue of M. salmoides from Binfield Park Dam. A human health assessment and edibility should be conducted in order to determine if the fish from Binfield Park Dam is safe for human consumption. In order to conserve South Africa’s Freshwater fish biodiversity, country wide surveys of indigenous fish species must be undertaken so that the health and the parasite diversity can be evaluated.

This article develops a taxonomy of these gaps and argues that the emerging technologies of the Information Age will create new gap-filling options and thus expand the range of environmental protection strategies. Remote sensing technologies, modern telecommunications systems, the Internet, and computers all promise to make it much easier to identify harms, track <b>pollution</b> <b>flows</b> and resource consumption, and measure the resulting impacts. These developments will make possible a new structure of institutional responses to environmental problems including a more robust market in environmental property rights, expanded use of economic incentives and market-based regulatory strategies, improved command-and-control regulation, and redefined social norms of environmental stewardship. Likewise, the degree to which policies are designed to promote information generation will determine whether and how quickly new institutional approaches emerge. While some potential downsides to Information Age environmental protection remain, the promise of a more refined, individually tailored, and precise approach to pollution control and natural resource management looks to be significant...|$|R
50|$|The steel mill, and {{the nearby}} coal mines that fuelled it, {{operated}} {{for nearly a century}} under a variety of owners including Dominion Steel Company (1912), British Empire Steel Corporation (1921), and Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO) after 1930. An economically failing DOSCO was purchased by A.V. Roe Canada in 1957, which was in turn dissolved, and its assets, including DOSCO, purchased by Hawker Siddeley Canada in 1962. By the mid-1960s, Hawker Siddeley began to close money-losing subsidiaries and identified DOSCO's coal mines and steel mill as candidates for closure. By 1967, DOSCO announced plans to close the mill and began phasing out the coal mines. In response to the threatened loss of thousands of jobs in a region with poor economic prospects, the government of Nova Scotia expropriated the steel mill, renaming it Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO). The government of Canada expropriated DOSCO's coal mines at the same time, as well as the coke ovens that produced the <b>pollution</b> <b>flowing</b> into the Tar Ponds, naming this operation Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO). SYSCO purchased the coke ovens from DEVCO in 1973.|$|R
