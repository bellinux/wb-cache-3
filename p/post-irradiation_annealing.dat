30|$|<b>Post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> was {{discussed}} for {{the recovery of}} irradiation damage and mechanical properties recently [9 – 11]. For <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> above 600  °C, the recovery of damage structure and tensile properties occurred and irradiation hardening completely disappeared in V- 3 Fe- 4 Ti- 0.1 Si. No significant recovery of irradiation hardening could be observed in the irradiated specimens after <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> at 500  °C for 2  h [12]. The research of irradiation damage of recovery by <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> of EUROFER base steels showed that repeated intermediate annealing treatment at 550  °C made RAFM steel withstood much higher nominal damage dose rates. After annealing, the embrittlement further decreased, while the hardening also decreased. Meanwhile, annealing at 500  °C {{was supposed to be}} the minimum temperature for starting recovery [13] of EUROFER base steels. Temperature below 500  °C should also be explored for the possibility of the recovery process from irradiation hardening in an operating mode maintenance process of a fusion reactor because the temperature will be kept in the regime where liquid lithium will circulate in the blanket module for cooling the decay heat after neutron exposure even in the suspension period of the operation of a fusion reactor. Investigating the recovery process from irradiation hardening and the <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> at a lower temperature would require a long-term annealing treatment to extend the temperature regime to a lower temperature and thus promote easier self-healing treatment in the reactor [14].|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> on the microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties of V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti alloys was studied. Helium-hydrogen-irradiated sequentially V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti alloys {{at room temperature}} (RT) were undergone <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> at 450  °C over periods of up to 30  h. These samples were carried out by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation and nanoindentation test. With the holding time, large amounts of point defects produced during irradiation at RT accumulated into large dislocation loops and then dislocation nets which promoted the irradiation hardening. Meanwhile, bubbles appeared. As annealing time extended, these bubbles grew up and merged, and finally broke up. In the process, the size of bubbles increased and the number density decreased. Microstructural changes due to <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> corresponded to the change of hardening. Dislocations and bubbles are co-contributed to irradiation hardening. With the holding time up to 30  h, the recovery of hardening is not obvious. The phenomenon was discussed by dispersed barrier hardening model and Friedel-Kroupa-Hirsch relationship.|$|E

Then, we can get experimental ΔH measurements corrected for ISE shown in Fig.  6 d. The hardness of un-irradiated samples was the lowest, then as-irradiated sample, which indicated the increment of hardness, was induced by irradiation. Among the three series of samples with <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing,</b> the hardness of samples after <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> at 450  °C for 20  h was lowest, and when the holding time was 10  h, the hardness was highest.

40|$|A {{variety of}} SiC-based {{composites}} and monolithic ceramics {{were characterized by}} measuring their thermal diffusivity in the unirradiated, thermal annealed, and irradiated conditions over the temperature range 400 to 1, 000 C. The irradiation was conducted in the EBR-II to doses of 33 and 43 dpa-SiC (185 EFPD) at a nominal temperature of 1, 000 C. The annealed specimens were held at 1, 010 C for 165 days to approximately duplicate the thermal exposure of the irradiated specimens. Thermal diffusivity was measured using the laser flash method, and was converted to thermal conductivity using density data and calculated specific heat values. Exposure to the 165 day anneal did not appreciably degrade the conductivity of the monolithic or particulate-reinforced composites, but the conductivity of the fiber-reinforced composites was slightly degraded. The crystalline SiC-based materials tested in this study exhibited thermal conductivity degradation after irradiation, presumably caused {{by the presence of}} irradiation-induced defects. Irradiation-induced conductivity degradation was greater at lower temperatures, and was typically more pronounced for materials with higher unirradiated conductivity. Annealing the irradiated specimens for one hour at 150 C above the irradiation temperature produced an increase in thermal conductivity, which is likely the result of interstitial-vacancy pair recombination. Multiple <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>anneals</b> on CVD {beta}-SiC indicated that a portion of the irradiation-induced damage was permanent. A possible explanation for this phenomenon was the formation of stable dislocation loops at the high irradiation temperature and/or high dose that prevented subsequent interstitial/vacancy recombination...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the impact of the {{sequential}} irradiation and annealing process on the microstructure, thermooxidation behavior and mechanical properties of GUR 1050 ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) with respect to the postirradiation annealed material. For this purpose, the effects of a variety of irradiation and annealing conditions on microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed to characterize melting temperature, crystalline content and crystal thickness, whereas transmission electron microscopy provided additional insights into crystal morphology. Thermogravimetric experiments in air served to assess thermooxidation resistance and changes associated to radiation-induced crosslinking. Fatigue properties were studied from three different approaches, namely short-term cyclic stress–strain tests, long-term fatigue experiments and crack propagation behavior. Likewise, three experimental techniques (uniaxial tensile test, impact experiments, and load to fracture of compact tension specimens) allowed evaluation of the fracture resistance. The present findings confirm sequentially crosslinked UHMWPE exhibited improved thermooxidation resistance and thermal stability compared to <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealed</b> UHMWPE. Also, the mechanical behavior, including the fatigue and fracture resistance, of these materials was generally comparable regardless of the annealing strategy. Therefore, the sequential irradiation and annealing process might provide higher oxidation resistance, but not a significant improvement in mechanical properties compared to the single radiation dose and subsequent annealing procedure.

Dislocation loops and bubbles formed in post-irradiated annealing V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti alloy. The size of dislocation loops and bubbles increased gradually with increasing holding time while the number density of dislocation loops and bubbles decreased. At last, large dislocation loops migrated to free surface. HRTEM observations showed that dislocation lines left in the matrix. Bubbles combined {{with each other and}} coarsened. Ion irradiation and <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> induced the evolution of hardening that was found by nanoindentation test. The irradiation hardening corresponded to the microstructural changes. Without <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing,</b> lattice distortion induced by point defects caused irradiation hardening. As the annealing treatment at 450  °C proceeded for 10  h, the hardness increased because the pinning effect between dislocation loops and bubbles was strong.

In the absence of Cu, the formation of γ′ appeared to proceed by a traditional diffusional growth mechanism, resulting in small (< 50 Å) γ′ precipitates in γ matrix grains. The presence of Cu caused the formation of a dual‐phase γ+γ′ structure (i. e., distinct, equal‐sized grains of γ and γ′) during <b>post‐irradiation</b> <b>annealing.</b> It is suggested that copper affected the nucleation of γ′ precipitates and increased the kinetics of growth resulting in the dual‐phase morphology. Strong irradiation‐induced textures were observed in the multilayers that were less pronounced in the coevaporated films. The texture in the multilayers was attributed to the presence of a slight as‐evaporated texture combined with the enhanced atomic mobility due to the heat‐of‐mixing released during irradiation.

In the as-received state, the alloys have a ferritic microstructure. Apart from Cu, the alloyed elements are solved in the matrix. Irradiation produces strong hardening and embrittlement. The effect increases with the Cu and P content. Ni causes an additional embrittlement. It is independent on the Ni concentration {{within the range of}} 1. 1 to 2 % Ni and results in a shift of the ductile-brittle transition temperature of about 120 °C after a fluence of 1 x 1019 /cm 2 by a flux of 4 x 1011 /cm 2 s. The shift does not depend on the Cu or P content. Furthermore the upper shelf energy is especially reduced by the Ni-rich alloys. For very low content of Cu and P these relations are not valid.

Beside the on-line measurement of output voltage and quiescent current during the thirty-minute period immediately after irradiation, also results were procured after 10 -year room-temperature spontaneous recovery. Data obtained during the irradiation and rapid annealing were fitted with linear, exponential, and power-law regression functions. A simple procedure was proposed, based on the quiescent current annealing factor, for the quick estimation of the integrated voltage regulator's radiation sensitivity during the <b>post-irradiation</b> isothermal <b>annealing.</b> In order to estimate the circuit's radiation sensitivity, immediately after irradiation, tested devices have to {{be left in the}} same operating conditions as during the exposure.

For the Ni rich alloys such well-validated references are missing. The experiment is part of an extended research programme. It is supposed to continue in order to gain information about the synergistic effects of these elements. (orig.) Die Strahlenversproedung der Reaktordruckbehaelter ist bei Reaktoren des Types WWER ein Problem von hoher sicherheitstechnischer Relevanz. Sie wird entscheidend durch die Zusammensetzung des Druckbehaeltermaterials bestimmt. Mit einem Bestrahlungsexperiment auf Surveillancepositionen zweier russischer WWER- 440 -Reaktoren sollte der Einfluss von Kupfer, Phosphor und Nickel auf die Strahlenversproedung nachgewiesen werden. Dazu wurden 8 Testlegierungen ausgewaehlt, deren Zusammensetzung zwischen 0, 015 - 0, 42 % Cu, 0, 002 - 0, 039 % P, 0, 01 - 1, 98 % Ni, 0, 09 - 0, 37 % Si und 0, 35 - 0, 49 % Mn variierte. An Proben aus diesen Legierungen wurden Kerbschlagbiege- und Zugversuche im Ausgangszustand, in 2 bestrahlten Zustaenden (Fluenx: 1 x 10 " 1 " 9 und 8 x 10 " 1 " 9 n/cm" 2 [E> 0, 5 MeV]) und nach einer Ausheilgluehung bei 475 C/ 100 h durchgefuehrt. Die Legierungen haben im Ausgangszustand ein ferritisches Gefuege, die Legierungselemente koennen, vom Kupfer abgesehen, als geloest angenommen werden. Nach Bestrahlung tritt ein ausgepraegter Haertungs- und Versproedungseffekt auf. Der Effekt steigt mit dem Gehalt an Cu und P. Im Bereich von 1, 1 - 1, 98 % bewirkt Nickel eine zusaetzliche, von der Ni-Konzentration unabhaengige Versproedung. Sie manifestiert sich in einer Verschiebung der Uebergangstemperatur bei einer Fluenz von 1 x 10 " 1 " 9 n/cm" 2 und einer Flussdichte von 4 x 10 " 1 " 1 n/cm" 2 s [E> 0, 5 MeV] um ca. 120 C, die nicht abhaengig vom Cu- und P-Gehalt ist. Ausserdem wird bei Ni-Legierungen die Kerbschlagarbeit in der Zaehigkeitshochlage besonders stark abgesenkt. Bei sehr niedrigen Gehalten an P und Cu gelten diese Zusammenhaenge nicht. Durch eine Ausheilgluehung kann bei Legierungen mit niedrigem Cu- und P-Gehalt der Bestrahlungseffekt auf die mechanischen Eigenschaften restlos eliminiert werden, fuer hohe Cu- oder P-Gehalte bleibt ein Resteffekt in Hoehe von ca. 20 [...] . 25 % der Bestrahlungwirkung. Die Ergebnisse, die an den Ni-freien Legierungen gewonnen wurden, stehen im Einklang mit den Ergebnissen aus den Versproedungsueberwachungsprogrammen der russischen WWER- 440 -Reaktoren an Schweissmetall. Fuer die Ni-haltigen Legierungen fehlen aequivalente zuverlaessige Referenzuntersuchungen. Das Experiment ist Teil eines groesseren Versuchsprogrammes, das fortzusetzen ist, um auch Aussagen hinsichtlich der synergistischen Wirkung der Elemente zuverlaessig treffen zu koennen. (orig.)

Deep level transient spectroscopy measurement {{was used to}} investigate the deep traps induced by the electron irradiation. The dominant trap in the as-grown ZnO single crystal has the activation energy of 0. 28 eV. The electron irradiation introduced an extra trap having the activation energy of 0. 16 eV. Thermal annealing study was also performed to study the thermal evolution of these deep level defects.

40|$|Gallium and boron {{doped silicon}} solar cells, {{processed}} by ion implantation followed by either laser or furnace anneal were irradiated by 1 MeV electrons and their postirradiation recovery by thermal annealing was determined. During the postirradiation anneal, gallium doped cells prepared by both processes recovered more rapidly and exhibited {{none of the}} severe reverse annealing observed for similarly processed 2 ohm-cm boron doped cells. Ion implanted furnace annealed 0. 1 ohm-cm boron doped cells exhibited the lowest <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> temperatures after irradiation. The drastically lowered recovery temperature is attributed to the reduced oxygen and carbon content of the 0. 1 ohm-cm cells. Analysis based on defect properties and annealing kinetics indicates that further reduction in annealing temperature is attainable with further reduction in the silicon's carbon and/or divacancy content after irradiation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the results of}} EPR and optical studies on {{vacancies}} and interstitials produced in type IIa diamond irradiated with 2 -MeV electrons at temperatures between 90 and 900 K. <b>Post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> studies at temperatures up to 1900 K were also performed. Data showing recombination-enhanced diffusion of self-interstitial atoms in diamond is presented and our analysis of the phenomena leads us {{to the conclusion that}} a highly mobile interstitial I* (possibly a charged/neutral T-d interstitial) is produced by electronic excitation and/or charge transfer. We estimate that the migration energy for I* is 0. 3 eV. No evidence for vacancy recombination-enhanced diffusion was observed. The experimental data confirms that there is a significant barrier to vacancy-interstitial recombination in diamond. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Electron microscopy techniques {{have been used to}} study the nucleation and distribution of helium bubbles in several different grades of beryllium, after irradiation at temperatures in the range 75 — 700 ºC. The effect of <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> is also reported. It is shown that for similar neutron doses and irradiation temperatures, there were wide variations in helium bubble size and distribution in specimens of beryllium fabricated by different methods. The most satisfactory material was that fabricated from Pechiney powder by direct hot extrusion followed by annealing for one hour at 800 ºC and air cooling, it is suggested that the helium bubbles nucleate on second phase precipitates and that the distribution of this phase is strongly affected by fabrication and heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Neutron {{irradiation}} and <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> under oxidising {{and reducing}} conditions {{have been used}} to investigate H incorporation in, and the optical properties of, reduced (TiO 2 x) rutile. Optical absorption in rutile is mainly due to a Ti 3 + Ti 4 + inter-valence charge transfer effect. The main mechanism for H incorporation in rutile involves interstitial H not coupled to other defects, which has important implica-tions for the rate of H diffusion, and possibly also on the electrical properties of rutile. Additional minor OH absorption bands in IR spectra indicate that a small amount of interstitial H is coupled to defects such as Ti 3 + on the main octahedral site, and indicates that more than one H incorporation mechanism may oper-ate. Concentration of oxygen vacancies has a controlling influence on the H affinity of rutile...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM), swelling measurements, isochronal annealing, and thermal diffusivity testing {{were used to}} characterize the effects of radiation damage in SiC. Together, these techniques provided a comprehensive set of tools for observing and characterizing the structure and evolution of radiation-induced defects in SiC {{as a function of}} irradiation temperature and dose. In this study, two types of dense, crystalline, monolithic SiC were subjected to irradiation doses up to 1 dpa-SiC at a temperature of 1100 C, as well as <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> up to 1500 C. The microscopic defect structures observed by TEM were correlated to changes in the macroscopic dimensions, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity. The results demonstrated the value of using ultrapure {beta}SiC as an effective reference material to characterize the nature of expected radiation damage in other, more complex, SiC-based materials such as SiC/SiC composites...|$|E
40|$|Three read/write {{random access}} memories, AM 91 L 24, HM 1 - 6514, and MWS 5114, were {{subjected}} to total dose irradiation at three dose rates, with electrical testing after each increment of dosage. Annealing measurements were performed after the radiation tests were completed. The AM 91 L 24 showed a strong dose rate effect and substantial <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> of radiation-induced damage. The dose rate effect was that a lower dose rate produced less net damage than an eqivalent total dose applied at a higher rate. The HM 1 - 6514 showed essentially no dose rate effect and no annealing damage, and the MWS 5114 exhibited a moderate effect with some annealing. It was concluded that dose rate is an important parameter in radiation test procedures for MOS microcircuits and that annealing measurements may be important evaluation aids for such tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} losses (PL) of {{lithium niobate}} optical planar waveguides fabricated by swift heavy-ion irradiation (SHI), {{an alternative to}} conventional ion implantation, have been investigated and optimized. For waveguide fabrication, congruently melting LiNbO 3 substrates were irradiated with F ions at 20 MeV or 30 MeV and fluences in the range 10 13 - 10 14 cm - 2. The influence of the temperature and time of <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>annealing</b> treatments has been systematically studied. Optimum propagation losses lower than 0. 5 dB/cm have been obtained for both TE and TM modes, after a two-stage annealing treatment at 350 and 375 °C.
