50|$|Ordinary {{types of}} cooked salmon contain 500-1500 mg DHA and 300-1000 mg EPA <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams.</b> Additional rich seafood sources of DHA include caviar (3400 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams),</b> {{anchovies}} (1292 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams),</b> mackerel (1195 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams),</b> and cooked herring (1105 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams).</b>|$|R
50|$|Although bananas are {{commonly}} thought to supply exceptional potassium content, their actual potassium content is relatively low per typical food serving at only 8% of the US recommended Daily Value (table). Vegetables with higher potassium content than raw dessert bananas (358 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams)</b> include raw spinach (558 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams),</b> baked potatoes without skin (391 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams),</b> cooked soybeans (539 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams),</b> grilled portabella mushrooms (437 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams)</b> and processed tomato sauces (413-439 mg <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams).</b> Raw plantains contain 499 mg potassium <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams.</b> Dehydrated dessert bananas or banana powder contain 1491 mg potassium <b>per</b> 100 <b>grams.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} is necessary for life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of whole body weight. Much below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, they die from toxic excess.|$|E
5|$|Thulium is principally {{extracted}} from monazite ores (~0.007% thulium) found in river sands, through ion-exchange. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques {{have led to}} easier separation of the rare earths, which has yielded much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China. In these, where {{about two-thirds of the}} total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural compounds are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced. In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 <b>per</b> <b>gram,</b> and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b>|$|E
5|$|Americium {{has been}} {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and kilograms of its 241Am and 243Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. Nevertheless, {{since it was}} first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. The heavier isotope 243Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.|$|E

5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E

30|$|For hydrocarbon-utilizing {{bacteria}} and fungi isolation, sterile 9 -cm filter papers were impregnated with crude oil and {{were placed in}} the lids of inoculated plates. This allowed the crude oil vapour to condense within the plates; hence, the colonies that developed after the incubation period of 5 – 10  days at room temperature (28  °C) were recorded and multiplied by the dilution factor to give the total hydrocarbon utilizing {{bacteria and}} fungi in CFU <b>per</b> <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> millilitre.|$|R

The bill also would have created a new crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The bill would have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
5|$|Once other {{investigations}} have indicated Wilson's disease, the ideal test is {{the removal of}} {{a small amount of}} liver tissue through a liver biopsy. This is assessed microscopically for the degree of steatosis and cirrhosis, and histochemistry and quantification of copper are used to measure the severity of the copper accumulation. A level of 250 μg of copper <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of dried liver tissue confirms Wilson's disease. Occasionally, lower levels of copper are found; in that case, the combination of the biopsy findings with all other tests could still lead to a formal diagnosis of Wilson's.|$|E
5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, after {{mephedrone}} {{was made}} illegal, a street {{trade in the}} drug emerged, with prices around double those prior to the ban, at £20–£25 <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> In September 2010, Druglink reported the ban had had a mixed effect on mephedrone use, with it decreasing in some areas, remaining similar in others and becoming more prevalent in some areas. In an online survey of 150 users after the ban, 63% said they were continuing to use mephedrone, half of those used the same amount and half said they used less. Compared to previous surveys, more users purchased it from dealers, rather than the internet. The average price <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> was £16, compared to around £10 before the ban. The 2010 Mixmag survey of 2,500 nightclubbers found one quarter had used mephedrone in the previous month, the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, and it {{was more likely to}} be cut with other substances. Of those who had already used mephedrone prior to the ban, 75% had continued to use it after the ban. Of the various drugs used by the survey participants, users {{were more likely to have}} concerns about it. Interviews with users in Northern Ireland also found the price had roughly doubled since it was made illegal, to around £30 a gram. Rather than the price rising due to increased scarcity of the drug, it is thought to have risen for two other reasons. Firstly, dealers knew there was still demand for mephedrone, but were aware the supplies may be exhausted in the future. Secondly, the dealers perceived customers were likely to be willing to pay more for an illegal substance.|$|E

5|$|By December 2009 {{mephedrone}} {{was available}} {{on at least}} 31 websites based in the UK and by March 2010 {{there were at least}} 78 online shops, half of which sold amounts of less than 200grams and half that also sold bulk quantities. The price <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> varied from £9.50 to £14. Between July 2009 and February 2010, UK health professionals accessed the National Poisons Information Services (NPIS) entry on mephedrone 1664 times and made 157 telephone inquiries; the requests increased month on month over this period. In comparison, over a similar time period, the entries for cocaine and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 times. After mephedrone was made illegal the number of inquiries to the NPIS fell substantially, to only 19 in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa State College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, {{paramagnetic}} metal. Its {{chemistry is}} typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 {{at a rate of about}} 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E
