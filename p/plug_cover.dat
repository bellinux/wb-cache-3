There are also subtle differences between the crankshaft, and visible difference in the pattern of the SFi airbox.|$|E
50|$|The 20XE {{came into}} {{production}} in 1987. The engine {{was designed by}} Dr Fritz Indra, who was head of Advanced Engine Development for Opel in Germany from 1985 to 1989. The engine was originally intended for race application, hence Cosworth's involvement. Commonly refer to this engine as the 'Red Top' (or just 'XE') because of {{the appearance of the}} red L-shaped spark <b>plug</b> <b>cover</b> (black colours were available too; the rocker cover was available in silver only). At the time of its launch, this engine was something of a milestone unit in Europe and was widely used in motorsport in many specialist race versions.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Mark 2 Astra was launched, they {{introduced}} the GTE using a 1.8-litre 115 bhp {{lifted from the}} Mark 1 GTE, but this was quickly dropped in favour of a 124 bhp 2.0 litre unit due to poorer than expected performance. All GTE models featured an all electronic dash with digital speedometer. Analogue instruments were an optional extra, but were very rarely selected over the digital dash. In 1988 Vauxhall's twin-camshaft version of the engine, the C20XE known as the [...] "red top" [...] (due to the red spark <b>plug</b> <b>cover),</b> was fitted to the GTE and instantly created a stir with the motoring press because of its performance. When this engine was originally released in Europe and the UK it developed 156 bhp and 150 ft lbs of torque in standard form. A few years later the GTE 16v, now subject to stricter emissions regulations, was fitted with a catalytic converter and a new exhaust manifold, which robbed the engine of 6 bhp, and 5 ft lbs of torque, and added [...]5 of a second to the 0-60 mph time, raising it from 7.0 seconds to 7.5 seconds. In 1990 the [...] "leather edition" [...] limited-edition was launched, and an allocation of around 250 examples sold only through London dealerships. This special edition came with Bordeaux paint work, and crossed spoke alloy wheels. It was {{also known as the}} [...] "London Edition" [...] and featured in a single sheet brochure printed in April 1990. Between the brochure being printed, and the time they hit the road the [...] "Leather Edition" [...] acquired some extra dealer fit decals to help them stand out further from the standard 16 valve GTE. These decals comprise a small three colour flash on the tail gate next to the GTE badge, and the same colours under the bumper strips on the sides near the rear arch. A silver strip was also added adjacent to this. The colours used were that of the GM racing teams, and once fitted these cars also became known as the [...] "Champion" [...] Edition. As the official name would suggest they came with Recaro seats and door cards clad in Connolly Leather. Although the [...] "Leather Edition" [...] was not in any way connected to John Clelands 1989 BTCC win in the Astra 16 valve, it is believed by many that the [...] "Champion" [...] name, and the GM motor sport coloured decals, in some way paid homage to Clelands Championship win 6 months earlier.|$|E

40|$|A thermal math {{model for}} the Space Shuttle Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) Plug Repair was {{developed}} to increase the confidence in the repair entry performance and provide a real-time mission support tool. The thermal response of the <b>plug</b> <b>cover</b> plate, local RCC, and metallic attach hardware can be assessed with this model for any location on the wing leading edge. The geometry and spatial location of the thermal mesh also matches the structural mesh which allows for the direct mapping of temperature loads and computation of the thermoelastic stresses. The thermal model was correlated to a full scale plug repair radiant test. To utilize the thermal model for flight analyses, accurate predictions of protuberance heating were required. Wind tunnel testing was performed at CUBRC to characterize the heat flux in both the radial and angular directions. Due {{to the complexity of}} the implementation of the protuberance heating, an intermediate program was developed to output the heating per nodal location for all OML surfaces in SINDA format. Three Design Reference Cases (DRC) were evaluated with the correlated plug thermal math model to bound the environments which the plug repair would potentially be used...|$|E

40|$|The {{plantation}} area in Vietnam of Acacia auriculiformis, A. mangium {{and their}} hybrid has expanded greatly {{in the last}} decade. Recently, a new stem canker disease causing symptoms of crown wilt, followed by wood discoloration then death of infected trees has occurred in many ecological zones. Ascomata were obtained by incubating discolored wood pieces in moist chambers or by carrot baiting. Isolates of fungi were obtained on PDA medium by taking spores emerging from the tips of ascomata necks. Ceratocystis was identified based on ascospore morphology and conidial types. Twenty six isolates of Ceratocystis were used for pathogenicity assessment on 8 -month old seedlings of A. mangium in a nursery, with 5 seedlings per isolate. Stems were inoculated by inserting an 8 mm diameter PDA <b>plug</b> <b>covered</b> with 15 -day old mycelia onto the cambium about 50 cm above the ground. Five seedlings were inoculated with sterile PDA plugs {{to serve as the}} control. The wounds and plugs were sealed with parafilm to protect them against desiccation and rain. After 60 days of inoculation, based on lesion development and tree death, the pathogenicity of the isolates were identified: 2 isolates (AA 8, AMH 12) nil, 4 isolates (AAHX 1, AMH 40, AMD 26, AHDL 1) low, 4 isolates (AA 22, AMH 9, AMMB 7, AHXL 3) moderate, 3 isolates (AMBL 3, AMPL 2, AMH 5) high, and 13 isolates (AA 54, AA 62, AMH 24, AMH 26, AMH 41, AMHX 1, AMQN 1, AMBL 4, AHBB 1, AHBD 1, AHBP 1, AHXL 1 and AHXL 2) very high level of pathogenicity causing plant death.
