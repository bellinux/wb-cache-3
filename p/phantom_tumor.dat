Superficial, non perfused phantom tumors were fashioned in eight anesthetized mongrel dogs by transplantation of the spleen from the abdomen to a subcutaneous site on the hind limb. After pretreatment of the animal with the vasodilator hydralazine (0. 5 mg/kg, IV) to enhance normal tissue perfusion, the spleen implant was heated with a 2450 -MHz microwave diathermy apparatus, first with the animal 2 ̆ 7 s core body temperature in the normal range (39 °C) and then after the animal had been packed in ice to reduce core temperature to 30 °C. Applied power density and temperatures in both the <b>phantom</b> <b>tumor</b> and underlying muscle tissue were recorded during brief interruptions of diathermy until steady-state temperatures had been achieved. Under normothermic conditions with time-averaged applied power of 0. 038 W/ml to <b>phantom</b> <b>tumor</b> and 0. 014 W/ml to underlying muscle, tumor temperature rose to 45. 9 ± l. 8 °C, while muscle temperature remained at 40. 5 ± 0. 7 °C.

Most frequently their appearance is associated with congestive heart failure, but also other disorders like hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency or pleuritis. Its rapid disappearance {{in response to the}} treatment of the underlying disorder is a classical feature of this clinical entity. Case report. A 47 -yearold woman, chronic smoker with symptoms of shortness of breath, orthopnea, chills, cough, weakness and the temperature of 39. 2 °C was admitted to our hospital. A posteroanterior chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with the cardiothoracic ratio of > 0. 5, blunting of both costophrenic angles and an adjacent 6 x 5 cm well-defined, rounded opacity in the right interlobar fissure. Transthoracic 2 -dimensional echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hyperthrophy with a systolic ejection fraction of 25 % and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient’s symptoms resolved rapidly after diuresis, and repeated chest X-ray four days later showed that the right lung opacity and pleural effusions had vanished. Conclusion.

40|$|Introduction Mammography is {{the main}} {{screening}} method in early breast cancer detection in most civilized countries. Although the breast cancer mortality rate decreased with 25 % since the introduction of mammographic population screening, the method still displays relatively high false negative and false positive rates, resulting in missed tumors and unnecessary stress for recalled women. The objective {{of this research is}} to explore the possibilities for optimizing mammographic breast cancer screening with the implementation of a local pressure sensing system. In this approach the differences in stiffness between cancerous tissue and healthy breast tissue are used as a biomarker. -Methods to explore the influence of a tumor surrounded by healthy breast tissue, a breast model was made. The stress distribution along the contact area of the breast with the compression plate is examined performing a numerical and experimental study. Three main input parameters which influence the stress around an inclusion were de fined; the size, the position in depth and the relative elasticity of the tumor. The influence of those parameters were evaluated using finite element analysis. The experimental setup contains a tensile tester used to compress silicone tissue phantoms, with or without a stiffer inclusion representing a tumor. An array of 16 pressure sensors is used to explore the abilities to measure fluctuations in stress distribution caused by the tumor. -Results & Conclusions The presence of a tumor produces a peak in the stress-distribution along the contact surface of the tissue <b>phantom.</b> <b>Tumors</b> embedded in a cylindrical tissue phantom having a diameter of 10 mm or larger are detectable using simple pressure sensors. The influence of the elasticity of a tumor is only noticeable up to a stiffness which is 20 times higher than the surrounding tissue. The stress peak grows exponentially by increasing the size or decreasing the distance from the tumor to the surface. The ability to use differences in the stress distribution for detecting a stiff inclusion surrounded by an elastic material looks promising. Additional research must be performed in order to find a suitable local pressure sensing system. Precision and Microsystems EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

If the tumor size in the shortest axis was smaller than 30  mm, the SUVmax was corrected for partial volume based on historical data obtained with a NEMA <b>phantom</b> [18]. PET <b>tumor</b> response was assessed according to the 1999 EORTC recommendations [24]. The volume for determination of the background activity was delineated posterior of the sternum in the mediastinal fat tissue using the low-dose CT. This volume was chosen {{in order to avoid}} possible confounding by active tumor within the lymph node, and confounding due to artherosclerotic plaques within the great mediastinal vessels. This background volume had to be at least 14  ml.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{technical}} challenge in hyperthermia therapy is to locally heat the tumor region {{up to an}} appropriate temperature to destroy cancerous cells, without damaging the surrounding healthy tissue. Magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is a novel, minimally invasive therapy aiming at concentrating heat inside cancerous tissues. This therapy {{is based on the}} injection of different superparamagnetic nanoparticles inside the tumor. In our study, superparamagnetic nanoparticles, which we developed and characterized, consisted of iron oxide nanoparticles stabilized with polyethylene glycol. Moreover, a new technique for MFH using a specially designed external electromagnetic waveguide as applicator is presented. Three magnetite concentrations were used for making the <b>tumor</b> <b>phantoms,</b> which were embedded in muscle phantoms. The phantoms were radiated and located at three different distances from the applicator. Furthermore, two volumes of tumor (2. 5 mL and 5. 0 mL) were assayed. Heating curves, as a function of time, allowed the establishment of a more appropriate nanoparticle concentration for obtaining the temperature increase suitable for hyperthermia therapy. The results shown in thi...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most {{commonly}} diagnosed cancers in females in UK [1]. Early breast cancer detection which has recently been gaining a lot of consideration within the research community and the most important for a quick and effective treatment of the cancer is early detection. UWB radar based microwave imaging for early breast cancer detection {{is one of}} the most promising and attractive screening techniques currently under research. This technique offers several advantages such as low cost, better patient comfort, non-ionising and non-invasive radiation compared to X-Ray mammography. In this technique the breast is illuminated from various points with short UWB microwave pulse(s) and the collected backscattered energy is then processed to identify the presence and location of the tumour. In this thesis experimental measurement of the reflection coefficient in complex frequency domain is obtained from Vector Network Analyzer (VNA E 5071) when the antenna is exposed to the environment and when the antenna is exposed to breast <b>phantom.</b> The <b>tumor</b> is simulated with different materials to investigate the effectiveness of the Confocal Microwave Imaging Algorithm for breast cancer detection. In addition, we used the materials at different depths to determine the effect of antenna distance to that of the tumor response. The Confocal Microwave Imaging (CMI) Algorithm for breast cancer detection is an easy and robust technique for tumor detection, which is used to approximate the precise location of the tumor. CMI is based on illuminating the breast with the UWB pulse from different antenna locations. The relative arrival times & amplitudes of the backscatter signals is used to estimate the location of the tumor. We applied the Confocal Algorithm in this study to the numerical data generated with the VNA and analyzed the results with different material(s) as tumor at different depth to verify its ability to estimate a tumor response...|$|R
40|$|Lung motion due to {{respiration}} causes {{image degradation}} in medical imaging, especially in nuclear medicine which requires long acquisition times. We {{have developed a}} method for image correction between the respiratory-gated (RG) PET images in different respiration phases or breath-hold (BH) PET images in an inconsistent respiration phase. In the method, the RG or BH-PET images in different respiration phases are deformed under two criteria: similarity of the image intensity distribution and smoothness of the estimated motion vector field (MVF). However, only these criteria may cause unnatural motion estimation of lung. In this paper, assuming {{the use of a}} PET-CT scanner, we add another criterion that is the similarity for the motion direction estimated from inhalation and exhalation CT images. The proposed method was first applied to a numerical <b>phantom</b> XCAT with <b>tumors</b> and then applied to BH-PET image data for seven patients. The resultant tumor contrasts and the estimated motion vector fields were compared with those obtained by our previous method. Through those experiments we confirmed that the proposed method can provide an improved and more stable image quality for both RG and BH-PET images...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of power {{delivered to the}} tumor and the resulting three-dimensional temperature field is necessary to control hyperthermia and to develop optimal treatment plans. Work in this thesis addresses theoretical and experimental approaches to predict temperature distributions in tumors and in <b>tumor</b> <b>phantoms</b> from limited thermocouple data in real-time and to estimate unknown model parameters during the hyperthermia treatment. Efficient numerical solutions of the bioheat equation are developed that are solvable in real-time on a microcomputer. The accuracy of the numerical solutions is evaluated by comparing numerical solutions to known analytical solutions for simple geometries. Parameter estimation is utilized to converge the predicted temperature distribution with the measured temperature. Phantoms for ultrasonic hyperthermia are examined. Attenuation coefficient, absorption coefficient, conduction velocity, density, and melting point of the phantoms are measured. Errors associated with measurements are presented. A number of different phantom materials are investigated. A scanning focused ultrasound hyperthermia delivery system is implemented to evaluate model performance. Spherical phantoms in a water bath are used as targets. Design considerations for focused ultrasound hyperthermia are addressed. Scanning approaches are investigated and implemented. Modeling and control algorithm results in phantoms are presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evaluation {{of changes}} in tumor size from images {{acquired}} by ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common measure of cancer chemotherapy efficacy. Tumor size measurement based on either the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria or the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is the only imaging biomarker for anti-cancer drug testing presently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The aim {{of this paper was}} to design and test a quality assurance phantom with the capability of monitoring tumor size changes with multiple preclinical imaging scanners (US, CT and MRI) in order to facilitate preclinical anti-cancer drug testing. Methods Three phantoms (Gammex/UTHSCSA Mark 1, Gammex/UTHSCSA Mark 2 and UTHSCSA multimodality <b>tumor</b> measurement <b>phantom)</b> containing tumor-simulating test objects were designed and constructed. All three phantoms were scanned in US, CT and MRI devices. The size of test objects in the phantoms was measured from the US, CT and MRI images. RECIST, WHO and volume analyses were performed. Results The smaller phantom size, simplified design and better test object CT contrast of the UTHSCSA multimodality <b>tumor</b> measurement <b>phantom</b> allowed scanning of the phantom in preclinical US, CT and MRI scanners compared with only limited preclinical scanning capability of Mark 1 and Mark 2 phantoms. For all imaging modalities, RECIST and WHO errors were reduced for UTHSCSA multimodality <b>tumor</b> measurement <b>phantom</b> (≤ 1. 69 ± 0. 33 %) compared with both Mark 1 (≤ - 7. 56 ± 6. 52 %) and Mark 2 (≤ 5. 66 ± 1. 41 %) phantoms. For the UTHSCSA multimodality <b>tumor</b> measurement <b>phantom,</b> measured <b>tumor</b> volumes were highly correlated with NIST traceable design volumes for US (R 2 = 1. 000, p 2 = 0. 9999, p 2 = 0. 9998, p Conclusions The UTHSCSA multimodality <b>tumor</b> measurement <b>phantom</b> described in this study can potentially be a useful quality assurance tool for verifying radiologic assessment of tumor size change during preclinical anti-cancer therapy testing with multiple imaging modalities. </p...|$|R
