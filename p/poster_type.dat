40|$|Given 70 % of Americans {{are seeking}} health {{information}} online, social media are becoming {{main sources of}} health-related information and discussions. Specifically, compounding rising trends in use of e-cigarettes in the US, {{there has been a}} rapid rise in e-cigarette marketing â much of which is happening on social media. Public health professionals seeking to understand consumer knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about e-cigarettes should consider analyzing social media data and to do so, there are numerous free and paid tools available. However, each uses different sources and processes, which makes data validation challenging. This exploratory study sought to understand the reliability and feasibility of two social media data tools analyzing e-cigarette tweets. Twitter mentions were pulled from two different industry standard tools (GNIP and Radian 6) and data were evaluated on six measures, e. g. Cost, Feasibility, Ease of Use, <b>Poster</b> <b>Type</b> (individual/organization), Context (tweet content analysis), and Valence (positive/negative). Findings included similarities amongst the data sets in terms of the content themes but differences in cost and ease of use of the tools themselves. These findings align with prior research, notably that e-cigarette marketing tweets are most common and public health-related content is noticeably absent. Findings from this exploratory study can inform futureÂ social mediaÂ studies as well as communication campaigns seeking to address the emerging issue of e-cigarette use.

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the impact of an appearance-based compared to a traditional health-based public health message for healthy eating. Methods: 166 British University students (41 male; aged 20. 6 ± 1. 9 years) were randomized to view either an appearance-based (n= 82) or a health-based (n= 84) fruit promotion poster. Intentions to consume fruit and immediate fruit selection (laboratory observation) were assessed immediately after poster-viewing and subsequent self-report fruit consumption was assessed 3 days later. Results: Intentions to consume fruit were not predicted by <b>poster</b> <b>type</b> (β= 0. 03, p= 0. 74), but were associated with fruit-based liking, past consumption, attitudes, and social norms (smallest β= 0. 16, p= 0. 04). Immediate fruit selection was greater following the appearance-based compared to the health-based poster (β=- 0. 24, p< 0. 01), and this effect remained when controlling for participant characteristics (β=- 0. 21, p< 0. 01). Subsequent fruit consumption was greater following the appearance-based compared to the health-based poster (β=- 0. 22, p= 0. 03), but this effect became non-significant on consideration of participant characteristics (β=- 0. 15, p= 0. 13), and was instead associated with fruit-based liking and past consumption (smallest β= 0. 24, p= 0. 03). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the clear value of an appearance-based compared to a health-based health promotion poster for increasing fruit selection.

40|$|Aims: Responsible {{drinking}} messages (RDMs) {{are used}} as a key tool to reduce alcohol-related harms. A common form of RDM is a poster format displayed {{in places such as}} bars, bus stops and toilet cubicles. However, evidence for the effectiveness of RDMs remains limited. Moreover, it is not known how environmental contexts (e. g. the number of alcohol related cues in the environment) impact how such RDMs are interacted with, nor how this in turn affects their efficacy. Methods: One hundred participants completed a pseudo taste preference task in either in a bar laboratory (alcohol cue rich environmental context) or a traditional laboratory. The walls of the laboratory displayed either RDM or control posters during this task and eye tracking was used to assess participant attention to the posters. Results: Participants looked at the RDM posters less in the bar laboratory where the environmental context is rich in alcohol cues compared to a traditional laboratory where alcohol cues are sparse. Neither <b>poster</b> <b>type</b> or environmental context affected the amount of ‘alcohol’ consumed and the amount of visual attention given to RDMs was unrelated to the amount of ‘alcohol’ consumed. Conclusions: These findings provide experimental evidence that RDMs do not influence drinking behavior during active consumption. In addition, locating RDMs in alcohol-cue rich environments may result in sub-optimal behavioural responses to the RDM materials (e. g. visual attention to content). To maximize the potential impact of RDMs, the optimal location for RDMs is in environments where pre-existing alcohol cues are sparse to non-existent...|$|E

40|$|After the {{evacuation}} of a transcendental ethic as a universal yardstick or law for action, notions of justice, morality and the law nevertheless remain policed, and are still invested in by strong systems of belief and prejudice. This thesis sets out to analyse the tradition and prevalence of “idealising” moments of consequence, judgement and decision and their specific relation to a transcendental-style aesthetics of violence. In this written thesis and in my studio-based work I examine the themes of “naturalised justice” and “decision” as means to achieve autonomy, hinged as they are upon critical, theoretical and cultural representations of, and responses to, {{the problem of the}} ubiquity of violence. As such, my thesis also asks how the rhetoric of this apparently mutual or shared conviction of autonomy as aggression, violence or force, produces judgement within culture in general, upon and within the condition of absolute finitude. It is through the empirical examination of my studio practice that I consider the universalising forces of individual authorities using the “worn out metaphors” of the post-tragic hero genre. Here, I create movie <b>poster</b> <b>type</b> images and pop-music style videos in which my appropriation of the powerful propaganda of Hollywood movies lives out the impossibility of exteriority, that is, the difficulty of separating this use of the medium from my being caught up within it. These apparently abstract and generic narratives of agency are the focus of my practice throughout. Through them, I investigate (i) the rhetoric of “violence as decision” as something which undermines its own determinism; (ii) the political force of such rhetoric in relation to the naturalisation of belief, (such as traditional, conventional and assumed agreements in the social); and (iii) the procedures and consequences of performances of the rhetoric of violence practiced in the judgements and convictions of individual subjects.

40|$|Colour and {{typography}} are a {{means of}} art expression that {{play a crucial role}} in poster design. The choice and relationship between them tell us what message we are trying to convey and, what is more, how we express it. They influence the way and intensity of message expression and thus indirectly also human social roles and behaviour, although on a lower consciousness level. In my Master's thesis, I focus on the relationship between colour and typography on a poster as {{a means of}} art expression, and, although the power of a poster depends on many factors, I tackle the issue through theoretical and empirical research, from two points of view. In the theoretical part of the thesis, I research the definition of a <b>poster,</b> <b>types</b> of a <b>poster</b> and its history. I pay particular attention to seven colour contrasts based on Johannes Itten, to emotional and functional meaning of colours and their psychologically-symbolic effect. I define the typography, its meaning and history. I research the relationship between the outlook and text as well. The research approach used is a theoretical one, by using the method of literature study and overview of resources open to public on the internet. Moreover, I also make a formal art analysis of twentyone posters of different authors, crucial for the research, with the help of which I verify the outcomings of the theoretical research on the case of specific art forms of posters. In the empirical part of the thesis, my goal is to establish whether pupils grasp the basic meaning of a poster in my introductory lesson, when they try to guess the meaning of colour and typography on previously analysed posters. I try to improve their knowledge of posters and fortify the idea of poster's powerful message. I use the quantitative analysis and causal-experimental method on the intentional sample consisting of 38 pupils from the ninth class of primary school. I carry out three lessons, including the introductory one, with the experimental group and two lessons with the control group. I analyse the art work of pupils with the help of external assessors and descriptive grading scale. ...|$|R

FT 04 - 02 (P 137 A) <b>Poster</b> AwardMembrane <b>Type</b> 1 -Matrix Metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP), {{also called}} as MMP 14, is a {{membrane}} tethered enzyme essential for tissue remodeling and signaling transducing events ranging from {{growth and development}} to cancer progression and metastasis. Mmp 14 -/- mice exhibit severe craniofacial abnormalities {{similar to those of}} FGF signaling mutant mice. We found that cranial defects occurred as early as 15. 5 dpc. in Mmp 14 -/- embryos, resulting from compromised FGF signaling that is a consequence of increased FGFR 2 shedding mediated by ADAM 9. MT 1 -MMP forms a complex with ADAM 9 and FGFR 2. Through this complex formation, MT 1 -MMP proteolytically inactivates ADAM 9 to protect FGFR 2 from ectodomain shedding. Interestingly, targeted deletion of ADAM 9 significantly rescued cranial defects of Mmp 14 -/- mice in a FGF signaling-dependent manner. These findings reveal a novel paradigm for the regulation of FGF signaling (Chan et al., 2012). In addition, MT 1 -MMP can regulate another ADAM family member, ADAM 15. MT 1 -MMP physically interacts with and cleaves ADAM 15 to promote its degradation (Wong et al., 2012). Disturbance of this regulatory loop, such as depletion of ADAM 15 in Mmp 14 -/- mice, leads to aberrant neovascularization. These results suggest that the regulation of ADAM 15 by MT 1 -MMP is essential for the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. These findings also highlight the importance of the functional crosstalk between MMP and ADAM families in physiological development and probably other pathological conditions...|$|R

Typographical research is central to this series of <b>posters.</b> These <b>types</b> of typographic interpretations are atypical of what is common in the tradition of film posters and were therefore met with a lot of approval in the graphic world. In traditional film posters, informative value, star worship and marketing logic generally take precedence over the artistic experiment. The students were challenged to break through the stereotypical pattern of the film poster design. The starting points were simple. Each poster departed from a white surface, took the film as a starting point and focussed on an innovative and explorative design practice. Some students chose to graphically reinterpret the original film poster, others attempted to completely deconstruct the poster format, create a typographic poem or radically reinterpret certain film contents. These often daring graphic statements also stimulate the film lover’s gaze. They are not merely an announcement of the film, but wish to transform it graphically. The publication also served as an exhibition catalogue. Linked to the presentation of the book, a selection of posters was exhibited during the festivities of the 150 th anniversary of Sint-Lucas and in the margin of the 2012 Ghent Film Festival.

40|$|Youth work is {{inherently}} filled with dilemmas: {{the challenges in}} which there are tensions between competing considerations, conflicting interests, and multiple options for taking action (Larson & Walker, 2010). Ethical challenges in particular deal with “rights, duties, needs, interests, relationships, motives and the maintenance or transgression of prevailing norms” (Banks, 2010, p. 12). Complex ethical dilemmas often surface unexpectedly within everyday practice. They unfold quickly and demand a response within a very short time frame. To understand and improve effective youth work practice during such ethical dilemmas, our research explores the types of ethical tensions that practitioners face and how contextually embedded responses facilitate ethical development for both the youth worker and young person. Our research is based on interview data collected from 25 program leaders across time in 13 programs for high school aged youth. Leaders were asked to identify a recent dilemma situation they faced in the program, what considerations they had in this situation, how they formulated their response, and what happened as a result. This yielded data about 71 dilemma scenarios, 18 of which were identified as ethical. This <b>poster</b> features three <b>types</b> of ethical dilemmas that arise in youth work, including situations where a young person violates a program norm, engages in illicit or risky behavior, and situations that represented incongruent values between youth worker and the young people or their family.

The WS 4 is caused by mutations {{in any of the}} following three genes: endothelin- 3 (EDN 3), endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB), or SOX 10. Materials and methods: Exons and exon/intron boundaries of the three candidate genes (EDN 3, EDNRB, SOX 10) were screened for mutations by direct sequencing of PCR products in a three-generation family (14 individuals) whose members were affected with WS 4 or only HSCR. The family members were also genotyped for 2. 5 million genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms -SNP- and copy number variation probes -CNVs-) using Illumina Human Omni 2. 5 -quad BeadChip. After quality control and pruning of SNPs in high linkage-disequilibrium, the Merlin software was used for parametric and non-parametric linkage. To test the effect of the mutation identified, wild-type and mutated mammalian expression vectors encoding for EDNRB isoforms (with green fluorescent protein -GFP-) were/will (isoform 3) transiently transfected in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells. Results: Direct sequencing revealed a heterozygous novel nonsense mutation in EDNRB (Chromosome 13). This mutation corresponds to M 1 V of the EDNRB isoforms 1 and 2 and M 91 V of the EDNRB isoform 3. It was present in four affected and two unaffected family members. The PolyPhen and SIFT prediction for M 1 V (isoforms 1 & 2) and for M 91 V (isoform 3) was damaging (abolishes the ATG start site) and benign respectively. Importantly, the 3 EDNRB transcripts are expressed in the human new-born gut. HEK 293 cells transfected with vector with wild-type EDNRB-GFP showed mainly a cell membrane localization, while the M 1 V mutated EDNRB-GFP revealed a clustered localization in cytoplasm indicating that EDNRB receptor cannot translocate to cell membrane. Analysis of M 91 V is underway. Our linkage analysis indicated that additional genes may be contributing to the phenotype. Conclusion: We found and characterized a novel nonsense mutation. The EDNRB mutation is deleterious in isoforms 1 and 2 (M 1 V) but predicted benign in isoform 3 (M 91 V) (in vitro is study underway). The variable manifestation of the disease may depend on the ratio between the EDNRB isoforms expressed in gut or/and additional genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|R

The study investigates the reality of tobacco advertising and marketing in a representative sample of EU Member States. The detailed evidence provided in this report will shed light on how current EU- and national- level regulation of tobacco and e-cigarette advertising is working in practice. Exposure is measured both by looking at actual advertising spend, what advertising activity is occurring in different channels and looking at what advertising citizens recall, as measured through a citizens' survey. These are complemented by a survey of national experts and a review of secondary data. We examine exposure to advertising through a wide range of channels including print, outdoor, TV and radio, online, sponsorship and corporate social responsibility. Strategies for selling tobacco at point of sale are also assessed, including a review of the different kind of retailers, such as specialised retailers (tobacconists), retail outlets (including supermarkets) and vending machines. Where information exists, we assess the extent to which young people in particular are exposed to this marketing. The report takes into account the regulatory context at EU and national levels, given that certain forms of advertising (e. g. billboards, point of sale) are still allowed in some Member States.

This <b>poster</b> illustrates the <b>types</b> of data accessible through the application, query and visualization tools, and sample outputs. The green boxes call out some of the primary open data issues associated with the application’s main features. Based on what the web application allows, to what extent do you think our data platform achieves open access goals and principles? Global Impact Study Goal: To investigate the impacts of public access to ICTs in venues such as libraries, telecenters, and cybercafés. Timeline: 2007 – 2012 Primary Research Questions: 1. What are the social and economic impacts of public access to ICTs? 2. What is the magnitude of these impacts and how can we measure them? 3. What is the relationship between {{the costs and benefits of}} providing and using public access ICTs? Inventory Why: To capture the magnitude and distribution of the venues studied in the project What: Address, venue type, and venue characteristic data Where: Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Lithuania, Philippines How: Through publically available, administrative data Open data: Tapping all sources We know that there are limitations to our data collection methods and users may find inaccuracies or gaps in some of our data. However, public users can currently only download data. How can we enable users to correct and supplement our data and at the same time maintain the integrity of the data?

Para se sustentar teórica e epistemologicamente, o trabalho articulou a teoria das representações sociais, os conceitos de espaço urbano, o lugar e não-lugar e a teoria dos campos conceituais do francês Gérard Vergnaud. Na construção da pesquisa, discorri sobre temas correlatos como subjetividade, juventudes, desenvolvimento conceitual, sujeito. A pesquisa evidenciou a necessidade de gerar um método de investigação que possibilitasse perceber as múltiplas dimensões envolvidas na temática. Assim, jovens de uma área urbana da cidade de Ceilândia - Distrito Federal, foram convidados e passaram pelas diferentes fases de pesquisa que foram: narrativa de história de vida, fotografia de seus espaços urbanos, análise, pelos próprios jovens de suas fotos e produção de um cartaz, tipo mapa conceitual no qual comentaram sobre as relações e significados dos espaços registrados. As conversas estabelecidas entre mim e os jovens foram registradas, transcritas e analisadas por mim, imediatamente depois de concluída cada etapa da investigação. Os protocolos dos sujeitos pesquisados mostraram-se muito ricos de dados e possibilitaram evidenciar representações sociais do grupo de jovens sobre seu espaço urbano enquanto objeto multifacetado e com dimensões complementares. Essa representação está ancorada nas experiências de vida dos jovens e se objetiva no seu cotidiano interferindo em suas ações. O processo gerou outros resultados como o próprio método de pesquisa e a revelação dos jovens enquanto sujeitos geográficos, ou seja, aquele que constrói seus conceitos em situações geográficas, que nascem e vivem em uma sociedade repleta de saberes geográficos. A pesquisa também possibilitou sistematizar hipóteses tais como a de que as representações sociais dos jovens acerca de seu espaço urbano podem interferir em seu processo de aprendizagem geográfica de temas concernentes; fomentou desejos que se sistematizaram em questões que podem sustentar outras pesquisas em educação geográfica, tais como: quais os esquemas desenvolvidos pelo sujeito, em uma situação escolar, no processo de aprendizagem de conteúdos da matéria geografia? Assim, esta pesquisa busca contribuir para a educação geográfica ao apontar para a necessidade de se {{considerar}} o sujeito geográfico no processo que envolve os saberes escolares, revelando a necessidade de se investir na formação contínua dos professores. ______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{main objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the social representation of a group of young people about its urban space. In order to support itself theoretical and epistemologically, the work articulated a theory of the social representation, the concept of urban space, the place and non-place and the theory of the concepts camps of the french Gérard Vergnaud. In the research building, it was necessary to discourse about correlate subjects like subjectiveness, youth, concept development, subject, culture and power. The research evidenced the necessity of begetting an investigation method that enabled to notice the multiple dimensions involved in the thematic. Thus, young people from an urban area of the city of Ceilândia, Federal District, were invited to pass through different phases of the research, which were: life history narrative, photography of their urban spaces, analysis by the own young of their photographies and a <b>poster</b> production, <b>type</b> a concept map on which commented about the relations and meanings of the registered spaces. The talks fixed between the young and the researcher were recorded, transcribed and analyzed by the researcher immediately after the conclusion of each investigation stage. The protocol of the researched subjects showed themselves very rich of data and anabled to evidence social representations of the young group about their urban space while myriad object and with complementary dimensions. The representation is anchored on the young life experiences and aims their quotidian, interfering in their actions. The process begot other results like the own research method and the revelation of the young while geographic subjects, that is, those who build their concepts in geographic situations, who are born and live in a society full of geographic knowledges. The research also enabled to systematize hypothesis such as that the young social representation about their urban space can interfere in their geographic apprenticeship process of touching subjects; fomented wishes that systematize themselves in questions that can sustain other researches in geographic education, such: what are the schemes developed by the subject, in a school situation, in the apprenticeship process of geography discipline content? Thus, this research aimed to contribute for the geographic education, pointing to the necessity of considering the geographic subject in the process that involves the school knowledge, revealing the necessity of investing on the continuous development of the teachers...|$|R
