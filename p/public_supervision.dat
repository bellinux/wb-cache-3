A really fine work, and really getting on. Moreover, a great system of drainage. Another really fine work, and likewise really getting on. Lastly, a muddle of railways in all directions possible and impossible, with no general public scheme, no general <b>public</b> <b>supervision,</b> enormous waste of money, no fixable responsibility, no accountability but under Lord Campbell's Act. I think of that accident in which I was preserved. Before the most furious and notable train in the four-and-twenty hours, {{the head of a}} gang of workmen takes up the rails. That train changes its time every day as the tide changes, and that head workman is not provided by the railway company with any clock or watch! Lord Shaftesbury wrote to me to ask me what I thought of an obligation on railway companies to put strong walls to all bridges and viaducts. I told him, of course, that the force of such a shock would carry away anything that any company could set up, and I added: [...] "Ask the minister what he thinks about the votes of the railway interest in the House of Commons, and about his being afraid to lay a finger on it with an eye to his majority." ...|$|E

I am now on a burning question: the labour traffic; and I shall ask permission in this place only to touch it with the tongs. Suffice {{it to say that}} in Queensland, Fiji, New Caledonia, and Hawaii it has been either suppressed or placed under close <b>public</b> <b>supervision.</b> In Samoa, where it still flourishes, there is no regulation of which the public receives any evidence; and the dirty linen of the firm, if there be any dirty, and if it be ever washed at all, is washed in private. This is unfortunate, if Germans would believe it. But they have no idea of publicity, keep their business to themselves, rather affect to [...] "move in a mysterious way," [...] and are naturally incensed by criticisms, which they consider hypocritical, from men who would import [...] "labour" [...] for themselves, if they could afford it, and would probably maltreat them if they dared. It is said the whip is very busy on some of the plantations; it is said that punitive extra-labour, by which the thrall's term of service is extended, has grown to be an abuse; and it is complained that, even where that term is out, much irregularity occurs in the repatriation of the discharged. To all this I can say nothing, good or bad. A certain number of the thralls, many of them wild negritos from the west, have taken to the bush, harbour there in a state partly bestial, or creep into the back quarters of the town to do a day's stealthy labour under the nose of their proprietors. Twelve were arrested one morning in my own boys' kitchen. Farther in the bush, huts, small patches of cultivation, and smoking ovens, have been found by hunters. There are still three runaways in the woods of Tutuila, whither they escaped upon a raft. And the Samoans regard these dark-skinned rangers with extreme alarm; the fourth refugee in Tutuila was shot down (as I was told in that island) while carrying off the virgin of a village; and tales of cannibalism run round the country, and the natives shudder about the evening fire. For the Samoans are not cannibals, do not seem to remember when they were, and regard the practice with a disfavour equal to our own.|$|E

40|$|The {{necessity}} of rebuilding Chinese rural financial supervision system is expounded. Rebuilding rural financial supervision system {{is conducive to}} normalizing rural financial order and forming the benign competitive situation; to clarifying {{the role played by}} rural financial organization and providing better financial services for â€œthree agricultureâ€; to forming safe rural financial environment to promote the development of rural economy and national economy. The restricting factors of rebuilding Chinese rural financial supervision system are analyzed. The major reasons are that rural financial legislation is relatively backward and the supervision department lacks the necessary legal basis. The administrative supervision is insufficient, which lead to the mal-position, administrative offside and vacancy of rural financial supervision; rural financial organization mechanism is unreasonable and the internal supervision mechanism is relatively bad; supervision organization of rural financial industry is imperfect and the function is imperfect; <b>public's</b> <b>supervision</b> awareness is weak and social supervision mechanism develops slowly. The paths for rebuilding Chinese rural financial supervision system are put forward including accelerating rural financial legislation to provide perfect legal evidence for rural financial supervision system; clarifying the position on governmental functions and fully displaying the leading role of rural financial supervision; establishing specialized rural financial supervision organization to perfect its supervision functions; vigorously cultivating people's supervision awareness to promote the development of social supervision mechanism.

5000|$|The [...] "free" [...] public {{education}} means educational services {{must be provided}} at public expense, under <b>public</b> <b>supervision</b> and direction, and without charge to parents except for fees that are charged for all students.

40|$|In {{financial}} market studies, <b>public</b> <b>supervision</b> {{has rarely been}} found to have any effects on {{financial market}} development. This is true, even though the primary objective of supervisory legislation is the limitation of market failures and externalities. Studies conducted by eg the World Bank and La Porta & al imply that whereas private enforcement contributes to financial market development, there is limited evidence that <b>public</b> <b>supervision</b> does the same. The objective of the paper is to empirically investigate the relation between <b>public</b> <b>supervision</b> and financial market development. This is done by focusing on major legislative features directing the supervisor and hence affecting market participant activities. The markets investigated comprise banks, investment firms, investment fund companies and listed companies in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Poland and Estonia for the years 1996 to 2005. The results suggest that certain features of <b>public</b> <b>supervision</b> correlate with financial market development. Strong legal obligations for the supervisor to develop legislation correlate significantly with higher company market values. Emphasizing economic aspects in the formulation of supervisory objectives corresponds with higher market profitability. Furthermore, severe monetary sanctions applicable to company directors correlate negatively with market growth. Unexpectedly, {{the same is true for}} a high degree of supervisory independence. The results imply links between <b>public</b> <b>supervision</b> and financial market development in a manner not always in line with previous research. Why this is the case, requires further investigation. One possible explanation may be methodological, based on the fact that in the present study legislative features are perceived in a conceptual rather than a technical manner. financial institution; regulation; supervision; utility...|$|E

The theoretical part of the diploma thesis observes findings dealing with atmosphere in general, internal environment, and state <b>public</b> health <b>supervision.</b> The research part of the thesis was completed employing a qualitative research. Methods employed in data collection were observation and documents analysis. The data collection was carried out by secondary data analysis.

Yet, {{by the time of the}} 21 st century, armed with the Internet, <b>public</b> opinion <b>supervision</b> has evolved into a powerful phenomenon with a life of its own. At its present time, the strange twist of logic is that the press is still tightly controlled by the Community Party but public opinion has been roaming wildly on the Internet, and creeping into the court rooms. To capture the above dynamic, this paper studies the top 20 events discussed in blogs, microblogs and online discussion boards in China between 2008 and 2012, and analyses the extent that public opinion has influenced the investigation and judicial outcome of cases. This article focuses on the intricate relationship between the Party, the judiciary, the Internet and the netizens.
