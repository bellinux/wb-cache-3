5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E

500|$|On June 11, 2007, {{the plaintiffs}} {{presented}} their first argument, {{in which they}} contended that Michelle Cedillo, {{as well as other}} children with autism, suffered from a [...] "mercury efflux disorder" [...] which was described by Aposhian, their first expert witness, as [...] "a problem with getting a metal, in this case mercury, out of a cell." [...] As evidence that such disorders have been documented before, he pointed to Wilson's disease. Aposhian based this claim, in part, on three peer-reviewed papers. The first such study was co-authored by Boyd Haley, and concluded that hair of children with autism contained less mercury than that of children without autism. Aposhian stated that [...] "we know that the hair is an excretory organ and that the hair is reflective of the mercury or the metal in the blood, and the blood {{is a reflection of the}} mercury in the tissues, and so the fact that the children with autism had less mercury in their hair was a hint or indication that <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> mercury efflux disorder." [...] The second of these studies was conducted by James B. Adams, and found that baby teeth of children with autism had more than twice as much mercury as those of children without autism. Aposhian cited this study as evidence that [...] "autistic children have a greater body burden of mercury." [...] Another study which Aposhian used to back up this statement was one conducted by Jeff Bradstreet and Mark Geier, which gave dimercaptosuccinic acid, a chelating agent, to children and concluded that children with autism excreted much more mercury thereafter than children without autism. [...] Aposhian also cited a number of in vitro studies as evidence that thimerosal could cause immune system dysregulation.|$|E

2500|$|The poem is {{generally}} more valued by historians than by literary criticsit has been thought to lack elegance and wit, and it strangely includes elements of choral lyric {{though it is}} not a choral song but a solo performance. The choral elements are dactylo-epitrite meter and what seems to be triadic structure (i.e. strophe, antistrophe, epode) C.M. Bowra considered it [...] "a strange and uncomfortable poem". Another scholar saw parallels between it and Anacreon's Artemon but judged Anacreon's poem to have more grace and wit. However, scholarly analysis of the poem has not produced agreement or convincing results and much depends on how we interpret the poet's tone. The reference to Leto is obscure but she may have had some connection with Salamis or <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a temple to her at Corinth.|$|E

Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, [...] "I wasn't even sure at that point â€“ really, I {{had no idea who}} had done it until Manson's group were actually arrested for it. It had only crossed my mind and I had a premonition, <b>perhaps.</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> some little tickle in my mind that the killings might be connected with them..."

2500|$|However, a {{transverse}} wave apparently required the propagating medium {{to behave as}} a solid, {{as opposed to a}} gas or fluid. The idea of a solid that did not interact with other matter seemed a bit odd, and Augustin-Louis Cauchy suggested that <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some sort of [...] "dragging", or [...] "entrainment", but this made the aberration measurements difficult to understand. He also suggested that the absence of longitudinal waves suggested that the aether had negative compressibility. George Green pointed out that such a fluid would be unstable. George Gabriel Stokes became a champion of the entrainment interpretation, developing a model in which the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid at very high frequencies and fluid at lower speeds. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, but it would be rigid enough to support light.|$|E

But it is known for certain that in the years following 1770, at least six people in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendall, Plett 1791) tested successfully the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans. [...] In 1796, Sarah Nelmes, a local milkmaid, contracted cowpox and went to Jenner for treatment. Jenner took the opportunity to test his theory. He inoculated James Phipps, the eight-year-old son of his gardener, with material taken from the cowpox lesions on Sarah's hand. After a mild fever and the expected local lesion James recovered after a few days. About two months later Jenner inoculated James on both arms with material from a case of smallpox, with no effect; the boy was immune to smallpox.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1990s, a feud between al-Bashir and al-Turabi began, mostly due to al-Turabi's {{links to}} Islamic {{fundamentalist}} groups, {{as well as}} allowing them to operate out of Sudan, even personally inviting Osama bin Laden to the country. The United States had listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993, mostly due to al-Bashir and Hassan al-Turabi taking complete power in the early 1990s. U.S. firms have been barred from doing business in Sudan since 1997. In 1998, the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum was destroyed by a U.S. cruise missile strike because of its alleged production of chemical weapons and links to al-Qaeda. However the U.S. State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research wrote a report in 1999 questioning {{the attack on the}} factory, suggesting that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate; James Risen reported in the New York Times: [...] "Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; <b>perhaps</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak." ...|$|E
