40|$|The {{field of}} complex {{services}} contains several actors. First {{it is the}} complex service companies that supply a <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> <b>supplier.</b> The professional service provider acts in many cases as a consultant. Secondly, the professional service provider works together with the client to reach a more efficient marketing. That marketing is then directed towards the customer. The customer is the client’s client and the end result. The purpose with this dissertation is to investigate if {{it is possible to}} standardize the working procedure {{in order to make it}} as efficient as possible. We choose to investigate this based on interviews with two firms: Marklyss, a domestically operating firm, and GFK, an internationally operating firm. Our limitation is due to the ability to find participating firms. Based on the interviews, we analysed the collected information through different theories such as 7 K and standardization versus adaptation model. This was done to find similarities and differences between the companies. We found that there were some similarities that could be used to create a standardized platform for the working procedure. Also we found some differences that could be investigated further if there is any possibility to find out why and if it is possible to transform it into a similarity...|$|E

Hur utvärderas en professionell tjänst? Dessa frågor är några av problemen som inköpare ställs mot, litteraturen består av mängder med kriterier och {{modeller}} för inköp av produkter men är bristfällig när det handlar om tjänster. Litteratur säger att besparingar på inköp av tjänster varierar mellan 10 och 29 %, medan på varor kan det endast variera mellan 5 till 17 %. Vid inköp av tjänster finns potentialen till att spara pengar, men kvaliteten på tjänsten får ej påverkas. I många fall är det en avvägning mellan kvalitet och pris. Detta examensarbete belyser de kriterier som är användbara vid utvärdering av professionella tjänster, samt ett förslag på en modell hur dessa kriterier kan användas. Arbetet är genomfört som en fallstudie på ett IT-företag i Sverige, som köper in professionella tjänster och använder dem mot slutkund.

Efter genomförd fallstudie har följande slutsatser dragits:Kriterier kan inordnas i tre olika kategorier beroende på vad de utvärderar; Leverantörskriterier utvärderar själva leverantören som sådan, Prestationskriterier utvärderar en leverantörs förmåga att leverera en tjänst och Produktkriterier som utvärderar själva tjänsten som sådan. På det hela taget kan sägas att kriterier som utvärderar de kvalitativa aspekterna av en leverans oftast är betydligt viktigare att utvärdera när professionella tjänster ska beaktas. Vidare har ofta professionella tjänster karaktären av att vara beroende av den strategiska passformen mellan leverantör, köpande företag, slutkund och kriterier som utvärderar dessa delar har därför prioriterats. Anledningen till detta är att värderealiseringen i professionella tjänster till stor del ligger i själva leveransen och interaktionen mellan dessa parter och kräver därför en hög grad av samverkan, kvalitet och service knuten till själva tjänsten. What kind {{of criteria}} {{is useful for}} a company when evaluating their suppliers? Does it depend on if the <b>supplier</b> delivers <b>services</b> or products? How can one evaluate a <b>professional</b> <b>service?</b> These questions {{are just a few}} of the problems a buyer face today, the literature of today holds many criteria and models for buying products but has a lack of information when it comes to <b>professional</b> <b>services.</b> The estimated possibilities to save money when purchasing services vary between 10 to 29 % but on products it vary only between 5 and 17 %. There is a potential of saving money when purchasing services, but the quality of the service can not be affected. In many cases there is a trade-off between quality and price. This master thesis will illustrate the criteria that can be used when evaluating a <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> and a model where the criteria can be used. The thesis is written after a conducted case study on an IT-company in Sweden, which buy <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> and use them towards their end costumers. The questions at issue that have been driving the search for information by the authors are: Which criteria are needed to conduct an evaluation of a <b>supplier</b> in <b>professional</b> <b>services?</b> How should an evaluation of a supplier be conducted when keeping these criteria in mind? The case study led to the following conclusions:Criteria can be categorized in three different categories depending on what they evaluate; Supplier criteria regarding the supplier itself, Performance criteria regarding the performance of delivery and Product criteria regarding the service itself. Regarding the area of evaluation of <b>professional</b> <b>service</b> <b>suppliers</b> it can be said that the qualitative criteria seems to be dominating. Moreover, the <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> have the characteristics of being dependent upon the strategic fit between supplier, buyer and end customer. Criteria evaluating those aspects have therefore been prioritized in this study. The reason for this is that the value realization in <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> is in the delivery of service and in the interaction between the parties involved, therefore demanding a high degree of cooperation, quality and service bound to the service itself...|$|R
30|$|Geographic {{agglomeration}} of {{the service}} industry is an inevitable choice of the external economy, scale economy, and scope economy. However, China must guard against the development of agglomeration being trapped into the practice of ‘agglomeration {{for the purpose of}} agglomerating,’ for agglomeration is only a means and not a goal. Taking the route of agglomeration development should avoid collecting companies in one region that seem to be interrelated but are not actually related to each other and cannot produce a synergistic effect. Real agglomeration is a group composed by companies related to each other: <b>professional</b> <b>suppliers,</b> <b>service</b> providers, firms related to the industry, related R&D institutes, and relevant industry associations, which are collected geographically. It is a phenomenon in which a large number of companies closely related to one industry and relevant supporting institutions gather together in one specific region and form a strong and continuous competitive advantage.|$|R

The lived experience is described from the interior design practitioner perspective. The background to the design of the school is outlined, and the design process and design changes that were made during the build process are detailed. The main features discussed are the toilet areas, hoist lifting system, the wayfinding and signage system, the hydrotherapy pool, and the wheelchair storage areas. Working relationships with key stakeholders involved in the design process are documented, including the Head Teacher, the staff, stu-dents, health <b>professionals,</b> <b>service</b> providers, and <b>suppliers.</b> During the build process, additional examples are provided of positive working arrangements between the project manager and the contractor to resolve design issues. The design case concludes by suggesting that, in this particular case, constant dialogue between all parties involved was a key component of this successful design outcome, in addition to obtaining design input {{from a variety of sources}} and flexibility to overcome issues on site.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to propose a {{standardization}} model for the purchase process of legal <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> leveraging e-Procurement and to validate the benefits brought by the implementation of both, an e-Procurement tool and a new procurement process. The hypotheses of this thesis are applicable to the procurement of legal <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> of large companies with a central legal department in charge of managing the relations with different legal firms (legal <b>services</b> <b>suppliers).</b> The information presented was gathered in a large global manufacturing company with strong presence in Europe. The procurement of legal <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> throughout the entire organization was analyzed and validated by central legal department based in the headquarters. An innovative model for the procurement of the legal services has been proposed based on different findings in the current literature. Also, a model developed by Ronchi et al. was leveraged to quantitatively measure the benefits brought by the implementation of e-Procurement. The model was implemented in the organization {{with the help of}} central purchasing and legal departments. The results showed it is possible to standardize the operative procurement of legal <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> for end-users to perceive the same process as the one used for direct purchases of office supplies. In order to accomplish this, some roles and an important transformation within the organization must be carried out. A general model to implement a comprehensive procurement process leveraging e-Procurement is presented in this study. The conclusions are that the specialized procurement literature focuses very little on service procurement standardization and even less in legal <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> or process standardization through e-Procurement, and thus this study and the model introduced might work {{as a starting point for}} professional practitioners or academic researchers alike. Further research topics are suggested at the end of this study to continue research on this topic...|$|R

Further, in telecommunications, courier services, and commercial banking, the government’s control over one major firm in the sector is suspended.

The performance of the contact <b>services</b> <b>supplier</b> directly affects end customer satisfaction which underlines the need for appropriate management of customer contacts and consideration of the end customer's perspective in designing appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs). This research draws on various streams of literature including services purchasing, performance management and service quality to derive propositions on how to manage customer contact <b>services</b> <b>suppliers.</b> These propositions are subsequently investigated in an in-depth case study. The results of the case study show that managing customer contact <b>services</b> <b>suppliers</b> on effectiveness rather than efficiency benefits the overall performance of the supplier. This research shows that quality improvements in both process and service delivery ultimately lead to decreased costs. These improvements will furthermore enhance customer satisfaction and improve buying company performance.

Method: Quantitative analyses of a sample of 850 informants. Results: Supportive networks exist for a majority of the informants and can also be a substitute for <b>professional</b> <b>services</b> in many respects. Regarding help to recover, social networks may offer qualities equal to those of <b>professional</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, there is a positive relationship between trust in a social network and trust in public <b>professional</b> <b>services.</b> Trust in a social network also increases the probability of achieving positive experiences with <b>professional</b> <b>services.</b> Conclusion: Our findings imply that more network qualities should be included in <b>professional</b> <b>services,</b> and also that professionals should assist vulnerable groups in building networks...|$|R
