5|$|A Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold to {{determine}} the number contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was held at Hard Justice. The match was announced on the April 29 episode of Impact! by DOA Rhodes. In a Gauntlet for the Gold, two wrestlers start the bout, with more entering at time intervals, in which the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the opponent by throwing them over the top rope and to the floor. When the match is down to two wrestlers, a standard match is held, with the winner being the one to gain the pinfall or submission. On the May 6 episode of Impact!, Abyss was announced as a participant in the match. TNA held a Ten-Man Gauntlet on the May 13 episode of Impact! {{to determine}} the first and final entrants in the match, with the first eliminated in the match entering first while the winner being the last entrant. Abyss, Bobby Roode, David Young, A-1, Chris Sabin, Petey Williams, Lance Hoyt, Michael Shane, Trytan, and Apolo all participated in the bout, with Roode being the first eliminated and Abyss winning the contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines at this <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many {{consider to be the}} ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the settlement marches, 36 settlement <b>points</b> <b>were</b> planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> established. The population of these <b>points</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> circa 20-30% German. Marking {{the center of each}} <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a planned German city of c. 20,000 inhabitants, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> surrounded by closely located German villages in a 5-10 km radius. The villages <b>were</b> <b>to</b> secure the German control of all major road and railroad nodes.|$|R

(One version depicts Goram as lazy and Vincent as keen and industrious.) The geographical <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> explain the narrow gorge of the Hazel Brook (a tributary of the river Trym) in Henbury and the dramatic Avon Gorge through which the Avon now flows. The onomastic <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> account {{for the name of}} the Avon Gorge, but this is a bit feeble since the river has had this name from time immemorial.|$|E
25|$|Many {{optimization}} algorithms need {{to start}} from a feasible point. One way to obtain such a <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> relax the feasibility conditions using a slack variable; with enough slack, any starting point is feasible. Then, minimize that slack variable until slack is null or negative.|$|E
25|$|As for Hermitian matrices, the key <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{prove the}} {{existence}} {{of at least one}} nonzero eigenvector. To prove this, we cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but instead one can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. The above spectral theorem holds for real or complex Hilbert spaces.|$|E

[...] The German onshore section <b>was</b> <b>to</b> include a compressor station and {{a connection to the}} existing gas network. The length of planned offshore section was around 200 km. The Danish landing <b>point</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Avedøre, and the pipeline <b>was</b> planned <b>to</b> connect with the Avedøre power plant.

25|$|The {{balance between}} good and evil is {{correlated}} to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity it is the duty of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.|$|E
25|$|Side reins are {{adjusted}} {{longer for}} less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened, and raised higher (from {{point of shoulder}} {{up to the point}} of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. For green horses, the side reins are adjusted so that the horse can take contact with the bit, but does not have to flex beyond its abilities. A good starting <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> adjust the reins so the green horse carries its head approximately 4inches in front of the vertical. In any case, the head is not to be pulled behind the vertical.|$|E
25|$|The first defender should {{usually be}} the player {{closest to the}} {{opponent}} holding possession, but needs {{to be at the}} defending side of him in order to do an effective job. He or she should keep a distance of about 2 metres, although the ideal distance will vary with each situation. The <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pressure the opponent as much as possible without giving him a large possibility of a dribble. As a dribble isn't as dangerous when the defending team is well organised, the distance may be shorter in these cases. Analogously, the distance should be increased if the defence is poorly organised.|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{logic in}} how many <b>points</b> <b>are</b> {{allocated}} <b>to</b> each indicator. 225 <b>points</b> <b>are</b> allocated <b>to</b> accessibility, but only 250 to health outcomes.|$|R

25|$|A red {{and white}} bar {{across the bottom of}} the screen {{indicates}} battle advantage. Where the {{red and white}} portions of the bar meet indicates which duelist has the advantage. The closer the meeting <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> a duelist, the worse they are doing. When the player properly performs a blocking move, or strikes the enemy, the bar shifts towards the opponent, indicating that he has lost advantage. The duelist with more advantage can attack faster, while the duelist with less advantage attacks slower. Also, a failed attack has the chance of disorienting the attacker, causing them to become even slower for a short time.|$|E
500|$|Since {{motion is}} continuous, space must be {{infinitely}} divisible. In order for anything to begin moving at all, {{there must be}} some mind-like, voluntaristic property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them. This conatus is a sort of instantaneous or [...] "virtual" [...] motion that all things possess, even when they are static. Motion, meanwhile, is just the summation of all the conatuses that a thing has, along with the interactions of things. The conatus is to motion as a <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> space. The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another {{would not be able to}} bounce back, if the only force in play were the conatus. Hence, Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an aether that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions. Leibniz' concept of a mind-like memory-less property of conatus, coupled with his rejection of atoms, eventually led to his theory of monads.|$|E
500|$|During its development, Lords of Shadow {{was placed}} on several lists for most {{anticipated}} video games.

[...] 1UP.com's top 50 most anticipated games of E3 2010 ranked Lords of Shadow at number 17. Despite the heavy anticipation, Cox noted {{there was still a}} small number of fans who did not like the game's transition to the 3D format. He stated, [...] "Fair enough, some people aren't going to like what we're doing and we accept that but generally what we're trying to do is bring the fans with us ... there's no point in going back and making the same game again – the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make a clean break and move forward with the series." ...|$|E

500|$|The feminist {{movement}} is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre {{as a symbol}} of male violence against women. For example, Charles Rackoff, a University of Toronto computer science professor, compared the Ku Klux Klan with those organizing vigils marking the event, writing that [...] "he <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda," [...] and adding that it is [...] "no more justified" [...] than the KKK using the [...] "murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda." [...] Other critics say that Lépine was a [...] "lone gunman" [...] who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women. Some masculinist and anti-feminist commentators state that feminism has provoked violence against women, and without condoning the shootings, view the massacre as an extreme expression of men's frustrations. A few say that Lépine was a hero of masculism, glorifying his actions.|$|E
500|$|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 {{had been}} written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx {{recognised}} that the Manuscripts had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. [...] Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven [...] "Theses on Feuerbach". [...] The [...] "Theses on Feuerbach" [...] are best known for Thesis 11, which states that [...] "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> change it". This work contains Marx's criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world. It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's historical materialism, an argument {{that the world is}} changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice. In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down Vorwärts!, with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Marx from France. At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to once again continue his study of capitalism and political economy.|$|E
500|$|Richard Dawkins {{dedicated}} {{a chapter}} in The Blind Watchmaker to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding rates of change. His first <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> argue that phyletic gradualism — understood {{in the sense that}} evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called [...] "constant speedism" [...] by Dawkins — is a [...] "caricature of Darwinism" [...] and [...] "does not really exist." [...] His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of [...] "constant speedism" [...] is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms [...] "variable speedism." [...] Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: [...] "discrete variable speedism" [...] and [...] "continuously variable speedism." [...] Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as [...] "discrete variable speedists," [...] and [...] "in this respect they are genuinely radical." [...] They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. [...] "Continuously variable speedists," [...] on the other hand advance that [...] "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis." [...] Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record, in contrast to his earlier claim that [...] "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it." [...] It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.|$|E

2500|$|Jung {{went on to}} say [...] "the main <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get a {{young and}} {{insecure}} science into a place of safety during an earthquake". He did not end his relationship with the Zentralblatt at this time, but he did arrange the appointment of a new managing editor, Carl Alfred Meier of Switzerland. For the next few years, the Zentralblatt under Jung and Meier maintained a position distinct from that of the Nazis, in that it continued to acknowledge contributions of Jewish doctors to psychotherapy.|$|E
2500|$|Also, in his Theses on Feuerbach (1845), {{in which}} the young Marx broke with Feuerbach's idealism, he writes that [...] "the {{philosophers}} have only described the world, in various ways, the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> change it," [...] and his materialist approach allows for and empowers such change. This opposition between various subjective interpretations given by philosophers, which may be, in a sense, compared with Weltanschauung designed to legitimize {{the current state of}} affairs, and effective transformation of the world through praxis, which combines theory and practice in a materialist way, is what distinguish [...] "Marxist philosophers" [...] with the rest of philosophers.|$|E
