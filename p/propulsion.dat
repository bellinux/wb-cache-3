5|$|Dual motor {{extended}} – The {{electric motors}} are used again in dual configuration with increased efficiency at higher speeds. Additionally the gasoline engine contributes <b>propulsion</b> power via the planetary gear. While power is drained from the battery the amount {{is less than}} in mode 2 for the same <b>propulsion</b> power, thus extending the range.|$|E
5|$|In response, SMRT {{announced}} it was replacing important engineering components on all C151 trains by 2019. This included changing the existing Mitsubishi Electric <b>propulsion</b> system for the newer Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) <b>propulsion</b> system by Toshiba, technology currently used in the Tokyo Metro's 1000 series and 16000 series trains {{as well as the}} Kyushu 305 series and Hankyu 1000 series trains. As of July 2015, train sets 055/056 and 131/132 are trialed with the new <b>propulsion</b> system. In tandem with the replacement of the signalling system on the East-West Line and North-South Line with the newer Thales SelTrac signalling system, new equipment are installed in the passenger compartment of the trailer cars.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries fleets had relied on {{two types of}} major warship, the ship {{of the line and}} the frigate. The first major change to these types was the {{introduction}} of steam power for <b>propulsion.</b> While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam <b>propulsion</b> only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Single motor {{electric}} – The primary motor runs {{solely on}} battery power, maximum <b>propulsion</b> power is 111kW.|$|E
5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were once {{thought to have}} been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for <b>propulsion,</b> and the tail was also not useful for <b>propulsion</b> because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the InSurv, Iowa failed an Operation <b>Propulsion</b> Program Evaluation. A short time later, the ship retook and passed the evaluation. In July 1987, Captain Larry Seaquist assumed command of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Albert G. Mumma (2 June 1906 – 15 July 1997) was a {{rear admiral}} in the United States Navy {{who played a}} pivotal role in the {{development}} of nuclear <b>propulsion</b> for warships. During World War II, he served in France and Germany with the Alsos Mission.|$|E
5|$|An {{aftermarket}} {{electric vehicle}} conversion is the modification {{of a conventional}} internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) to electric <b>propulsion,</b> creating an all-electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} steam cannon guarding Port Royal Sound {{was built}} around 1900, {{in what is}} now Port Royal Plantation. The cannon was fixed but its <b>propulsion</b> system allowed for long range shots for the time.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{construction}} works for the atmospheric-propulsion system, the world's first railway flyover was constructed {{at the north end}} of Portland Road, to carry the new atmospheric line over the conventional steam line below. In 1847, the atmospheric <b>propulsion</b> experiment was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{includes}} whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully {{adapted to}} aquatic {{life with a}} spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by {{a thick layer of}} blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide <b>propulsion</b> underwater.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} <b>propulsion</b> techniques, which apply to {{different}} surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the <b>propulsion.</b> Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet <b>propulsion</b> would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of <b>propulsion.</b> Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR): Multiple rocket {{launches}} (up to 15 in some plans) {{would carry}} {{parts of a}} Direct Ascent spacecraft and <b>propulsion</b> units for translunar injection (TLI). These would be assembled into a single spacecraft in Earth orbit.|$|E
5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing <b>propulsion</b> and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing <b>propulsion</b> module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E
5|$|Having {{satisfied}} {{himself as}} to the advantages of screw <b>propulsion,</b> Brunel wrote to the company directors to persuade them {{to embark on a}} second major design change, abandoning the paddlewheel engines—already half constructed—for completely new engines suitable for powering a propeller.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic <b>propulsion</b> {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the <b>propulsion</b> pipe.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Operation Sandblast, the , and Captain Edward L. Beach, Jr., were {{included}} in the Technology for the Nuclear Age: Nuclear <b>Propulsion</b> display for the Cold War exhibit at the U.S. Navy Museum in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} <b>propulsion</b> systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the <b>propulsion</b> systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
5|$|Initially, diesel <b>propulsion</b> {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use {{superheated}} steam <b>propulsion.</b> The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet <b>propulsion,</b> {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni <b>propulsion</b> (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals have {{a number}} of {{physiological}} and anatomical features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species specific. Marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for <b>propulsion</b> and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for <b>propulsion</b> and balance. Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchangers); torpedo shaped bodies, reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|E
5|$|Micronized and {{nano-scale}} {{zinc oxide}} and titanium dioxide provide strong protection against UVA and UVB ultraviolet radiation, {{and are used}} in suntan lotion, and also in UV-blocking sunglasses for use in space and for protection when welding, following research by scientists at Jet <b>Propulsion</b> Laboratory (JPL).|$|E
5|$|Much of the UK's space {{industry}} is centred on EADS Astrium, based in Stevenage and Portsmouth. The company builds the buses – the underlying structure onto which the payload and <b>propulsion</b> systems are built – {{for most of}} the European Space Agency's spacecraft, as well as commercial satellites. The world leader in compact satellite systems, Surrey Satellites, is also part of Astrium. Reaction Engines Limited, the company planning to build Skylon, a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane using their SABRE rocket engine, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket <b>propulsion</b> system is based Culham.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>propulsion</b> {{problems}} included excessive motor vibrations {{at certain}} speeds which damaged various components (which {{was attributed to}} the removal of a flywheel and to corrosion caused by the fuel problems), and excessive fuel consumption in Collins at high speed (found {{to be caused by}} manufacturing problems with the turbines and turbochargers). The <b>propulsion</b> system was also found to be a secondary source of noise: poor design of the exhaust mufflers, weight-saving measures in the generator mountings, and an incorrect voltage supply to the battery compartment exhaust fans were noise-creating factors found and eliminated during studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for using}} solar sail <b>propulsion</b> for {{interstellar}} travel have targeted Sirius {{as the star}} system fastest to arrive at from Earth. While Alpha Centauri and others are closer, the brightness of Sirius provides the best braking power to arrive with the least travel time.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary 2 {{is not a}} {{steamship}} {{like many}} of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four diesel engines, with two additional gas turbines used when extra power is required; this integrated electric <b>propulsion</b> configuration is used to produce the power to drive her four electric <b>propulsion</b> pods as well as powering the ship's hotel services. The spaces for these prime movers are also split, and controls are also backed up, {{with the intention of}} preventing a single failure from disabling the ship.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the NASA Jet <b>Propulsion</b> Laboratory (JPL), had {{discovered}} a new bacterium on the filters of the International Space Station (ISS) and named it Solibacillus kalamii to honour the late president Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.|$|E
5|$|Rotifers are a phylum of {{microscopic}} but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments. Although the Latin name rotifer means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms {{do not have}} any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and <b>propulsion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shivalik {{features}} improved stealth {{and land}} attacking features over the preceding s. She {{is also the}} first Indian navy ship to use the CODOG (COmbined Diesel Or Gas) <b>propulsion</b> system.|$|E
5|$|Shivaliks design embodies many firsts in Indian ships. Shivalik is {{the first}} Indian naval vessel to use a {{combined}} diesel or gas (CODOG) <b>propulsion</b> system. The CODOG gearboxes were designed and built by Elecon Engineering.|$|E
5|$|Starting May 1946, the S-50 plant {{buildings}} were utilised, {{not as a}} production facility, but by the United States Army Air Forces' Nuclear Energy for the <b>Propulsion</b> of Aircraft (NEPA) project. Fairchild Aircraft {{conducted a series of}} experiments there involving beryllium. Workers also fabricated blocks of enriched uranium and graphite. NEPA operated until May 1951, when it was superseded by the joint Atomic Energy Commission-United States Air Force Aircraft Nuclear <b>Propulsion</b> project. The S-50 plant was disassembled in the late 1940s. Equipment was taken to the K-25 powerhouse area, where it was stored before being salvaged or buried.|$|E
5|$|Technical {{development}} continued rapidly {{through the}} dreadnought era, with steep changes in armament, armor and <b>propulsion.</b> Ten years after Dreadnoughts commissioning, {{much more powerful}} ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.|$|E
