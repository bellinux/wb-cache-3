40|$|Liver {{failure is}} {{a major cause of}} mortality. A Bioartificial Liver (BAL) device {{employing}} isolated hepatocytes can potentially provide temporary support for liver failure patients. We have designed and manufactured a small-scale BAL device that attempts to mimic some of the elements of the flow conditions observed in the liver by creating a well-defined 3 D porous matrix. The proposed reactor consists of <b>perforated</b> <b>discs</b> stacked on top of each other. The holes of two consecutive discs are misaligned in a specific manner to create a similar fluid flow configuration as the one seen in the liver. The advantages of such a design are numerous: high flow rates can be achieved while still minimizing the local shear stress levels, cells are cultured on a flat-plate as seen in the liver, and all cells are directly exposed to flow in order to supply oxygen and nutrients. Two prototypes of the proposed reactor were manufactured with two different disc spacing: 565 gm and 127 pm. The <b>perforated</b> <b>discs</b> were produced by injection-molding and their biocompatibility demonstrated using hepatocyte cultures under static conditions (i. e. no flow).

5000|$|Daniell first {{constructed}} {{his cell}} in 1836. [...] His original design {{consisted of a}} 3.5 inch diameter copper cylinder. A copper disc perforated with numerous holes was placed across the cylinder recessed down from the top. A tube of ox gullet hung from a large hole in {{the centre of the}} perforated copper disc. A 0.5 inch diameter zinc rod hung inside this ox-gullet tube suspended from wooden supports. The copper vessel was filled with sulfuric acid solution saturated with copper sulfate to above the level of the <b>perforated</b> <b>disc.</b> The ox-gullet tube was filled with sulfuric acid solution. Copper sulfate crystals were piled on the perforated copper disc to keep the solution saturated. The ox-gullet acts as a porous membrane allowing passage of ions. Daniell states that a porous earthenware tube may be used instead of the ox gullet for practical ease but this arrangement will produce less power. Another suggestion made by Daniell to improve the cell was to replace the copper with platinum and copper sulfate with platinum chloride, but he remarks [...] "such an arrangement would be perfect, but too costly for ordinary applications". [...] It is the porous pot form of the cell that came to be widely used in telegraphy.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) cartilage {{consists of}} condylar cartilage and disc and undergoes continuous remodeling throughout post-natal life. To maintain {{the integrity of}} the TMJ cartilage, anti-angiogenic factors play an important role during the remodeling process. In this study, we investigated the expression of the anti-angiogenic factor, chondromodulin- 1 (ChM- 1), in TMJ cartilage and evaluate its potential role in TMJ remodeling. METHODS: Eight TMJ specimens were collected from six 4 -month-old Japanese white rabbits. Safranin-O staining was performed to determine proteoglycan content. ChM- 1 expression in TMJ condylar cartilage and disc was determined by immunohistochemistry. Three human <b>perforated</b> <b>disc</b> tissue samples were collected for investigation of ChM- 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) distribution in perforated TMJ disc. RESULTS: Safranin-O stained weakly in TMJ compared with tibial articular and epiphyseal cartilage. In TMJ, ChM- 1 was expressed in the proliferative and hypertrophic zone of condylar cartilage and chondrocyte-like cells in the disc. No expression of ChM- 1 was observed in osteoblasts and subchondral bone. ChM- 1 and VEGF were both similarly expressed in <b>perforated</b> <b>disc</b> tissues. CONCLUSIONS: ChM- 1 {{may play a role in}} the regulation of TMJ remodeling by preventing blood vessel invasion of the cartilage, thereby maintaining condylar cartilage and disc integrity...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to remove iron from {{drinking}} water using a new electrocoagulation (EC) cell. In this research, a flow column has been employed in the designing of a new electrocoagulation reactor (FCER) to achieve the planned target. Where, the water being treated flows through the <b>perforated</b> <b>disc</b> electrodes, thereby effectively mixing and aerating the water being treated. As a result, the stirring and aerating devices that until now {{have been widely used}} in the electrocoagulation reactors are unnecessary. The obtained results indicated that FCER reduced the iron concentration from 20 to 0. 3 mg/L within 20 min of electrolysis at initial pH of 6, inter-electrode distance (ID) of 5 mm, current density (CD) of 1. 5 mA/cm 2, and minimum operating cost of 0. 22 US $/m 3. Additionally, it was found that FCER produces H 2 gas enough to generate energy of 10. 14 kW/m 3. Statistically, {{it was found that the}} relationship between iron removal and operating parameters could be modelled with R 2 of 0. 86, and the influence of operating parameters on iron removal followed the order: C 0 >t>CD>pH.

40|$|There are {{increasing}} reports of deaths and serious complications {{associated with the}} use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Bleeding may occur in patients when NPWT is applied to a wound with exposed blood vessels or vascular grafts, possibly due to mechanical deformation and hypoperfusion of the vessel walls. Recent evidence suggests that using a rigid barrier disc to protect underlying tissue can prevent this mechanical deformation. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of rigid discs on the tissue exposed to negative pressure with regard to tissue pressure and microvascular blood flow. Peripheral wounds were created on the backs of eight pigs. The pressure and microvascular blood flow in the wound bed were measured when NPWT was applied. The wound was filled with foam, and rigid discs of different designs were inserted between the wound bed and the foam. The discs were created with or without channels (to accommodate exposed sensitive structures such as blood vessels and nerves), perforations, or a porous dressing that covered the underside of the discs (to facilitate pressure transduction and fluid evacuation). When comparing the results for pressure transduction to the wound bed, no significant differences were found using different discs covered with dressing, whereas pressure transduction was lower with bare discs. Microvascular blood flow in the wound bed decreased by 49 ± 7 % when NPWT was applied to control wounds. The reduction in blood flow was less in the presence of a protective disc (e. g., - 6 ± 5 % for a dressing-covered, <b>perforated</b> <b>disc,</b> p = 0. 006). In conclusion, NPWT causes hypoperfusion of superficial tissue in the wound bed. The insertion of a rigid barrier counteracts this effect. The placement of a rigid disc over exposed blood vessels or nerves may protect these structures from rupture and damage...|$|E

50|$|The viscous type is {{generally}} simpler because {{it relies on}} hydrodynamic friction from fluids with high viscosity. Silicone-based oils are often used. Here, a cylindrical chamber of fluid filled {{with a stack of}} <b>perforated</b> <b>discs</b> rotates with the normal motion of the output shafts. The inside surface of the chamber is coupled to one of the driveshafts, and the outside coupled to the differential carrier. Half of the discs are connected to the inner, the other half to the outer, alternating inner/outer in the stack. Differential motion forces the interleaved discs to move through the fluid against each other. In some viscous couplings when speed is maintained the fluid will accumulate heat due to friction. This heat will cause the fluid to expand, and expand the coupler causing the discs to be pulled together resulting in a non-viscous plate to plate friction and a dramatic drop in speed difference. This is known as the hump phenomenon and it allows the side of the coupler to gently lock. In contrast to the mechanical type, the limiting action is much softer and more proportional to the slip, and so is easier to cope with for the average driver. New Process Gear used a viscous coupling of the Ferguson style in several of their transfer cases including those used in the AMC Eagle.|$|R
40|$|Foamed plaster moulds {{are used}} in {{precision}} casting process of non-ferrous alloys. Casting from those moulds are characterizedby high dimensional accuracy, very good shape pattering and small surface roughness. However, a drawback of the plaster mould is very low permeability. A substational improvement of this parametr may be achived through physical or phisico-chemical treatment of the plaster slurry or prepared mould. The most advantageous results {{can be obtained by}} foaming the slurry. The investigatious comprised evaluation of the influence of mixing parametrs (mixer type, rotation and mixing time, settings the mixer in mixing device) and the content of a foaming agent on the degree of foaming of the plaster. The tests were carried out using the α-plaster Hartform-H 1 and Alkanol XC as a foaming agent. The structure of a slurry produced after foaming is non-homogeous. Therefore, the investigations were completed by making appropriate of this process. Analysis of the results leads to the conclusion, that the foamed plaster Hartform_H 1 reaches the top degree of foaming at the following parameters: the water/plaster ratio W/G= 0. 55, the content of Alkanol XC a= 0. 07 %, stirring with a <b>perforate</b> <b>disc</b> mixer at the rotation speed nm= 4000 rpm during τm= 30 s. In turn the top homogeneity of the foamed plaster slurry can be achieved at the rotation speed nu= 1400 rpm during τu= 30 s., while other parameters are the same as in the foaming process.

Winchester Repeating Arms Company began loading sporting ammunition with smokeless powder manufactured by the Anglo-American Explosives Company; and the United States Army published smokeless powder specifications for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. Laflin & Rand negotiated a license to produce Alfred Nobel's patented Ballistite smokeless powder adopted by many European military forces; but the U.S. Army selected Ruby smokeless powder produced by the newly formed Leonard Smokeless Powder Company. Rather than pay the required royalties to manufacture Ballistite, Laflin & Rand loaned the financially troubled Leonard company $30,000 to reorganize as the American Smokeless Powder Company. U.S. Army Lieutenant Garland Whistler assisted American Smokeless Powder Company factory superintendent Henry Aspinwall in formulating an improved powder. They reduced the nitroglycerine content from 58% to 30%; and the extruded formulation, named W.A. in recognition of their work, was cut into black <b>perforated</b> <b>discs</b> 0.08 inch mm in diameter and 0.045 inch mm thick.
