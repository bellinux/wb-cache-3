5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding.

Information about brain trauma and stroke has <b>provided</b> <b>information</b> about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
5|$|Several sources {{reported}} that Friedrich, his father, and his aunt were all named Trump, thus placing the name change before the 18th century.

A genealogist at Dotdash, which was then called About.com, listed Donald Trump's grandfather as Friederich Trump and great-grandfather as Christian Johannes Trump. In his 2013 book America's Obsessives: The Compulsive Energy That Built a Nation, Joshua Kendall wrote that Frederick's father and aunt, and by extension Donald Trump's great-grandfather and great-grandaunt, were called John Trump and Charlotte Luise Trump, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender and approached seven of the world's nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the <b>provided</b> <b>information,</b> with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would {{be incorporated into the}} project, and that they were willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines.

5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong <b>provided</b> <b>information</b> about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries.

5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl <b>provided</b> <b>information</b> on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E
