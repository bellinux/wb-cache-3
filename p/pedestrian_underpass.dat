5|$|The Council {{wanted the}} {{developers}} to consider constructing a road tunnel from Mounts Bay Road to the underground parking to reduce traffic congestion around the tower, however the developers only agreed to consider building a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> beneath St Georges Terrace.|$|E
5|$|The {{full-time}} side at {{the west}} end of the mezzanine has three street stairs. One leads to the northeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue, the closest to the mall. The other two staircases are through a long passageway to both southern corners of Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard, acting as a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> outside of fare control. These staircases date back to the station's original opening. There is an entrance to the southeast corner of Woodhaven and Queens Boulevards that, {{as a result of the}} construction of the Long Island Expressway in the mid-1950s, leads only to two entrance ramps to the expressway, with no continuous sidewalk leading to the entrance.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, it was {{announced}} that the Kwinana Freeway between Leach Highway and Roe Highway would be widened from two to three lanes in each direction. The $58 million project was brought forward to ease increased congestion on this part of the freeway. Construction began in July 2011, with completion scheduled for May 2012. The new southbound lane opened on 1 June 2012. On 20 December 2012, the State Transport Minister Troy Buswell, with Federal MP Gary Gray and State MLA for Riverton Mike Nahan, officially opened the northbound lane. By May 2013, all major construction works had been completed, including a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> at South Street, a new carpark and access road for Murdoch railway station, and noise walls. Remaining landscaping works were expected to be finalised in September 2013, and the whole projected had been completed by mid-October.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} to reduce congestion on Oxford Street. Horse-drawn vehicles were banned in 1931, and traffic signals were installed in the same year. To alleviate congestion and help traffic flow of buses, most of Oxford Street is designated a bus lane during peak daytime hours, when private vehicles are banned. It is only open to buses, taxis and two-wheeled vehicles between 7:00am and 7:00pm on all days except Sundays. The ban was introduced experimentally in June 1972. It was considered a success, with an estimated increase of Â£250,000 in retail sales. In 2009, a new diagonal crossing opened at Oxford Circus, allowing pedestrians to cross from one corner of Oxford Street to the opposite corner without having to cross the road twice or use the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass.</b> This doubles the pedestrian capacity at the junction.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{during the}} {{elimination}} of some grade crossings in Allendale, the telephone poles around the station and tracks were moved. At {{the beginning of the}} next year, a joint project of the Erie, the Works Progress Administration and the New Jersey Public Utilities Commissioners built new overpasses to replace the grade crossings and a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> at the Allendale station to replace the closed grade crossings at West Allendale and Park avenues.|$|E
25|$|The {{east side}} of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., {{features}} the main parking lot, Knott's Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complementary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010, but is still used for wedding ceremonies. A tunnel and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.|$|E

25|$|The Broadway subway {{plan was}} changed in 1915 to route both tracks into 60th Street and {{to cross the}} East River by a tunnel {{just north of the}} Queensboro Bridge. The 59th Street {{crossing}} was obviously now useless, and at 60th Street, the subway would have to be at a lower grade, {{on its way to the}} 60th Street Tunnel. The 59th Street crossing was worked into a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> for the IRT 59th Street station, which turned into a way to get between the downtown platform and the direct subway entrance to Bloomingdale's on the uptown platform. That section is still in use, and the floor level is that of the never-completed BMT station. The 60th Street crossing was mostly destroyed when the existing station was built at a lower grade. A door in the southern wall across from the platform opens into a remaining unused space, and suggests the platform level of the original grade, which is the same as the 59th Street underpass.|$|E
25|$|Many {{stations}} in the subway system have mezzanines. In underground stations, this typically consists of the first level below the street or the areas between the street and platform level. For open-cut, grade-level and elevated stations, prevalent in uptown Manhattan and the outer boroughs, the mezzanine area often consists of a station house at street level or above the street. Mezzanines allow for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and proceed to the correct platform without having {{to cross the street}} before entering. At busy intersections, they also act as a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> or overpass. They also allow for crossover between uptown and downtown trains on side platforms or a pair of island platforms, which is very useful when local tracks are closed for construction. Within the mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically pay their fare to enter the subway system. In underground subway stations built close to ground level or under narrow streets, a characteristic of early IRT and BMT construction, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine crossovers. Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare control with no common station house between directions of service.|$|E
500|$|Tickle Cock Bridge is a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> in Castleford, England, under {{a railway}} line {{originally}} {{built by the}} York and North Midland Railway between York and Normanton. Built in 1890, the thoroughfare now connects the town's main residential area with the Carlton Lanes Shopping Centre, and is used by 50,000pedestrians each week. The original Victorian structure, described by the shopping centre's manager as [...] "small, narrow, very low and gloomy" [...] and [...] "frightening to walk through", was replaced in 2008 {{as part of an}} urban regeneration scheme.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} seven tracks for {{passenger}} service. Each {{is equipped with}} a platform fitted with a shelter. The platforms are connected with each other by <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses.</b>|$|R
50|$|In particular, the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses</b> running {{beneath the}} tracks (to allow {{passenger}} {{access to the}} station) are too small, and cause great inconvenience at peak times when they become overcrowded.|$|R
50|$|A {{platform}} {{adjacent to}} the passenger building is used {{to provide access to}} track 1. To serve the other tracks, there are three island platforms, all of them linked with the passenger building via three <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses.</b>|$|R
500|$|Pranksters have {{sometimes}} pushed over artificial cows. Along Chicago's Michigan Avenue in 1999, two [...] "apparently drunk" [...] men felled six fiberglass cows {{that were part}} of a Cows on Parade public art exhibit. Four other vandals removed a [...] "Wow cow" [...] sculpture from its lifeguard chair at Oak Street Beach and abandoned it in a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass.</b> A year later, New York City anchored its CowParade art cows, including [...] "A Streetcow Named Desire", to concrete bases [...] "to prevent the udder disrespect of cow-tippers and thieves." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{geographic}} western exit {{leads to}} Cadman Plaza West/Old Fulton Street (formerly Fulton Street, as indicated on wall mosaic signs) in Brooklyn Heights, {{a few hundred}} feet south of Cadman Plaza West's intersection with Middagh Street. This was the original exit to the station. The eastern exits lead to Adams Street, on the border of Brooklyn Heights, DUMBO and Downtown Brooklyn, adjacent to the central courthouse for the Federal Eastern District of New York. These exits were opened following an additional delay to complete the escalators. Adams Street was widened from 100 feet to 160 feet in the 1950s to accommodate new ramps to the Brooklyn Bridge, and now carries the secondary name [...] "Brooklyn Bridge Boulevard". The current exit staircases lead to ether side of Adams Street, acting as a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass.</b> There are painted-over mosaics pointing to former exits at Washington Street (now Cadman Plaza East).|$|E
500|$|A bypass of Clackline {{was also}} constructed, {{realigning}} [...] of Great Eastern Highway [...] {{north of the}} town. Works began in January 2007, and were completed in February 2008. The project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between Clackline and Bakers Hill, upgrading intersections in Clackline, and constructing a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> for a heritage trail. Clackline Brook was realigned through a large box culvert, allowing a safer crossing than the narrow Clackline Bridge on the original alignment. The bypass was originally allocated $2.4million of funding in 2006, but by January 2007 it was expected to cost almost $11million. The final project value was $9.2million. Issues and challenges in the project's design and construction included extensive rock protection requirements for the Clackline Brook culvert, drilling and blasting close to the existing highway, and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008.|$|E
50|$|The station yard is {{composed}} of five through tracks, with platforms connected by two <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses.</b> There is also a dock platform that can accommodate trains from the south, and a track leading to the goods yard.|$|R
50|$|Excavation depth {{for this}} station is 32 meters deep. It is 158 meters {{in length and}} 19.85 meters wide. It has three entrances, one {{accessibility}} elevator, and two vent shafts. The entrances connect with existing <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses</b> and two joint development buildings.|$|R
50|$|In June 2012, the new grade {{separated}} interchange {{opened at the}} Great Eastern Highway intersection, allowing free flowing traffic on Roe Highway over Great Eastern Highway. The design includes a northbound to eastbound loop ramp to cater for heavy vehicles, and three <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, {{the film}} Romper Stomper {{was set in}} and filmed in and around Footscray. It deals with a fictional gang of neo-Nazi skinheads and their battle against Vietnamese immigrants. Not all scenes were filmed locally: the [...] "Footscray Railway Station" [...] {{featured}} in the movie has a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass,</b> while the real station has an overpass for foot traffic; the actual station used for filming was Richmond Station.|$|E
2500|$|The West Street <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> (the West Concourse, {{formerly}} the [...] "east-west connector") links the WTC station mezzanine with Brookfield Place in Battery Park City, {{on the west}} side of the World Trade Center site. It opened on October 23, 2013. Access to One World Trade Center from the West Concourse became possible for employees when the tower opened on November 3, 2014. On May 29, the same day the tower's observatory opened, the entrance to the observation deck opened.|$|E
2500|$|Cobbler Creek Recreation Park is a [...] {{protected}} area located about [...] {{north of the}} Adelaide city centre within the suburb of Gulfview Heights. The park is bounded by Bridge and Smith roads, and Green Valley Drive. The Grove Way, a major divided road, runs through the park with a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> connecting the two park sections. The park {{is open to the}} public and includes three formed walking trails and two ruins. The remains of William Pedler's home [...] "Trevalsa" [...] and another's called [...] "Teakles House" [...] lie next to one of the trails. There are no public facilities except for benches, signage and picnic tables. [...] "Kelway House", originally belonging to the Kelway Park farm that occupied much of the park, remains as office accommodation for park management staff.|$|E
50|$|All the {{shopping}} {{and other facilities}} in the parish are now found in Botley.

2500|$|Located on {{the north}} side of Rockaway Beach Boulevard {{extending}} to Beach Channel Drive is the park's parking lot. At [...] or [...] in size, the parking lot is the largest individual feature in the park and occupies much of the park site north of the beach. The only entry point to the lot is at its south end in front of the bathhouse, where four toll booths are present. It was built with a capacity of 9,000 or 14,000 automobiles. At the time of its construction, it was the largest paved parking lot in the world. The Jacob Riis Park lot, the 4,000-space lot on Randalls Island, and the 8,000-space lot at Orchard Beach collectively covered [...] of land. A grade-level crosswalk to the west of the toll booths and a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpass</b> to the east lead across the street to the bathhouse.

5000|$|The rather over-generous {{proportions}} of the roundabout, which included <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses</b> from the adjacent roads onto it, were a result of London Underground safeguarding a route for the possible future extension of the Bakerloo line [...] from its terminus at Elephant & Castle tube station. This was to run along and under the main road route and thence underneath the trackways of the old main line station, to join surface services at South Bermondsey station. The roundabout {{would have been the}} site of a station, similar in layout to Old Street station. The route is still safeguarded but has no prominence in current proposals. The <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses</b> were not attractive and involved quite circuitous walks via the island, surfacing and descending again to the various entrances; in 2009 these were supplemented by pelican crossings at the junctions with New Kent and Old Kent Roads, introduced because pedestrians preferring to cross there were causing more accidents. In 2013 the underpasses were filled in and levelled, becoming wider pavements at these points.|$|R
50|$|Just to {{the east}} of the station, the local road passes over the railway on a bridge and there is a {{footpath}} underneath. In line with the local council policy of decorating all <b>pedestrian</b> <b>underpasses,</b> they commissioned two railway-themed murals for the overbridge walls in 1989. On the north wall is a Great Western scene and on the south wall, a Southern railway scene. Both are visible from passing trains and remain remarkably undamaged.|$|R
