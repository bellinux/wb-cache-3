5|$|Northern Paiutes {{or their}} ancestors, who were hunter-gatherers, {{have lived in}} the region for {{thousands}} of years. Since the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, cattle ranching and other forms of agriculture have dominated land use in the area. In 1930, logging in the mountains north of Burns {{led to the creation of}} Hines, a lumber company town, and the timber industry remained important to the local economy until the 1990s. In addition to ranching, a variety of private and <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> support the Burns–Hines economy in the 21stcentury. Annual events include a migratory bird festival, the county fair, and a country music jamboree.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E

Seorabeol City Gas, an affiliate of GS Group, provides gas to the Gyeongju residents, while, electrical power is supplied by the <b>public</b> <b>enterprises,</b> Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power via the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant. The plant is known for the only nuclear power plant operating PHWRs (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) in South Korea and supplies about 5% of South Korea's electricity.

Since 1983, the power plant has been providing commercial service and operating with the PHWRs that has a capacity of 678,000kW. As the construction of each Wolseong 2, 3 and 4 with a capacity of 70,000kW were completed respectively in 1997, 1998 and 1999, Wolseong Nuclear Power plant site has been successfully operating the four PHWRs plants.

40|$|By {{means of}} an {{explicit}} positive political economy model {{of the behavior of}} <b>public</b> <b>enterprise,</b> consumer electoral preferences, electoral platform choices of political parties, and side payments by production factors ("suppliers") to political parties, I analyze the political economy of choices among three alternative institutional arrangements for infrastructure industries: competition among private firms (or regulation by an independent agency to replicate competitive outcomes), private monopoly, or <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> monopoly. The analysis shows that in a democratic political system, there is strong pressure in favor of <b>public</b> <b>enterprise,</b> because consumers and suppliers benefit from its behavior. Voter and party ideologies are muted by political competition among parties. Distributional conflict further enhances pressures in favor of <b>public</b> <b>enterprise,</b> as suppliers scramble to access rents.
