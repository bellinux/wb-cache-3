40|$|Correct {{management}} of syndesmotic injuries is mandatory to avoid scar tissue impingement, chronic instability, heterotopic ossification, or deformity of the ankle. The {{aim of the}} present study was to perform a systematic review of the current treatments of these injuries to identify the best non-surgical and surgical management for patients with acute isolated syndesmotic injuries. A review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar databases was performed using the following keywords: "ankle injury", "syndesmotic injury", "chronic", "acute", "treatment", "conservative", "non-operative" "operative", "fixation", "osteosynthesis", "screw", "synostosis", "ligamentoplasties" over the years 1962 - 2015. The literature search and cross-referencing resulted in a total of 345 references, of which 283 were rejected due to off-topic abstract and/or failure to fulfil the inclusion criteria. After reading the remaining full-text articles, we included four studies, describing non-surgical management, and only two studies investigating surgical {{management of}} acute isolated injuries. The ESSKA-AFAS consensus panel provided recommendations to improve the management of patients with isolated acute syndesmotic injury in clinical practice. Non-surgical management is recommended for stable ankle lesions and includes: 3 -week non-weight bearing, a below-the-knee cast, rest and ice, followed by proprioceptive exercises.

40|$|Baseplate {{fixation}} in {{a reverse}} shoulder arthroplasty depends on adequate bone stock. In cases of severe glenoid bone loss and revision shoulder arthroplasty, deficiency of the glenoid vault compels the surgeon to attain screw fixation {{in the three}} columns of the scapula. The relationship of these columns demonstrated that the coracoid {{is closer to the}} lateral scapular pillar in females than in males. Significant gender dimorphism exists between the orientations of the three columns. The gender dimorphism is further evaluated by anthropometric measurements of the scapular body and the glenoid. The clinical significance lies in the ability to reconstruct the glenoid to its premorbid anatomy, there by being able to predict the glenoid dimensions from scapular body dimensions. Adequate positioning of the glenoid baseplate requires it to be positioned orthogonal to the scapular plane. Typically, calculation of the scapular plane relies on the glenoid being intact. As such, the scapular plane cannot be recreated if the glenoid has an abnormal morphology. This mandates the utilization of alternate planes that are independent of glenoid reference points. A relationship between the various planes independent of the glenoid reference points and the current scapular plane dependent upon the normal glenoid anatomy has been established.

Background: Screws are used in spinal instrumentation for many diseases. Various techniques are available for the placement of the screws in the vertebral body. However, clear guidelines as to which technique to apply to optimize the strength of fixation at the bone screw interface are not available. Methods: A spine model to imitate a vertebral body was used for the biomechanical comparison of the different positioned double-screw constructs, similar to an angular stability system. Each different double-screw construct (parallel, converged, and cross) was tested on the spine model with simulated corticalis and without simulated corticalis. The tests conducted were performed on both the bending load and the shearing load. Results: The study was designed to provide insight on the relationship of the positioning of various double-screw constructs and the biomechanical stability. Different biomechanical tests were conducted and the results were analyzed. The biomechanical study on double-screw constructs showed that <b>screw</b> <b>positioning</b> (i. e. parallel, converged, and cross) had no significant influence on fixation strength. The study shows comparable results for both the bending load and for the shearing load. Conclusion: Regarding the application of angular stability double-screw systems as a ventral Instrumentation, however, the study showed no additional benefit in biomechanical stability depending on a change of screw- positioning. The method of fixation that uses the principle of angular stability system already provides a high level of biomechanical stability.

We investigated {{the reliability of the}} tip apex distance measurement, the Cleveland femoral head dividing system, the three-grade classification system of Baumgaertner for fracture reduction, and the AO classification system as predictors for screw cutout. Methods: All patients with an intertrochanteric hip fracture who were managed with either a dynamic hip screw or a gamma nail between January 2007 and June 2010 were evaluated from our hip trauma database. Results: The tip apex distance measurement was reliable and patients with device cutout had a significantly higher tip apex distance. The agreement between observers with regard to <b>screw</b> <b>position</b> and fracture reduction was moderately reliable. After adjustment for tip apex distance and <b>screw</b> <b>position,</b> A 3 fractures were at more risk of cutout compared with A 1 fractures. Poor fracture reduction was significantly related with a higher incidence of cutout in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. Central-inferior and anterior-inferior positions, after adjustment for tip apex distance and <b>screw</b> <b>position,</b> were significantly protective against cutout.

Even intraoperative navigation, as often used nowadays, does not provide optimal <b>screw</b> <b>positioning</b> in all patients. METHODS: According to the three-dimensional CT data obtained for every individual cadaver or patient, a template was designed for the posterior course of C 2 : the template contains a drill guide allowing navigated <b>screw</b> <b>positioning</b> inside {{the left and right}} isthmus of C 2. For a first series of five cadavers a template with clamps connecting only to the lamina of C 2, excluding the spinous process from the interface, was carried out.

The screw was placed in femoral head more inferiorly (p= 0. 045) on frontal and more posteriorly (p= 0. 013) on sagital planes in Group B, while central placement of the screw was present in Group A. The common characteristic of three patients with screw cut-out in Group B was the <b>position</b> of the <b>screw</b> which was located in femoral head more superiorly and anteriorly after an acceptable fracture reduction. ConclusionsPeripheral placement of the screw in femoral head increases tip-apex distance. However, posterior and inferior locations may help to support posteromedial cortex and calcar femoral in unstable intertrochanteric fractures and reduce the risk of cut-out failure.

50|$|The {{mandible}} osteotomy {{is intended}} for those with a receded mandible (lower jaw) or an open bite, which may cause difficulty chewing and jaw pain.For this procedure cuts are made behind the molars, in {{between the first and}} second molars, and lengthwise, detaching the front of the jaw so the palate (including the teeth and all) can move as one unit. From here, the surgeon can smoothly slide the mandible into its new <b>position.</b> Stabilization <b>screws</b> are used to support the jaw until the healing process is done.|$|R
40|$|Background: In femoral neck fractures, {{internal}} fixation {{by three}} cannulated hip screws (3 CHS) {{is a common}} procedure with a known high risk of fracture healing complications. Many reports have made recommendations on the <b>positioning</b> of the <b>screws</b> to prevent complications due to mechanical failure. Most of these reports however, are only based on biomechanical studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between <b>screw</b> <b>positioning</b> and complication-risk in femoral neck fractures in a clinical setting. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively the fracture healing complication risk in all patients with a femoral neck fracture who underwent 3 CHS fixation between January 2002 and June 2009. In these patients we analyzed the <b>screw</b> <b>positioning</b> in plain postoperative anteroposterior (AP) and axial (AX) radiographs according to our own measuring methods. We analyzed parallel positioning, spreading of the screws in the femoral head and the distance of the screws from the cortex and their influence on the fracture healing complication risk. Results: Within 84 fixations with cannulated screws, 35 (42 %) appeared to be complicated in relation to the fracture healing. The complication-risk was higher in displaced fractures (51 %) than in undisplaced fractures (33 %). No relationship was found between parallel screw alignment or spreading of the screws and fracture healing complications in femoral neck fractures. There was a trend visible favoring a screw distance of 5 - 10 mm to the femoral cortex in AP radiographs (p= 0. 054). Conclusion: In accordance with other studies, a more parallel positioning has no benefit in relation to the fracture healing complication risk. In our study a greater spread of the screws in the femoral head has also no influence on the fracture healing complication risk. A screw distance of 5 - 10 mm from the femoral cortex seems to be beneficial in preventing fracture healing complications. For a higher level of evidence a prospective study with a long-term follow-up and greater patient count is needed. But for now, surgeons should focus on other aspects influencing the complication risk than <b>screw</b> <b>positioning.</b> ...|$|R
