50|$|The TeD video-disc player used a piezo-electric <b>pick-up</b> <b>cartridge</b> with {{a diamond}} stylus, {{mechanically}} sampling the frequency-modulated, PAL-encoded audio-video signal {{from thousands of}} concentric grooves, vertically recorded into {{the surface of a}} very thin, flexible vinyl disc. The disc was freely rotating on a thin cushion of air between the disc and a fixed plate at 1500rpm (25 Hz), the disc being stabilized only by centrifugal force. The sampling frequency of the combined audio-video signal was about 2.7 MHz. Maximum video playing time was ten minutes on a 210 mm disc, amounting to about 15,000 concentric grooves on the disc, each storing two half-frame PAL-video-lines.|$|E
5000|$|Potassium sodium {{tartrate}} tetrahydrate, {{also known}} as Rochelle salt, is a double salt of tartaric acid first prepared (in about 1675) by an apothecary, Pierre Seignette, of La Rochelle, France. Potassium sodium tartrate and monopotassium phosphate were the first materials discovered to exhibit piezoelectricity. This property led to its extensive use in [...] "crystal" [...] gramophone (phono) pick-ups, microphones and earpieces during the post-World War II consumer electronics boom of the mid-20th Century. Such transducers had an exceptionally high output with typical <b>pick-up</b> <b>cartridge</b> outputs as much as 2 volts or more. Rochelle salt is deliquescent so any transducers based on the material deteriorated if stored in damp conditions.|$|E
5000|$|London Decca is a {{manufacturer}} of phonograph tonearms and <b>pick-up</b> <b>cartridges.</b> The London Decca cartridges may be unique in {{that they do not}} employ a [...] "proper" [...] cantilever, neither are they [...] "moving magnet" [...] (MM) nor [...] "moving coil" [...] (MC) designs. These products are critically acclaimed for their sonic detail.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} play back {{binaural}} disks, a listener would need two separate <b>pick-ups</b> (LP <b>cartridges),</b> {{both of them}} monaural. Since the two pick-ups on a playback system had {{to be kept in}} very precise alignment with each other, Cook had to invent and market a system that could do this. Cook created a [...] "binaural phonograph adaptor" [...] or [...] "Binaural Clip-On" [...] which functioned as an outrigger that could be used on existing standard tonearm to hold a second pickup. The Binaural Clip-On was a well-made aluminum device that Cook Laboratories sold for US$5.95. The Clip-On made provision for very fine adjustment of the spacing of the cartridges: this level of adjustment was needed, because only a very slight misalignment of the two cartridge styluses would produce a phase difference between the two channels.|$|R
