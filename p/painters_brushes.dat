The popular weekly journal ran a two-page, black-and-white spread featuring four of his pieces--Adolf Hitler with a house <b>painter's</b> <b>brush</b> for nose and mustache (Hitler was rumored to be a house painter) and a dustpan of manure for the shirt; Harpo Marx with tomatoes for hair; Italian dictator Benito Mussolini with a toilet plunger for a scowling mouth; and the Duchess and Duke of Windsor, the well-off American divorcee Wallis Simpson with a pocketbook face, and milquetoast-timid former King Edward VIII with a slice-of-toast head and sunny-side-up egg eye. His work also appeared in several other publications, including Vanity Fair. In May 2015, the New York-based Society of illustrators hosted a lecture on forgotten caricaturists, which highlighted Hirshman's work.|$|R

After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.

In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice.

40|$|Background: Painters are chronically {{exposed to}} lead based paints, which causes anemia by {{impairing}} heme biosynthesis {{and increasing the}} red cell destruction. The present {{study was conducted to}} assess the lead exposure and haematological effects of lead in <b>brush</b> <b>painters</b> as they are chronically exposed to lead based paints. Objective: To estimate prevalence of anemia among <b>brush</b> <b>painters</b> and lead exposure among them. Methodology: Community based cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 occupational residential <b>brush</b> <b>painters</b> of Mysore city of India during July 2012 and September 2012. Subjects were interviewed using standardized questionnaire, mainly, for lead toxicity symptoms and personal hygiene. Venous blood samples were drawn and haematological parameters were determined (n= 100). The marker of anaemia was haemoglobin concentration. Through Systematic random sampling, 30 samples were selected for blood lead concentration (PbB) estimation. Results: The prevalence of anemia among the subjects was 3 %. The mean hemoglobin concentration was 15. 5 ± 1. 4 g/dL and mean blood lead concentration (PbB) was 12. 9 ± 10. 9 µg/dL. There was no significant correlation found between the PbB and haematological parameters. There was a high prevalence of lead toxicity symptoms and the symptoms were more in the less hygienic subjects than the hygienic subjects. Conclusion: The blood lead concentration among painters is less than the threshold (PbB > 50 µg/dL) for hematological alterations. Hence lead induced anaemia is not a health risk among <b>brush</b> <b>painters.</b> The PbB is also less than the recommended threshold for occupational exposure (30 µg/dL). But the high prevalence of lead toxicity symptoms indicates the long term health effects of lead even at low levels of exposure. Fortunately, being hygienic is an easily achievable goal to decrease the lead exposure among the painters...|$|R

60|$|For the {{moonlight}} this evening was almost solid, seeming with its cool still vibration {{to replace the}} very air; in it the war-time precautions against light seemed fantastic, like shading candles in a room still full of daylight.

The dreamlike quality of the town was perhaps enhanced for her eyes by the veil she was wearing--in daytime no longer white. As the music died out of her, elation also ebbed.

On this moonlight night by the banks of the Rhine--whence she came--the orchards would be heavy with apples; there would be murmurs, and sweet scents; the old castle would stand out clear, high over the woods and the chalky-white river. There would be singing far away, and the churning of a distant steamer's screw; and perhaps on the water a log raft still drifting down in the blue light. There would be German voices talking. And suddenly tears oozed up in her eyes, and crept down through the powder on her cheeks. She raised her veil and dabbed at her face with a little, not-too-clean handkerchief, screwed up in her yellow-gloved hand. But the more she dabbed, the more those treacherous tears ran. Then she became aware that a tall young man in khaki was also standing before the shop-window, not looking at the titles of the books, but eyeing her askance. His face was fresh and open, with a sort of kindly eagerness in his blue eyes. Mechanically she drooped her wet lashes, raised them obliquely, drooped them again, and uttered a little sob....|$|R

6000|$|The {{arrangement}} was happily completed, {{and for a}} few days the coach of Mr. Jarvis bore about the titled dame, until one unlucky day the merchant, who still went on 'change when any great bargain in the stocks was to be made, arrived at his own door suddenly, to procure a calculation he had made on the leaf of his prayer-book the last Sunday during sermon. This he obtained after some search. In his haste he drove to his broker's in the carriage of his wife, to save time, it happening to be in waiting at the moment, and the distance not great. Mr. Jarvis forgot to order the man to return, and for an hour the vehicle stood {{in one of the most}} public places in the city. The consequence was, that when Mr. Jarvis undertook to examine into his gains, with the account rendered of the transaction by his broker, he was astonished to read, [...] "Sir Timothy Jarvis, Bart., in account with John Smith, Dr." [...] Sir Timothy examined the account in as many different ways as Mr. Benfield had examined the marriage of Denbigh, before he would believe his eyes; and when assured of the fact, he immediately caught up his hat, and went to find the man who had dared to insult him, as it were, in defiance of the formality of business. He had not proceeded one square in the city before he met a friend, who spoke to him by the title; an explanation of the mistake followed, and the quasi baronet proceeded to his stables. Here by actual examination he detected the fraud. An explanation with his consort followed; and the <b>painter's</b> <b>brush</b> soon effaced the emblem of dignity from the panels of the coach.

60|$|Every {{country now}} {{has its own}} models, except America. In New York, and even in Boston, a good model is so great a rarity {{that most of the}} artists are reduced to {{painting}} Niagara and millionaires. In Europe, however, it is different. Here we have plenty of models, and of every nationality. The Italian models are the best. The natural grace of their attitudes, as well as the wonderful picturesqueness of their colouring, makes them facile - often too facile - subjects for the <b>painter's</b> <b>brush.</b> The French models, though not so beautiful as the Italian, possess a quickness of intellectual sympathy, a capacity, in fact, of understanding the artist, which is quite remarkable. They have also a great command over the varieties of facial expression, are peculiarly dramatic, and can chatter the ARGOT of the ATELIER as cleverly as the critic of the GIL BLAS. The English models form a class entirely by themselves. They are not so picturesque as the Italian, nor so clever as the French, and they have absolutely no tradition, so to speak, of their order. Now and then some old veteran knocks at the studio door, and proposes to sit as Ajax defying the lightning, or as King Lear upon the blasted heath. One of them some time ago called on a popular painter who, happening at the moment to require his services, engaged him, and told him to begin by kneeling down in the attitude of prayer. 'Shall I be Biblical or Shakespearean, sir?' asked the veteran. 'Well - Shakespearean,' answered the artist, wondering by what subtle nuance of expression the model would convey the difference. 'All right, sir,' said the professor of posing, and he solemnly knelt down and began to wink with his left eye! This class, however, is dying out. As a rule the model, nowadays, is a pretty girl, from about twelve to twenty-five years of age, who knows nothing about art, cares less, and is merely anxious to earn seven or eight shillings a day without much trouble. English models rarely look at a picture, and never venture on any aesthetic theories. In fact, they realise very completely Mr. Whistler's idea of the function of an art critic, for they pass no criticisms at all. They accept all schools of art with the grand catholicity of the auctioneer, and sit to a fantastic young impressionist as readily as to a learned and laborious academician. They are neither for the Whistlerites nor against them; the quarrel between the school of facts and the school of effects touches them not; idealistic and naturalistic are words that convey no meaning to their ears; they merely desire that the studio shall be warm, and the lunch hot, for all charming artists give their models lunch.|$|R
