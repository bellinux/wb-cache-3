5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity <b>portfolio</b> <b>is</b> quite close to the {{tangency}} portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity <b>portfolio</b> <b>is</b> near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
5|$|Roughly speaking, the {{approach}} of building a risk parity <b>portfolio</b> <b>is</b> similar to creating a minimum-variance portfolio subject to the constraint that each asset (or asset class, such as bonds, stocks, real estate, etc.) contributes equally to the portfolio overall volatility.|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk. However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management. The {{extent to which a}} risk parity <b>portfolio</b> <b>is</b> managed, is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of risk parity funds available today.|$|E

5|$|Although the IFC's {{shareholders}} initially {{only allowed}} it to make loans, the IFC was authorized in 1961 to make equity investments, {{the first of which}} was made in 1962 by taking a stake in FEMSA, a former manufacturer of auto parts in Spain that is now part of Bosch Spain. The IFC invests in businesses' equity either directly or via private equity funds, generally from five up to twenty percent of a company's total equity. IFC’s private equity portfolio currently stands at roughly $3.0 billion committed to about 180 funds. The <b>portfolio</b> <b>is</b> widely distributed across all regions including Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, and recently has invested in Small Enterprise Assistance Funds' (SEAF) Caucasus Growth Fund, Aureos Capital's Kula Fund II (Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Pacific Islands) and Leopard Capital’s Haiti Fund. Other equity investments made by the IFC include preferred equity, convertible loans, and participation loans. The IFC prefers to invest for the long-term, usually for a period of eight to fifteen years, before exiting through the sale of shares on a domestic stock exchange, usually as part of an initial public offering. When the IFC invests in a company, it does not assume an active role in management of the company.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other factor}} {{reducing}} {{the attractiveness of}} hedge funds in a diversified <b>portfolio</b> <b>is</b> {{that they tend to}} perform poorly during equity bear markets, just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value.
