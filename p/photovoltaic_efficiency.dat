50|$|At reduced {{pressure}} levels for VLSI manufacturing, polysilicon deposition rate below 575 °C is {{too slow to}} be practical. Above 650 °C, poor deposition uniformity and excessive roughness will be encountered due to unwanted gas-phase reactions and silane depletion. Pressure can be varied inside a low-pressure reactor either by changing the pumping speed or changing the inlet gas flow into the reactor. If the inlet gas is composed of both silane and nitrogen, the inlet gas flow, and hence the reactor pressure, may be varied either by changing the nitrogen flow at constant silane flow, or changing both the nitrogen and silane flow to change the total gas flow while keeping the gas ratio constant.

Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} are seeing increasing {{use in a}} variety of applications including warfare, imaging, communication, search and rescue, meteorology, agriculture, and more. For most applications, flight endurance on the order of days, weeks, or even years is desirable. Photovoltaic cells represent an emerging and viable method of powering unmanned aerial vehicles on such long endurance flights. This study investigates the design optimization of a small solar powered unmanned aerial vehicle. The aircraft is intended to weigh less than twenty pounds and to fly for 24 hours at low altitude over Sacramento, California during the summer months of May through September. Photovoltaic technology and the characterization of a thin-film photovoltaic cell are reviewed.
