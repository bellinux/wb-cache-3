50|$|Several {{species of}} {{speedwell}} are weeds that outcompete lawn grasses. Some {{of the more}} common of these are <b>Persian</b> <b>speedwell</b> (V. persica), creeping speedwell (V. filiformis), corn speedwell (V. arvensis),germander speedwell (V. chamaedrys), and ivy-leaved speedwell (V. hederifolia). It {{is often difficult to}} tell one species from another. There are five to seven species of speedwell in Michigan alone that are easily confused.|$|E
50|$|Veronica persica (common names: birdeye speedwell, common field-speedwell, <b>Persian</b> <b>speedwell,</b> large field speedwell, bird's-eye, or winter speedwell) (سیزاب ایرانی) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} plantain family Plantaginaceae. It is native to Eurasia and is widespread as an introduced species in the British Isles (where it was first recorded in 1825), North America, and eastern Asia, including Japan and Taiwan.|$|E
40|$|Due to etching {{effects on}} broad leafed weeds, fine ground kainite {{was used for}} weed control before {{synthetic}} herbicides have become common practice in conventional farming. According to the organic standards kainite {{can be used as}} potassium fertiliser. The present study investigates optimal growing stages for application in organic winter wheat and the range of effectiveness. Kainite was applied at a rate of 800 kg per hectare alternatively at EC 29 and EC 30 under the conditions of morning dew on days with high sunshine duration. At both growing stages kainite application reduced the population of hairy vetch, chamomile, cornflower, field pansy, winter rape, common chickweed and <b>persian</b> <b>speedwell.</b> Application at early growing stages led to a higher weed reduction...|$|E
