40|$|Abstract Background Human Papillomavirus (HPV) {{detection}} results comparing <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> cervical {{tissue and}} other cervical specimens {{have been done}} {{with varying degrees of}} agreement. However, studies comparing freshly frozen specimens and <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> specimens of invasive cervical carcinomas are lacking. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare HPV detection using SPF 10 broad-spectrum primers PCR followed by DEIA and genotyping by LiPA 25 (version 1) between freshly frozen cervical tissue samples and <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> blocks of cervical tissue from the same patient. There were 171 pairs of <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> and freshly frozen samples analyzed from cervical carcinoma cases from Kampala, Uganda. Results 88. 9 % (95 % CI: 83. 2 %- 93. 2 %) of <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> samples were HPV positive compared with 90. 1 % (95 % CI: 84. 6 %- 94. 1 %) of freshly frozen samples, giving an overall agreement in HPV detection between fresh tissue and <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> tissue at 86. 0 % (95 % CI: 79. 8 %- 90. 8 %). Although the proportion of HPV positive cases in freshly frozen tissue was higher than those in paraffin blocks, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). In both types of tissues, single HPV infections were predominant, with HPV 16 accounting for 47 % of positive cases. Comparison in the overall agreement, taking into accounts not only positivity in general, but also HPV types, showed a 65 % agreement (complete agreement of 59. 7 %, partial agreement of 5. 3 %) and complete disagreement of 35. 0 %. HPV detection in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and adenocarcinomas (ADC) was similar in fresh tissue or paraffin blocks (p ≥ 0. 05). p 16 immunostaining in samples that had at least one HPV negative results showed that 24 out of 25 cases had an over-expressed pattern. Conclusions HPV DNA detection was lower among ADC as compared to SCC. However, such differences were minimized when additional p 16 testing was added, suggesting that the technical issues may largely explain the HPV negative cases. </p...|$|R

The reactivity of A and H antigen after neutral buffered formalin fixation was superior to that observed after Zenker’s, Helly’s or Bouin’s fixation; reactivity in paraffin sections of forma-lin fixed tissues were equal to that of fresh frozen sections.

40|$|Frozen tissue {{specimens}} are {{the gold}} standard for molecular analysis. However, snap freezing presents several challenges regarding collection and storage of tissue, and preservation of histological detail. We evaluate an alternative preservation method, ethanol fixation followed by <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedding,</b> by analyzing expression profiles of microdissected cells on Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays of three matched benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and tumor samples processed with each preservation method. Frozen samples generated an average present call of 26 % of the probe sets, compared to 4. 5 % in ethanol-paraffin samples. Eighty-eight percent of the probe sets called present in the ethanol-paraffin samples were also present in the frozen specimens. Comparing ethanol-paraffin BPH to tumor, 52 probe sets showed a twofold differential expression or higher in at least two cases, 23 of which were also differentially expressed in at least one frozen case. Despite a significant drop in the number of transcripts detectable, the data suggests that the obtainable information in ethanol-fixed samples may be useful for molecular profiling where frozen tissue is not available. However, ethanol fixation and <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedding</b> of tissue specimens is not optimal for high-throughput mRNA expression analysis. Improved methods for transcript profiling of archival samples, and/or tissue processing are still required...|$|E

40|$|Background: Genetic {{analysis}} using the fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) method applied to intact tissue sections of formalin-fixed <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> (FFPE) tissue is well known to be relatively difficult. The frequent technical problems include unsuccessful hybridization as a result of poor probe penetration, excessive probe requirement, excessive background, auto-fluorescence, and overlapping or incomplete nuclei. These problems lead to absence or insufficiency of fluorescent signals, resulting in an inaccurate analysis. Formalin-fixed <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> tissue can be analyzed either as intact tissue sections or as a suspension of disaggregated, but intact, nuclei. Intact tissue sections have the advantage of preserved tissue architecture and morphology but have the intrinsic disadvantage of poor probe penetration, overlapping or incomplete nuclei and auto-fluorescence, accordingly reducing the accuracy of fluorescent signals evalua-tion. Objective: To present the effective FISH method applied to isolated of single nuclei and the procedures for isolation of a single nuclei from formalin-fixed <b>paraffin</b> <b>embedded</b> tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma.
