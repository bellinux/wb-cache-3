50|$|Heap {{leaching}} is {{an industrial}} mining process to extract precious metals, copper, uranium, and other compounds from ore via {{a series of}} chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and then re-separates them after their division from other earth materials.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{trend in}} {{extraction}} of nickel and cobalt from laterite ore through hydrometallurgical route is by using leaching agents {{that can be}} effectively regenerated, such as hydrochloric and nitric acid. Despite success stories of nickel laterite leaching in nitric acid, investigations on separation of nickel and cobalt from <b>pregnant</b> leach <b>solution</b> in this leaching media are still poorly reported. Nickel and cobalt are mostly recovered in the forms of intermediate products such as mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) and mixed sulphide precipitate (MSP). In this paper, separations of cobalt and nickel in nitrate <b>solution</b> and in <b>pregnant</b> leach <b>solution</b> of nickel laterite ore from Indonesia are discussed. Series of solvent extraction tests using Cyanex 272 and a combination of Versatic 10 and Cyanex 272 were performed under variations of equilibrium pH, extractant concentration, temperature and volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase (O/A ratio). The investigation results demonstrate that Cyanex 272 can be effectively used to separate cobalt and nickel in a solution with low nitrate concentration at the absences of Fe and Mg. The increase of equilibrium pH, extractant concentration, O/A ratio and temperature tends to enhance cobalt extraction and co-extraction of nickel. The best condition for separation of Co and Ni was obtained at equilibrium pH of 5, Cyanex 272 concentration 20 % (v/v), temperature 25 oC and O/A ratio 1 / 1. Separation of Co-Ni and Mg from <b>pregnant</b> leach <b>solution</b> can be well performed by 2 stage-SX using Versatic 10 followed by Cyanex 272 and selective stripping of loaded organic from {{the second stage of}} the extraction by using 1 molar sulfuric acid...|$|R
50|$|Cyanide {{should be}} {{strictly}} controlled on mine sites, and proper management requires that certain precautions {{be taken to}} limit worker exposure and to prevent chemical solutions containing cyanide from entering the environment. The most-used process of removing gold from ore is through leaching. In the leaching process, sodium cyanide is dissolved in water where, under mildly oxidizing conditions, it dissolves the gold contained in the crushed gold ore. The resultant gold-bearing solution is called 'pregnant solution.' Either zinc metal or activated carbon is then added to the <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution</b> to recover the gold by removing it from the solution. There are two main leaching methods for gold extraction using cyanide. The first is 'heap' leaching in which the dilute cyanide solution is sprayed on large piles or heaps of coarse gold ore. The solution percolates through the pile dissolving the gold and the <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution</b> is then collected. This method is mainly used for ore with lower concentrations of gold. The other method is 'vat' leaching in which the process is similar but the gold ore is finely ground and leaching {{takes place in a}} tank or vat. Vat leaching is used mainly for ores with higher concentrations of gold due to the cost of milling the ore to a very small particle size. Alternative lixiviant (leaching) chemicals to cyanide (for example thiourea, sodium bromide) have been investigated for many years, but they are generally less effective and/or economical than cyanide, and they also present environmental risks that can be greater than cyanide. Because cyanide is toxic if not properly handled, its use is highly regulated in most countries.|$|E
50|$|Such oxide ores {{are usually}} leached by sulfuric acid, {{usually in a}} heap {{leaching}} or dump leaching process to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with copper sulfate in solution. The copper sulfate solution (the pregnant leach solution) is then stripped of copper via a solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX-EW) plant, with the barred (denuded) sulfuric acid recycled back on to the heaps. Alternatively, the copper can be precipitated out of the <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution</b> by contacting it with scrap iron; a process called cementation. Cement copper is normally less pure than SX-EW copper. Commonly sulfuric acid {{is used as a}} leachant for copper oxide, although it is possible to use water, particularly for ores rich in ultra-soluble sulfate minerals.|$|E
50|$|Gravity {{concentration}} {{has been}} historically {{the most important}} way of extracting the native metal using pans or washing tables. Amalgamation with mercury was used to enhance recovery, often by adding it directly to the riffle tables, and mercury is still widely used in small diggings across the world. However, froth flotation processes may {{also be used to}} concentrate the gold. In some cases, particularly when the gold is present in the ore as discrete coarse particles, a gravity concentrate can be directly smelted to form gold bars. In other cases, particularly when the gold is present in the ore as fine particles or is not sufficiently liberated from the host rock, the concentrates are treated with cyanide salts, a process known as cyanidation leaching, followed by recovery from the leach solution. Recovery from solution typically involves adsorption on activated carbon then stripping (eluting) the gold from the carbon and passing the <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution</b> through electrowinning and then onto the smelting process.|$|E

Moreover, a kinetic study performed in the uptake of gold (III) by Lewatit MP- 64 _shows that either the film-diffusion and the particle-diffusion models fit the adsorption process on the resin.

This process is composed of successive units operations: crushing, milling, acid conventional leaching, filtration-washing, purification–concentration by ion exchange resins and uranium precipitation. The acid leaching operating conditions allow us to obtain a recovery uranium rate of 93 %. The uranium concentration of the <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution</b> is approximately of 1. 2 g/l. This value justifies the use of ion exchange resins to the concentration–purification of our <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution.</b> We have noticed that the <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution</b> contains a relatively high phosphate concentration which causes a premature uranium precipitation at pH= 1. 8.

We have obtained at this condition a good adsorption capacity. A 75 % uranium concentrate have been elaborated, but the filtration of this concentrate has been very difficult.

40|$|In {{this study}} carbide lime waste {{was used as}} raw {{material}} to produce precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). Carbide lime is an industrial waste from acetylene gas industry which uses limestone in its production. The use of PCC as fillers in paper making can reduce the production cost and improve the paper properties such as opacity and brightness. PCC can be produced from carbide lime waste by ionic sucrose solution method. The sucrose solution of Brix 10 ° was first prepared by dissolving sugar (sucrose) in water followed by dissolution of carbide lime waste in the sucrose solution. The sucrose solution which had turned milky was then filtered to obtain a clear solution known as <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution.</b> The <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution</b> that contained calcium ions was subsequently used to produce PCC by introducing CO 2 gas into the <b>pregnant</b> <b>solution.</b> The process is known as carbonation.
