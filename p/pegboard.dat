The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a <b>pegboard</b> used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E
25|$|Milton Bradley {{also created}} a Fine Edition and a Collector's Edition with more questions. The magic slates came {{enclosed}} in a gold-looking folder, plus a dial to keep score instead of the <b>pegboard.</b> The scoring and point values were just like the TV show. The only difference between the Fine Edition and the Collector's Edition is that instead of being packaged in a normal cardboard box, it came in a leatherette case with buttons on the front apron..|$|E
25|$|The bass type, {{similarly}} to the theorbo and other baroque lutes, has a vaulted body (shell) constructed of separate ribs, a flat soundboard {{with either a}} carved rose or one which is inset into the soundhole, and a bridge (without a saddle) consisting of a wooden bar acting as a string-holder glued to the soundboard. Unique to this instrument is the neck, which is long enough to allow for ten to 12 tied gut frets. The pegbox is either straight and set at a sharp angle to the neck (much like a lute pegbox), or gently curving and set at a shallow angle, either case being fitted with laterally-inserted tuning pegs (although sometimes a flat <b>pegboard</b> with sagittal pegs is found). The strings were of gut and are strung either singly or, especially on Italian instruments, in double courses. However, on German-made instruments, the first course (highest in pitch) is usually single (a chanterelle) and often has its own separate raised peg rider/holder attached to the pegbox. The number of courses varies from six to eight. Open string lengths tend to be fairly long (6272cm) on German instruments, but shorter (5565cm) on late Italian ones, probably because they tended to be tuned to a higher pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Acrylic {{laboratory}} {{drying racks}} give a unique feature that other <b>pegboards</b> cannot do. The clear acrylic is transparent, {{which means that}} it allows the light to pass through as well as brightening the working area. Acrylic <b>pegboards</b> are mostly {{in the place where}} there are no lights, or to be done in dim areas. [...] Like epoxy <b>pegboards,</b> acrylic laboratory <b>pegboards</b> are also installed with basic tools and power tools in the same way. However, acrylic <b>pegboards</b> are made up of plastic, so it can be easily scratched as compared to the epoxy and the stainless steel drying rack.|$|R

50|$|Timanus's father, Chuck, was a play-by-play announcer. Eddie began {{attending}} {{sporting events}} {{with his father}} {{at the age of}} six, and he started keeping statistics at the age of eleven. Timanus graduated from Wake Forest University in 1990 with a degree in economics. In 1991, The Washington Post reported that Eddie worked alongside Chuck as a statkeeper for American University's basketball games, using <b>pegboards</b> and abaci, compiling statistical information for WINX-AM radio.|$|R
500|$|The {{interior}} {{also contained}} a <b>pegboard</b> chess board {{connected to a}} pantograph-style series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move {{the arm of the}} Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the director to move the Turk's arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the director by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model. Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions. A voice box was added following the Turk's acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say [...] "Échec!" [...] (French for [...] "check") during matches.|$|E

50|$|Metal <b>pegboard</b> {{systems are}} usually {{made out of}} steel. Metal pegboards are usually mounted in strips, {{as it would be}} {{comparatively}} costly, cumbersome and inefficient to sell in larger sheets. Sufficiently thick metal pegboards will not sag between mounting points. Instead, the system's mounting on surfaces such as wood beams or sheetrock will usually fail under a heavy weight before the metal <b>pegboard</b> does. Manufacturers advise customers to hang tools and other gear based on the estimated strength of the mounting points. High quality metal <b>pegboard</b> systems use extruded holes, while other systems have the holes drilled after casting.|$|E

40|$|We {{employ the}} single-particle {{fluorescence}} nanoscopy technique points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) using site-specific DNA probes to acquire two-dimensional density maps of specific features patterned on nanoscale DNA origami <b>pegboards.</b> We show that PAINT has a localization accuracy of ∼ 10 nm that {{is sufficient to}} reliably distinguish dense (> 10 [superscript 4] features μm[superscript – 2]) sub- 100 nm patterns of oligonucleotide features. We employ two-color PAINT to follow enzyme-catalyzed modification of features on individual origami and to show that single nanopegboards exhibit stable, spatially heterogeneous probe-binding patterns, or “fingerprints. ” Finally, we present experimental and modeling evidence suggesting that these fingerprints may arise from feature spacing variations that locally modulate the probe binding kinetics.

40|$|Background: Parents of {{children}} with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), particularly mothers, experience a unique caregiving demand. Although benefits do exist, caregivers often report a burden due to children’s lack of social interaction and ability to self-care. Development of motor skills employed in these activities is often delayed in children with ASD; however, possible links between motor skills and the experiences of their caregivers is not clearly understood. This pilot study explored caregivers’ descriptions of the functioning {{of children}} with ASD {{in relation to their}} children’s motor abilities. Methods: Five children (two male, three female, ages 6 – 8) with ASD participated in the following tasks to assess lateral preference and performance: the WatHand Cabinet Test, involving a series of unimanual tasks; the Large and Small Grooved <b>Pegboards</b> test, which time the placement of pegs into key-shaped holes; Eyedness Tasks, such as looking through a tube with one eye; and Footedness Tasks, such as kicking a ball. The five married female primary caregivers (ages 35 – 46) of these children participated in one-on-one, semi-structured interviews regarding their view of their children’s functioning, and costs and benefits of their experiences. Results: Overall, parents of children who displayed weaker lateralization described their children’s motor abilities in ways that were indicative of greater difficulties with social interaction and age-appropriate self-care. Conclusions: Implications exist for intervention planning, where service providers should be cognizant of the motor difficulties experienced by children with ASD, and plan interventions that promote functional gains...|$|R
40|$|Adults {{with disabilities}} have {{traditionally}} performed meaningless tasks repeatedly, such as stringing beads or putting pegs in <b>pegboards.</b> Current best practices require professionals to train {{individuals with disabilities}} to become more independent {{in all aspects of}} daily living. They should participate in activities that are performed on a regular basis by nondisabled individuals of the same age. Since individuals with severe disabilities may lack many of the required prerequisite skills for performing daily living skills, adaptations and alternative performance strategies can be implemented to compensate for skill deficits. One alternative performance strategy is using picture recipes rather than traditional written recipes for individuals who lack reading skills. In the current study, each subject prepared two food items using a picture recipe and two food items without pictures. Subjects were randomly assigned to prepare four separate food items in different orders. The food items and the treatments were counterbalanced across subjects. This demonstrated that changes in behavior occurred with changes in treatment and not {{as a function of the}} preparation of a particular food item. The subjects were eight adults with severe disabilities who live in a large intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded. A pretest was administered to assure that subjects had the vision, mobility, dexterity, and matching skills required for the study. Neither reading skills nor number recognition was required for participation. The primary intent of the current study was to examine the relationship between cooking with pictures and cooking without pictures. The results show that adults with severe disabilities can be more independent in cooking when using picture recipes than when not using pictures. Of secondary interest was the generalization of skills from one cooking task to another. The experiment did not show that acquisition scores were consistently higher for the second food item prepared with pictures than for the first. Additionally, generalization was not shown from one food item prepared without pictures to another food item prepared without pictures. Department of Special EducationThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
