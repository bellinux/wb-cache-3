First, the characteristics of visually impaired people and several common orientation and mobility strategies are reviewed. Then, two research studies are discussed: In Study I an indoor test track was developed to explore what qualities of paving materials make them detectable by long cane users. Twenty-four visually impaired people were tested. It {{was found that the}} noise the cane made when it struck the surface was the best predictor of detectability. Study II was a field study in which sixteen subjects traversed a one-half mile (800 m) test route both before and after various countermeasures were added.

40|$|Global {{climate is}} changing, with {{heterogeneous}} {{effects on the}} biological world including direct impacts on plant phenology. The resilience and future dynamics of ecosystems will depend on their responsiveness to gradual environmental change, as well as susceptibility to more frequent climatic extremes (e. g. Orsenigo et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2013). High latitude regions are experiencing particularly rapid climatic changes, and bryophytes, specifically mosses, are the dominant plants in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. Wetlands cover 70 % of the Arctic, largely made up of Sphagnum dominated peatlands that are shaped by freeze-thaw processes and may be minerotrophic fens or ombrotrophic bogs (Minayeva & Sirin, 2010). In the Antarctic, over one hundred species of moss have been identified (Ochyra et al., 2008), with two native vascular plant species. Most Antarctic mosses form occasional low growing <b>carpets,</b> <b>mats,</b> turfs and hummocks, whilst some ombrotrophic peat banks up to three metres deep have accumulated in more maritime areas...|$|R
5000|$|On May 28, 2010, the NHTSA {{issued a}} {{statement}} that the stacking of all-weather floor mats from any manufacturer {{on top of the}} factory floor mat could cause accelerator entrapment.

Depending on vehicle and floor mat design, it is possible for unsecured floor mats to interfere with accelerator or brake pedals in a wide range of vehicles. Therefore, NHTSA reminds all drivers of all makes and models to check the driver-side floor mats for secure installation and to follow all manufacturer instructions for installing the mats." ...|$|R
