5|$|The {{number and}} {{strength}} of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50–70 year cycle, {{also known as the}} Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century and found five periods averaging 3–5 major hurricanes <b>per</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> lasting 40–60 years, and six other averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes <b>per</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> lasting 10–20 years. These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Throughout, a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year.|$|E

40|$|I use micro data on {{food and}} {{recreation}} expenditures from 1888 to 1994 to provide the first estimates of overall CPI bias prior to the 1970 s and new estimates of bias since the 1970 s and to reassess long-run growth rates.
