5000|$|The {{original}} Farmall {{is widely}} viewed as the first tractor to combine a set of traits that would define the row-crop tractor category, although competition in the category came quickly. Although {{it was not the}} first tractor to have any one of these traits, it was early in bringing the winning combination to market. The traits included (a) 'tricycle' [...] (a single front wheel or narrowly spaced pair), high ground clearance, quickly adjustable axle track, excellent visibility all around and under the machine, and light weight; (b) sufficient power for plowing and harrowing, and a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> <b>for</b> <b>belt</b> work; and (c) all at low cost, with a familiar brand and an extensive distribution and service network. The first group of traits allowed for more nimble maneuvering and accurate cultivation than most other tractors of the day; additionally, because of the second group, the Farmall could also, like previous tractors, perform all the other duties a farmer would have previously achieved using a team of horses. A tractor could yield lower overall operating costs than horses {{as long as it was}} priced right and reliable (and its fuel supply as well). The Farmall, mass-produced with the same low-cost-and-high-value ethos as the Ford Model T or Fordson tractor, could meet that requirement. The Farmall was thus similar to a Fordson in its capabilities and affordability, but with better cultivating ability.|$|R
40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2006 The goal of {{this project}} is to design, verify, and build an on-demand supercharger, powered by a small {{hydraulic}} motor, to produce additional boost for mid-range speeds according to the desired pressure profile for 6 to 7 seconds. Our design is durable, efficient, and quick to power up. A prototype design was created with a hydraulic motor and supercharger on-loan from the USEPA, and the team manufactured mounts for the system {{as well as the}} <b>pulleys</b> <b>for</b> the <b>belt</b> system. The team has created a validation plan for testing the prototype at the USEPA. In addition, the team has created a Matlab simulation of system performance which approximately meets the pressure/flow profile provided by the USEPA...|$|R
50|$|All of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engines have a {{timing belt}} made of rubber and cord. This belt must be {{replaced}} at 105,000 mi. These engines are interference engines, meaning that if the timing belt breaks or stretches, the pistons will hit the valves, resulting in an engine teardown, and a likely rebuild. Also, if this belt is replaced around 105,000 miles, {{it is a good}} idea to change the water pump, thermostat, belt tensioner and all the idler <b>pulleys</b> <b>for</b> this <b>belt.</b> The water pump and thermostat are behind this belt.In Australia for the Series II (MY06) cars, Subaru changed the recommended service interval <b>for</b> the timing <b>belt</b> replacement from 100,000 kilometers to 125,000 kilometers.The 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the first-generation Foresters featured head gaskets which were prone to premature failure. For 2003 and later, this issue was addressed with a revised, higher performing design, but is still an issue.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> <b>for</b> a flat <b>belt</b> (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} agro-waste disposal is {{a traditional}} and oldest method of waste disposal in which agriculture wastes are dumped {{as it is to}} degrade in a particular place for decomposing. As the wastes are dumped as such, it takes more time to degrade and it causes environmental pollution. The waste shredder machine aims to reduce the agro waste and convert it into useful nourishing fertilizer. It decreases the man work making the farm neat and clean. Also it reduces the heap amount of pollution, disease causing agro-wastes and produces a better fertilizer with vermin compost. The waste shredder machine is an attachment as like a ploughing attachment. In the shredder attachment input power and rigid support is provided by a KAMCO Tera-trac 4 W tractor by means of PTO (power take off) shaft and three point linkage. PTO shaft of the tractor acts as a basic power input and the three point linkage provide a rigid support to the machine. Various kinds of blades are used for chipping and powdering operations like sawing blades, rotatory blades, and triangular shape blades. The blades are mounted on the shaft. The power is transmitted to another shaft by means of <b>pulley</b> and <b>belt.</b> <b>For</b> designing waste shredder machine, Creo parametric 1. 0 software is used...|$|R
