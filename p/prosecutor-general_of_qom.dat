50|$|It is {{difficult}} to decipher the actual process of the Arab conquest <b>of</b> <b>Qom</b> from the extant Arabic sources. According to Balāḏori, the first tentative conquest <b>of</b> <b>Qom</b> took place in 23/644 by Abu Musa Ashaari {{after a few days}} of fighting (although Abu Musa's route through Western Persia, as narrated by Balāḏori, appears somewhat confusing). It remains unclear who the defenders <b>of</b> <b>Qom</b> were; probably fleeing Sasanian nobles and local soldiers returning from the great battles against the Arabs formed the core of the resistance. The area remained largely untouched for 60 years after the initial conquest and was probably administered from Isfahan.|$|R
50|$|The decisive {{step for}} the later urban {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>Qom</b> occurred {{when a group}} of Ashaari Arabs came to the area. These Ashaaries originated in Yemen and the first important figure among them was the first conqueror of the area <b>of</b> <b>Qom,</b> the above-mentioned Abu Musa Ashaari. ʿAbd-Allāh b. Saʿd and Aḥwaṣ b. Saʿd were grandsons of Abi Musa's nephew and led the group of Ashaaries that emigrated from Kufa to the region <b>of</b> <b>Qom.</b> It is not exactly clear why they migrated, but it might have also been a general opposition to the Umayyad dynasty. A central element was the early contact with the leading local Zoroastrian Persian noble Yazdanfadar.|$|R
