This system mainly designed to avoid unnecessary time conception to find an empty lot in a car parking area. By the same case we can also save more than 80 % of fuel wastage in a car parking area to finds the empty parking slot. The reservation process is happening only by user.

In the process industries, {{there is a growing}} need for fast acting measurement and control procedures, architectures and their implementation within existing sensor and control suites. With this industrial relevance, a multimodal tomometric sensor fusion is studied involving pressure and capacitance measurements in a two phase flow rig. Pressure is measured using standard pressure sensors, whereas the capacitance are measured using arrays of capacitance electrodes placed on the periphery of a section of the pipe in the multiphase flow rig. These capacitance measurements are performed by using ECT-modules. In this paper, the focus is on early slug detection and timely characterization of these slugs formed in the two phase flow. To associate simultaneous occurrence of slug based phenomena in the time series of the pressure and ECT-signals, dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithms are used. The usage of DTW and the multimodal tomometric sensor suite with pressure and ECT-modules leads to a co-operative sensor data fusion, which can help to identify characteristic features of slugs in two phase flows, which can be significant inputs to the <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in the assessment/implementation of necessary actions, such as activating choke valves, reducing pump outputs of {{one or more of the}} phases flowing in the rig.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 25 years, {{microsystem}} technology has developed {{to become a}} key technology of {{the first part of}} the 21 st century. With a world market share of approximately 25 billion US dollars forecast for the year 2009 and an anticipated annual rate of increase of 16 %, microsystem technology is one of the world's largest growth markets. The main growth drivers of this development are the industries of IT periphery, bio-medical technology, automotive technology, household and telecommunications. The strong growth and mounting competition in the field of microsystem technology are gradually stepping up the pressure on companies to manufacture cheaper products under constantly rising quality requirements. The decisive factor in this instance is microsystem assembly: according to surveys, up to 80 % of microsystem manufacturing costs are incurred by assembly. At the same time, assembly processes significantly influence the achievable levels of product quality and reliability. A core process in the fabrication of substance-to-substance connections in microassembly is bonding. It is often not possible to join microcomponents using other techniques such as welding or soldering. However, the use of adhesives to create substance-to-substance bonds is becoming more and more difficult due to ever-smaller component dimensions. The associated over-proportional reduction in size frequently results in the inability to ensure adequate levels of reproducibility and accuracy when applying continuous or discontinuous lines or dots of adhesive. Based on the current state of the art of adhesive application processes, by analyzing market data it was possible to identify the dispensing process as the most significant process for applying adhesives. On considering the varying dispensing processes that exist, the time-pressure method showed to be the most important dispensing technique. However, the dosing process of the time-pressure dispensing method does not enable the amounts of adhesive fed to be applied with a high degree of reproducibility and accuracy. This results in process scattering levels of approx. 10 %. The aim of this thesis was therefore to specify control laws to improve reproducibility and accuracy of time-pressure dispensing processes. An additional aim was to design and realize a tool and the necessary control software for process-controlled time-pressure dispensing. Firstly, using representative examples of hybrid microassembly application, it was possible to define the requirements of continuous and discontinuous time-pressure dosing. This resulted in maximum permitted process scattering levels of 2. 8 % for the continuous dispensing of lines of adhesives and 8. 3 % for the discontinuous dispensing of dots of adhesive. Based on this information, it was possible to identify problems associated with the process which could be solved within the scope of this thesis. This involved defining a complete mathematical model of the time-pressure dosing process which took into account not only the changes in temperature occurring in the dosing system but also the non-linear flow behavior of the adhesive. This also included the development of a working point <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> to regulate the continuous dosing of adhesive and a output <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> to regulate the discontinuous dosing of adhesive. The problems associated with forming the mathematical model were solved in two ways; first of all, a differential equation system was derived to calculate the transient temperature of the air in the syringe. Secondly, a differential equation was derived to characterize the transient, non-linear flow behavior of the adhesive in the dispensing capillary. Using the complete process model, a working point <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> was subsequently developed to regulate the continuous dosing of adhesive. To regulate the discontinuous dosing of adhesive, a reproducible output <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> was developed to resolve deficits regarding reproducibility and accuracy. In order to implement the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> realized, alternative solution approaches were developed to enable the targeted, continuous influence on the time-pressure dosing process and to record the required values of pressure and volume flow. The most suitable solutions were then determined. The newly-realized <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> as well as the solutions developed for monitoring and steering the processes were verified by carrying out experimental tests using the highly-viscous oil type “SHC 639 ” as a replacement medium. The tests demonstrated that the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> developed were capable of fulfilling requirements and showed that the reproducibility of dispensing results could be significantly increased both for continuous and discontinuous dosing processes. The developments made enabled variations in reproducibility to be reduced to less than 0. 5 % with an improved degree of accuracy of over 5 %, thus fulfilling the requirements placed on the continuous and discontinuous application of adhesive using time-pressure dispensing processes. Furthermore, these developments also enabled the reproducible dosing spectrum attainable with <b>controlled</b> time-pressure <b>processes</b> to be extended by 23 ml/h for continuous dispensing and 160 nl for discontinuous dispensing. When the techniques were finally implemented in a controlled time-pressure dispensing tool, it was possible to prove the technical feasibility of the process-controlled dosing of highly-viscous adhesives in an example using the type of adhesive "PD 955 ". If the control, dispensing tool and the volumetric flow sensor are further developed, it is conceivable that the technique developed could be implemented in industrial applications requiring the reproducible dispensing of tiny volumes of highly-viscous adhesive. The main focus of interest should be on increasing the load capacity of the flow sensor membrane in order to enable higher working pressures and thus reduce dispensing times. Another interesting aspect would be to carry out further investigations using the above-mentioned <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>units</b> with the aim of reducing minimum dispensing flow rates and volumes achievable with time-pressure dispensing systems. In addition to this, it would also make sense to transfer these results to other dispensing or dosing techniques, as well as to extend <b>controlled</b> dosing <b>processes</b> to <b>controlled</b> dispensing <b>processes</b> which also possess a feedback control of the adhesive application technique...|$|R

To restore the degraded control performance caused by the controller failures, a compensator is designed and inserted into the post-fault control loop, which serially links with the faulty controller and recovers the degraded control performance into an acceptable range.

40|$|Conventional {{quality control}} devices for spot welding cannot perform on-line {{inspection}} and provide {{feedback to the}} welding control system. In this way, the traditional quality control systems are similar to statistical welding parameters monitoring systems. It is imperative to combine the idea of on-line quality inspection with closed-loop feedback control in a robust control system. However, {{there is no single}} acoustic method to date capable of manipulating real-time control and on-line quality inspection, concurrently, since specific procedures (e. g. scanning time and adjustment time) need to be adopted by traditional acoustic microscopes to retrieve proper information, and these procedures tend to disable the real-time and on-line capability of acoustic microscopy. With recent hardware improvements, the novel portable acoustic device is able to reduce the scanning time to real-time fashion without losing any significant data. On the other hand, the adjustment time of the portable acoustic device can be reduced noticeably by employing intelligent control software instead of human operators. This new hardware-software configuration will be an ideal approach to the on-line, real-time nondestructive inspection of spot welds. The primary goal of this research is to develop an intelligent system to accomplish the on-line, real-time nondestructive inspection for spot welds. The following objectives were fulfilled to reach the final goal. (1) Classification of the acoustic images of spot welds. (2) Quantification of acoustic information as parameters. (3) The study of the influence of each parameter on the strength of spot welds. (4) Identification of important and significant parameters. (5) Integration of these parameters into the knowledge base of the software.

This is illustrated by a <b>process</b> <b>control</b> example of a water level monitoring system. First we prove the correctness of a control strategy in terms of a continuous interface. Next, to obtain a discrete interface, a sensor and an actuator are introduced. Using their specifications only, a suitable specification of the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> is derived. This reduces the design of the system to the conventional problem of deriving a program according to its specification. Finally the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> is extended, in a modular way, with error detection features...|$|R
40|$|Conversion and {{coating of}} {{particle}} nuclear fuel is performed in spouted (fluidized) bed reactors. The reactor must {{be capable of}} operating at temperatures up to 2000 °C in inert, flammable, and coating gas environments. The spouted bed reactor geometry is defined by a graphite retort with a 2. 5 inch inside diameter, conical section with a 60 ° included angle, and a 4 mm gas inlet orifice diameter through which particles are removed from the reactor {{at the completion of}} each run. The particles may range from 200 µm to 2 mm in diameter. Maintaining optimal gas flow rates slightly above the minimum spouting velocity throughout the duration of each run is complicated by the variation of particle size and density as conversion and/or coating reactions proceed in addition to gas composition and temperature variations. In order to achieve uniform particle coating, prevent agglomeration of the particle bed, and monitor the reaction progress, a spouted bed monitoring system was developed. The monitoring system includes a high-sensitivity, low-response time differential pressure transducer paired with a signal processing, data acquisition, and <b>process</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> which allows for real-time monitoring and control of the spouted bed reactor. The pressure transducer is mounted upstream of the spouted bed reactor gas inlet. The gas flow into the reactor induces motion of the particles in the bed and prevents the particles from draining from the reactor due to gravitational forces. Pressure fluctuations in the gas inlet stream are generated as the particles in the bed interact with the entering gas stream. The pressure fluctuations are produced by bulk movement of the bed, generation and movement of gas bubbles through the bed, and the individual motion of particles and particle subsets in the bed. The pressure fluctuations propagate upstream to the pressure transducer where they can be monitored. Pressure fluctuation, mean differential pressure, gas flow rate, reactor operating temperature data from the spouted bed monitoring system are used to determine the bed operating regime and monitor the particle characteristics. Tests have been conducted to determine the sensitivity of the monitoring system to the different operating regimes of the spouted particle bed. The pressure transducer signal response was monitored over a range of particle sizes and gas flow rates while holding bed height constant. During initial testing, the bed monitoring system successfully identified the spouting regime as well as when particles became interlocked and spouting ceased. The particle characterization capabilities of the bed monitoring system are currently being tested and refined. A feedback control module for the bed monitoring system is currently under development. The feedback control module will correlate changes in the bed response to changes in the particle characteristics and bed spouting regime resulting from the coating and/or conversion <b>process.</b> The feedback <b>control</b> module will then adjust the gas composition, gas flow rate, and run duration accordingly to maintain the bed in the desired spouting regime and produce optimally coated/converted particles...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for an automated calibration <b>process</b> for electronic <b>control</b> <b>units</b> (ECU) of power split transmissions in agricultural tractors. Today the calibration process is done manually on a prototype tractor by experts. In {{order to reduce}} development costs the calibration process is shifted from prototype testing to software modelling. Simultaneous optimization methods are used within the software modelling to calculate new parameters. The simultaneous optimization includes objective evaluation methods to evaluate the tractor behaviour. With the combination of both methods inside the software modelling, the calibration process can be automated. The success of this approach depends {{on the quality of}} the software modelling. Therefore the identification of the initial prototype behaviour and the fitting of the tractor software model is done at the beginning. At the end of the automated calibration the validation and fine-tuning of the calculated parameters are done on the real tractor. These steps are condensed to a five step automated calibration process which includes simultaneous optimization and objective evaluation methods in several applications. After the detailed discussion of this automated calibration process one function of the ECU (one transmission component) will be calibrated through this process as example...|$|R
