25|$|The U.S. Army has {{deployed}} machines {{such as the}} <b>PackBot</b> and UAV vehicles, {{which make}} use of a game-style hand controller {{to make it more}} familiar for young people. According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' dexterity as well as their ability to do problem solving. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.|$|E
25|$|Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices {{remotely}} operated {{from a distance}} by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time. They {{can also be used}} to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it. Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely. Teleoperated robot aircraft, like the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, are increasingly being used by the military. These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets. Hundreds of robots such as iRobot's <b>Packbot</b> and the Foster-Miller TALON are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to deployment as bomb-disposal units with the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, <b>PackBots</b> {{have been used}} to gather data in dangerous conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site, and an IRobot Seaglider detected underwater pools of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>PackBots</b> {{being used}} by the U. S. {{military}} in Afghanistan and the urban search and rescue (USAR) robots that worked the World Trade Center site are just two recent examples of mobile robots moving from the laboratory to the field. What is significant about these new applications is that they invariably involve some form of human-robot interaction (HRI) rather than the full robot autonomy that has motivated most prior research. Conducting HRI research can be extremely difficult because experimentation with physical robots is expensive and time consuming. Few roboticists have experience or interest in conducting human experimentation, and researchers in human factors or human-computer interaction often lack experience in programming robots or access to robotic platforms. In this paper, we describe a high-fidelity, open-source simulation intended for HRI researchers of varying backgrounds and provide reference tasks and environments to facilitate collaboration in order to share the results. The architecture and capabilities of the game engine–based USARSim simulation are described. Its use for HRI research is illustrated through case studies describing experiments in camera control for remote viewing and integrated display of attitude information...|$|R
40|$|While {{a number}} of {{excellent}} review articles on military robots have appeared in existing literature, this paper focuses on a distinct sub-space of related problems: small military robots organized into moderately sized squads, operating in a ground combat environment. Specifically, we consider the following: - Command of practical small robots, comparable to current generation, small unmanned ground vehicles (e. g., <b>PackBots)</b> with limited computing and sensor payload, as opposed to larger vehicle-sized robots or micro-scale robots; - Utilization of moderately sized practical forces of 3 - 10 robots applicable to currently envisioned military ground operations; - Complex three-dimensional physical environments, such as urban areas or mountainous terrains and the inherent difficulties they impose, including limited and variable fields of observation, difficult navigation, and intermittent communication; - Adversarial environments where the active, intelligent enemy is the key consideration in determining {{the behavior of the}} robotic force; and - Purposeful, partly autonomous, coordinated behaviors that are necessary for such a robotic force to survive and complete missions; these are far more complex than, for example, formation control or field coverage behavior.

2500|$|The Associated Press {{reports that}} two <b>PackBot</b> ground robots from iRobot have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the {{crippled}} Fukushima {{nuclear power plant}} and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49mSv/h inside unit 1 and up to 57mSv/h inside unit 3. TEPCO officials say that the radiation data from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant {{by the end of}} this year. Though more robots will be used, a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do, and eventually [...] "people must enter the buildings". Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by fogging of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{use of the}} <b>Packbot</b> in {{the field}} is IED {{detection}} and diffusion. The <b>Packbot</b> Scout was the first deployment of the <b>Packbot</b> and sent to Afghanistan in 2002 to explore caves and bunkers. This model was the simplest <b>Packbot</b> which contained just a robotic arm and camera. As of 2007 Packbots have been deployed to aid in the detection of sniper fire in the middle east. Acoustic signatures detected by the robot allow ground troops to pin point sniper fire in battle. [...] <b>Packbot</b> has also been used to explore buildings and other possibly dangerous areas with the modified light <b>Packbot</b> Explorer which only weighs 30 pounds and is faster than the <b>Packbot</b> 510. [...] In addition, iRobot sent two <b>Packbot</b> 510 robots to Japan after the tsunami and earthquake destroyed Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The robot was used on several reconnaissance missions at the power plant to remove debris and measure radiation readings.|$|E
50|$|A {{new model}} of the <b>PackBot</b> was also produced, known as the Warrior. It is over five {{times the size of}} a <b>PackBot,</b> can travel at speeds of up to 15 mph, and is the first {{variation}} of a <b>PackBot</b> capable of carrying a weapon (Singer, 2009a). Like the <b>Packbot,</b> they are instrumental in checking for explosives. They are capable of carrying 68 kilograms, and travelling at 8 MPH. The Warrior is priced at nearly 400,000 and more than 5000 units have already been delivered worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|<b>PackBot</b> Scout is {{the basic}} configuration. It has five payload bays for {{assignable}} purposes and can be dropped from a height of six feet (1.83m) onto concrete without being damaged. The <b>Packbot</b> scout version weighs about 40 pounds (18 kg).|$|E
5000|$|<b>PackBot</b> 510 with Fido {{utilizes}} the Fido Explosives Detector from ICx Technologies as a payload {{in order}} to [...] "sniff" [...] out explosive materials. With the Fido, the <b>PackBot</b> now has the capability of locating explosive devices and subsequently disarming them using on-board robotic capabilities.|$|E

50|$|<b>PackBot</b> is {{a series}} of {{military}} robots by iRobot, an international robotics company founded in 1990. More than 2000 were used in Iraq and Afghanistan. They were then used again to aid searching through the debris of the World Trade Center after 9/11 in 2001. Another instance of the <b>PackBot</b> technology being implemented was to the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami where they were the first to assess the site. As of November 2014, the U.S. Army is refurbishing 224 iRobot 510 robots. The <b>PackBot</b> technology is also used in collaboration with NASA for their rovers and probes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>PackBot</b> 510 has {{a maximum}} speed of 5.8 mph or 9.3 km/h, and weighs 31.6 lbs. or 14.3 kg. The robot can {{traverse}} mud, rocks, stairs, and other surfaces {{due to its}} caterpillar track. The robot also has zero radius turn capability, and can climb up to a 60 degree incline. The dual BB-2590/U Li-ion rechargeable batteries allow for the robot to have a run time of 4 to 8 hours. Adaptive Materials Inc. (AMI) has created a power pod battery capable of extending {{the life of the}} <b>PackBot.</b> The power pod weighs 6 kg(13 lbs) and allows for extension of battery life to reach 12 hours. [...] It can maneuver in up to 3 feet of water. <b>PackBot</b> has more than 40 accessories which are illustrated in <b>PackBot</b> 510 variants. Additionally, the robot can communicate up to 1000 meters or 3281 feet, and captures information through four cameras with night vision, zoom, and illumination capabilities that allow for real time image processing.|$|E
