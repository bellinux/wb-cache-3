5|$|The Employment Development Centres {{continuously}} seek {{to increase}} their diversity of contract work, in-house industries, social enterprises and job placements into open employment for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disability.

But more importantly, with jobs to do, <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disability can hold their heads high in society as ‘contributors’.|$|E
5|$|According to the PCBS, in 2007 94.5% of the {{population}} {{over the age of}} 10 was literate. Of that demographic segment, 21.7% received elementary education, 24.8% received primary education and 20.2% had secondary education. Over 15% had completed some form of higher education (617 <b>persons),</b> <b>with</b> 248 attaining associate degrees, 324 attaining bachelor's degrees and 45 obtaining higher diplomas.|$|E

50|$|For a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a Sensorineural {{hearing loss}} (SNHL) in quiet, the SRT {{also needs to}} be higher than for a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> normal hearing. This is because the only factor that is {{important}} in quiet for a CHL and a SNHL is the audibility of the sound, which corresponds to Factor A. In noise, the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a SNHL requires a better signal-to-noise ratio to achieve the same performance level, as the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> normal hearing and the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a CHL. This shows that in noise, Factor A is not enough to explain the problems of a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a SNHL. Therefore, there is another problem present, which is Factor D. At present, it is not known what causes Factor D. Thus, in noise the audiogram is irrelevant. It is the type of hearing loss that is important in this situation.|$|R
5|$|Another {{classification}} scheme considers genetic and demographic factors. Type 1 {{has a positive}} family history, starts {{before the age of}} 40, and is associated with the human leukocyte antigen, HLA-Cw6. Conversely, type 2 does not show a family history, presents after age 40, and is not associated with HLA-Cw6. Type 1 accounts for about 75% of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution {{provides}} that Parliament may restrict {{the right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression to provide against contempt of court.

5|$|Bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6, an isozyme of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system. Alcohol causes {{an increase}} of CYP2B6 in the liver, and <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> a history of alcohol use metabolize bupropion faster. Bupropion is metabolized to threo-hydrobupropion via cortisone reductase. The metabolic pathway responsible {{for the creation of}} erythro-hydrobupropion remains elusive.|$|E
50|$|Speech {{recognition}} threshold (SRT) {{is defined as}} the sound pressure level at which 50% of the speech is identified correctly. For a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a conductive hearing loss (CHL) in quiet, the SRT needs to be higher than for a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> normal hearing. The increase in SRT depends on the degree of hearing loss only, so Factor A reflects the audiogram of that person. In noise, the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a CHL has the same problem as the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> normal hearing (See Figure 10).|$|R

5000|$|A <b>person</b> <b>with</b> high self-efficacy will {{attribute}} {{failure to}} external factors, where a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> low self-efficacy will blame low ability. For example, someone with high self-efficacy {{in regards to}} mathematics may attribute a poor test grade to a harder-than-usual test, illness, lack of effort, or insufficient preparation. A <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a low self-efficacy will attribute the result to poor mathematical ability. See Attribution Theory.|$|R
50|$|In The 16 Strivings for God Reiss {{develops}} {{the theory that}} people embrace religion because it provides them with opportunities to satisfy all 16 basic desires both in strong form and in weak form. For example, a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a weak basic desire for social contact might be attracted to religious retreats, while a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a strong basic desire for Social Contact might be attracted to religious festivals. A <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a weak basic desire for Vengeance might be attracted to passages in scriptures that speak of peace and forgiveness, while a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> a strong basic desire for Vengeance might be attracted to passages that speak of revenge.|$|R

50|$|A race statute will divest {{common law}} title from a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> {{superior}} title if the subsequent purchaser recorded their deed {{prior to the}} <b>person</b> <b>with</b> superior title. A notice statute will divest common law title from a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> superior title if the subsequent purchaser had no notice (either actual or constructive - otherwise known as bona fide) of the true owner's title. A race-notice statute requires a subsequent purchaser to be bona fide and record first.|$|R
5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> {{three or more}} Jewish {{grandparents}} would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (Mischlinge of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> two Jewish grandparents (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree. For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did {{not have the right to}} vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the figures}} from 2012 show that 34.7% of the {{permanent}} resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third of this population (853,000) held Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> an immigration background were themselves immigrants (first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens).|$|E
5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} each round, {{the player}} going out {{receives}} 0 points, while all other players receive the sum of all pips (dots) on their dominoes.
