40|$|Packaging of MMIC LNA (monolithic {{microwave}} {{integrated circuit}} low-noise amplifier) chips at frequencies over 200 GHz {{has always been}} problematic due to the high loss in the transition between the MMIC chip and the waveguide medium in which the chip will typically be used. In addition, above 200 GHz, wire-bond inductance between the LNA and the waveguide can severely limit the RF matching and bandwidth of the final waveguide amplifier module. This work resulted {{in the development of}} a low-loss quartz waveguide transition that includes a capacitive transmission line between the MMIC and the waveguide <b>probe</b> <b>element.</b> This capacitive transmission line tunes out the wirebond inductance (where the wire-bond is required to bond between the MMIC and the <b>probe</b> <b>element).</b> This inductance can severely limit the RF matching and bandwidth of the final waveguide amplifier module. The amplifier module consists of a quartz E-plane waveguide probe transition, a short capacitive tuning element, a short wire-bond to the MMIC, and the MMIC LNA. The output structure is similar, with a short wire-bond at the output of the MMIC, a quartz E-plane waveguide probe transition, and the output waveguide. The quartz <b>probe</b> <b>element</b> is made of 3 -mil quartz, which is the thinnest commercially available material. The waveguide band used is WR 4, from 170 to 260 GHz. This new transition and block design is an improvement over prior art because it provides for better RF matching, and will likely yield lower loss and better noise figure. The development of high-performance, low-noise amplifiers in the 180 -to- 700 -GHz range has applications for future earth science and planetary instruments with low power and volume, and astrophysics array instruments for molecular spectroscopy. This frequency band, while suitable for homeland security and commercial applications (such as millimeter-wave imaging, hidden weapons detection, crowd scanning, airport security, and communications), also has applications to future NASA missions. The Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM) in the NRC Decadel Survey will need low-noise amplifiers with extremely low noise temperatures, either at room temperature or for cryogenic applications, for atmospheric remote sensing...|$|E

Hierarchical cluster analysis segregated the tumors into two main groups based on their ER status, which correlated well with basal and luminal characteristics. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified 16 genes that were significantly associated with relapse-free survival at a stringent significance level of 0. 001 to account for multiple comparisons.

40|$|A {{hardware-in-the-loop}} (HIL) simulation is {{a hybrid}} simulation {{that includes a}} hardware element within a numerical simulation loop. One {{of the goals of}} performing a HIL simulation at the European Proximity Operation Simulator (EPOS) is to simulate on-orbit servicing for verification and validation of the docking phase. The simulator essentially consists of two robots, with very accurate position controllers, holding a docking interface and a <b>probe</b> <b>element,</b> respectively. A key feature of the HIL docking simulator set-up is a feedback loop that is closed on the real force sensed at the docking interface during the contact with the probe, which is used in order to drive the free-floating bodies numerical simulation. The high stiffness of the robots causes the contact duration to be shorter than the (incompressible) time delay in the robots' dynamics. This leads to inconsistencies in the HIL docking simulation results and to potential instability and damage of the closed-loop system. This work presents a novel mitigation strategy to the given challenge, accompanied with stability analysis and validating experiments. The high-stiffness compliance issue is modified by combining virtual and real compliances in the software and hardware. The method is presented here for six degrees of freedom. Experimental results for the case of a translational motion along a single axis and the six degrees of freedom are presented, too. In addition, analysis is performed in order to characterize the stability region of the HIL docking simulator {{as a function of the}} contact force parameters, the time delay and the simulated satellites' masses.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} radiofrequency probe design for Ultra High Frequency Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7 T). The signal-to-noise ratio available in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{is determined by the}} static magnetic field strength, causing a continued drive toward higher fields to enable faster image acquisition at finer spatial resolution. The resonant frequency increases linearly with static field strength. At 7 T the proton resonant frequency is 300 MHz, with a wavelength of approximately 13 cm in tissue. As this is smaller than the dimensions of the human head, the phase of the radiofrequency (RF) signal varies considerably across the sample, producing field cancellation due to interference. A full wave electromagnetic simulator, using the Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) method, was developed to investigate RF probes at high frequency. A Birdcage probe operating at 64, 128 and 300 MHz (corresponding to 1. 5, 3 and 7 T) was simulated, loaded with an anatomically detailed human head model. A half-wave microstrip was investigated for use as a high frequency <b>probe</b> <b>element.</b> Magnetic and electric fields produced by a single microstrip were simulated, and the strip dimensions varied to investigate the effect on field penetration into the head and Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). A transmit-receive array probe using four microstrip elements was then developed. Bloch simulations were run, using TLM generated magnetic fields, to investigate imaging at short wavelength. Parallel receive probes are demonstrated to offer considerable advantage over volume probes, as signals from receive elements can be combined without interference. There is no transmit equivalent to parallel reception; simultaneous excitation of independent probe elements causes interference in exactly the same manner as a volume probe. A new imaging sequence was developed using a Burst-like encoding to allow sequential excitation of probe elements, without interference, which can be recalled in a single readout. An improvement in image homogeneity was demonstrated, and SENSE acceleration of the new imaging sequence is shown. The sequence was implemented at 3 T using a purpose built four element microstrip probe. An RF multiplexer was also built to enable transmit element switching during the imaging sequence. It was demonstrated that images due to different RF excitations, acquired in a single EPI readout, can be separated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
