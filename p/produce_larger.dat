5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and in the water around gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer to mate with larger females because they <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> and more offspring.|$|E
5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and water temperature. They feed on copepods, arthropod larvae and other zooplankton, eventually settling {{on the ocean floor}} and developing directly into adults with no distinct metamorphoses that are present in other groups of mollusc larvae. Octopus species that <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E
5|$|In Great Britain, the Percheron is {{used for}} {{advertising}} and publicity, as well as forestry and farm work. They are crossbred with lighter horses by breeders of heavy hunters {{in order to increase}} size and improve disposition. Purebred Percherons are also ridden, and some have proven useful at show jumping. Crossbred Percherons have been used successfully in dressage. In both the Falkland Islands and northern Australia, Percherons have been crossed with local mares, primarily Criollos in the Falklands, to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> stock horses with greater stamina. These crossbred horses are used extensively in both the sub-Antarctic climate of the Falklands and the sub-tropical climate of Australia for working stock. In Australia they are also crossed with Thoroughbreds for use as mounted police horses.|$|E

5|$|Large female Murray cod in the 15– to 35-kg (35– to 80-lb) range are {{the most}} {{important}} breeders because they produce the most eggs and for other reasons; large females in most fish species are also important because they <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> larvae with larger yolk sacs, and are also more experienced breeders that display optimal breeding behaviours. Such large females may also have valuable, successful genes to pass on. All of these factors mean the spawnings of large female fish have far higher larval survival rates and make far greater reproductive contributions than the spawnings of small female fish.|$|E
5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E

25|$|When {{carbon dioxide}} is the substrate, {{the product of the}} {{carboxylase}} reaction is a highly unstable six-carbon phosphorylated intermediate known as 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate, which decays virtually instantaneously into two molecules of glycerate-3-phosphate. The extremely unstable molecule created by the initial carboxylation was unknown until 1988, when it was isolated. The 3-phosphoglycerate can be used to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> molecules such as glucose.|$|E
25|$|Government further {{developed}} agriculture through {{technology and}} lower taxation. Complex irrigation systems built by government allowed peasant farmers to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> crop volumes and produce crops {{not only for}} sustenance but also as cash crops. Reduced taxation of the peasantry also furthered the expanded commerce through increasing periodic markets, usually held every five days. One thousand such markets existed in the 19th century, and were communal centers for economic trade and entertainment.|$|E
25|$|The galls occur more {{commonly}} on plants under stress, i.e. very dry conditions, waterlogging or hedge cutting, whereas vigorously growing plants are less commonly {{found to have}} galls. Whether the vigorous plant suppresses gall formation or is avoided by the wasp in favour of easier targets is unknown. Young and damaged plants tend to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> and more numerous galls than old and intact ones. In the latter, many eggs are laid, {{but the number of}} galls formed is relatively few.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese {{water spider}} spins four main kinds of silk: (1) silk {{used for the}} diving bell, (2) silk to anchor the diving bell to water plants, (3) silk for “walking” so as to get prey and mate, and (4) silk for the egg-cocoon. The diving bell silk is “used for breathing,” that is it serves to {{oxygenate}} the diving bell. Females <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> diving bells than males. Males build their diving bells less carefully than females do. Males also frequently make more walking threads than females.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to climate}} change for the past millennium, even the {{smallest}} exchange modeled would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the Little Ice Age (the period of history between approximately A.D. 1600 and A.D. 1850). This would take effect instantly, and agriculture would be severely threatened. Larger amounts of smoke would <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> climate changes, and for the 150 teragrams (Tg) producing a true nuclear winter (1 Tg is 1012 grams), making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases, new climate model simulations show that the effects would last {{for more than a}} decade.|$|E
25|$|Courtship {{occurs in}} two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the {{butterflies}} copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes. Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females {{may be able}} to avoid mating, though some have more success than others. During copulation, a male transfers his spermatophore to a female. Along with sperm, the spermatophore provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in egg laying. An increase in spermatophore size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> spermatophores also fertilize more females' eggs.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 {{bird species}} are long-distance migrants. The primary {{motivation}} for migration {{appears to be}} food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young. This helps diurnal birds to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> clutches than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.|$|E
25|$|Boron {{was known}} to the ancient Egyptians, {{but only in the}} mineral borax. The {{metalloid}} element was not known in its pure form until 1808, when Humphry Davy was able to extract it by the method of electrolysis. Davy devised an experiment in which he dissolved a boron-containing compound in water and sent an electric current through it, causing the elements of the compound to separate into their pure states. To <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> quantities he shifted from electrolysis to reduction with sodium. Davy named the element boracium. At the same time two French chemists, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard, used iron to reduce boric acid. The boron they produced was oxidized to boron oxide.|$|E
25|$|Thallium, the {{heaviest}} stable {{element in the}} boron group, was discovered by William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy in 1861. Unlike gallium and indium, thallium had not been predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev, having been discovered before Mendeleev invented the periodic table. As a result, no one was really looking for it until the 1850s when Crookes and Lamy were examining residues from sulfuric acid production. In the spectra they saw a completely new line, a streak of deep green, which Crookes named after the Greek word θαλλός (thallos), referring to a green shoot or twig. Lamy was able to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> amounts of the new metal and determined most of its chemical and physical properties.|$|E

25|$|Nearly all {{research}} in algal biofuels {{has focused on}} culturing single species, or monocultures, of microalgae. However, ecological theory and empirical {{studies have demonstrated that}} plant and algae polycultures, i.e. groups of multiple species, tend to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> yields than monocultures. Experiments have also shown that more diverse aquatic microbial communities tend to be more stable through time than less diverse communities. Recent studies found that polycultures of microalgae produced significantly higher lipid yields than monocultures. Polycultures also tend to be more resistant to pest and disease outbreaks, as well as invasion by other plants or algae. Thus culturing microalgae in polyculture may not only increase yields and stability of yields of biofuel, but also reduce the environmental impact of an algal biofuel industry.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco {{production}} {{requires the}} use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field. Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain. Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.|$|E
25|$|As a tropospheric cloud matures, {{the dense}} water {{droplets}} may combine to <b>produce</b> <b>larger</b> droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy {{to be kept}} aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as rain. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, {{a percentage of the}} light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker look. A simple example of this is one's being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of reflection/absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.|$|E
