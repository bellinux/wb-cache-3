50|$|In 1954, a 260.9 CID L truck {{engine was}} {{introduced}} as an optional Jobmaster engine for heavy-duty trucks.

This engine was offered as a step up from the 235 starting in 1954. It was offered in parallel with the GMC V6 engine in 1960 until 1963, when it was discontinued. The 261 USA truck engine had mechanical lifters and was available from 1954 to 1962.|$|E

50|$|The name 'trunk piston' {{derives from}} the 'trunk engine', an early design of marine steam engine. To make these more compact, they avoided the steam engine's usual piston rod with {{separate}} crosshead and were instead the first engine design to place the gudgeon pin directly within the piston. Otherwise these trunk engine <b>pistons</b> <b>bore</b> {{little resemblance to the}} trunk piston; they were extremely large diameter and double-acting. Their 'trunk' was a narrow cylinder mounted in the centre of the piston.|$|R
50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber is {{in two parts}} and is normally open to the atmosphere. When the contact tip is pushed onto a piece of work, the lower piston chamber (which also serves as the <b>piston</b> <b>bore)</b> is pushed into the upper part, sealing it. Simultaneously, a metered amount of fuel is squirted into the chamber from the fuel cell. When the trigger is pulled, a spark plug ignites the fuel charge, pushes the piston and connected drive pin {{to the bottom of}} the chamber, and drives a nail. A small amount of combustion gas is briefly stored in a side chamber and is used to push the piston back into the ready position after the nail is driven.|$|E
5000|$|Differences between F7P (1.8L 16V) and F7R include {{increased}} {{capacity to}} 1998 cc, bigger valves, more aggressive cam profile, different crank, larger <b>piston</b> <b>bore</b> (82.7mm compared to F7P of 82.0mm), longer stroke (93.0mm compared to 83.50mm) different exhaust manifold, oil cooler, etc. All {{this results in}} more low-down torque and more power. Also F7R is coupled to uprated gearbox (JC5) instead of JB3(1.8 16V). Highly tuned F7R engine was used in Renault's rally car Clio Williams Maxi with power output ranging from 250 to [...] This version was coupled with Sadev 6-speed manual or 7-speed Hewland sequential gearbox (stock Williams 5-speed manual).

50|$|An inline four cylinder, {{or even a}} V6 engine with a crank-speed balance shaft, will {{experience}} significant secondary dynamic imbalance, resulting in engine vibration. As a general rule, the forces arising from any dynamic imbalance increase as {{the square of the}} engine speed — for example, if the speed doubles, vibration will increase by a factor of four. In contrast, inline six engines have no primary or (significant) secondary imbalances, and with carefully designed crankshaft vibration dampers to absorb torsional vibration, will run more smoothly at the same crankshaft speed (rpm). This characteristic has made the straight-six popular in some European sports-luxury cars, where smooth high-speed performance is very desirable. As engine reciprocating forces increase with the cube of <b>piston</b> <b>bore,</b> the straight-six is a preferred configuration for large truck engines.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally {{opposing}} {{piston brake}} calipers {{are made in}} two halves which are then bolted together. The advantages of this method are ease and the speed of which the pieces can be made. The disadvantage {{is that they are}} less resistant to flex under load. Calipers machined from a single piece of metal are stronger, but much more expensive to make so some manufacturers such as Sumitomo cast the caliper body as one piece and then machine the <b>piston</b> <b>bores</b> externally with the holes created plugged after assembly.

40|$|Abstract: Inside of {{an engine}} block are <b>piston</b> <b>bores</b> and {{corresponding}} <b>piston</b> rings. Before and during engine operation, the cylinder bore may distort, possibly causing {{a loss of}} the “light-tight ” seal between the ring and the piston. We examine the conformability of elastic piston rings to a distorted cylinder bore. Several bounds exist that give the maximum bore distortion for each Fourier harmonic: the Dunaevsky, the GOETZE and the Tomanik bounds. By considering the complete bore profile, we analyze ring conformability {{in the presence of}} multiple orders of distortion with our RINGPACK program. We scrutinize the underlying assumptions for each bound. We then test our RINGPACK simulator with Finite Element (FE) data and compare our results to each bound. Our results indicate that the GOETZE bounds predict conformabilit...|$|R

5000|$|Alfa Romeo's Twin Spark {{technology}} used dual ignition to fire two spark plugs in the cylinder head of each <b>piston</b> <b>bore</b> and {{was first used}} in the A.L.F.A. Grand Prix car of 1914. Racing versions of the Giulia engine, including the engine used in the GTA, featured a cylinder head with two spark plugs per cylinder. Twin Spark versions of the Twin Cam were also developed for 1750 and 2000 models used for racing. In 1987 the model 75 was fitted with a Twin Spark head, which provided improved fuel ignition and allowed an improved combustion chamber shape with narrower angle between intake and exhaust valve. Although developed from the Twin Cam, few if any parts are interchangeable between Twin Spark engines and Twin Cams. For instance, while Twin Cams have six oilways leading to the cylinder head the Twin Sparks only have two, the timing chain cover is narrowed and the included angle between the valves is down to a 46°. The Twin Spark engine in the 75 also employed Alfa's variatore di fase VVT system which, when combined with electronic fuel injection, gave a power output of [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{basis for}} induced voltage in {{a magnetic field}} comes from Faraday's law describing an induced electromotive force (EMF) as follows:Emf = -N (∆Φb / ∆t)(Nave, C. R. 2011).This implies that {{as the number of}} magnetic flux lines increase or decrease there is a subsequent induced voltage of negative or positive polarity. However the relationship of electric forces and magnetic forces were summed up in Lorentz Force Law as F as follows:F = qE + qv x BHere all three forces were found to be perpendicular to each other (Nave, a, 2011). Thus Lorentz gave specially oriented direction to each of the forces allowing us to predict the direction of forces within the inductive pump architecture. Salamey further investigated the relationship of magnetic flux to circumferential area about the magnetic field where most of the magnetic forces were found to create mechanical forces used to direct the motion of the piston. Salamey further describes in his second patent the incorporation of a magnetic field gap. The gap is defined as a region of non-magnetic conduction circumferentially located {{at either end of the}} <b>piston</b> <b>bore.</b> The magnetic gap allows for increased propagation of magnetic flux through the magnetic piston body causing an increased force pulling the piston towards the magnetic end-pole (Salamey, 1999).|$|E

5000|$|Some {{areas of}} failure on this {{transmission}} include damage to plastic internals due to fluid over-temperature conditions, internal fluid pressure leaks from torn piston diaphragms, worn <b>piston</b> <b>bores</b> for solenoids in aluminum valve body, {{and the resulting}} worn clutches and bands. Occasionally, the plastic speedometer drive gear will break and fall off of the differential carrier and the speedometer will stop working. To repair this, the transmission must be removed and the differential disassembled far enough to replace the plastic gear. With age, the resistance in the wiring and/or electrical terminals between the valve body and transmission controller can increase. The additional resistance may prevent the computer from reading the faint pulses from the transmission speed sensors. Any missing sensor signal causes the transmission to go to [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "limp" [...] mode. This mode keeps the transmission in Third gear and the gear indicator in the instrument panel indicates all gears are selected simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The {{strain of}} side loading can be {{directly}} reduced {{with the use of}} internal stop tubes which reduce the maximum extension length, leaving some distance between the <b>piston</b> and <b>bore</b> seal, and increasing leverage to resist warping of the seals. Double pistons also spread out the forces of side loading while also reducing stroke length. Alternately, external sliding guides and hinges can support the load and reduce side loading forces applied directly on the cylinder.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{finishing}} of precise bores is {{an important}} machining step, especially in the automotive industries. Bores can vary in diameter and form, from bigger <b>piston</b> <b>bores</b> in motor cylinders to rather small bores in fuel injection systems. Quality parameters for these bores are form- and geometric accuracy as well as surface roughness and structure. All requirements can economically be met by using the honing process as the final finishing operation for readymade bores. Honing is an abrasive machining process using abrasive grains usually made of diamond or Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) in metallic bonding. During the process three movement components, namely an axial movement along the bore axis, a rotational movement around the bore axis and the feeding movement of the honing stone, are combined. The feeding movement of the honing stone is induced by an axial movement of the feeding cone, which is translated into a radial movement of the honing stone at the interface between honing stone and work piece. The feeding movement is decisive {{for the results of}} the honing process. For a regulation of the process that enables high process stability and repeatability as well as good quality results from the first part {{it is important to know}} about the forces in the feeding system of the tool. The following paper describes the static and dynamic correlation of the process forces in order to give a basis for a new regulation approach especially for bores with smaller diameters (below 20 mm) where the direct measurement of the process forces with a tool- integrated sensor is difficult. Measured signals are investigated for their dynamic influences. The theoretical approach is then compared to signals measured during the process...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines dominate transportation {{of people and}} goods, contributing significantly to air pollution, and requiring large amounts of fossil fuels. With increasing public concern about {{the environment and the}} reliability of oil supplies, automotive companies are pushed to improve engine design in order to reduce engine emissions and fuel consumption. This project aims to develop a numerical model of piston dynamics and lubrication in internal {{combustion engines}}, enabling prediction of friction generation at the <b>piston</b> -cylinder <b>bore</b> interface, and oil transport in the power cylinder system. It is currently estimated that the <b>piston</b> - cylinder <b>bore</b> friction accounts for up to 25 % of the power loss in a typical engine, while oil transported to the combustion chamber by the piston and ring-pack contributes significantly to engine emissions. A dry piston model was first developed to allow fast calculation of approximate piston dynamics. An elastohydrodynamic lubrication model was then developed to allow direct numerical simulation of the effect of piston tooling marks, and comparison with results obtained using an Average Reynolds equation with flow factors. The lubrication model was incorporated into the piston dynamics model, enabling more accurate evaluation of friction and oil transport. Comparison between the dry and lubricated model results demonstrate the effect of oil film thickness on piston lateral motion, tilt, friction generation and oil transport. by Fiona McClure.
