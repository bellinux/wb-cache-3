5|$|Although {{the main}} {{characters}} are fictional, some real <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> portrayed in the wartime sequences of the 1990s TV series Goodnight Sweetheart, including Alfred Lennon.|$|E
5|$|The next month, she tweeted an anti-gun {{message with}} the Season of Glass image of Lennon's bloodied glasses {{on what would}} have been her and Lennon's 44th anniversary, noting that more than 1 million <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed by guns since Lennon's death in 1980.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} New China News Agency {{stated that}} three <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed and eight others injured, {{but there are}} other reports that quoted villagers saying as many as 20 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed.|$|R
50|$|A {{source in}} Daraa told Al Jazeera that {{security}} forces were intensifying their {{house to house}} searches, and that hundreds of <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested. The government confirmed that 149 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested in Daraa.|$|R
25|$|By 15 August 2011 around 3,100 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested, of whom over 1,100 had {{appeared}} in court. On 25 August the BBC reported that more than 2,000 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested {{in connection with the}} disorder in London.|$|R
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{also has}} had a human toll. Thirty-two Alyeska or contract workers were killed during the construction project. That figure does not include common carrier fatalities. Since the pipeline began operating in 1977, 10 <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed while working for Alyeska or one of its contractors.|$|E
5|$|The pool is {{also open}} to motel guests, and, {{in spite of}} signs warning {{swimmers}} {{that they can be}} viewed from the bar while swimming, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to skinny dip.|$|E
5|$|Although many Pakistanis {{were silent}} about the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision {{to use force to}} retake the complex. While hardliners have been able to stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, most <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tolerant and oppose the militants desire to impose their interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E

50|$|Pangalengan {{became a}} major site for the {{placement}} of refugees (internally displaced persons, or IDPs) after the large West Java earthquake in September 2009. Following the earthquake, {{it was estimated that}} 50,000 homes <b>had</b> <b>been</b> destroyed in the area, 80,000 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> left homeless, and around 250,000 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> displaced.|$|R
5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to kill bears with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012. This among other contributing {{factors such as}} online dating and the upward mobility of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attributed to pushing {{the average age of}} marriage in China to 27, up from 20 in 1950, making it closer to global marriage trends.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about early human {{habitation}} in the Bryce Canyon area. Archaeological surveys of Bryce Canyon National Park and the Paunsaugunt Plateau show that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{in the area for}} at least 10,000years. Basketmaker Anasazi artifacts several thousand years old have been found south of the park. Other artifacts from the Pueblo-period Anasazi and the Fremont culture (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.|$|E
5000|$|A {{spokesman}} for the public prosecutor's office has said that twenty people were seriously injured in the collision. The Governor of Flemish Brabant, Lodewijk De Witte, said that 162 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> injured: of those, 55 <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hospitalized, and 11 were in a [...] "very serious" [...] condition.|$|R

5|$|Several notable <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> born or {{lived in}} Cheddar. Musician Jack Bessant, the bass guitarist {{with the band}} Reef grew up on his parents' {{strawberry}} farm, and Matt Goss and Luke Goss, former members of Bros, lived in Cheddar for nine months as children. Trina Gulliver, eight-time World Professional Darts Champion, currently lives in Cheddar.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{only three}} <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{appointed}} to the Order, {{all members of the}} British Royal Family. The then-Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII and later Duke of Windsor) was appointed in 1927 and his younger brothers, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, in 1934 and Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Six {{of these}} {{original}} handwritten copies were uniquely dedicated and given by Rowling to six {{people who were}} most involved with the Harry Potter series. The recipients of these copies were not initially identified. Since then, two of these <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> named. One is Barry Cunningham, Rowling's very first editor. Another is Arthur A. Levine, editor for Scholastic, the U.S. publisher of the Harry Potter books. Cunningham and Levine had lent their personal copies as part of Beedle the Bard exhibits in December 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times hotter than {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice in the same spot, some <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E
5|$|Besides Athkatla, {{other places}} the player will pass through include: an island, on which stands both the port town of Brynnlaw and the asylum Spellhold; the Underdark; {{the city of}} Suldanessellar; and the Astral Plane. There are also other places, which may be explored: the Umar Hills, where <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> disappearing; a temple ruins, fallen {{under the shadow of}} the Shade Lord; the de'Arnise Keep, home of the de'Arnises but {{recently}} overrun by trolls; the town of Trademeet, under attack by animals; a druid grove connected to Trademeet's woes; the Windspear Hills, where the player becomes entangled in the intrigues of Firkraag, a dragon; the underwater Sahuagin city; and the Planar Prison.|$|E
5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands}} of farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason.|$|E

5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 67 <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{given the}} Life Achievement Award. Multiple winners have been awarded 20 times, typically two co-winners, though five were noted in 1984. Since 2000 {{it has become}} an unofficial tradition for two winners to be announced, often with one winner primarily an author and the other not. While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and three winners are best known for founding or running publishing houses that produce fantasy works.|$|E
5|$|During the 6 {{years the}} award has been active, 19 fancasts by 56 <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> nominated, and 4 of those fancasts have won. SF Squeecast, {{created by a}} team of five people, won the award in both 2012 and 2013, and {{declined}} to be nominated for 2014. SF Signal Podcast, run by Patrick Hester, won the 2014 award, and Galactic Suburbia Podcast, run by Alisa Krasnostein, Alexandra Pierce, Tansy Rayner Roberts, and Andrew Finch, won the 2015 award. No award was given in 2016, and Tea and Jeopardy, by Emma Newman and Peter Newman, won in 2017 on its third nomination.|$|E
5|$|Examination of peat cores and pollen records {{indicates}} that soil erosion (suggesting clearance of woodland for agricultural purposes) {{was taking place}} in 3470 BC (the early Neolithic era); much later, from 2460 BC, evidence of arable cultivation exists. As the climate became damper, peat expanded its coverage {{at the expense of}} woodland, and post-glacial sea level changes left raised beaches around the coastline 18–45metres above the present sea-level, especially between Harris and A'Bhrideanach; Bronze Age artefacts, such as barbed-and-tanged arrowheads typical of the Beaker <b>People,</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found in the machair which replaced it.|$|E
