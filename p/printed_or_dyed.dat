A single dye which dyes all the textile material (fiber) is not made yet. In present study acid dye was used for silk fabric because silk is a protein fiber so acid dye is excellent for printing and Indalca gum is stable in both acidic and alkaline conditions so {{it is good for}} printing with acid dye on silk. Applying colour on fabric in different shape or design is textile printing. In textile printing colour is bounded with fabric. Various printing style were used for <b>printing.</b> After <b>printing</b> <b>or</b> <b>dyeing</b> it is necessary to have excellent fastness. For checking the fastness, various tests was done. These were washing, rubbing fastness and blue wool scale was used to assess the light fastness...|$|R

She opened her first boutique in Delhi in 1966. In 1973, she first showcased the Zardozi embroidery in her garments, which had its origins in the royal costumes dating back to the Mughal era. This led to the revival of this lost art. In time embroidery became a prominent feature of Indian wedding attire, and also one of the country's biggest fashion exports. This was a period of revival, where various organisations, NGOs and indicuals were involved in reviving traditional Indian techniques, in weaving, <b>printing,</b> <b>dyeing</b> <b>or</b> embroidery, including ikat, patola (double-ikat), bandhani (tie-dye) and shisha (mirror embroidery).|$|R
40|$|Textile dyeing {{effluents}} {{present a}} substantial environmental problem, primarily because such wastewaters contain {{high concentrations of}} waste dyes, dye by-products, and variable salt concentrations originating from <b>printing</b> <b>or</b> <b>dyeing</b> processes. Such wastewater streams often do not meet regulatory standards for wastewater discharge even after undergoing treatment by conventional means. The decolorization of textile wastewaters is a worldwide problem. Various processes have been utilized to remove the colored colloidal bodies and suspended solids and to reduce the associated high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). ^ Currently, no single treatment system is adequate to degrade the dye structures in wastewaters. A significant disadvantage of the current processes is their high capital and operating expenditures. Oxidation methods for example, are only effective in wastewater with a very low concentration of organic color while the adsorption process by active polymer resin is expensive {{and it is difficult}} to regenerate the adsorbent. ^ Palygorskite is a crystalloid hydrous magnesium-aluminum silicate mineral with very good colloidal properties such as specific features in dispersion high temperature endurance, salt and alkali resistance, and a high adsorbing and de-coloring capability. The structure of palygorskite was first proposed by Bradley (1940), who described a theoretical formula of [Si 8 Mg 5 O 20 (OH) 2] (H 2 O) 4. 4 H 2 O. Due to its sorptive properties, Palygorskite has been effectively applied in decolorizing and clarifying mineral oils and fats, as a carrier in pesticides, in the filtration of special products, as a sorbent on factory floors, and in the pharmaceutical industry. Its ability to adsorb indigo waste and other contaminants from textile effluents however has not been studied. Palygorskite is one of the two constituents of Maya Blue, a material of unprecedented stability with potential application in paints and coatings. The properties and quality of the pigments synthesized from the recovery products compares favorably to pigments synthesized from pure products. ^ The primary objective of this research was to demonstrate the ability of palygorskite to recover waste indigo dye from blue denim wastewater and to use the recovery products as a substrate for the synthesis Maya-blue pigment, a by-product with potential commercial applications. A secondary objective was to demonstrate the simultaneous removal of salts from the wastewater without substantially compromising the quality of the synthesized pigment. Salt reductions of up to over 60 per cent were achieved. Removal of the color and salts from the wastewater essentially opens up opportunities for possible reuse of the wastewater. ^ We demonstrate the effectiveness of palygorskite to concurrently remove indigo dye and salts from the wastewater without significantly compromising the quality of the synthesized by-product. Given that over a billion pairs of blue jeans are manufactured every year and the inordinate quantities of indigo dye used and released as effluent in the stonewash process, the possibility to apply the process on a commercial scale would have substantial economic and environmental implications. ...|$|R
40|$|Hypersensitivity {{pneumonitis}} (HP) is a nonimmunoglobulin E-related immune-mediated parenchymal lung disease. A 45 -year-old {{woman who}} was a lifelong nonsmoker with a six-month history of frequent episodes of cough and dyspnea was admitted to hospital. She had been working as a money counter for 20 years at a central bank. Bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, ground-glass opacities and a mosaic pattern on high-resolution computed tomography, restrictive abnormality on pulmonary function tests and mild hypoxemia were the prominent findings. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis revealed a predominance of CD 4 -positive T cells, and she tested positive on her natural challenge test. She was diagnosed with subacute HP based on established criteria. She was advised to discontinue counting fresh banknotes. Prednisolone was commenced, then tapered to discontinue in the ensuing six months. Clinical and radiological improvement was achieved within two months. To the authors’ knowledge, the present report {{is the first to}} describe ‘hard cash HP’, possibly caused by chipping dust <b>or</b> <b>printing</b> <b>dye...</b>|$|R

Then, microstructured monolayer arrays of these nanoparticles were generated by photolithography, microcontact <b>printing</b> <b>or</b> spotting with a microarrayer.

50|$|Though {{the quality}} of {{integral}} instant film {{is not as good}} as conventional film, peel apart black and white film, {{and to a lesser extent}} color film approached {{the quality of}} traditional film types. Instant film was used where it was undesirable to have to wait for a roll of conventional film to be finished and processed, e.g., documenting evidence in law enforcement, in health care and scientific applications, and producing photographs for passports and other identity documents, or simply for snapshots to be seen immediately. Some photographers use instant film for test shots, to see how a subject or setup looks before using conventional film for the final exposure. Instant film is also used by artists to achieve effects that are impossible to accomplish with traditional photography, by manipulating the emulsion during the developing process, or separating the image emulsion from the film base. Instant film has been supplanted for most purposes by digital photography, which allows the result to be viewed immediately on a display screen <b>or</b> <b>printed</b> with <b>dye</b> sublimation, inkjet, <b>or</b> laser home or professional printers.|$|R
