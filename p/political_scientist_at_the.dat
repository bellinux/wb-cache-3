5|$|The {{film was}} {{broadcast}} on China's national TV station, China Central Television (CCTV) on December 16, 2012 completely uncensored, surprising many viewers. While many {{believed that the}} government had banned the film, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television stated that it was not aware of a ban; CCTV makes its own decisions on whether to censor foreign films. Liu Shanying, a <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship might be being loosened.|$|E

The committee conducted extensive national consultations with over 200 people including academics, sitting and retired political leaders of all political persuasions including provincial premiers, current and former political party leaders, former prime ministers and others {{in order to develop}} a short list of candidates for the position. Also on the short list were other distinguished Canadians, including John de Chastelain and John Fraser.|$|E
25|$|As in the 2005 {{election}}s, the Red-Green Coalition won {{the election}} with less votes (this time 47.9%) than the opposition parties (49.5%). Peter N. Myhre of the Progress Party complained that this meant eight years with a government that had not truly won an election, and called for an overhaul of an electoral system that, he claimed, disproportionately favours the Norwegian periphery. Hanne Marthe Narud, a <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Oslo, identified the result {{as a consequence of}} deliberate political planning, and in particular of a 2001 compromise in the Storting that balanced proportionality against an intent to over-represent rural areas. She explained to Dagbladet that this trend could be dated as far back as 1917, when it was argued that Oslo's status as the national capital inherently gave it greater influence, so that it should have less representation in parliament compared with rural areas. Electoral researcher Bernt Aardal stated that he had calculated the results of the election without the rural skewness. His results showed that the Labour Party and Progress Party would both lose a representative, while Red and the Liberal Party would each gain one, still giving a majority to the Red-Green Coalition.|$|E

500|$|Robert Ford, a <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Manchester, {{reported}} on a YouGov survey on partisan reactions to the Downing Street cats. Participants in the survey were shown a picture of Humphrey, the Chief Mouser appointed by Margaret Thatcher, and told that he was either Thatcher's cat or Tony Blair's cat. Affinity for the cat divided along partisan lines: Conservative voters liked the cat far more when they were told he was Thatcher's and Labour voters liked the cat far more when they were told he was Blair's. Ford concludes that partisanship shapes reactions to everything a politician does, however trivial, similar to the halo effect (and a reverse [...] "forked tail effect") observed by psychologists.|$|E
500|$|On September 12, 2009 (his 50th birthday), Brown {{announced}} his {{run for the}} U.S. Senate seat that became vacant {{with the death of}} Ted Kennedy, saying the state [...] "needs an independent thinker."

Pasi Saukkonen, a <b>political</b> <b>scientist</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Helsinki, made a comparison between similar EU referendums in Denmark and Ireland (following which a similar referendum passed the measure, though it was in turn followed by a similar proposed measure) where the smaller EU member states wielded immense influence; though he said that such controversial matters usually work out in the end.|$|E
