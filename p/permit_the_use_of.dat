25|$|In 1679 Pope InnocentXI {{publicly}} condemned sixty-five of {{the more}} radical propositions (stricti mentalis), taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, Suarez and other casuists as propositiones laxorum moralistarum and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of excommunication. Despite this papal condemnation, both Catholicism and Protestantism <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ambiguous and equivocal statements in specific circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The Dauglish method survived its creator, and Dauglish's company survived him by {{well over}} a century, but his method was later {{superseded}} by the adoption of mechanical, high-speed dough processes such as the Chorleywood Bread Process (CBP), now responsible for 80 percent of U.K. bread production.

25|$|One of {{the actions}} taken by Congress was to <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the metric system in trade (1866), made {{at the height of}} the {{metrication}} process in Latin America.

25|$|In a responsum Joseph Saul Nathanson {{discussed}} {{the problem of}} the transfer of a corpse from one place of burial to another ("Sho'el u-Meshib", i., No. 231). In another responsum (ib. iii., No. 373) he replied in the affirmative to a question sent him from New York City asking whether a Protestant church might be changed into a synagogue.

25|$|This {{system was}} first used with the {{tungsten}} incandescent Bilux/Duplo R2 bulb of 1954, and later with the halogen H4 bulb of 1971. In 1992, US regulations were amended to <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> H4 bulbs redesignated HB2 and 9003, and with slightly different production tolerances stipulated. These are physically and electrically interchangeable with H4 bulbs. Similar optical techniques are used, but with different reflector or lens optics to create a US beam pattern rather than a European one.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, an {{optional}} test method was approved by California which <b>permitted</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> 10% ballistic gelatin {{as a replacement for}} Roma clay. The transition from hard, dense clay-based Roma to soft low-density gelatin allowed all textile solutions to meet this attack energy requirement. Soft all textile “ice pick” vests began to be adopted by California and other US states {{as a result of this}} migration in the test methods. It is important for users to understand that the smooth, round tip of the ice pick does not cut fiber on impact and this <b>permits</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> textile based vests for this application.|$|R

The Laws do not say that the pitch needs to be flat or level, merely that the surface must be safe to play on.

25|$|The {{x-system}} {{has become}} as popular as the h-system, but {{it has long been}} perceived as being contrary to the Fundamento de Esperanto. However, in its 2007 decision, the Akademio de Esperanto has issued a general permission for the use of surrogate systems for the representation of the diacritical letters of Esperanto, under the condition that this is being done only when the circumstances do not <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> proper diacritics, and when due to a special need the h-system fixed in the Fundamento is not convenient. This provision covers situations such as using the x-system as a technical solution (to store data in plain ASCII) yet still displaying proper Unicode characters to the end user.|$|E
25|$|There were {{cases in}} which team boats {{replaced}} steam boats for reasons of economy. In 1812, two steam boats designed by Robert Fulton were placed in use in New York, for the Paulus Hook Ferry from the foot of Cortlandt Street, and on the Hoboken Ferry from the foot of Barclay Street. The Juliana, running from Barclay Street, was withdrawn from service, as announced, {{in favor of the}} more convenient horse boat. It is almost certain, however, that this retrograde step was taken because of the monopoly enjoyed by Mssrs. Fulton and Livingston for the navigation of the waters of New York State by steam. In 1816, a steamboat company running ferry service between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Dartmouth had the law amended to <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> team boats instead.|$|E
50|$|Flagellation {{was also}} practiced during the Black Plague {{as a means}} to purge oneself of sin to prevent oneself from getting it. Pope Clement VI is known to have <b>permitted</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{flagellation}} for this purpose in 1348.|$|R
25|$|ZCPR2 was {{released}} on February 14, 1983. It {{was released}} {{as a set of}} ten disks from SIG/M. ZCPR2 was upgraded to 2.3, and also was released in 8080 code, <b>permitting</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ZCPR2 on 8080 and 8085 systems.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, filenames allowed any {{character}} in their filenames {{as long as}} they were file system safe.

25|$|Dalaras {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to perform a concert on the closing night of the second International Orthodox Youth Conference held in Istanbul from 11 to 15 July 2007. The event, organised by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, had drawn the ire of the Turkish press and Turkish nationalist politicians who filed complaints to the Governorship of Istanbul to revoke the licence for the concert it had issued, and the concert was abruptly cancelled by the Turkish authorities of the Governorship of Istanbul {{on the grounds that the}} country's Archaeological Service did not <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the planned venue, the 15th century Rumeli Hisar castle. The site had previously been used for international theatre festivals and for an international dance festival, until its use was prohibited by the Archaeological Service. The last-minute cancellation of the concert attracted strong media coverage and criticism in neighbouring Greece.|$|E
25|$|Enraged {{with this}} {{situation}} and determined to establish their authority, the company requested King James II in 1685 to <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> force against the Emperor’s army to settle the matter. Admiral Nicholson was sent with ships to attack the port at Chittagong, fortify it, make an alliance with the King of Arakan who was against the Mughals, establish a mint and collect revenue, thus making Chittagong a fort city for the British in the eastern part. Then {{he was ordered to}} proceed to Dhaka. It was assumed that the Governor would abandon the city and then a peace treaty would be offered which would guarantee free trade and other economic benefits for the British and he would give up the territory of Dhaka and Chittagong. Job Charnock was then at Madras and was directed to join the expedition with 400 soldiers from the Madras division.|$|E
500|$|A {{long range}} {{version of the}} Ju 87B was also built, known as the Ju 87R, the letter {{allegedly}} being an abbreviation for Reichweite, [...] "(operational) range". They were primarily intended for anti-shipping missions. The Ju 87R had a B-series airframe with an additional oil tank and fuel lines to the outer wing stations to <b>permit</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> two [...] standardised capacity under-wing drop tanks, used by {{a wide variety of}} Luftwaffe aircraft through most of the war. This increased fuel capacity to [...] (500litres in main fuel tank of which 480litres were usable + 600litres from drop tanks). To prevent overload conditions, bomb carrying ability was often restricted to a single [...] bomb if the aircraft was fully loaded with fuel.|$|E
