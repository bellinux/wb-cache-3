40|$|We have {{investigated}} the creation and destruction of asteroid families using a collisional code which follows {{the evolution of the}} size distributions of both the main-belt background population and individual families which are produced by collisions within the population. Starting with a small-mass initial belt, the number of families produced by collisional breakup of <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> larger than 100 km and surviving to the present time is in good agreement with the observed number of families. Increasing the mass of the initial belt increases the number of families in the model; hence the number of families that we see today provides a significant constraint on the overall collisional history of asteroids. Most families formed by disruption of large (D,> 200 km) <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> are still recognizable today. Families formed from smaller <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> early in Solar System history have been eroded away, and there is a general trend in our models to have younger ages associated with families formed from smaller <b>parent</b> <b>bodies.</b> Today about one-third of the overall population should be in families, consistent with the findings of V.

5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the <b>parent</b> <b>body</b> to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E
5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being {{removed from the}} main ring {{by a combination of}} Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in the ring is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This <b>parent</b> <b>body</b> population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of the main ring, and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of the main ring and halo ring. The age of the main ring is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|Cosmic-ray-exposure ages of meteorites provide {{information}} on the collisional history of their <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> and the delivery mechanism of meteorites to Earth. The exposure-age distributions of ordinary chondrites show distinct patterns for H, L, and LL types, consistent with their origin on different <b>parent</b> <b>bodies.</b> The exposure-age distributions of howardites, eucrites. and diogenites (HEDS) show a common pattern with major peaks at 22 Ma and 38 Ma This provides additional evidence for a common origin of the HED meteorites, possibly 4 Vesta, although orbital dynamics calculations showed that the delivery of meteorites from Vesta to Earth is difficult. However, the discovery of several kilometer-sized Vesta-like asteroids in the region between Vesta and the 3 : 1 resonance suggested that these seem more likely <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> of the HEDs than Vesta itself. This implies that the exposure-age clusters may represent samples of several <b>parent</b> <b>bodies.</b> Therefore, the near-absence of diogenites with ages < 20 Ma might be of interest for the composition of these kilometer-sized fragments of Vesta. Here we present cosmic-ray-exposure ages of 20 diogenites, including 9 new meteorites. In addition, we calculate the probability for each peak to occur by chance, assuming a constant production rate of HED fragments...|$|R

40|$|Skripsie (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1990 With {{regard to}} the {{education}} dispensation as proposed by the HSRC Education Report (1981 } a degree of ignorance prevails among parents as well as practising teaching staff. The obvious person to make available this information {{appears to be the}} principal. The abovementioned report emphasises an important aspect related to provision of tuition on the formal level - viz. that parents are co-responsible, and therefore should have a say in the educational tuition of their children. Organized parent involvement in the educational tuition of their children in Transvaal is embodied in statutory <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> such as management councils and in non-statutory <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> such as the "Transvaalse Afrikaanse Ouervereniging (TAO) ". These <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> can represent the parents who have elected them at a high level with regard to matters relating to educational tuition. The family as a primary community and the school as a secondary community should work in conjunction with each other and a spirit of partnership should exist between the family and the school {{for the benefit of the}} educational tuition of the child. Parent involvement and their dictates in school matters should take place in an organized and orderly fashion. It has become evident that the family and the school as partners have mutual expectations of each other. These expectations can only be realised if a bond of mutual trust exists between the partners and if concordant objectives relating to educational tuition are pursued. The composition of and the powers and duties of a Management Council and the TAO are discussed. From the literature study it has become clear that future clarification and specification, of these powers and duties are required. This will prevent any confusion concerning the dual competency areas of <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> and the school. Further it is pointed out that the principal is responsible for the management of the school in its totality. The principal's management embraces the planning, organization, guidance and exercise of control. The principal also exercises these managerial aspects within the activities of the <b>parent</b> <b>bodies.</b> Special emphasis is placed on guidance, which should emanate from the principal, so as to equip the <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> with the knowledge and the ability by means of which they will be able to exercise their task fittingly. It has also come to light that a manager's function is not only to plan, to organize, to give guidance, and to exercise control. The manager (i. e. principal) fulfils several other roles. According to Mintzberg's approach to the managerial role, it emerges that the principal also interprets different managerial roles in respect to the involvement of statutory and non-statutory <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> in educational tuition. An empirical investigation was made by means of a structured mailed questionnaire. This investigation confirms that the principal, as manager of the school, interprets certain roles and executes managerial tasks in respect of the activities of organized <b>parent</b> <b>bodies.</b> Certain conclusions were finally reached and recommendations relevant to specific facets of statutory and non-statutory <b>parent</b> <b>bodies</b> were made.
