50|$|The {{intestinal}} epithelium helps {{protect the}} intestinal mucosa from {{the external environment}} and luminal contents. Tight junctions are intercellular complexes that facilitate {{the low level of}} permeability present in the intestinal epithelial layer by monitoring the movement of materials between the intestinal lumen and the intestinal mucosa. Enterotoxins released by pathogens, in particular TNF-ct, result in an increase in the level of epithelial permeability. Lactobacillus mucosae strain ME-340 expressing the gene Lam29, which encodes for a protein that is believed {{to be related to the}} cysteine-binding transporter, shows a significant adhesion for human blood group A and B antigens. Many pathogens show a high affinity for these same blood group antigens in the gastrointestinal tract. Lactobacillus mucosae ME-340, and other strains including the patented CNCM 1-4429 strain, have been shown to decrease epithelial permeability and improve epithelial barrier function. The presence of this organism provides competitive exclusion against many of these pathogenic organisms and help with the development of new <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products. Increased epithelial activity is also one of the contributing factors to many intestinal disorders. Among these disorders is celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease. There is also significant antimicrobial activity to protect against pathogens exhibited in strain LM1. Analysis of this activity, as well as the activity of epithelial cell and mucin adhesion genes, is underway.|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to determine the perception of and attitude toward <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products among college students. This study used a self-reported survey questionnaire with a random recruited sample of 304 of students from upper- and lower-division classes at CSUN. Data were collected in November 2011 and analyzed with t-test, chi-square, and correlation. The results of this study indicated no significant differences between men and women on (1) how often they consume and (2) how much they know about <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products. In addition, there were no significant differences between men and women on how they defined <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products. Almost half of the participants could not answer the question, ???How would you define <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products???? The results also indicated that as participants age, they are significantly more likely to consume <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products (r=. 21, p<. 01) and hear about <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products (r=. 17, p<. 01). However, no significant correlation was found between income and consumption of or hearing about <b>probiotic</b> <b>food</b> products. In conclusion, the results indicated a lack of knowledge about probiotic functional food products among the general public, even among educated consumers such as college students. Therefore, it is necessary to make more of an effort to educate the public about probiotic functional food products; there should be more studies to not only educate the public but also further investigate the benefits of these products...|$|E
