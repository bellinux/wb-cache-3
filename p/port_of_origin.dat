25|$|Seal {{hunting in}} the waters between Svalbard and Greenland was started by Germans in the late 17th century. The {{activity}} was later taken over by Norwegians and Danish in the 18th century. Sealing was less profitable but could be carried with much less capital. Norwegians {{came in contact with}} the Russians through the Pomor trade. Despite earlier attempts, not until 1794 did a Norwegian party reach Bjørnøya and the following years Spitsbergen. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast Sámi from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795. From the 1820s the Norwegian hunting expeditions were taken up and continued {{through the rest of the}} century. Tromsø gradually replaced Hammerfest as the main <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> In the last third of the century, an average 27 Norwegian ships sailed to Svalbard. In the winter of 1872–73, seventeen seal hunters died in the Svenskehuset Tragedy.|$|E

The oldest known maritime trading route is the one between the Indus Valley Civilisation and Dilmun in modern-day Bahrain. Traders often stayed in the Gulf region {{for an extended period}} of time before returning to their <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> During the first wave, migrants mainly came from Asia and settled on the eastern shores of the Persian Gulf. Migration was often the result of trade relations between the Gulf and Asia. Migration was mainly undertaken by people from modern-day Iran and India who traveled to the Gulf. Most trading goods were exported to the Gulf, while only a limited amount of goods was exported in the other direction. Pearls were the exception and the main trading product in places like Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Scholars such as Muhammad Azhar point out the longstanding relationship between Indians and the Arabian Gulf, where many stayed for generations and even became citizens.|$|E

At around 17:00, Detmers {{instructed}} his wireless operators to send a false distress signal indicating that Straat Malakka was being approached by a suspicious ship. The message, transmitted at 17:03 and repeated at 17:05, contained the distress call for a merchantman under attack from a raider instead of a warship (QQQQ, as opposed to RRRR), the latitude and longitude of the transmitting ship, the time per Greenwich Mean Time (normal practice was to transmit local time; using GMT was to let the Kriegsmarine know that the ship was actually a raider about to be lost), and the ship's name. This signal was partially received by the tugboat Uco ("QQQQ [...] 1000 GMT") and a shore station at Geraldton (" [...] 7C 11115E 1000 GMT"). The Geraldton station broadcast a message to all ships asking {{if there was anything}} to report (which was interpreted by the Germans as acknowledgement of their signal), but after no response was forthcoming, ignored it until a report on the signal was forwarded to the Naval Board on 27 November.|$|E

40|$|Norway rats are a {{globally}} distributed invasive species, {{which have}} colonized many islands around the world, {{including in the}} South Atlantic Ocean. We investigated the phylogeography of Norway rats across the South Atlantic Ocean and bordering continental countries. We identified haplotypes from 517 bp of the hypervariable region I of the mitochondrial D-loop and constructed a Bayesian consensus tree and median-joining network incorporating all other publicly available haplotypes via an alignment of 364 bp. Three Norway rat haplotypes are present across the islands of the South Atlantic Ocean, including multiple haplotypes separated by geographic barriers within island groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The growing {{progression}} {{in the use}} of containers as standardized charge {{unity in}} maritim transport and the tecnological revolution associated to this has involved deep changes in the nature of interport competition. At first, the concept of Hinterland is becoming obsolete because the use of containers provide the intermodality and so remove monopolistic position <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> in his next influence area. Adjoint to this, interport competition is not focused, however, exclusively in enlarging the next influence area and more and more {{it has to do with}} his function of transhipment, that is, attracting the throughput with origin or destination to another port. Shippers organize container througtput by means of Round-The-World services which reasoning lie in using huge ships paying of call in a few strategic ports where transhipments are done from/to <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> or destination <b>ports</b> through feeder ships(with a moderate size). The upshot of all that is growing concentration of container througput in a few intermodal launchs and the configuration of a very competitive environment in the regional port systems. The purpose of this paper is analysing the impact of tecnological, economic and spatial changes associated to the introduction of containers in maritim...|$|R
50|$|On July 18, 1947, the Royal Navy intercepted the Exodus-1947 a ship {{laden with}} 4,515 {{refugees}} {{en route to}} Palestine. The passengers resisted violently, and the boarding ended with two passengers and one crewman dead. Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin decided that rather than being sent to Cyprus, the immigrants on board the Exodus would {{be returned to the}} ship's <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in France. Bevin believed that sending illegal immigrants to Cyprus, where they then qualified for inclusion into legal immigration quotas to Palestine, only encouraged more illegal immigration. By forcing them to return to their <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> Bevin hoped to deter future illegal immigrants. However, the French government announced that it would not permit the disembarkation of passengers unless it was voluntary on their part. The passengers refused to disembark, spending weeks in difficult conditions. The ship was then taken to Germany, where the passengers were forcibly removed at Hamburg and returned to DP camps. The event became a major media event, influencing UN deliberations, damaging Britain's international image and prestige, and exacerbating the already poor relationship between Britain and the Jews.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. When a Royal Navy vessel or a private man-of-war captured an enemy ship, a court needed to establish whether the vessel {{was in fact}} a lawful prize: in other words whether the ship, crew or cargo belonged to an enemy state. To determine this, crew members were cross-examined (if necessary {{with the help of a}} sworn-in interpreter) about all matters relating to the ownership of the ship and its cargo. Commonly, three crew members were questioned, usually a cross section of the ranks aboard. From these interrogations, we have created a database, containing all the information required by the interrogation rubric and therefore consistently present in the interrogations. The database comprises two tables, one of which deal with information about the ship, such as geographical markers <b>of</b> its <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and destination, its tonnage, the number of nationalities aboard and information about its owner. This is linked to information about the crew, since there was normally more than one crew member interrogated per vessel.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This study {{examined}} the logbook record of the Oregon trawl fishery using a geographic information system (GIS) to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of English sole, Pleuronectes vetulus. The original logbook data for the years 1981, 1982, 1994, 1995, 1996 were filtered twice to provide both a general description of trends {{in the distribution of}} tows and catch parameters, and a more explicit ecological description of English sole catch dynamics. Tow distribution maps were used as a basis to evaluate the utility of the logbook data as a means to identify potential locations for harvest refugia. The spatial pattern of the trawl fishery changed dramatically between 1981 - 82 and 1994 - 96, although fishing activity was concentrated near <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> in all years. The fleet moved offshore and northward and the species composition of tows shifted from shallow water species toward deeper water fisheries. The English sole fishery remained distinct from the trawl fishery, although English sole tows and yields declined. High densities of English sole tows and the largest percentage annual English sole catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) occurred in waters offshore Astoria, within 46 - 47 °, in all years. Eight geographical regions were ranked according to their value to the production of English sole and their importance to the fishery. Sites of potential harvest refugia were selected based on their ability to contribute to the goal of long-term sustainability of the English sole fishery, by providing a buffer against errors in fishery management. Four sites were identified as potential locations, three sites in the offshore waters <b>of</b> the <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> Astoria, Newport and Brookings, and a fourth site in the nearshore zone along the Oregon coast, within the 50 -fathom contour. The study concluded that logbook data will be useful to future planning of marine harvest refugia along the Pacific coast, because the data provide insights into fishing behavior and the relative amounts of fishing intensity that occur in different geographic regions. In addition, use of logbook data provide an opportunity for involvement of the fishing industry in the marine harvest refugia planning...|$|R

At night the port authorities used signal lights to warn a skipper he must halt, and the flag had to stay raised until the ship was passed. Arrangements for boarding and examining ships {{were made in the}} port 'Boarding Room', and eventually a team of 2 officers and 6 men set out in a fishing drifter or motor launch to the ship. After apologising to the captain for the trouble, they inspected the ship's papers, manifest and bills of lading. At the same time the wireless cabin was sealed so no signals could be sent out while the ship was in the controlled zone. After satisfying themselves that the cargo corresponded with the written records, the party returned ashore and a summary of the manifest, passengers, <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and destination was sent by teleprinter to the Ministry. When the ministry's consent was received, the ship's papers were returned to the captain along with a certificate of naval clearance and a number of special flags - one for each day - signifying that they had already been checked and could pass other patrols and ports without being stopped. If the Ministry found something suspicious, the team returned to examine the load. If part or all the cargo was found suspect the ship was directed to a more convenient port where the cargo was made a ward of the Prize Court by the Admiralty Marshall who held it until the Court sat to decide the outcome, which could include returning it to the captain or confirming its confiscation to be sold at a later time and the proceeds placed into a prize fund for distribution among the fleet after the war. A disgruntled captain could dispute the seizure as illegal, but the list of banned goods was intentionally made broad to include [...] "any goods capable of being used for or converted to the manufacture of war materials".|$|R
