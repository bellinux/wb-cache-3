2500|$|The {{traditional}} way {{to analyze the}} ascorbic acid content {{is the process of}} titration with an oxidizing agent, and several procedures have been developed, mainly relying on iodometry. Iodine is used {{in the presence of a}} starch indicator. Iodine is reduced by ascorbic acid, and, when all the ascorbic acid has reacted, the iodine is then in excess, forming a blue-black complex with the starch indicator. [...] This indicates the end-point of the titration. As an alternative, ascorbic acid can be treated with iodine in excess, followed by back titration with sodium thiosulfate using starch as an indicator. The preceding iodometric method has been revised to exploit reaction of ascorbic acid with iodate and iodide in acid solution. Electrolyzing the solution of potassium iodide produces iodine, which reacts with ascorbic acid. The end of process is determined by <b>potentiometric</b> <b>titration</b> in a manner similar to Karl Fischer titration. The amount of ascorbic acid can be calculated by Faraday's law.|$|E

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} persistence {{length of}} carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) {{is determined by}} size exclusion chromatography in combination with multiangle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) {{as well as from}} <b>potentiometric</b> <b>titrations.</b> Samples with degree of substitution (ds) ranging from 0. 75 to 1. 25 were investigated. The relation between molar mass M and radius of gyration Rg as obtained by SEC-MALLS is determined in 0. 02, 0. 1, and 0. 2 mol L- 1 NaNO 3. Using the electrostatic wormlike chain theory a bare (intrinsic) persistence length Lp 0 of CMC is assessed at 16 nm, irrespective of the degree of substitution. A somewhat lower value (12 nm) is obtained when Odijk's theory for the description of polyelectrolyte dimensions is applied. The difference between Lp 0 assessed from both models is discussed briefly. <b>Potentiometric</b> <b>titrations</b> were carried out in NaCl solutions (ranging from 0. 01 to 1 mol L- 1). From the titrations the radius of the CMC backbone was obtained by application of the model of a uniformly charged cylinder. The radius amounts to 0. 95 nm for CMC ds = 0. 75, and increases to 1. 15 nm for CMC with ds = 1. 25. The pK for the intrinsic dissociation constant of the carboxyl groups (i. e., at zero degree of dissociation) amounted to 3. 2. Lp 0 was also deduced from <b>potentiometric</b> <b>titrations.</b> A model developed by Katchalsky and Lifson, which relates the dissociation behavior of a polyelectrolyte to the stiffness of its chain, was applied to CMC. From analyses of the <b>potentiometric</b> <b>titrations</b> an intrinsic persistence length of 6 nm was deduced.

50|$|<b>Potentiometric</b> <b>titration</b> is {{a useful}} tool for {{estimating}} the amounts of isohumulones in hops bitter substances, which are a large component of beer. Isohumulones are seen to combine with metals in stoichiometric proportions. This allows solutions of isohumulones, generally created by extracting isohumulones from hops using isooctane or petroleum and a liquid-liquid extraction, can be titrated with solutions of metal salts using changes in conductivity to determine an end point. The solutions of isohumulones can then be titrated against a metal salt such as nickel acetate or lead acetate. Readings of potential difference over time then give a titration curve in which potential will increase very slowly at first and then very rapidly. The rapid change in difference corresponds to all of the isohumulones reacting, signifying the end point of the reaction.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>potentiometric</b> <b>titration</b> {{was carried}} out in 1893 by Robert Behrend at Ostwald's Institute in Leipzig. He titrated mercurous {{solution}} with potassium chloride, potassium bromide, and potassium iodide. He used a mercury electrode along with a mercury/mercurous nitrate reference electrode. He found that in a cell composed of mercurous nitrate and mercurous nitrate/mercury, the initial voltage is 0. If potassium chloride is added to mercurous nitrate on one side, mercury (I) chloride is precipitated. This decreased the osmotic pressure of mercury (I) ions on the side and creates a potential difference. This potential difference increases slowly as additional potassium chloride is added, but then increases more rapidly. He found the greatest potential difference is achieved once all of the mercurous nitrate has been precipitated. This was used to discern end points of titrations.|$|E
