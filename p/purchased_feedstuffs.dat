30|$|A {{two year}} study was {{conducted}} in the community of 11 producers, considering their present cheese production, their varying commercializing strategies through time (with the actual selling prices and costs of sale), and all their expenses of inputs acquired outside of their system, including <b>purchased</b> <b>feedstuffs,</b> veterinary products, salts, fuel, and agricultural inputs. These variable costs were allocated according to the percentage of income derived from the sale of goat dairy products. Results showed that producers lose 50 to 70 % of their profits when they sell cheese to middlemen. Since the cost of family labour is not included because they do not pay for it, the profit margin is actually part of their own family salary. In addition, a marginal labour analysis shows that the extra work in manufacturing and selling cheese, compared with just selling the milk, on average, provides incomes almost twice their earnings per hour, considering their whole business. Thus, cheese-making is the most lucrative part of producers’ business.|$|E
40|$|Dairy Research, 2006 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2006 Efficient {{utilization}} of nutrients is a must on modern dairies. Most of the phosphorus arriving at the dairy will either be found in <b>purchased</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> or commercial fertilizer used to raise grain and forage for the dairy. In general, those dairies that purchase all feeds are more efficient with phosphorus utilization than those that grow forage and grain. This is likely due to increased inefficiencies associ-ated with feeding and crop enterprises. Care-ful evaluation of diets to reduce feeding ex-cess phosphorus can reduce phosphorus excre-tion in the manure {{by as much as}} 50 %. This not only reduces input costs, but also reduces the total cost of land application. The most efficient way to manage dairy farm nutrients is to develop a comprehensive nutrient manage-ment plan that includes both the cropping and animal enterprises. This plan will help pro-ducers predict phosphorus requirements of cattle and crops, and then allow the producer to control phosphorus inputs to meet the re-quirements...|$|E
40|$|Milk supply from Mexican {{dairy farms}} {{does not meet}} demand and {{small-scale}} farms can contribute toward closing the gap. Two multi-criteria programming techniques, goal programming and compromise programming, were used {{in a study of}} small-scale dairy farms in central Mexico. To build the goal and compromise programming models, 4 ordinary linear programming models were also developed, which had objective functions to maximize metabolizable energy for milk production, to maximize margin of income over feed costs, to maximize metabolizable protein for milk production, and to minimize <b>purchased</b> <b>feedstuffs.</b> Neither multicriteria approach was significantly better than the other; however, by applying both models it was possible to perform a more comprehensive analysis of these small-scale dairy systems. The multi-criteria programming models affirm findings from previous work and suggest that a forage strategy based on alfalfa, rye-grass, and corn silage would meet nutrient requirements of the herd. Both models suggested that there is an economic advantage in rescheduling the calving season to the second and third calendar quarters to better synchronize higher demand for nutrients with the period of high forage availability...|$|E
40|$|Pork is an {{important}} source of human Salmonellosis. Therefore efficient Salmonella surveillance programmes are recommended for minimising Salmonella entry into food production. With a stochastic simulation model, a Salmonella control programme (based on meat juice samples) was analysed depending on sample size (30 to 200 animals per finishing farm and year), prevalence in the population (8, 13 and 24 %), farm size (400, 1500 and 3000 places per farm), threshold level classifying a farm as positive (20 and 40 %) and sensitivity of the test. The simulation model generates an integrated pig production chain with linkages between the stages farrowing, rearing, fattening and slaughter starting with the purchase of gilts. Salmonella may enter the system via <b>purchase</b> of animals, <b>feedstuffs</b> and other vectors. Crowding effects and pen-to-pen infection were also taken into account. Within each herd a dynamic pattern of Salmonella infection was simulated. The simulation covered a time interval of 24 months. Sensitivity, specificity and the predictive values were used for the evaluation of the different sampling strategies. At the base situation (prevalence 8 %, 1500 places per finishing farm, 60 animals sampled per year and a threshold of 40 %) sensitivity was 65. 9 and specificity 96. 6 %. Increasing the sample size mainly improved the sensitivity (74. 2 to 77. 0 %). If the prevalence in the population is enhanced, more animals have to be sampled in order to realise the same detection rate. The effect of the farm size was negligible. The pattern of the Salmonella infection within a farm over 24 months demonstrated that a classification of farms supposes a handling time of 12 months...|$|R
40|$|In Italy {{nearly two}} thirds of the beef bulls are reared in {{northern}} regions by specialized intensive fatteners that import stock calves from other European countries, mainly from France. Usually they feed them until slaughter with total mixed rations based on maize silage and concentrates. The increase of feed and animal purchase costs, the growing requirements for environmental sustainability and the expected detrimental changes in Common Agricultural Policy for intensive systems are currently endangering the viability of this sector. This study aimed to analyse the effects of management factors such as beef breed, body weight (BW) at arrival and diets on performance traits, nutrient excretion and net sale gain (NSG), taken as economic indicator, computed as (beef value at sale – beef value at purchase) and expressed per day of fattening (€/d). Seventeen specialized fattening herds were visited monthly during 1 year to collect performance data and diets formulation and composition. The data were analyzed using ANOVA with herd, breed and classes of management factors as fixed effects. The fattening period for beef cattle lasted on average 229 d, with an average BW at purchase and at sale of 370 and 671 kg, respectively. The average NSG computed per day of fattening was 2. 44 €/d, with a large variation due to herd and breed. Feed intake averaged 9. 75 kg DM, and the average gain to feed ratio was 7. 5. Diets were characterised by an average crude protein and phosphorus content of 141 g/kg DM and 3. 78 g/kg DM, respectively, the ratio between NSC and NDF averaged 1. 4, and average self-sufficiency was 33 % on daily DM intake. During the production cycle the intake, the retention and excretion of nitrogen averaged 0. 22, 0. 04 and 0. 18 kg/d, respectively, and those of phosphorous averaged 0. 04, 0. 01 and 0. 03 kg/d, respectively. Further studies are needed for better defining the profitability of this system by including the ratio and cost of <b>feedstuffs</b> <b>purchased</b> outside the farm...|$|R
40|$|Intensification of milk {{production}} {{is associated with}} {{an increase in the number}} of dairy cows and milk yielding. In order to maintain high milk yield and quality of the produced raw material it is very important to adjust the appropriately balanced dose of feeds. Production of good quality own roughage is a valuable and cheap source of food for animals, but it may be insufficient to provide high milk yielding. As a result, it is necessary to buy commercial concentrated feedingstuffs (mainly protein concentrates and concentrated compounds) which may lead to an increase of production costs. Intensification of {{milk production}} in the economic aspect is justified only in the case of a simultaneous increase in the profitability of this production, which is the relation of the production value and incurred costs. For the economic purpose of milk production the way of feeding the dairy cows should also result from economic calculation and the purchase of commercial feedingstuffs must be economically justified. This article attempts to answer the question whether the increased consumption of commercial concentrated feedingstuffs and increased direct costs are justified by achieved economic results from milk production. The accountancy data were collected according to the methodology of the AGROKOSZTY and Polish FADN system among dairy farms. Grouping of the surveyed farms concerned a level of commercial feedingstuff quantity which (as shown by statistical analysis) was strongly correlated with milk yielding. The designated groups (with small level and high level of usage of commercial feedingstuffs) were analysed in terms of direct costs and labour input as well as the level of income from the activity. The economic results of the surveyed farms showed that the higher costs incurred for the <b>purchase</b> of commercial <b>feedstuffs</b> in the group with high usage of commercial feedingstuffs (average herd in the group was 30 dairy cows with milk yielding of 6, 000 liters per cow) did not allow to achieve much better economic results than in the group with small usage of commercial feedstuffs (average herd in group was 15 cows with milk yielding of 5, 200 litres per cow) ...|$|R
40|$|Demand for {{livestock}} products {{has been increasing}} {{through much of the}} semi-arid tropics and will likely continue to increase along with the use of <b>purchased</b> <b>feedstuffs.</b> As smallholder livestock systems evolve and become more market oriented, the type of diets fed to livestock may change and the importance of feed marketing may increase. Mixed crop–livestock systems are key to meeting this increasing livestock product demand and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L. ] Walp.) fodder (haulms) is an important component of these systems in semi-arid regions of the tropics where its high nutritional quality allows it {{to be used as a}} supplement to livestock diets based on cereal stovers and other low-quality forages. Improving the nutritional quality of cowpea fodder for use by livestock is important to improving the productivity and profitability of these mixed farming systems. Legume fodders will remain an important part of changing livestock diets and the development of cowpea varieties that better feed both people and their farm animals will give farmers new and better choices for improving levels and efficiency of livestock production. Cowpea breeding programs have worked toward producing dual-purpose varieties that emphasize the production of grain and fodder since the late 1980 s and have produced several that have become well accepted when tested on-farm. Systematic screening of cowpea genetic resources is important for advancing development of dual-purpose varieties. Involvement of cultivar release agencies and seed production programs are also important to advance the use of improved dual-purpose crop varieties...|$|E
40|$|Production {{analysis}} and survey data {{suggests that the}} greatest contribution to annual cow production costs in the Northern Plains is harvested and purchased feed (Taylor and Field, 1995). Harvested hay is not only expensive to purchase, but it is expensive to put up and feed. Dunn (2002) showed that interest and depreciation on capital (required to handle hay) were major factors limiting profitability of ranching operations. Profit margins in cow/calf production are slim due to high production costs (Taylor and Field, 1995) and lost opportunity to capture value from marketable ranch products (NASS, 1999). Low input systems, or systems that reduce hay feeding, may add profitability to producers. Systems that rely more on grazing and less on harvested and <b>purchased</b> <b>feedstuffs</b> have a higher potential to be profitable (Adams et al., 1994). Early weaning practices may be beneficial when forage supplies are low and supplemental feed is costly. Work done by Meyers et al. (1999 a, b) and Fluharty et al. (2000) showed early-weaned steer calves when compared to those calves weaned at traditional ages may have comparable average daily gains and improved feed efficiency during the postweaning period. While {{it is clear that}} reduced-input systems have a greater potential for positive returns, management of cattle becomes increasingly important on these low- or reduced-input systems. Management of calving dates, weaning dates, supplementation programs and monitoring and managing cow condition at critical times throughout the production year, are key elements in achieving good performance in the herd...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of mountain dairy systems (Italian eastern-Alps) was analyzed {{by using the}} following indicators: carbon footprint (CF, cradle-to-farm gate Life Cycle Assessment method) and gross energy and crude protein human-edible conversion ratios (computed as the ratio {{between the amount of}} gross energy and crude protein content in human-edible feedstuffs and the energy and protein content of milk, HeE_CR and HeCP_CR, respectively). Data were collected at farm level in 71 dairy farms (52 ± 47 Livestock Unit – LU, 17. 4 ± 9. 3 kg Fat Protein Corrected Milk - FPCM/cow/day on average). Two functional units were tested: 1 kg of FPCM(CFFPCM, kg) and 1 m 2 of farm agricultural area (CFFAA, m 2). Emissions due to herd and manure management, on-farm feedstuffs production, <b>purchased</b> <b>feedstuffs,</b> fuel and electricity were included within the system boundaries. Emission computation was based on IPCC Tier 1 - 2 procedure. Allocation between milk and meat was based on IDF method. CFFPCM, CFFAA, HeE_CR and HeCP_CR were analyzed with a GLM model with the fixed effects of the classes of farm size (LU) and milk productivity (kg FPCM/LU/day) – three classes computed on the basis of mean± 0. 5 *SD (Low, Intermediate, High). Mean CFFPCM was 1. 1 ± 0. 3 kg CO 2 -eq/kg and mean CFFAA was 0. 92 ± 0. 82 kg CO 2 -eq/m 2, whereas mean HeE_CR and HeCP_CR were 1. 27 ± 0. 82 MJ edible feedstuffs/MJ milk and 0. 81 ± 0. 56 kg CP edible feedstuffs/kg CP milk, respectively. The main drivers of the impact were enteric fermentation (62...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNutrient {{supply in}} organic pig {{production}} {{is characterized by}} limited amino acids (AA) availability due to the preferable use of home-grown feedstuffs and restrictions on <b>purchased</b> <b>feedstuffs.</b> This can cause large variations {{in the quality of}} diets, carcasses, and pork. The objective of two feeding trials was to assess the interactions between feeding regimes, genotype, and birth weight on carcass and pork quality. A control regime was compared with two feeding regimes that were partly (only in the finishing phase (FIN)) or both in the growing and finishing phase (GRO+FIN) restricted to home-grown feedstuffs, thus differing in AA supply. Using an isocaloric ration, individually housed pigs differing in genotype (Experiment 1) or birth weight (Experiment 2) were allocated to the three feeding regimes. The highest daily live weight gain, the best feed conversion, and the highest values for performance traits and meat composition were achieved by Du×DL pigs, while the highest carcass yield was achieved by Pi×(DL×DE) pigs. In Experiment 1, performance traits were significantly higher in the control feeding regime than in the GRO+FIN treatment, with the feeding regime FIN being intermediate. Lean meat percentage was significantly lower in the GRO+FIN feeding regime than in the control while the fat area was not influenced by feeding regime. Intramuscular fat content was higher under the GRO+FIN feeding regime without AA supplementation than in the control. In Experiment 2, birth weight showed no significant effect on carcass yield, carcass traits and meat composition, but affected growth rate. Performance traits were highest in the control, while meat composition was best in the GRO+FIN treatment, confirming results of Experiment 1. Exclusion of AA supplementation in the feeding regime reduced growth but increased intramuscular fat content (IMF). The feeding regime was the main source of variation for intramuscular fat content in the longissimus muscle. Organic pig production can yield high quality pork, but information on feed, feed intake, and pig characteristics is important to steer the production process...|$|E
