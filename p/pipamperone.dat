40|$|A {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous quantification of seven typical antipsychotic drugs (cis-chlorprothixene, flupentixol, haloperidol, levomepromazine, <b>pipamperone,</b> promazine and zuclopenthixol) in human plasma. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) was used for complete separation of the compounds in less than 4. 5 min on an Acquity UPLC BEH C 18 column (2. 1 mm× 50 mm; 1. 7 μm), with a gradient elution of ammonium formate buffer pH 4. 0 and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 400 μl/min. Detection was performed on a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) equipped with an electrospray ionization interface. A simple protein precipitation procedure with acetonitrile was used for sample preparation. Thanks {{to the use of}} stable isotope-labeled internal standards for all analytes, internal standard-normalized matrix effects were in the range of 92 - 108 %. The method was fully validated to cover large concentration ranges of 0. 2 - 90 ng/ml for haloperidol, 0. 5 - 90 ng/ml for flupentixol, 1 - 450 ng/ml for levomepromazine, promazine and zuclopenthixol and 2 - 900 ng/ml for cis-chlorprothixene and <b>pipamperone.</b> Trueness (89. 1 - 114. 8 %), repeatability (1. 8 - 9. 9 %), intermediate precision (1. 9 - 16. 3 %) and accuracy profiles (< 30 %) were in accordance with the latest international recommendations.

40|$|Risperidone and its active {{metabolite}} 9 -OH-risperidone {{were compared}} to reference antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, <b>pipamperone,</b> fluspirilene, clozapine, zotepine) and compounds under development (olanzapine, seroquel, sertindole, ORG- 5222, ziprasidone) for in vitro binding to neurotransmitter receptors in brain tissue and on membranes of recombinant cells expressing cloned human receptors and for in vivo occupancy of neurotransmitter receptors in rat and guinea-pig brain following acute treatment (2 h., s. c.). An ex vivo autoradiography technique was applied to determine the receptor occupancy by the drugs administered in vivo. Of particular interest are the central 5 HT 2 A receptors and D 2 -type receptors. Predominant 5 HT 2 A receptor antagonism is supposed to add to an atypical profile of the antipsychotics (treatment of the negative symptoms, low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects). D 2 antagonism is required the treatment of positive symptoms. A contribution of the new dopamine receptor subtypes D 3 and in particular D 4 receptors has been proposed. In vitro, all compounds, except the 'typical' antipsychotics haloperidol and fluspirilene, showed higher affinity for 5 HT 2 A than for D 2 receptors. Subnanomolar affinity for human 5 HT 2 A receptors was observed for ORG- 5222, sertindole, risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone and ziprasidone. Fluspirilene, ORG- 5222, haloperidol, ziprasidone, risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone and zotepine displayed nanomolar affinity for human D 2 receptors. Sertindole and olanzapine were slightly less potent. <b>Pipamperone,</b> clozapine and seroquel showed 2 orders of magnitude lower D 2 affinity in vitro. Clozapine, but even more so <b>pipamperone,</b> displayed higher affinity for D 4 than for D 2 receptors. For most other compounds, D 4 affinity was only slightly lower than their D 2 affinity. Seroquel was totally devoid of D 4 affinity. None of the compounds had nanomolar affinity for D 1 receptors; their affinity for D 3 receptors was usually slightly lower than for D 2 receptors. In vivo, ORG- 5222, risperidone, <b>pipamperone,</b> 9 -OH-risperidone, sertindole, olanzapine, zotepine and clozapine maintained a higher potency for occupying 5 HT 2 A than D 2 receptors. Risperidone and ORG- 5222 had 5 HT 2 A versus D 2 potency ratio of about 20. Highest potency for 5 HT 2 A receptor occupancy was observed for ORG- 5222 followed by risperidone and olanzapine. Ziprasidone exclusively occupied 5 HT 2 A receptors. ORG- 5222, haloperidol, fluspirilene and olanzapine showed the highest potency for occupying D 2 receptors. No regional selectivity for D 2 receptor occupancy in mesolimbic versus nigrostriatal areas was detected {{for any of the}} test compounds. Risperidone was conspicuous because of its more gradual occupancy of D 2 receptors; none of the other compounds showed this property. The various compounds also displayed high to moderate occupancy of adrenergic alpha 1 receptors, except fluspirilene and ziprasidone. Clozapine, zotepine, ORG- 5222 and sertindole occupied even more alpha 1 than D 2 receptors. Clozapine showed predominant occupancy of H 1 receptors and occupied cholinergic receptors with equivalent potency to D 2 receptors. A stronger predominance of 5 HT 2 A versus D 2 receptor occupancy combined with a more gradual occupancy of D 2 receptors differentiates risperidone and its 9 -OH-metabolite from the other antipsychotic compounds in this study. The predominant 5 HT 2 A receptor occupancy probably plays a role in the beneficial action of risperidone on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas maintenance of a moderate occupancy of D 2 receptors seems adequate for treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. A combined 5 HT 2 A and D 2 occupancy and the avoidance of D 2 receptor overblockade are believed to reduce the risk for extrapyrastatus: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The 5 -HT(2 A) and 5 -HT(2 C) {{receptor}}s {{belong to}} the same subtype of the G-protein coupled receptor family and have several agonist and antagonist ligands in common. To gain more insight into the differences in the regulation of the two receptors, we studied the effect of agonist and antagonist pre-treatment on radioligand receptor binding and 5 -HT-induced inositol phosphate formation on rat 5 -HT(2 A) and rat 5 -HT(2 C) receptors stable expressed in NIH 3 T 3 cells. We compared short (15 min) and prolonged (48 h) pre-treatment of the cells with the natural agonist, 5 -HT and with the antagonist <b>pipamperone,</b> which can be readily washed out. The rat 5 -HT(2 C) receptor showed an agonist-induced down-regulation (decrease in B(max) of labelled agonist and antagonist binding) and desensitisation (decrease in 5 -HT-induced inositol phosphate formation and potency of 5 -HT). Antagonist pre-treatment induced an increase in rat 5 -HT(2 C) receptor-mediated inositol phosphate formation as well as increased agonist and antagonist radioligand binding. These findings are consistent with the classical model of G-protein coupled receptor regulation. In contrast, the rat 5 -HT(2 A) receptor expressed in the same host cell behaved differently, unlike the classical model. Pre-treatment with 5 -HT for 15 min and 48 h did not change receptor levels measured by radioligand binding, but the signal transduction response (inositol phosphate formation) was significantly reduced. Pre-treatment with the antagonist <b>pipamperone</b> for 15 min and 48 h caused an increase in antagonist radioligand binding but a reduction in agonist radioligand binding and a decrease in inositol phosphate formation and potency of 5 -HT. Hence, the rat 5 -HT(2 A) receptor apparently undergoes agonist desensitisation without down-regulation of the total receptor number. Antagonist pre-treatment causes a paradoxical desensitisation, possibly by uncoupling of the receptor from G-proteins. The uncoupled receptor does not bind 5 -HT in the nanomolar range but retains its antagonist binding properties. Paradoxical antagonist-induced desensitisation of rat 5 -HT(2 A) receptors has also been observed in vivo. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|When {{developing}} an LC-MS/MS-method matrix effects {{are a major}} issue. The effect of co-eluting compounds arising from the matrix can result in signal enhancement or suppression. During method development much attention should be paid to diminishing matrix effects as much as possible. The present work evaluates matrix effects from aqueous environmental samples in the simultaneous analysis {{of a group of}} 9 specific pharmaceuticals with HPLC-ESI/MS/MS and UPLC-ESI/MS/MS: flubendazole, propiconazole, <b>pipamperone,</b> cinnarizine, ketoconazole, miconazole, rabeprazole, itraconazole and domperidone. When HPLC-MS/MS is used, matrix effects are substantial and can not be compensated for with analogue internal standards. For different surface water samples different matrix effects are found. For accurate quantification the standard addition approach is necessary. Due to the better resolution and more narrow peaks in UPLC, analytes will co-elute less with interferences during ionisation, so matrix effects could be lower, or even eliminated. If matrix effects are eliminated with this technique, the standard addition method for quantification can be omitted and the overall method will be simplified. Results show that matrix effects are almost eliminated if internal standards (structural analogues) are used. Instead of the time-consuming and labour-intensive standard addition method, with UPLC the internal standardization can be used for quantification and the overall method is substantially simplified...|$|E
40|$|Background. Prescription of {{fragmented}} tablets {{is useful}} for individualisation of dose but includes several drawbacks. Although without score lines, the antipsychotic drug quetiapine was in 2011 the most often prescribed 1 / 2 tablet in discharge prescriptions at the University Hospital in Basel (USB, 671 beds). We aimed at analysing the prescription patterns of split tablets {{in general and of}} quetiapine in particular in Switzerland. Methods. All orders of community pharmacies for unit-of-use soft pouch blisters placed at Medifilm AG, the leader company in Switzerland for repackaging into pouch blisters, were analysed. Results. Out of 4, 784, 999 tablets that were repacked in 2012 in unit-of-use pouch blisters, 8. 5 % were fragmented, mostly in half (87. 6 %), and were predominantly psycholeptics (<b>pipamperone</b> 15. 8 %). Prescription of half quetiapine appears to be a Basel specificity (highest rates of fragments and half quetiapine). Conclusions. Prescription of fragmented tablet is frequent. It represents a safety issue for the patient, and a pharmaceutical care issue for the pharmacist. In ambulatory care, the patient’s cognitive and physical capacities must be clarified, suitability of the splitting of the tablet must be checked, appropriate aids must be offered, like a pill-splitting device in order to improve accuracy, and safe use of the drug must be ensured...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to validate an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method for the quantification of these antipsychotics in plasma. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay was developed for the determination of the drugs and metabolites. Gradient elution was performed on a reversed-phase column with a mobile phase consisting of ammonium acetate, formic acid in methanol or in Milli-Q ultrapure water at a flow rate of 0. 5 mL/min. The method was validated according to the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The analytes were found to be stable enough after reconstitution and injection of only 5 L improved the accuracy and precision in combination with the internal standard. Calibration curves of all five analytes were linear. All analytes were stable for at least 72 h in the autosampler and the high quality control of 9 -OH-risperidone was stable for 48 h. The method allows quantification of all analytes. The advantage of this method is the combination of a minimal injection volume, a short run-time, an easy sample preparation method and the ability to quantify all analytes in one run.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the use of antipsychotic drugs and hypoglycaemia requiring hospital admission in older diabetic patients. DESIGN: Nested case-control study. METHODS: In PHARMO Record Linkage System a cohort of 68. 314 patients over 65 years with diabetes was constructed. Cases were patients from the study cohort with a first hospitalization for hypoglycaemia. Up to five controls were selected. Exposure to antipsychotic drugs was the primary determinant of interest. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the strength of association between antipsychotic drug use and hypoglycaemia, taking into account potential confounders. RESULTS: 815 patients were admitted to hospital for hypoglycaemia. Current use of antipsychotic drugs was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia compared with non-use (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2. 27; 95 % confidence interval [CI 95] 1. 46 - 3. 54], especially in the first 30 days of treatment (adjusted OR 7. 61; CI 95 2. 49 - 23. 27).

40|$|Introduction: Kleefstra {{syndrome}} [OMIM: 610253] {{is caused}} by a 9 q 34. 3 micro-deletion or an intragenic mutation in the EHMT 1 gene. Its core phenotype comprises intellectual disability, childhood hypotonia and distinct dysmorphisms. The syndrome can be associated with congenital anomalies, epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmias and a typical sleep pattern. Starting from adult age, a regressive phenotype may develop. Objectives: Further delineation of the neuropsychiatric phenotype. Aims: Formulating a comprehensive treatment approach. Methods: Detailed examination of two patients with EHMT 1 mutation. Results: Patient 1, male aged 34 years, showed recurrent behavioral problems with aggression and self-injuries as well as obstipation. Elsewhere, a diagnosis of autism was established. Aged 24, he suffered from some epileptic seizures. Recently, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was diagnosed. Neither treatment with <b>pipamperone</b> and risperidone nor with valproate was effective for behavioral control. Array analysis and metabolic screening did not reveal abnormalities. Whole exome sequencing revealed an intragenic EHMT 1 mutation. Patient 2, female aged 53 years, was known with childhood epilepsy and developed gradual decline of general functioning with motor slowing from her third decade. In her thirties, a mood/anxiety disorder was suspected for which several antidepressants were given without any effect. Array analysis was normal. A pathogenic nucleotide deletion was identified resulting in a frame-shift in exon 21 of the EHMT 1 gene. In both patients marked apathy was observed (AES = 62 and 64, respectively). Conclusions: Apathy syndrome in Kleefstra syndrome should be differentiated from depression and autism. Apart from treatment with selected psychotropics, individually targeted contextual measures should always be implemented...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} risk of {{extrapyramidal}} syndromes (EPS) between patients using risperidone and those using low-potency conventional antipsychotic drugs (APDs) in outpatient clinical practice, {{as measured by the}} use of anticholinergic medication. We tried to replicate results from previous clinical trials that compared risperidone with high-potency APDs. Method: Data was obtained from the PHARMO database containing filled prescriptions of 450, 000 community-dwelling people in The Netherlands from 1986 to 1998. From the patients aged 15 - 54 years who had been newly treated with APDs, we defined mutually exclusive cohorts according to the APD first prescribed to a patient. APD exposure was followed until the first prescription of anticholinergic medication and was censored when APD prescribing was interrupted or switched. We estimated relative risks between risperidone and commonly used low-potency and high-potency APDs using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, gender, dose and other potential confounders. Results: In 4094 patients who had been newly prescribed antipsychotic drugs, the overall incidence rate of anticholinergic drug therapy was 556 per 1000 person-years, which was dose dependent. Prescribed doses of all antipsychotics were low. While, in accordance with previous trials, risperidone showed a lower risk of EPS than the high potency APDs such as haloperidol (RR 0. 26; 95 % CI 0. 10 - 0. 64), we did not observe a lower EPS rate than low-potency APDs (risperidone vs thioridazine RR 1. 73, 95 % CI 0. 49 - 6. 13; risperidone vs <b>pipamperone</b> RR 2. 50, 95 % CI 0. 78 - 8. 04).

40|$|Background: Older {{people are}} more {{susceptible}} to falls than younger people. Therefore, as the Dutch population ages, the total number of falls and costs associated with them will rise. The use of psychotropic drugs is associated with an increased risk of falling. To create tailored fall-prevention programmes, information on the magnitude of the association between fall incidents and specific psychotropic drugs or drug classes is needed. Objective: The goal {{of this study was to}} delineate the associations between fall incidents and specific psychotropic drugs or drug classes. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic patient records, medication records and fall incident reports were collected for 1415 residents receiving somatic or psychogeriatric care in 22 nursing homes in the eastern part of the Netherlands from May 2012 until March 2015. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we analysed the magnitude of the association between psychotropic drugs and the risk of falling for users and non-users of the psychotropic drugs or drug classes. Results: Antipsychotics (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1. 49; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 12 – 2. 00) and hypnotics and sedatives (aHR 1. 51; 95 % CI 1. 13 – 2. 02) increase the risk of falling. There was no difference between the risk incurred by typical and atypical antipsychotics. However, within these groups, there were differences between the most commonly prescribed drugs: haloperidol and quetiapine were seen to have an association with falls, whereas <b>pipamperone</b> and risperidone were not. Conclusions: The results suggest falls may be associated with individual drugs rather than drug classes. Within the drug classes, clear differences are evident between individual drugs. Future fall-prevention programmes should highlight the differential risks involved with the use of specific psychotropic drugs, and doctors should take the fall risk into account when choosing specific drugs...|$|E
40|$|Narcotic {{dependence}} {{was established}} by continuous intravenous infusion of gradually increasing doses of morphine. Several days at the terminal concentration of morphine (100 mg/kg/day) was allowed prior to withdrawal. Morphine withdrawal body shakes were reliably observed upon the termination of continuous morphine infusion. The administration of morphine, methadone or _fentanyl, potent narcotic drugs, reliably abolished the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes 8 hours after the termination of morphine infusion. The narcotic antagonist naloxone or pentazocine had no {{significant effect on the}} rate of occurrence of withdrawal body shakes; however, there was a slight trend towards an increase in the frequency of this withdrawal index. A wide variety of neuroleptics were investigated for their ability to reduce withdrawal. The order of potency for reduction of withdrawal body shakes on a mg/kg basis for those neuroleptics tested was spiperone, benperidol, butaclarriol, loxapine, oxiperomide, haloperidol, spiramide, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, pimozide and <b>pipamperone.</b> The dopaminergic agonists amphetamine, apomorphine and L-IX 3 ̆ePA were also found to dose dependently reduce withdrawal• body shakes. Azaperone, a butyrophenone possessing high alpha noradrenergic blocking potency, reduces withdrawal body shakes in a dose related manner, while the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine and the beta adrenergic blocker propronalol failed to reduce withdrawal shakes to any significant extent. Dose dependent decreases in morphine withdrawal body shakes were produced by clonidine and desmethylimipramine, adrenergic agonists. Reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine also reduced withdrawal shakes, but the effect was dose dependent for only reserpine. The serotoninergic agents fluoxetine, 5 -HTP and methysergide were without effect on the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes at the doses tested. A slight but non-significant increase in the rate of withdrawal shakes was observed after the administration of the anticholinergic drugs atropine, benztropine, dexetimide and scopolamine. Conversely, the cholinergic agonists physostigmine and pilocarpine, reduced withdrawal body shakes in a dose related fashion. Modification of gabaminergic system by the administration of bicuculline, depakene and picrotoxin had no significant effect. Chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and pentobarbital, sedativehypnotic agents, did not produce dose dependent effects on the occurrence of withdrawal shakes. However, the highest dose of each sedative hypnotic employed did reduce withdrawal body shakes. The exact mechanism by which neuroleptics reduce withdrawal is not known. Manipulation of each of the transmitters effect by neuroleptics indicates that dopamine and acetylcholine are involved in mediating the reduction in withdrawal body shakes. The fact that the antiwithdrawal activity of certain neuroleptics is reversed by the narcotic antagonist naloxone implicates opiate receptor mechanisms. However, not all neuroleptics were antagonized by naloxone, suggesting that neuroleptics may be working at more than one site to reduce withdrawal. Thus neuroleptics may be reducing withdrawal body shakes by several different mechanisms. The data gathered from these studies suggest a role for cholinergic, dopaminergic and narcotic mechanisms in the antiwithdrawal activity of neuroleptic drugs...|$|E

The analyses were carried out at the laboratory by a restricted number of experienced technicians with the kit Triage- 8 (Merck-Darmstadt). Positive results are easily identified by coloured bars on specific zones on the test cassette after a fast immunological reaction between urine and highly specific monoclonal antibodies. Of the 34000 patients having attended the emergency care during the year, 405 were screened: 290 were found positive (169 M and 121 F). The results were distributed as follows: 222 BZD, 80 MTD, 63 OPI, 53 BAR, 39 TCA, 59 THC, 18 AMP and 34 COC. Several drugs were often combined (up to 6 drugs). AMP was found preferentially for patients of less than 20 years, MTD, COC, THC, and TCA for patients between 20 and 60 years and BAR, OPI, and BZD in all the age classes but more frequently for patients from 20 to 60 years. For 87 patients, a request for screening blood by a HPLC/PDA method and urine by GC-MS was prescribed during the hours following the initial urinary screening. All the results were compared. They were concordant for 72 patients. In 6 cases, they were different but performed with a delay of more than 24 H. In nine cases one result was different {{but on the other}} hand, for some samples, there was a presence of other drugs non detectable by our urinary screening: 4 times BZD (once in presence of <b>pipamperone</b> in the blood), 2 times MTD (once with propoxyphene and once with prothipendyl in the blood), once AMP and 2 times THC in urine comparisons (once with clomethiazol in blood and urine). The HPLC-PDA and GC-MS methods gave results for drugs that do not react in our urinary screening system: some are enlisted in the Merck notices but others are not announced. A rapid detection of COC, OPI, THC and AMP in the urine is a tool appreciated by the clinicians particularly in front of an unconscious patient. The interpretation of the results must however be careful and cautious: a number of drugs frequently used are not detected by the screening test and this one does not bring information on the level of toxicity. It makes it possible to take the first therapeutic measures but blood screening by a reference method remains essential, particularly to confirm positive or negative unexpected results.

40|$|Background Antipsychotic {{agents are}} often used to treat neuropsychiatric {{symptoms}} (NPS) in dementia, although the literature is sceptical about their long-termuse for this indication. Their effectiveness is limited and there is concern about adverse effects, including higher mortality with long-term use. When behavioural strategies have failed and drug therapy is instituted, regular attempts to withdraw these drugs are recommended. Physicians, nurses and families of older people with dementia are often reluctant {{to try to stop}} antipsychotics, fearing deterioration of NPS. Strategies to reduce antipsychotic use have been proposed, but a systematic review of interventions aimed at withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia has not yet been performed. Objectives : To evaluate whether withdrawal of antipsychotic agents is successful in older people with dementia in community or nursing home settings, to list the different strategies for withdrawal of antipsychotic agents in older people with dementia and NPS, and to measure the effects of withdrawal of antipsychotic agents on behaviour. Search methods : ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, clinical trials registries and grey literature sources were searched on 23 November 2012. The search included the following terms: antipsychotic* or neuroleptic* or phenothiazines or butyrophenones or risperidone or olanzapine or haloperidol or prothipendyl or methotrimeprazine or clopenthixol or flupenthixol or clothiapine or metylperon or droperidol or <b>pipamperone</b> or benperidol or bromperidol or fluspirilene or pimozide or penfluridol or sulpiride or veralipride or levosulpiride or sultopride or aripiprazole or clozapine or quetiapine or thioridazine combined wither terms such as discontinu* or withdraw* or cessat* or reduce* or reducing or reduct* or taper* or stop*. ALOIS contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria : Randomised, placebo-controlled trials comparing an antipsychotic withdrawal strategy to continuation of antipsychotics in people with dementia. Data collection and analysis : Review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, rated their risk of bias and extracted data. Main results : We included nine trials with 606 randomised participants. Seven trials were conducted in nursing homes, one trial in an outpatient setting and one in both settings. In these trials, different types of antipsychotics prescribed at different doses were withdrawn. Both abrupt and gradual withdrawal schedules were used. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low regarding blinding and outcome reporting and unclear for randomisation procedures and recruitment of participants. There was a wide variety of outcome measures. Our primary efficacy outcomes were success of withdrawal (i. e. remaining in study off antipsychotics) and NPS. Eight of nine trials reported no overall significant difference between groups on the primary outcomes, although in one pilot study of people with psychosis and agitation that had responded to haloperidol, time to relapse was significantly shorter in the discontinuation group (Chi(2) = 4. 1, P value = 0. 04). The ninth trial included people with psychosis or agitation who had responded well to risperidone therapy for four to eight months and reported that discontinuation led to an increased risk of relapse, that is, increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -core score of 30 % or greater (P value = 0. 004, hazard ratio (HR) 1. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 09 to 3. 45 at four months). The only outcome that could be pooled was the full NPI-score, used in two studies. For this outcome {{there was no significant difference}} between people withdrawn from and those continuing on antipsychotics at three months (mean difference (MD) - 1. 49, 95 % CI - 5. 39 to 2. 40). These two studies reported subgroup analyses according to baseline NPI-score (14 or less versus > 14). In one study, those with milder symptoms at baseline were significantly less agitated at three months in the discontinuation group (NPI-agitation, Mann-Whitney U test z = 2. 4, P value = 0. 018). In both studies, there was evidence of significant behavioural deterioration in people with more severe baseline NPS who were withdrawn from antipsychotics (Chi(2) = 6. 8; P value = 0. 009 for the marked symptom score in one study). Individual studies did not report significant differences between groups on any other outcome except one trial that found a significant difference in a measure of verbal fluency, favouring discontinuation. Most trials lacked power to detect clinically important differences between groups. Adverse events were not systematically assessed. In one trial there was a non-significant increase in mortality in people who continued antipsychotic treatment (5 % to 8 % greater than placebo, depending on the population analysed, measured at 12 months). This trend became significant three years after randomisation, but due to dropout and uncertainty about the use of antipsychotics in this follow-up period this result should be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions : Our findings suggest that many older people with Alzheimer's dementia and NPS can be withdrawn from chronic antipsychotic medication without detrimental effects on their behaviour. It remains uncertain whether withdrawal is beneficial for cognition or psychomotor status, but the results of this review suggest that discontinuation programmes could be incorporated into routine practice. However, two studies of people whose agitation or psychosis had previously responded well to antipsychotic treatment found an increased risk of relapse or shorter time to relapse after discontinuation. Two other studies suggest that people with more severe NPS at baseline could benefit from continuing their antipsychotic medication. In these people, withdrawal might not be recommended...|$|E
