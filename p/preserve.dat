40|$|A “bundle endofunctor <b>preserving</b> proneness ” for a {{cartesian}} cate-gory C is an endofunctor T • of {{the arrow}} category C↓, the identity on codomains, that <b>preserves</b> {{the property of}} morphisms of being pullback squares. Such a T • is “slicewise strong”, restricting to a strong endofunc-tor T • on every slice C/B, and with that structure <b>preserved</b> by pullback between slices. In the other direction, a strong endofunctor T on C extends to a bundle endofunctor T • on C, which <b>preserves</b> proneness if T <b>preserves</b> coreflexive equalizers. If a bundle endofunctor T • <b>preserving</b> proneness also <b>preserves</b> core-flexive equalizers, then it is naturally isomorphic to the T • arising from T = T 1. Combining these, bundle endofunctors for C <b>preserving</b> proneness and coreflexive equalizers are equivalent to strong endofunctors on C <b>preserving</b> coreflexive equalizers; this latter structure is inherited by all slices and <b>preserved</b> by pullback between them. The results extend to situations where T • and T are monads. We propose that the structure of bundle endofunctor <b>preserving</b> prone-ness is a satisfactory categorical abstraction {{of the notion of}} geometric construction when C is the category Loc of locales. The powerlocales give rise to bundle monads on Loc <b>preserving</b> proneness and coreflexive equalizers; likewise for the covariant powerobject monad on any topos. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to <b>preserve</b> the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage.
