However, cashless payments have grown considerably in terms of instruments, avenues, transactions, and volumes.

5000|$|The {{scope of}} stamp duty {{has been reduced}} {{dramatically}} in recent years. Apart from transfers of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments and certain transactions involving partnerships, stamp duty was largely abolished in the UK from 1 December 2003. [...] "Stamp duty land tax" [...] (SDLT), a new transfer tax derived from stamp duty, was introduced for land transactions from 1 December 2003. [...] "Stamp duty reserve tax" [...] (SDRT) was introduced on agreements to transfer uncertificated shares and other securities in 1986, and {{with the growth of}} <b>paperless</b> <b>transactions</b> SDRT rather than stamp duty now applies to most transfers of shares and securities. Stamp duty land tax was replaced on transactions in Scotland by the new Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) from 1 April 2015.|$|R
40|$|Information Technology (IT) {{has been}} widely {{employed}} in supply chain operations, helping companies to respond to clients&# 039; needs in real time, facilitate <b>paperless</b> <b>transactions,</b> reach out to difficult-to-access markets, and outperform competitors. This paper presents a theory-driven, validated higher-order construct that measures e-supply chain capability, integrating typical procurement and order-taking functions within an organization&# 039;s supply chain. It {{is a response to}} a call in information systems literature to develop and assess multidimensional IT capabilities. Drawing on tenets from both resource based view and relational view, we developed a conceptual definition of e-supply chain capability. Using structural equation modeling techniques, we constructed a measurement model of e-supply chain capability encompassing four dimensions: communication with customers, order taking, procurement, and communication with suppliers. The new validated measurement model of e-supply chain capability offers opportunities to expand IS research in supply chain management...|$|R

40|$|Letters of Credit {{continue}} to be the most popular method of international payments in the trading community, but there is a push to convert traditional processes to the electronic age of <b>paperless</b> <b>transactions.</b> This paper discusses the new eUCP regulations (version 1. 0), which became effective on 1 April 2002. Touted as a revolution by some commentators, this set of rules is an electronic supplement to the established principles of the traditional Letter of Credit rules, which rely on paper-based flows of documents to satisfy the requirements of this instrument of payment. The eUCP provides some flexibility, but also some uncertainty about their operations, particularly on issues related to systems standards and certainty of electronic records integrity. In the discussion, comments will be made about the reservations and concerns traders and service providers may have about the operations of these new rules and whether they facilitate or complicate presentation of documents under this method of payment...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advances}} seem {{to introduce}} as many obstacles as improvements. For instance, {{people seem to}} spend more time reading and writing electronic mail than they ever did on regular mail. Likewise, VCR use is sufficiently formidable to have inspired a wealth of humor. And so it is with grading assignments that have been submitted electronically. Electronic submission of student assignments certainly provides many advantages for the faculty member and graders. For instance, electronic submissions are easier to manage and keep track of than their paper counterparts, particularly as the number of submissions gets large. Submissions can be time-stamped automatically and archived, thus minimizing the potential for disputes over lateness and lost assignments and/or grades. Furthermore, archives can help resolve issues involving academic dishonesty and/or plagiarism. Finally, <b>paperless</b> <b>transactions</b> are especially useful when the number of submissions is large and the assignments must be distributed to multiple locations (such as to teaching assistants, graders, and plagiarism detection software) ...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{they say}} is law. The truth of this {{assertion}} {{lies in the fact}} that evidence is central to every trial, civil or criminal and serves two major purposes therein. First, it decides what is or is not admissible in the trial for the purpose of proving or disproving facts in issue. Secondly, it determines how, if at all, the admissible fact may or must be presented to the court 3. Against this background, every jurisdiction tends to have a uniform code on the rules of evidence. In Nigeria for instance; such rules are codified in the Evidence Act 4. One of the cardinal codifications in this regard is the concept of document. This concept was originally conceived from the common law perspective which viewed documents as legible inscriptions or writings on substances 5. However, the advent of technological development, and the consequent evolution of <b>paperless</b> <b>transactions</b> have permeated every sphere of life including the legal world. We now live in an electronic age where everyday transactions are conducted on the platform of electronic devices. In the event of dispute, parties are bound to rely on electronic evidence. In view of this, the Evidence Act, 20116 provides for admissibility of electronic evidence. The focus of this work therefore is to examine the salient provisions of the Act relating to admissibility of electronic evidence. It will equally enquire into the effect of this technological innovation on the concept of document with emphasis on laying of proper foundation for admissibility. Our methodology will be largely analytical, critica...|$|R
40|$|While PKI {{has had its}} {{difficulties}} (like {{most new}} technologies) the unique value of public key authentication in <b>paperless</b> <b>transactions</b> is now widely acknowledged. The naïve early vision of a single all-purpose identity system {{has given way to}} a more sophisticated landscape of multiple PKIs, used not for managing identity per se, but rather more subtle memberships, credentials and so on. It is well known that PKI’s successes have mostly been in closed schemes. Until now, this fact was often regarded as a compromise; many held out hope that a bigger general purpose PKI would still eventuate. But I argue that the dominance of closed PKI over open is better understood as reflecting the reality of identity plurality, which independently is becoming the norm through the Laws of Identity and related frameworks. This paper introduces the term “Public Key Superstructure ” to describe a new approach to knitting together existing mature PKI components to improve the utility and strategic appeal of digital certificates. The “superstructure ” draws on useful precedents in the security printing industry for manufacturing specialized security goods without complicated or un-natural liabilities, and international accreditation arrangements for achieving cross-border recognition of certificates. The model rests on a crucial reimagining of certificates as standing for relationships rather than identities. This elegant re-interpretation of otherwise standard elements could truly be a paradigm shift for PKI, for it normalizes digital certificates, grounding them in familiar, even mundane management processes. It will bring profound yet easily realized benefits for liability, cost, interoperability, scalability, accreditation, and governance...|$|R

40|$|Money {{occupies}} a central position {{in both the}} disciplines of law and economics. From the legal point of view, money constitutes {{a vital part of}} the legal system. Ever since the advance from a barter economy, money has become a central instrumentality of legal transactions. Seeking a legal definition of the phenomenon of money is, therefore, an invaluable exercise for the discipline of law. However, as money is an economic phenomenon, seeking to ascertain the meaning of money for legal purposes cannot be comprehensively pursued without due regard to economics. This thesis sets out to show the importance of monetary and other economic factors in analysing and applying the law of money. In particular, this thesis sets out to identify the principal functions performed by money from the viewpoint of their relevance in comprehensively defining the phenomenon for legal purposes. It examines the legal meaning of money in the context of such developments as the use of advancing technology to transmit by electronic means rights to money at ever increasing speeds and amounts across the globe, floating exchange rate markets, the changing role of gold from its once unique position as the quintessential international monetary reserve, the development of "electronic cash", and the tracing of money through a series of <b>paperless</b> <b>transactions.</b> When examining these developments, there is a focus on how legal analysis might be assisted by identifying the role performed by money in specific sets of circumstances. While attention is given to international monetary units, such as the Special Drawing Right and the European Currency Unit where relevant throughout the thesis, the development of the Euro as the currency of the European Union in the twenty-first century is not specifically addressed. This is an on-going and developing process, raising specific issues such as natural currency areas within the European Union necessarily outside the ambit of this thesis, which focuses on the law of money proceeding from an Australian viewpoint to more general materials especially in the English-speaking world. However, this thesis does draw from the non-English-speaking world for materials and examples that may well be of universal significance, and have unique ramifications, in the process of determining the meaning of money for legal purposes. While focussing on the future, the thesis carefully considers the past from the point of view of determining the extent to which the existing law is able to deal with what appear as entirely new phenomena, associated with technological advancement and apparent rapid globalisation.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{agricultural}} trade has direct {{implications for the}} Asia-Pacific region. Agricultural supply chains employ millions of people {{and there is a}} growing need for food commodities and high-value food products. The Asia-Pacific region is both a major consumer and producer of agricultural products. Its growth in both imports and exports is accelerating, but not to the potential. There is significant opportunity in this region to expand agro-trade especially due to population growth, dietary change of consumers and trade of high-value products. A number of constraints act as barriers to realizing the trade potential of the Asia-Pacific region: cumbersome trade procedures, inadequate compliance to product standards, poor trade logistics and lack of financing for agricultural trade. The status of least developed and landlocked developing countries are worse in many of these categories. Some Asia-Pacific countries have adopted effective measures to deal with their national bottlenecks, mostly based on simplifying procedures, introducing <b>paperless</b> trade <b>transactions,</b> improving quality infrastructure and introducing innovative financing mechanisms. Still, many countries in this region lag behind in facilitating agricultural trade and will need to adopt similar measures.
