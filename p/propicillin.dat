40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to test the antibiotic (1 -phenoxypropyl) penicillin (<b>propicillin)</b> against a complex microflora of periodontal bacteria. This was accomplished by using a continuously growing mixed culture that was obtained by enrichment of periodontal plaque in human serum. Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella intermedia, Lactobacillus, catenaforme, and Streptococcus species were dominant members of the enrichment culture. None of the strains isolated from the enrichment culture exhibited detectable beta-lactamase activity. MICs of <b>propicillin</b> for the organisms ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 2 mg/liter. <b>Propicillin</b> {{was added to the}} cultures in single doses that were repeated once or twice at 24 -h intervals, that is, after 2. 4 volume changes of the culture vessel. Analyses done 24 h after the last addition of <b>propicillin</b> revealed that total cell counts of the culture were hardly affected by 1 mg of <b>propicillin</b> per liter, although some changes in the microbial composition occurred. The relative insusceptibility of the culture might be explained by the low growth rate. Higher concentrations (5, 10, and 50 mg/liter) of the antibiotic caused 10 - to 20 -fold drops in total cell counts. In these cultures P. intermedia was selectively suppressed to below the detection level, whereas other organisms that were equally susceptible to <b>propicillin</b> were less affected. It was concluded that mixed continuous cultures are a useful tool for studying the effects of antibiotics against the periodontal microbiota...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen methicillin-resistant {{strains of}} Staphylococcus aureus {{obtained}} from Europe {{were found to}} be sensitive to the lytic activity of lysotaphin. With only minor exceptions, the strains {{were found to be}} sensitive to novobiocin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, and lincomycin, and slightly less sensitive to vancomycin and chloramphenicol. All strains were resistant to tetracycline, penicillinase-sensitive penicillins (benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and <b>propicillin),</b> penicillinase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, nafcillin, ancillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin), and two cephalosporin antibiotics (cephalothin and cephaloridine) ...|$|E
40|$|The β-lactamase {{specified}} by an Rte 16 plasmid in Bordetella bronchiseptica was purified 200 -fold by carboxymethyl-Sephadex column chromatography and electrofocusing. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 46, 000 ± 3, 000 and an isoelectric point of 8. 3 and was highly active against phenethicillin, oxacillin, and <b>propicillin.</b> The enzyme activity was inhibited by sodium chloride {{but not by}} ferrous ion. The maximal enzyme activity to benzylpenicillin was observed at pH 7. 0 to 7. 5 and at 40 C. It is concluded that this enzyme {{is different from the}} R-mediated β-lactamases, i. e., the type I and type II β-lactamases which have been classified in previous papers...|$|E
40|$|Using 20 {{clinical}} isolates of S. aureus (all bacteriophage 80 / 81 type), {{we found}} that lysostaphin inhibits the growth of all cultures at concentrations significantly lower than those observed with any of eight penicillins, a penicillin-like compound (cephalothin), or fusidic acid (a steroid antibiotic). All test cultures were shown to be resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, and <b>propicillin.</b> Of the remaining penicillins (all penicillinase-insensitive), oxacillin, nafcillin, cloxacillin, and cephalothin were approximately equal in antimicrobial activity. Ancillin was slightly less active, and methicillin was even lower in potency. Cultures varied more widely in susceptibility to fusidic acid. None of the clinical isolates tested {{was found to be}} resistant to lysostaphin...|$|E
40|$|Simple, {{rapid and}} {{selective}} HPLC {{methods have been}} developed for the analysis of amoxycillin, ampicillin, epicillin, mecillinam and <b>propicillin.</b> A Hypersil ODS 5 mu m (150 x 4. 6 mm I. D.) column was used with mobile phases containing aqueous phosphate buffers, pH 3 - 4. 6 and either methanol or acetonitrile as the organic modifier. Samples were detected by their optimal UV absorption (210 - 230 nm). The lower limits of quantitation of the compounds !(100 mu l injection volume) were 0. 1 mu g/ml. The assays were linear in the range of 0. 1 - 100 mu g/ml with r(2) values greater than 0. 99. The methods have been applied successfully for the measurement of the Aux of the compounds across Caco- 2 cells monolayers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|The {{insensitivity}} of Gram-negative bacteria towards different penicillins {{has been}} {{correlated with the}} inactivation of these compounds by the penicillinases produced by these bacteria. Penicillins such as phenethi-cillin, <b>propicillin,</b> methicillin, and cloxacillin were relatively inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, but resistance was not accompanied by inactivation of these compounds. With ampicillin and benzylpenicillin, however, bacterial resistance was associated with destruction of the penicillins. Ampicillin was more stable to the penicillinases produced by certain Gram-negative bacteria than was benzylpenicillin and was corre-spondingly more active against these organisms. Gram-negative bacteria which produced little or no penicillinase were two to four times more sensitive to ampicillin than to benzylpenicillin, but ampicillin was a t least ten times more active than benzylpenicillin against several penicillinase-producing coliform organisms. All strains of bacteria which were resistant to both ampicillin and benzylpenicillin were capable of inactivating both compounds, but the insensitivity of these bacteria was not necessarily due solely to penicillinase production. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and certain strains of Escherichia coli and Protew mirabilis were able to grow in high concentrations of these antibiotics, whereas with the strains of Aerobacter aerogernes, Protew morgartii and Proteus vulgaris examined, the resistance appeared to be due solely to inactivation of the penicillins...|$|E
