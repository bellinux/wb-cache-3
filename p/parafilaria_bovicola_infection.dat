40|$|The {{possible}} {{adverse effect}} of arsenical tick control dips on <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> <b>infections</b> {{was investigated in}} 48 artificially infected cattle. A treatment group of 24 cattle was dipped in a plunge dip containing 1600 ppm arsenic trioxide. A control group {{of the same size}} was dipped in an organophosphate dip containing a mixture of chlorfenvinphos and dioxathion. Regular weekly to 3 -weekly dipping had no effect initially on the prevalence of ovipositional blood spots of P. bovicola in either group. However, from 4 months after bleeding commenced there was a significant reduction in blood spots in the arsenic-dipped cattle and, on slaughter at 12 - 14 months after infection, the arsenic group had significantly fewer live worms and fewer carcass lesions. Arsenic residues in muscle samples of treated cattle were 11, 6 times higher than in the controls. It is proposed that arsenic residues in the sub-cutaneous muscle layers increase with repeated dipping until a level toxic to P. bovicola is finally reached. Older cattle would therefore be refractory to infection and their carcasses at slaughter would not be affected. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|Parafilariosis is a vector borne {{parasitic}} disease {{caused by the}} development of the nematode <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> in the subcutaneous and intermuscular connective tissues of cattle. On February 28 th 2012, the so-called bleeding spots were observed in two heifers and one bull in a cattle herd close to Namur (Belgium). The animals had been treated in December with an injectable ivermectin/closantel solution (Closamectin pour on®, Norbrook Lab) at the recommended dosage. Samples of serohaemorrhagic exudate and blood as well as skin biopsies were collected. Embryonated eggs of <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> in the serohaemorrhagic exudate and high levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were detected. Clinically affected animals were treated with injectable ivermectin (Ivomec®, Merial) at 200 µg/kg. Two epidemiological phone surveys were carried out in the south of Belgium (Wallonia) in order to estimate the geographical distribution of this condition since it was first described and published in 2009. A standardized questionnaire was used and the results were analysed. Most outbreaks were recorded in the provinces of Liege and Luxembourg. The initial source of infection is still unknown but this parasitic infection is clearly spreading from the initial Belgian outbreak site. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{observation}} {{of the first two}} outbreaks of bovine parafilariosis in Belgium led to a preliminary epidemiological investigation conducted through a telephone survey among veterinarians in a limited area around the outbreaks. Typical clinical signs consisting of bleeding spots and areas of oedema were recorded, and the aetiology was confirmed through the {{observation of}} typical embryonated eggs of <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> in the exudate. The localisation of the lesions on the withers, neck, back and, to a smaller extent, the rump of the animals, and their first appearance in early spring, were additional useful epidemiological observations. The clinical herd prevalence in the area was 14. 1 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 11. 3 to 17. 2 per cent), suggesting that bovine parafilariosis is established in the area.

2500|$|Irritation {{is caused}} by large numbers of Musca house-flies, through to severe biting stress from dense populations of Stomoxys or Haematobia flies. Musca house-flies, face-flies, and similar types {{transmit}} a variety of bacteria involved in mastitis of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye {{is caused by}} Moraxella bovis bacteria transmitted by Musca autumnalis face-flies. The feeding of various Musca species of fly permits the contaminative transmission of nematode worms, for example <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola,</b> causing a nodular filariasis in cattle. Stomoxys species transmit several species of Trypanosoma protozoa to cattle, sheep and goats causing various types of trypanosomiasis. [...] Haematobia horn-flies transmit nematode worms in the genus Stephanofilaria to the skin of cattle, causing stephanofilariasis, a suppurating dermatitis known as hump sore. Stomoxys flies transmit the bacterium Eperythrozoon ovis to sheep and this infection may lead to fever and anemia.|$|R
40|$|More lesions {{were found}} in the carcass of an animal that has been {{naturally}} infested with <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> than in one artificially infested with a single subcutaneous injection of infective larvae of this species. This may be because natural infestations are either more frequent or more successful. Similarities in the distribution of lesions in naturally and experimentally infested animals suggest that certain predilection sites may be used by the intermediate fly hosts. Subcutaneous areas infiltrated with eosinophils are more conspicuous during the first 20 days after infestation and during the patent phase of the life cycle of P. bovicola. Yellowish discolorations caused by oedema are usually present in all lesions. When these are combined with eosinophil infiltrations, the lesions become yellowish-green. After the appearance of bleeding spots the green colour of lesions is dominated by the appearance of a brown pigment (haemosiderin) in numerous macrophages. The histopathological changes in the dermis, subcutis and superficial muscles bordering the affected areas are described. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|The filaricidal {{effects of}} trichlorphon, arsenic trioxide, sodium {{antimony}} biscathecol disulphonate and nitroxynil against <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> were {{the subject of}} this investigation. Levamisole hydrochloride was retested in a separate trial to assess the time required for healing after successful treatment. A comparison of carcass lesions and the percentage of lesion area in untreated controls with those in treated animals reconfirmed the efficacy of levamisole hydrochloride, while nitroxynil gave more promising results. Both lesions and lesion area were reduced by 76 % by the former and by 93 % by the latter compound. The other drugs only slightly suppressed P. bovicola activity. After treatment with levamisole hydrochloride, active lesions were still present for 1 - 4 weeks and visible lesions on slaughter for 8 weeks. Since the visible lesions during the 8 weeks varied from acute to chronic and as they disappeared 9 weeks post treatment, it is suggested that provision should be made for a healing period of at least 9 weeks.

40|$|Ivermectin {{treatment}} of all cattle on a badly infected farm failed {{to interrupt the}} transmission of P. bovicola, even though ovipositional blood spots were drastically reduced in numbers for an entire summer season following treatment. Regular weekly to fortnightly dipping of all cattle in 50 ppm deltamethrin immediately reduced vector fly numbers to less than 1 fly per cow face. Sustained dipping for 9 months effectively reduced P. bovicola transmission from approximately 50 % to less than 2 %. However, cessation of fly control led to a return to predipping P. <b>bovicola</b> <b>infection</b> levels. Ovipositional blood spot counts and the ELISA technique for evaluating P. <b>bovicola</b> <b>infection</b> in a herd were compared and were both effective methods. Best results for the blood spot method, however, are obtained in spring {{at the peak of}} the bleeding season whereas the ELISA method does not have this limitation.

40|$|Parafilariosis {{was first}} {{described}} in South Africa in 1964, thereafter being discovered at numerous localities in the country. When {{it became obvious}} that <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola,</b> for which no treatment was known, caused considerable economic losses, trials involving a series of compounds were conducted to identify candidate remedies. This paper describes an anthelmintic test for evaluating the efficacy of compounds for registration for field use. Recovery of Parafilaria worms is impractical for anthelmintic testing, and consequently the lesion sizes of treated and control groups of cattle are compared statistically, using appropriate statistical tests. The seasonal incidence of mature worm infection in cattle in South Africa is such that trials should commence after June and be completed before the end of January, allowing a lapse of 70 days between treatment and slaughter for resolution of the lesions. The presently available parafilaricidal compounds while of value for treating slaughter stock, when used alone will probably not be effective for control of infection in the field.

40|$|In {{controlled}} {{experiments in}} an insect-free stable, cattle became infected with <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> when Musca lusoria, {{infected with the}} larvae of this worm, were allowed to feed on a fresh skin incision, and when infective larvae were placed on fresh skin incisions, injected subcutaneously or into the jugular vein, or instilled into the eyes. The sites of blood spots caused by ovipositing P. bovicola females and the sites of carcass lesions were seldom close {{to the site of}} infection, an indication that the worms had migrated. The prepatent period of P. bovicola in 4 cattle which developed blood spots ranged from 242 - 319 days. Neither of the infected cattle that were kept continuously in a shady stable showed blood spots, but 4 out of 7 infected cattle which spent some time in the sun bled. However, carcass lesions on shaded cattle were similar in appearance to those on cattle kept outdoors. Infective larvae were stimulated to escape from the mouth-parts of infected M. lusoria and Musca xanthomelas s. s. when these were fed citrated ox blood warmed to 38 - 40 °C. No escape took place when the flies were fed warmed saline or warmed 15 % sucrose solution. This article has been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|The filarial worm <b>Parafilaria</b> <b>bovicola</b> causes {{streaks of}} blood on the skins of live cattle and slimy bruise-like lesions on the {{subcutaneous}} surfaces of their carcases. To determine the vectors of this worm a field survey was conducted in November 1972 and during the summer of 1973 / 74 on 6 farms in the Transvaal. A total of 10 093 flies was collected off cattle and examined for the infective 3 rd stage Parafilaria larvae. Of the 12 fly species collected, Muscalusoria, Musca domesrica, Musca xanthomelas, Musca n. sp., Musca sorbens and Musca fasciata were the commonest. Third stage larvae were found in 3 species all belonging to the subgenus Eumusca, viz. M. fusaria, M. xanthomelas and a new Musca species. The infection rate in these flies was usually less than 1 % and most of the worms were recovered from the heads of female flies. The same 3 species were successfully infected artificially in the laboratory, the infection rate ranging from 40, 0 %- 53, 8 %. The measurements of larvae from these flies agreed closely with those of larvae recovered from field-collected flies. Female P. bovicola worms perforate the skin of cattle and deposit their eggs and/or microfilariae into the blood which trickles down from the holes. Most of these bleeding marks were noticed between July and December 1973. As 3 rd stage larvae were recovered from flies from August 1973 to February 1974 the main period for transmission is likely to be between July and February. Since the 3 flies suspected of being vectors feed mainly on eye secretions it is believed that most transmission takes place via the orbital route. Thereafter development of the worms in cattle to the adult stage will take approximately 7 - 10 months. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.
