5000|$|<b>Phenampromide</b> is an opioid {{analgesic}} from the ampromide family of drugs, related to other {{drugs such as}} propiram and diampromide. It was invented in the 1960s by American Cyanamid Co. Although never given a general release, it was trialled and 50mg codeine â‰ˆ 60mg <b>phenampromide.</b> Tests on the 2 isomers showed {{that all of the}} analgesic effects were caused by the (S) isomer. In the book [...] a 4-benzyl group added to the piperidine-ring produces a drug some x60 morphine. When overlaid with the most potent isomer of 3-methylfentanyl, the 2 compounds overlay perfectly. This is of academic interest only since the synthetic complexity is beyond clandestine drug manufacturers.|$|E
