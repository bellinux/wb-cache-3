40|$|Abstract. Structural {{equation}} modeling (SEM) with ordinal indicators rely on {{an assumption}} of categorized normality. This assumption may {{be tested for}} pairs of variables using the likelihood ratio G 2 or Pearson’s X 2 statistics. For increased computational efficiency, SEM programs usually estimate <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlations</b> in two stages. However, two-stage polychoric estimates are not asymptotically efficient and G 2 and X 2 need not be asymptotically chi-square when the estimator is not efficient. Recently, Maydeu-Olivares and Joe (2005) have introduced a new statistic, Mn, that is asymptotically chi-square even for estimators that are not efficient. We investigate the behavior of G 2, X 2, and Mn when testing underlying bivariate normality with <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlations</b> estimated in two stages...|$|R

40|$|Ordinal {{variables}} {{are common in}} many empirical investigations {{in the social and}} behavioral sciences. Researchers often apply the maximum likelihood method to fit structural equation models to ordinal data. This assumes that the observed measures have normal distributions, which is not the case when the {{variables are}} ordinal. A better approach is to use <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlations</b> and fit the models using methods such as unweighted least squares (ULS), maximum likelihood (ML), weighted least squares (WLS), or diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS). In this simulation evaluation we study the behavior of these methods in combination with <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlations</b> when the models are misspecified. We also study the effect of model size and number of categories on the parameter estimates, their standard errors, and the common chi-square measures of fit when the models are both correct and misspecified. When used routinely, these methods give consistent parameter estimates but ULS, ML, and DWLS give incorrect standard errors. Correct standard errors can be obtained for these methods by robustification using an estimate of the asymptotic covariance matrix W of the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlations.</b> When used in this way the methods are here called RULS, RML, and RDWLS.

5000|$|The {{response}} variable may be non-continuous ("limited" [...] {{to lie on}} some subset of the real line). For binary (zero or one) variables, if analysis proceeds with least-squares linear regression, the model is called the linear probability model. Nonlinear models for binary dependent variables include the probit and logit model. The multivariate probit model is a standard method of estimating a joint relationship between several binary dependent variables and some independent variables. For categorical variables with more than two values there is the multinomial logit. For ordinal variables with more than two values, there are the ordered logit and ordered probit models. Censored regression models may be used when the dependent variable is only sometimes observed, and Heckman correction type models may be used when the sample is not randomly selected from the population of interest. An alternative to such procedures is linear regression based on <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> (or polyserial correlations) between the categorical variables. Such procedures differ in the assumptions made about {{the distribution of the}} variables in the population. If the variable is positive with low values and represents the repetition of the occurrence of an event, then count models like the Poisson regression or the negative binomial model may be used instead.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} measures of association for ordinal variables from a theoretical perspective. In particular, we study the phi-coefficient, the tetrachoric correlation coefficient and the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient. We also {{introduce a new}} measure of association for ordinal variables, the empirical <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient, which has better theoretical properties than the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient, including greatly enhanced robustness. In the first article, entitled ``On {{the relation between the}} phi-coefficient and the tetrachoric correlation coefficient'', we show that under given marginal probabilities there exists a continuous bijection between the two measures of association. Furthermore, we show that the bijection has a fixed point at zero for all marginal probabilities. Consequently, the choice of which of these measures of association to use is for all practical purposes a matter of preference only. In the second article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the tetrachoric correlation coefficient'', we generalize the tetrachoric correlation coefficient so that a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions can be assumed as underlying distributions. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the generalized tetrachoric correlation coefficient to be well defined for a given parametric family of bivariate distributions. With examples, we illustrate the effects on the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient of different distributional assumptions. In the third article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient'', we generalize the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient to a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions, and show that the generalized and the conventional <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficients agree on the family of bivariate normal distributions. With examples, we illustrate the effects of different distributional assumptions on the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient. In combination with goodness-of-fit p-values, the association analysis can be enriched with a consideration of possible tail dependence. In the fourth article, we propose a new measure of association for ordinal variables, named the empirical <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient. The empirical <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient relaxes the fundamental assumption of the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient so that an underlying joint distribution is only assumed to exist, not to be of a particular parametric family. We also provide an asymptotical result, by which the empirical <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient converges almost surely to the true <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> under very general conditions. Thus, the proposed empirical <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient has better theoretical properties than the <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient...|$|E

40|$|Confirmatory factor {{analysis}} (CFA) {{is widely used}} for examining hypothesized relations among ordinal variables (e. g., Likert-type items). A theoretically appropriate method fits the CFA model to <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlations</b> using either weighted least squares (WLS) or robust WLS. Importantly, this approach assumes that a continuous, normal latent process determines each observed variable. The extent to which violations of this assumption undermine CFA estimation is not well-known. In this article, the authors empirically study this issue using a computer simulation study. The results suggest that estimation of <b>polychoric</b> <b>correlations</b> is robust to modest violations of underlying normality. Further, WLS performed adequately only at the largest sample size but led to substantial estimation difficulties with smaller samples. Finally, robust WLS performed well across all conditions.

Thus, measuring the association between ordinal variables means estimating the product moment correlation between the underlying normal variables (Olsonn, 1979).
