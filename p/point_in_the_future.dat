Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E

5|$|At some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> IK Pegasi A will {{consume the}} {{hydrogen}} fuel {{at its core}} and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands {{to the point where}} its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in the forecast process at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E

5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo a {{supernova}} at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was certainly {{in the final stages of}} its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E

50|$|In large rivers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Northwest of the United States, it {{has been}} shown there is a {{lifecycle}} of tree growth and river migration, with large trees falling into the channel as banks erode, then staying in place and acting as focal points for log jam formation.

When the null geodesics intersect, they are no longer on the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> they are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior of <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> So, if all the null geodesics collide, there is no boundary to <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|R
40|$|Individuals plan {{consumption}} and production for different <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> using interest rates of various maturities as a guide. How-ever, individuals {{do not always}} pre-contract all planned future borrowing and lending, and the intermediaries they work through often do not match the maturity structure of their assets and liabilities. As {{a result of this}} individual failure to hedge and institutional "misintermediation", aggregate production and consumption plans for each period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> need not coincide. The resulting discrepancy will eventually appear as a recession or boom, involving an unanticipated change in interest rates. Fiscal stimulus aggravates the welfare loss associated with a recession, whether the spending is consumption-displacing or wholly wasteful. ...|$|R
