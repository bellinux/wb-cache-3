In the first project, we developed the Ru-catalyzed C 2 -H arylation of N-(2 -pyrimidyl) indoles and pyrroles with nucleophilic arylboronic acids under oxidative conditions. Wide variety of arylboronic acids afforded the desired product in excellent yield regardless of the substituents or functional group electronic nature. Electron-rich heteroarenes are well suited for this method than electron-poor heteroarenes. Halides such as bromide and iodide also survived, further derivatisation of the halide is shown by Heck alkenylation. In order to find catalytic on-cycle intermediate extensive mechanistic experiments {{have been carried out}} by preparing presumed ruthenacyclic complexes and C-H/D exchange reactions. It suggested that <b>para-cymene</b> ligand is not present in the catalytic on-cycle intermediate and we suspect that metalation occurs with electrophilic ruthenium center via SEAr mechanism. In the second project, we developed the Ru-catalyzed silylation of gramine, tryptamine and their congeners using silanes as coupling partner. The transformation worked well with many different silanes. Regarding directing group, nitrogen atom containing directing groups are more favoured than the oxygen containing directing groups. Wide range of gramines and tryptamines also yielded the desired product in poor to excellent yield. At higher temperature, albeit in low yield, undirected silylation occurred. In order to get some insights about the reaction pathway of the silylation C-H/D exchange experiments were performed, and it revealed the possibility of C 4 -H activation of gramines by an electron rich metal- Si-H/D experiments showed Si-H activation by Ru is easy.

The TOF decreased with variation in the N,N' chelating ligand in the order TfEn > TsEn > MsEn for a given arene. [(bn) Ru(TfEn) Cl] (12) was the most active, with a TOP of 10. 4 h(- 1). The effects of NAD(+) and formate concentration on the reaction rates were determined for [(p-cym) Ru(TsEn) Cl] (2). Isotope studies implicated the formation of [(arene) Ru(N,N') (H) ] as the rate-limiting step. The coordination of formate and subsequent CO 2 elimination to generate the hydride were modeled computationally by density functional theory (DFT). CO 2 elimination occurs via a two-step process with the coordinated formate first twisting to present its hydrogen toward the metal center. The computed barriers for CO 2 release for arene = benzene follow the order MsEn > TsEn > TfEn, and for the Ms En system the barrier followed bn < hmb, both consistent with the observed rates. The effect of methanol on transfer hydrogenation rates in aqueous solution was investigated. A study of pH dependence of the reaction in D 2 O gave the optimum pH* as 7. 2 with a TOF of 1. 58 h(- 1) for 2. The series of compounds reported here show an improvement in the catalytic activity by an order of magnitude compared to the ethylenediamine analogues...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{compositions}} {{of essential}} oils obtained in laboratory from ten sampling location and collective essential oil obtained using industrial process {{was established by}} GC, GC/MS and compared. No significant difference was reported between the various samples. 39 components were identified representing 99. 0 % of the total amount. The major components were -pinene (44. 8 ± 2. 3 %) and 1, 8 -cineol (26. 1 ± 1, 6 %). The essential oils was characterized by 15 monoterpene hydrocarbons (60. 3 ± 4. 8 %), 10 oxygenated monoterpenes (34. 3 ± 4. 3 %), 9 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (2. 7 ± 0. 3 %), 2 oxygenated sesquiterpenes (0. 4 ± 0. 1 %) and three other compounds (1. 0 ± 0. 2 %) for the ten sites of sampling. A large part of these volatile components were also detected after extraction by HS-SPME. The major components of the HS-SPME volatile fractions obtained were always -pinene (44. 9 ± 2. 3 %) and 1, 8 -cineol (26. 1 ± 1. 6 %). Moreover, no chemical variability in the volatile fractions of Myrtus communis berries was observed using HS/SPME. The volatile compositions of two commercial alcoholic beverages (myrtle liqueur and eau-de-vie) from Corsica were carried out using HS/SPME, GC and GC/MS. The volatile composition was characterized by 21 components from liquor and 18 compounds from eau-de-vie. The two alcoholic beverages were characterized by the high amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes. The major components obtained from berries and alcoholic extracts were always -pinene (31. 9 - 60. 0 %), 1, 8 -cineole (13. 5 - 29. 0 %), limonene (2. 9 - 5. 6 %) and <b>para-cymene</b> (3. 0 - 9. 0 %); except for eau-de-vie witch exhibited a relative high content of (E) --caryophyllene (4. 2 %). HS-SPME is simple, rapid, clean and environmentally friendly approach for {{the determination of the}} volatile compositions of commercial alcoholic beverages...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Raspberries {{have been}} popular {{since the time}} of the ancient Greeks. Red {{raspberries}} are cultivated throughout the world, particularly in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) causes significant reduction in yield and crumbly fruit in raspberries, blackberries and raspberry-blackberry hybrids. There is no effective treatment once a plant is infected and the only effective prevention is using resistant varieties. Resistance is difficult to attain using traditional cultivation techniques. Through transgenic modification, five lines of resistant red raspberries have been developed from the 'Meeker' cultivar. To investigate trueness to type, flavor characteristics for raspberries grown in Oregon and Washington during 2004 and 2005 were compared. Aroma volatiles important to the raspberry aroma profile were quantified, as well as the sugar and organic acid profiles, to compare the five transgenic 'Meeker' lines with the wild type 'Meeker', 'Chilliwack', 'Tulameen', 'Willamette' and 'Yellow Meeker'. Thirty aroma compounds ((Z) - 3 -hexenol, 4 -isopropylbenzyl alcohol, 6 - methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -ol, 2 -nonanol, hexanal, (E) - 2 -hexenal, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl nonanoate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, raspberry ketone, zingerone, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone, <b>para-cymene,</b> geraniol, α-ionone, β-ionone, limonene, linalool, myrcene, nerol, α-phellandrene, α-pinene, sabinene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, α-terpineol, terpinen- 4 -ol and terpinolene) were selected and quantified using stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) paired with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in all raspberry samples. The chiral stereoisomers of some volatile compounds in these raspberries were also studied using a cyclosilB GC column. Different raspberry cultivars varied widely in titratable acidity, sugar and acid concentration, and volatile composition, particularly α-ionone, linalool and (Z) - 3 -hexenol. Chiral compositions were also quite different among the cultivars studied. For the wild type 'Meeker' and RBDV-resistant varieties, flavor variations were observed from sites to sites and year to year. However, overall volatile profile had much less variations compared with sugar and organic acid profiles. None of the analyses separated the transgenic 'Meeker' raspberries from the wild type 'Meeker', and result was consistent for both of the locations and years studied. The results suggested that the transgenic RBDV-resistant 'Meeker' varieties were not different from the wild type 'Meeker' raspberry...|$|E

Complexes in which N,N′ is 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen), 1, 10 -phenanthroline- 5, 6 -dione or 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (bathophen) were studied for comparison. The RuII arene complexes undergo ligand-exchange reactions {{in aqueous solution}} at 310 K; their half-lives for hydrolysis range from 14 to 715 min. Density functional theory calculations on [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(bpm) Cl][PF 6], [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(bpm) Br][PF 6], [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(bpm) I][PF 6], [(η 6 -bip) Ru(bpm) Cl][PF 6], [(η 6 -bip) Ru(bpm) Br][PF 6] and [(η 6 -bip) Ru(bpm) I][PF 6] suggest that aquation occurs via an associative pathway and that the reaction is thermodynamically favourable when the leaving ligand is I > Br ≈ Cl. pK a* values for the aqua adducts of the complexes range from 6. 9 to 7. 32. A binding preference for 9 -ethylguanine (9 -EtG) compared with 9 -ethyladenine (9 -EtA) was observed for [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(bpm) Cl][PF 6], [(η 6 -hmb) Ru(bpm) Cl]+, [(η 6 -ind) Ru(bpm) Cl]+, [(η 6 -thn) Ru(bpm) Cl]+, [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(phen) Cl]+ and [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(bathophen) Cl]+ in aqueous solution at 310 K. The X-ray crystal structure of the guanine complex [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(bpm) (9 -EtG-N 7) ][PF 6] 2 shows multiple hydrogen bonding. Density functional theory calculations show that the 9 -EtG adducts of all complexes are thermodynamically preferred {{compared with those of}} 9 -EtA. However, the bmp complexes are inactive towards A 2780 human ovarian cancer cells. Calf thymus DNA interactions for [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(bpm) Cl][PF 6] and [(η 6 -p-cym) Ru(phen) Cl][PF 6] consist of weak coordinative, intercalative and monofunctional coordination.

40|$|During summer 2010, a proton {{transfer}} reaction – time {{of flight}} – mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) and a quadrupole proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) were deployed simultaneously for one month in an orange orchard in the Central Valley of California to collect continuous data suitable for eddy covariance (EC) flux calculations. The high time resolution (5 Hz) and high mass resolution (up to 5000 m/ 1 m) data from the PTRTOF- MS {{provided the basis for}} calculating the concentration and flux {{for a wide range of}} volatile organic compounds (VOC). Throughout the campaign, 664 mass peaks were detected in mass-to-charge ratios between 10 and 1278. Here we present PTR-TOF-MS EC fluxes of the 27 ion species for which the vertical gradient was simultaneously measured by PTR-MS. These EC flux data were validated through spectral analysis (i. e., co-spectrum, normalized co-spectrum, and ogive). Based on inter-comparison of the two PTR instruments, no significant instrumental biases were found in either mixing ratios or fluxes, and the data showed agreement within 5 % on average for methanol and acetone. For the measured biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC), the EC fluxes from PTR-TOF-MS were in agreement with the qualitatively inferred flux directions from vertical gradient measurements by PTR-MS. For the 27 selected ion species reported here, the PTR-TOF-MS measured total (24 h) mean net flux of 299 μg Cm− 2 h− 1. The dominant BVOC emissions from this site were monoterpenes (m/z 81. 070 +m/z 137. 131 +m/z 95. 086, 34 %, 102 μg Cm− 2 h− 1) and methanol (m/z 33. 032, 18 %, 72 μgCm− 2 h− 1). The next largest fluxes were detected at the following masses (attribution in parenthesis) : m/z 59. 048 (mostly acetone, 12. 2 %, 36. 5 μgCm− 2 h− 1), m/z 61. 027 (mostly acetic acid, 11. 9 %, 35. 7 μg Cm− 2 h− 1), m/z 93. 069 (<b>para-cymene</b> + toluene, 4. 1 %, 12. 2 μgCm− 2 h− 1), m/z 45. 033 (acetaldehyde, 3. 8 %, 11. 5 μgCm− 2 h− 1), m/z 71. 048 (methylvinylketone + methacrolein, 2. 4 %, 7. 1 μgCm− 2 h− 1), and m/z 69. 071 (isoprene + 2 -methyl- 3 -butene- 2 -ol, 1. 8 %, 5. 3 μg Cm− 2 h− 1).

In the ethereal oil of summer savory, 19 components were identified: carvacrol (89, 07 %), γ-terpinene (3, 53 %), α-thujone (1, 7 %), camphora (1, 48 %), terpinen- 4 ol 4 (0, 91 %), β-bisabolen (0, 56 %), β-caryophyllene (0, 45 %), bitsiklogermakren (0, 38 %) <b>para-cymene</b> (0, 34 %), 1, 8 -cineole (0, 33 %), trans-sabinengidrat (0. 25 %), 1 -octen- 3 -ol (0. 20 %), spatulenol (0, 18 %), β-thujone (0, 14 %), eugenol (0, 11 %), geranylacetate (0, 11 %), humulene (0, 09 %), α-terpinene (0, 09 %), octanol- 3 (0, 07 %). A high carvacrol content determines antimicrobial properties of summer savory. The antimicrobial activity of S. hortensis extract was studied in accordance with the common methodology of determining the sensitivity of microorganisms to antibacterial preparations. The aboveground part of plants harvested in the last ten-day period of August, in the flowering phase, was used in the experiments. The raw material was reduced to fragments of 1 - 1. 5 mm according to the requirements of pharmacopoeia. The extract of S. hortensis was obtained by the method of maceration in 40 % ethyl alcohol at a ratio of 1 : 5 and the concentration of 200 mg/ml. The availability of antimicrobial activity of extracted substances {{in the structure of the}} substances studied was determined by the way of comparison of their minimum inhibiting concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations (MBC/MFC) with those in 40 % ethyl alcohol. The paper investigates the biological activity of 40 % ethanol extract of Satureja hortensis herb grown under the conditions of Ukrainian Polissya as to golden staphylococcus (Staphylococcus aureus), coliform bacillus Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans which are pathogenic in reference to other organisms. It has been shown that S. hortensis extract was characterized by antimicrobial activity since extracted substances increased 32 times the indices of minimum bacteriostatic concentration and 16 times those of minimum bactericidal concentration as to S. aureus. The less marked effect was registered concerning C. albicans. In this case twofold increase of MIC and MFC indices was only observed. In relation to E. coli the components of savory extract intensified two times the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal effect of 40 % ethanol. As to P. aerugionosa the antimicrobial effect was not registered. The paper draws attention to the prospects of the further more detailed study of ethanol extracts of summer savory with the aim of producing antibacterial and antifungal herbal preparations.
