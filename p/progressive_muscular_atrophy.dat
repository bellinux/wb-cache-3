40|$|SUMMARY Haptoglobin (Hp) {{groups were}} {{investigated}} in 81 patients with motor neuron disease. A significant excess of heterozygotes was observed, accentuated among males {{and in the}} <b>progressive</b> spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> subgroup. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} a possible influence of Hp in the immunological response. Motor neuron disease is a progressive disorder of the upper and lower motor neurons. Affected individuals become severely disabled and many die within a few years. Most cases are sporadic but 5 - 10 % occur in a familial pattern suggesting autosomal dominant in-heritance. 1 A slight male overrepresentation is often observed. Three clinical varieties are recognised, de-pending on involvement of upper or lower motor neu-rons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shows signs of upper and lower motor neuron disorder, whereas progressive bulbar paralysis (PBP) and <b>progressive</b> spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PSMA) show only lower motor neuron signs. With time the symptomatologies of these variants often merge and in late stages of the disease subgroups are difficult to distinguish. The cause and pathogenesis of motor neuron dis-ease are unknown and various aetiologies, such as viral, immunological, genetic and environmental, have been proposed. 2 3 On the island of Guam, with a focus of high incidence for motor neuron disease, ex-tensive investigations of genetic markers have been performed without finding any striking associ-ations. 46 Apart from histocompatibility antigens genetic markers have not, to our knowledge, pre-viously been investigated in cases of motor neuron disease outside the high incidence areas. 7 Haptoglobin (Hp), the major haemoglobin-binding serum protein, is an acute phase reactant with various properties of unknown biological significance.

40|$|Background: Spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of anterior horn {{cells in the}} spinal cord leading to <b>progressive</b> <b>muscular</b> weakness and <b>atrophy.</b> The spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> candidate interval genes including survival motor neuron, the responsible gene in spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> phenotype expression, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, and P 44, potential modifying genes, are located on chromosome 5 q 13 in two highly homologous copies (telomeric and centromeric) within the spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> region. Methods: In this study, the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion was analyzed in 34 spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> families, with the consanguinity rate of 65 % (22 / 34), in whom exon 7 of the survival motor neuron- 1 gene was already confirmed and was deleted in 79 % of the affected individuals. Deletion analysis of exons 5, 6, and 13 of the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-t gene {{was carried out in}} our samples. Results: We found 80 % neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in 5 q-spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> patients (91 % spinal muscular atrophy-I, 50 % spinal muscular atrophy-II and-III), and in 5 % (two of fourty) of spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> parents. All the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-deleted samples also lacked the survival motor neuron- 1 gene. Conclusion: The neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in spinal muscular atrophy-I was higher than the other spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> types. The high frequency of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein deletion most likely reflects a higher frequency of survival motor neuron- 1 deletions compared with survival motor neuron- 1 to survival motor neuron- 2 gene conversion in this population...|$|R

50|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (PMA), {{also known}} as Duchenne-Aran muscular atrophy and by various other names, is a rare subtype of motor neuron disease (MND) that affects only the lower motor neurons.

This is in {{contrast}} to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), {{the most common form of}} MND, which affects both the upper and lower motor neurones, or primary lateral sclerosis, another rare MND variant, which affects only the upper motor neurons.

40|$|Spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (SMA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{autosomal}} recessive disorders characterized by degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord, and leads to <b>progressive</b> <b>muscular</b> weakness and <b>atrophy.</b> At least three SMA-related genes have been identified: SMN 1, NAIP and p 44 t. We analyzed these genes in 32 SMA patients and found that the SMN 1 gene was deleted in 30 of 32 patients (94 %), irrespective of clinical type. The NAIP gene was deleted in 6 patients and its deletion rate was higher in type I patients than that in type or. Further, in type I patients lacking the NAIP gene, deterioration in their respiratory function is more rapid than in those type I patients retaining the NAIP gene. Since complete p 44 t deletion was observed in only 3 patients, the correlation between the p 44 t deletion and severity of SMA remained ambiguous. We concluded that the NAIP deletion was closely related to the clinical severity of SMA and was a predictive marker of SMA prognosis, while the SMN 1 deletion did not correlate with clinical severity.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the genetic basis of hereditary lower motor neuron disease (LMND) and the recognition of multifocal motor neuropathy as a distinct clinical entity necessitate a new classification of LMND. To this end, we studied the clinical and electrophysiological features of 49 patients with sporadic adult-onset LMND in a cross-sectional study. Disease duration was more than 4 years to exclude the majority of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Based on the pattern of weakness, we identified three groups: 13 patients with generalized weakness (group 1); eight patients with symmetrical, distal muscle weakness (group 2); and 28 patients with non-generalized asymmetrical weakness of the arms in most patients (group 3). Group 3 could be subdivided into patients with weakness in predominantly the distal (group 3 a) or the proximal (group 3 b) muscle groups, both with disease progression to adjacent spinal cord segments. Distinctive features of group 1 were an older age at onset, more severe weakness and muscle atrophy, lower reflexes, greater functional impairment, more widespread abnormalities on concentric needle EMG, respiratory insufficiency and serum M-protein. In groups 2 and 3, concentric needle EMG findings also suggested a more widespread disease process. Retrospectively, the prognosis of sporadic adult-onset LMND appears to be favourable, because clinical abnormalities were still confined to one limb in most patients after a median disease duration of 12 years. We propose to classify the patients in the different subgroups as slowly <b>progressive</b> spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 1), distal spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 2), segmental distal spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 3 a) and segmental proximal spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (group 3 b).

50|$|If lesions {{affecting}} {{the branches of}} the ulnar nerve that run to the wasted muscles are excluded, the lesion is almost sure to be located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord at the C8-T1 level.

It can also occur in other disorders {{affecting the}} anterior horn, such as spinal muscular atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, poliomyelitis and <b>progressive</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> A slow onset and a lack of pain or sensorial symptoms are arguments against a lesion of the spinal root or plexus brachialis.

40|$|AbstractSpinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (SMA) is {{a common}} fatal {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons, leading to <b>progressive</b> paralysis with <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The gene for SMA has been mapped to chromosome 5 q 13, where large-scale deletions have been reported. We describe here the inverted duplication of a 500 kb element in normal chromosomes and narrow the critical region to 140 kb within the telomeric region. This interval contains a 20 kb gene encoding a novel protein of 294 amino acids. An highly homologous gene {{is present in the}} centromeric element of 95 % of controls. The telomeric gene is either lacking or interrupted in 226 of 229 patients, and patients retaining this gene (3 of 229) carry either a point mutation (Y 272 C) or short deletions in the consensus splice sites of introns 6 and 7.
