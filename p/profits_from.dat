30|$|Our surveys {{indicated}} that the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> potatoes is 18, 000  yuan/ha, and the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> scallions is 67, 500  yuan/ha. A farmer wanting to adopt the conversion plan would incur 14, 400  yuan in opportunity costs according to the designed rule described in Farmers’ Intention. However, the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> scallions is 27, 000  yuan. Therefore, even if the opportunity cost was incurred before the maturation of the scallions, the farmer would still earn 12, 600  yuan. This reasoning explains why the conversion cost is not considered in the farmer household decision making model.|$|R
