Not-Horses are red-eyed equines having a metallic skin, three clawed toes on each foot, discerning intelligence, personalities suited for battle, {{and the ability to}} march in step with each other. They are used as beasts of burden by the Glorious Army of the Architect, particularly by the <b>pseudo-</b> Mongol division thereof known as the Horde. Other versions of Not-Horses include Winged Not-Horses as in Lord Sunday.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} name pseudoplatanus {{refers to the}} superficial similarity of the leaves and bark of the sycamore to those of plane trees in the genus Platanus, the prefix <b>pseudo-</b> (from Ancient Greek) meaning [...] "false". [...] However, the two genera are in different families that are only distantly related. Acer and Platanus differ in the position in which leaves {{are attached to the}} stem (alternate in Platanus, paired or opposite in Acer) and in their fruit, which are spherical clusters in Platanus and paired samaras (winged fruit) in Acer.|$|E
500|$|In {{a series}} of potto (Perodicticus potto) skeletons in the {{collections}} of the Anthropological Institute and Museum of the University of Zurich at Irchel, anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz recognized two specimens with traits he believed distinct from all pottos, and in 1996 he used these two specimens to describe a new genus and species of primate, Pseudopotto martini. The generic name, Pseudopotto, combines the element <b>pseudo-</b> (Greek for [...] "false") with [...] "potto", referring to superficial similarities between the new form and the potto. The specific name, martini, honors primatologist Robert D. Martin. The exact provenance of the two specimens is unknown, and one is represented by a complete skeleton (but no skin) and the other by a skull only. Schwartz placed both specimens in a single species, but noted that further study might indicate that the two represent distinct species. He thought the relationships of the new form were unknown and difficult to assess and did not assign it to any family, but provisionally placed it closest to the family Lorisidae, together with the potto, the angwantibos, and the lorises. The discovery, published in the Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History, was featured in Scientific American and Science; the Science account noted that Schwartz thought Pseudopotto may represent a new family of primates.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} text on {{the sublime}} was written sometime in the first or third century AD by the Greek writer (<b>pseudo-)</b> Longinus in his work On the Sublime ( [...] , Perì hýpsous). Longinus defines the literary sublime as [...] "excellence in language", the [...] "expression of a great spirit" [...] {{and the power to}} provoke [...] "ecstasy" [...] in one's readers. Longinus holds that the goal of a writer should be to produce a form of ecstasy.|$|E
2500|$|Related pathologies {{whose names}} may be {{confused}} with osteoarthritis include pseudo-arthrosis. This {{is derived from the}} Greek roots <b>pseudo-,</b> meaning [...] "false", and arthr-, meaning [...] "joint", together with the ending -osis used for disorders. Radiographic diagnosis results in diagnosis of a fracture within a joint, which is not to {{be confused with}} osteoarthritis which is a degenerative pathology affecting a high incidence of distal phalangeal joints of female patients. A polished ivory-like appearance may also develop on the bones of the affected joints, reflecting a change called eburnation.|$|E

So [...] "I think it highly probable," [...] says Mr. Greenwood, [...] "that he attended the Grammar School at Stratford for four or five years, and that, later in life, after some years in London, he was probably able to 'bumbast out a line,' and perhaps to pose as 'Poet-Ape who would be thought our chief.'"

6000|$|The spiritual medium {{which he}} liked, he was partly born into, and partly he created it. The {{child of a}} race which came from England, robust and Puritanic, {{he had in his}} veins the blood of judges--of those judges who burned witches and persecuted Quakers. His fancy is as much {{influenced}} by the old fanciful traditions of Providence, of Witchcraft, of haunting Indian magic, as Scott's is influenced by legends of foray and feud, by ballad, and song, and old wives' tales, and records of conspiracies, fire- raisings, tragic love-adventures, and border wars. Like Scott, Hawthorne lived in phantasy--in phantasy which returned to the romantic past, wherein his ancestors had been notable men. It is a commonplace, but an inevitable commonplace, to add that he was filled with the idea of Heredity, with the belief that we are all only new combinations of our fathers that were before us. This has been made into a kind of <b>pseudo-</b> scientific doctrine by M. Zola, in the long series of his Rougon-Macquart novels. Hawthorne treated it with a more delicate and a serener art in [...] "The House of the Seven Gables." ...|$|E
6000|$|Smollett {{never reached}} that goal, {{and even the}} shadow of decency never haunted him {{so as to make}} him afraid with any amazement. Smollett avers that he [...] "has had the courage to call in {{question}} the talents of a <b>pseudo-</b> patron," [...] and so is charged with [...] "insolence, rancour, and scurrility." [...] Of all these things, and of worse, he had been guilty; his offence had never been limited to [...] "calling in question the talents" [...] of persons who had been unsuccessful in getting his play represented. Remonstrance merely irritated Tobias. His new novel was but a fainter echo of his old novels, a panorama of scoundrelism, with the melodramatic fortunes of the virtuous Monimia for a foil. If read to-day, it is read as a sketch of manners, or want of manners. The scene in which the bumpkin squire rooks the accomplished Fathom at hazard, in Paris, is prettily conceived, and Smollett's indignation at the British system of pews in church is edifying. But when Monimia appears to her lover as he weeps at her tomb, and proves to be no phantom, but a [...] "warm and substantial" [...] Monimia, capable of being [...] "dished up," [...] like any other Smollettian heroine, the reader is sensibly annoyed. Tobias as un romantique is absolutely too absurd; [...] "not here, oh Tobias, are haunts meet for thee." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} the misfortune of this eminent gentleman when he first entered public life, to become {{identified}} with a political connection which, having arrogated to itself {{the name of an}} illustrious historical party, pursued a policy which was either founded on no principle whatever, or on principles exactly contrary to those which had always guided the conduct of the great Tory leaders. The chief members of this official confederacy were men distinguished by none of the conspicuous qualities of statesmen. They had none of the divine gifts that govern senates and guide councils. They were not orators; they were not men of deep thought or happy resource, or of penetrative and sagacious minds. Their political ken was essentially dull and contracted. They expended some energy in obtaining a defective, blundering acquaintance with foreign affairs; they knew as little of the real state of their own country as savages of an approaching eclipse. This factious league had shuffled themselves into power by clinging to the skirts of a great minister, the last of Tory statesmen, but who, in the unparalleled and confounding emergencies of his latter years, had been forced, unfortunately for England, to relinquish Toryism. His successors inherited all his errors without the latent genius, which in him might have still rallied and extricated him from the consequences of his disasters. His successors did not merely inherit his errors; they exaggerated, they caricatured them. They rode into power on a springtide of all the rampant prejudices and rancorous passions of their time. From the King to the boor their policy was a mere pandering to public ignorance. Impudently usurping the name of that party of which nationality, and therefore universality, is the essence, these <b>pseudo-</b> Tories made Exclusion the principle of their political constitution, and Restriction the genius of their commercial code.|$|E
6000|$|The less gifted {{portion of}} the educated public was greatly delighted some {{years ago by a}} work by Dr. Nordau called Degeneration, in which a great number of {{abnormal}} people were studied in a <b>pseudo-</b> scientific manner and shown to be abnormal beyond any possibility of dispute. Mostly the samples selected were men of exceptional artistic and literary power. The book was pretentious and inconsistent--the late Lord Tennyson was quoted, I remember, as a typically [...] "sane" [...] poet in spite of the scope afforded by his melodramatic personal appearance and his morbid passion for seclusion--but it did at least serve to show that if we cannot call a man stupid we may almost invariably call him mad with some show of reason. The public read the book for the sake of its abuse, applied the intended conclusion to every success that awakened its envy, and failed altogether to see how absolutely the definition of madness was destroyed. But if madness is indeed simply genius out of hand and genius only madness under adequate control; if imagination is a snare only to the unreasonable and a disordered mind only an excess of intellectual enterprise--and really none of these things can be positively disproved--then just as reasonable as the idea of suppressing the reproduction of madness, is the idea of breeding it! Let us take all these dull, stagnant, respectable people, one might say, who do nothing but conform to whatever rule is established about them and obstruct whatever change is proposed to them, whose chief quality is a sheer incapacity to imagine anything beyond their petty experiences, and let us tell them plainly, [...] "It is time a lunatic married into your family." [...] Let no one run away from this with the statement that I propose such a thing should be done, but it is, at any rate in the present state of our knowledge, as reasonable a proposal, to make as its quite frequently reiterated converse.|$|E

Whether true or not, and it was probably not true in just that form, {{it must have been}} this rumor which determined his host to drive into Boston for him with the handsomest hack which the livery of Cambridge afforded, and not trust to the horse-car and the local expressman to get him and his baggage out, as he would have done with a less portentous guest. However it was, he instantly lost all fear when they met at the station, and Harte pressed forward with his cordial hand-clasp, as if he were not even a fairy prince, and with that voice and laugh which were surely the most winning in the world. He was then, as always, a child of extreme fashion as to his clothes and the cut of his beard, which he wore in a mustache and the drooping side-whiskers of the day, and his jovial physiognomy was as winning as his voice, with its straight nose and fascinating thrust of the under lip, its fine eyes, and good forehead, then thickly crowned with the black hair which grew early white, while his mustache remained dark the most enviable and consoling effect possible in the universal mortal necessity of either aging or dying. He was, as one could not help seeing, thickly pitted, but after the first glance one forgot this, so that a lady who met {{him for the first time}} could say to him, [...] "Mr. Harte, aren't you afraid to go about in the cars so recklessly when there is this scare about smallpox?"
