The test environments were high humidity, alternate immersion in 3. 5 -percent NaCl, and 5 -percent salt spray. Stress levels ranged from 25 to 90 percent of the yield strengths. The majority of the tests were conducted for 90 days. Even though the specimens rusted significantly in salt spray and alternate immersion, no failures occurred. Therefore, it can be concluded that this alloy, in the forms and at the strength levels tested, is highly resistant to SCC in salt and high humidity environments...|$|E

Further {{details of this}} conference can be found at: [URL] of the ways of damping {{resonant}} vibrations of engineering structures or their components is to reduce reflections of bending waves from their free edges. A new efficient method of reducing edge reflections proposed by the present author is based on using specially designed <b>plates</b> or <b>bars</b> of variable thickness in combination with strips of thin absorbing layers placed at the edges. Such <b>plates</b> or <b>bars</b> utilise gradual change in their thickness from the value corresponding to {{the thickness of the}} basic <b>plate</b> or <b>bar</b> to almost zero. If to use some specific power-law profiles for these <b>plates</b> or <b>bars</b> then they would ideally provide zero reflection of bending waves from their sharp edges {{even in the absence of}} the absorbing layers at the edges, thus materialising the so-called ‘acoustic black holes’ for bending waves. In the present paper, this effect is considered for one-dimensional and two-dimensional acoustic black holes. In the latter case black holes are materialised by cylindrically symmetrical pits (cavities) of powerlaw profile nearly protruding through the bottom of the plate. Geometrical acoustics (ray tracing) theory for plate bending wave propagation in the vicinity of one- and two-dimensional acoustic black holes is considered, including definition of ray trajectories and calculation of the reflection coefficients. Finally, we discuss possible practical applications of the abovementioned one- and two-dimensional black holes for damping structural vibrations...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. One of the {{possible}} ways of damping resonant flexural vibrations of engineering structures or their components, e. g. finite <b>plates</b> or <b>bars,</b> is to reduce reflections of flexural waves from the free edges. A new emerging method of reducing edge reflections, which is being developed by the present author, uses specifically designed attachable <b>plates</b> or <b>bars</b> of variable thickness (non-linear wedges). Such <b>plates</b> or <b>bars</b> utilise gradual change in their thickness from the value corresponding to {{the thickness of the}} basic <b>plate</b> or <b>bar,</b> which are to be damped, to almost zero. It is proposed to use specific power-law shapes of these attachable wedges so that they would ideally provide zero reflection of flexural waves even for negligibly small material attenuation, thus materialising the so-called ‘acoustic black hole effect’. To make up for real manufactured wedges, that always have edge truncations, and to increase the efficiency of damping it is suggested also to deposit absorbing thin layers on wedge surfaces. According to the theoretical calculations, the deposition of thin absorbing layers on surfaces of wedges utilising the acoustic black hole effect can dramatically reduce the reflection coefficients, thus resulting in very efficient damping systems for flexural vibrations. The theory of the phenomenon based on geometrical-acoustics approach is discussed for different wedge profiles. Theoretical results are complemented by the preliminary experimental measurements carried out on a steel wedge of quadratic shape...|$|R

A new {{efficient}} method of reducing edge reflections of flexural waves in <b>plates</b> or <b>bars</b> {{based on the}} 'acoustic black hole effect' has been recently proposed and described theoretically {{by one of the}} present authors [1] (see also [2 - 4]).

The present paper describes the results of the experimental investigation of the damping system consisting of a steel plate (wedge) of quadratic shape covered on one side by a strip of absorbing layer. The results of the measurements of point mobility in such a system show that for the wedge covered by an absorbing layer there is a significant reduction of resonant peaks, in comparison with the uncovered wedge or with the covered plate of constant thickness. Thus, the measurements confirm the existence of the acoustic black hole effect for flexural waves and demonstrate the possibility of its use in practice...|$|R
