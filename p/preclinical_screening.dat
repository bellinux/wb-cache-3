40|$|The anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) {{introduced}} {{in the last two}} decades have provided several benefits: they offered new treatment options for symptomatic treatment of seizures, improved ease of use and tolerability, lowered risk for hypersensitivity reactions and detrimental drug-drug interactions. These drugs, however, did not attenuate the problem of drug refractory epilepsy nor proved capable to prevent and/or cure the disease. Thus, new <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening</b> strategies are needed to identify AEDs that target these unmet medical needs. New therapies may derive from novel targets identified on the basis of existing hypotheses for drug refractory epilepsy and the biology of epileptogenesis; from research on genetics, transcriptomics and epigenetics; from mechanisms relevant for other therapy areas. Novel targets should be explored using new <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening</b> strategies and new technologies should be used to develop medium- to high-throughput screening models. In vivo testing of novel drugs should be performed in models mimicking relevant aspects of drug refractory epilepsy and/or epileptogenesis. To minimize the high attrition rate associated with drug development, which mainly arises from a failure to demonstrate sufficient clinical efficacy of new treatments, it is important to define integrated strategies for <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening</b> and experimental trial design. An important tool will be the discovery and implementation of relevant biomarkers, that will facilitate a continuum of proof-of-concept approaches during early clinical testing to rapidly confirm or reject preclinical findings, and thereby lower the risk of the overall development effort. In this review, we overview some of the issues related to these topics and provide examples of new approaches that will hopefully be more successful than those used in the past...|$|E

40|$|A lack of {{relevant}} animal models has hampered <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening</b> and critical {{evaluation of the}} efficacy of human vaccines in vivo. Carcinoembryonic antigen–A 2 Kb (CEA–A 2 Kb) double transgenic mice provide a biologically relevant model for <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening</b> and critical evaluation of human CEA vaccine efficacy in vivo, particularly because such animals are peripherally tolerant of CEA. We established the utility of this model by demonstrating that an oral DNA minigene vaccine induces effective HLA-A 2 –restricted, CEA-specific antitumor CTL responses. This finding is supported by three lines of evidence: (a) an effective HLA-A 2 –restricted, CEA 691 -specific CTL response; (b) specific in vitro killing of CEA-A 2 Kb transduced MC- 38 colon carcinoma cells; and (c) protective immunity induced in vaccinated mice against challenges of these tumor cells. Importantly, peripheral T cell tolerance against CEA in CEA-A 2 Kb double transgenic mice was broken by the CEA 691 (IMIGVLVGV) minigene vaccine. In conclusion, CEA-A 2 Kb double transgenic mice were demonstrated to be good candidates for in vivo testing of human CEA–based vaccines. This result suggests a potential for these vaccines in future human vaccine development. The feasibility of using nonmutated self-antigens as targets for therapeutic vaccinations was indicated, provided that such antigens are presented in an immunogenic context; that is, as a DNA minigene in a bacterial carrier system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBoth psychostimulants and {{antidepressants}} target monoamine transporters and, as a consequence, augment monoamine transmission. These {{two groups}} of drugs also increase motor activity in <b>preclinical</b> behavioural <b>screens</b> for antidepressants. Substance P-preferring receptor (NK 1 R) antagonists similarly increase both motor activity in these tests and monoamine transmission in the brain. In this article, the neurochemical and behavioural responses to these three groups of drugs are compared. It becomes evident that NK 1 R antagonists represent a distinct class of compounds (‘motor disinhibitors’) that differ substantially from both psychostimulants and antidepressants, especially during states of heightened arousal or stress. Also, all three groups of drugs influence the activation of voltage-gated Ca(v) 1. 2 and Ca(v) 1. 3 L-type channels (LTCCs) in the brain, albeit in different ways. This article discusses evidence that points to disruption of these functional interactions between NK 1 R and LTCCs as a contributing factor in the cognitive and behavioural abnormalities that are prominent features of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Arising from this is the interesting possibility that the hyperactivity and impulsivity (as in ADHD) and psychomotor retardation (as in depression) reflect opposite poles of a behavioural continuum. A better understanding of this pharmacological network could help explain why psychostimulants augment motor behaviour during stress (e. g., in <b>preclinical</b> <b>screens</b> for antidepressants) and yet reduce locomotor activity and impulsivity in ADHD.

Using quantitative mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we identified in preclinical models 21 plasma metabolites including amino acids, propionylcarnitine, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins that were significantly altered in two B-RAF mutant melanoma xenografts and that were reversed following a single dose of the potent and selective MEK inhibitor RO 4987655. Treatment of non-tumour bearing animals and mice bearing the PTEN null U 87 MG human glioblastoma xenograft elicited plasma changes only in amino acids and propionylcarnitine.

40|$|In vitro {{repeated}} dose {{testing for}} the assessment of chronic drug-induced effects is a huge challenge in preclinical pharmaceutical drug development. Chronic toxicity results in discontinuation of therapy or post-marketing withdrawal of drugs despite in vivo <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening.</b> In case of hepatotoxicity, due to limited long term viability and functionality of primary hepatocytes, chronic hepatic effects are difficult to detect. In this study, we maintained primary human hepatocytes in a serum-free cultivation medium for more than 3 weeks and analyzed physiology, viability and drug metabolizing capacities of the hepatocytes. Moreover, we assessed acute (24 h) diclofenac toxicity in a range of (10 - 1000 muM) concentrations. The chronic (9 repeated doses) toxicity at one clinically relevant and another higher concentration (6. 4 and 100 muM) was also tested. We investigated phase I and II metabolism of diclofenac upon repeated dose exposure and analyzed effects on the cellular exometabolome. Acute 24 h assessment revealed toxicity only for the highest tested concentration (1 mM). Upon repeated dose exposure, toxic effects were observed even at a low, clinically relevant concentration (6. 4 muM). Biotransformation pathways were active for 3 weeks and diclofenac-acylglucuronide was detected as the predominant metabolite. Dose dependent diclofenac-induced effects on exometabolome, such as on the production of lactate and 3 -hydroxybutyric acid as well as glucose and galactose metabolism, were observed upon nine repeated doses. Summarizing, we show that repeated dose testing on long-term functional cultures of primary human hepatocytes may be included {{for the assessment}} of long term toxic effects in <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening</b> and can potentially help replace/reduce in vivo animal testing...|$|E

Although the acute effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in elevating synaptic serotonin concentrations is well known, the clinical amelioration of depressive symptoms requires 14 - 21 days of treatment, suggesting that numerous other rearrangements of function in the CNS must take place. In the present study, we demonstrated that 14 days of FLX treatment up-regulated galanin mRNA levels by 100 % and GalR 2 -binding sites by 50 %, in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus, where galanin coexists with serotonin.

MethodsThe current research aims to compare the impact of using serum-free medium instead of complete culture medium during the last step of psoriatic skin substitute reconstruction. Skin substitutes were produced according to the self-assembly approach. ResultsSerum-free conditions have no {{negative impact on the}} reconstruction of healthy or psoriatic skin substitutes presented in this study regarding their macroscopic or histological appearances. ATR-FTIR results showed no significant differences in the CH 2 bands between psoriatic substitutes cultured with or without serum, thus suggesting that serum deprivation did not {{have a negative impact on}} the lipid organization of their stratum corneum. Serum deprivation could even lead to a better organization of healthy skin substitute lipids. Percutaneous analyses demonstrated that psoriatic substitutes cultured in serum-free conditions showed a higher permeability to hydrocortisone compared to controls, while no significant differences in benzoic acid and caffeine penetration profiles were observed.

However, the low-throughput nature of these models renders them problematic for employment as <b>preclinical</b> <b>screening</b> assays. Here, we present an analogous, but high-throughput, in vitro approach in which drugs are administered to a variety of cell types (primary human and rat hepatocytes and the human HepG 2 cell line) across a landscape of inflammatory contexts containing LPS and cytokines TNF, IFNγ, IL- 1 α, and IL- 6. Using this assay, we observed drug–cytokine hepatotoxicity synergies for multiple idiosyncratic hepatotoxicants (ranitidine, trovafloxacin, nefazodone, nimesulide, clarithromycin, and telithromycin) but not for their corresponding non-toxic control compounds (famotidine, levofloxacin, buspirone, and aspirin). A larger compendium of drug–cytokine mix hepatotoxicity data demonstrated that hepatotoxicity synergies were largely potentiated by TNF, IL- 1 α, and LPS within the context of multi-cytokine mixes. Then, we screened 90 drugs for cytokine synergy in human hepatocytes and found that a significantly larger fraction of the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicants (19 %) synergized with a single cytokine mix than did the non-hepatotoxic drugs (3 %). Finally, we used an information theoretic approach to ascertain especially informative subsets of cytokine treatments for most highly effective construction of regression models for drug- and cytokine mix-induced hepatotoxicities across these cell systems.

These include bimanual pelvic examination, ultrasound examination (Box), with or without colour Doppler flow imaging, and measurement of various circulating proteins. ■ Bimanual pelvic examination as part of a “well-woman’s screen ” has not been found to be useful. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryNeurofibromatosis type 1 is a tumor-predisposing genetic disorder. Plexiform neurofibromas {{are common}} NF 1 tumors {{carrying}} {{a risk of}} malignant transformation, which is typically fatal. Little is known about mechanisms mediating initiation and identity of specific cell type that gives rise to neurofibromas. Using cell-lineage tracing, we identify a population of GAP 43 + PLP+ precursors in embryonic nerve roots as the cells of origin for these tumors and report a non-germline neurofibroma model for <b>preclinical</b> drug <b>screening</b> to identify effective therapies. The identity of the tumor cell of origin and facility for isolation and expansion provides fertile ground for continued analysis to define factors critical for neurofibromagenesis. It also provides unique approaches to develop therapies to prevent neurofibroma formation in NF 1 patients...|$|R
