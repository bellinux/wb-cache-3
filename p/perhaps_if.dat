It was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of yellow fever and cholera, which killed thousands of the inhabitants {{and members of the}} garrison.

Lord Nelson wrote the following March that he hoped that Gibraltar [...] "will escape the dreadful scourge of last autumn, and I hope that General Fox has burnt down all the small houses at the back of the Town; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>if</b> half the Town went with them, it would be better for the Rock." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} {{kingdom in}} eastern Scotland before the Viking Age was the northern Pictish kingdom of Fortriu {{on the shores}} of the Moray Firth. By the 9th century, the Gaels of Dál Riata (Dalriada) were subject to the kings of Fortriu of the family of Constantín mac Fergusa (Constantine son of Fergus). Constantín's family dominated Fortriu after 789 and <b>perhaps,</b> <b>if</b> Constantín was a kinsman of Óengus I of the Picts (Óengus son of Fergus), from around 730. The dominance of Fortriu came to an end in 839 with a defeat by Viking armies reported by the Annals of Ulster in which King Uen of Fortriu and his brother Bran, Constantín's nephews, together with the king of Dál Riata, Áed mac Boanta, [...] "and others almost innumerable" [...] were killed. These deaths led to a period of instability lasting a decade as several families attempted to establish their dominance in Pictland. By around 848 Kenneth MacAlpin had emerged as the winner.|$|E

500|$|Garfield's biographers, {{and those}} who have studied his {{presidency}}, tend to think well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian Justus D. Doenecke, while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements, [...] "by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched." [...] Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation. According to Caldwell, writing in 1931, [...] "If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality—but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>if</b> he had lived he could have done no more."

500|$|Gill {{signed a}} two-and-a-half-year {{contract}} in January 2001. Having {{taken part in}} most of the games in Birmingham's League Cup run, he was omitted from the first leg of the semi-final at Ipswich Town in favour of loan player Steve Jenkins. When Jenkins returned to his owning club, Gary Rowett said that Gill should be given a run of games in the Birmingham first team, suggesting that [...] "if anything, he's too nice. He doesn't complain a lot and it's easy for people not to take notice of you. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>if</b> he moaned a bit more he'd get a start!" [...] Recalled for the second leg, he produced an excellent performance, making a goal-line clearance from a header which would have left Birmingham two goals adrift had it crossed the line. Yet {{when it came to the}} final, manager Francis was unable to find a place for Gill even among the substitutes, preferring Eaden and McCarthy, making only his second start after recovering from a broken leg, in the starting eleven and David Holdsworth, a defender unavailable since the previous November due to serious illness, on the bench. Gill was devastated by this decision, describing it as [...] "the biggest disappointment of [...] whole life".|$|E
