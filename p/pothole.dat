25|$|Iowa's natural {{vegetation}} is tallgrass prairie and savanna in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and <b>pothole</b> wetlands in northern prairie areas.

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} that the boroughs of Blakely and Archbald include protection of Wildcat Creek in their zoning plans.

25|$|In 1928, {{a second}} PL.8 was built, {{equipped}} with a Hispano-Suiza 12M 375kW (500hp) engine. Flown in 1928, the PL.8-02 {{was intended as a}} long-range record breaker but modified as an air mail carrier. On 20 December 1929, the second PL.8-02, registered F-AJKP to Cie Generale Aeropostale and based at Dakar while flown by pilot Henry Delaunay, was badly damaged when it hit a <b>pothole</b> on landing at Istres and not repaired.|$|E
25|$|The {{watershed}} of Wildcat Creek {{is mainly}} on {{residential and commercial}} land. The creek {{is a source of}} flooding in Archbald and Blakely. The creek's course was diverted at least once in the early 20th century and a bridge was constructed over it in the late 20th century. A trail along the creek between the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail and Archbald <b>Pothole</b> State Park has been proposed. The creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the thirteenth}} stage, Hector Heusghem fell down {{due to a}} <b>pothole,</b> and broke his bicycle. According to the rules, he should have fixed his bicycle without help, but instead he changed to a {{different}} bicycle. He had gotten permission from a race judge to do this, but later the judges reevaluated the rules, {{and gave him a}} one-hour penalty. This dropped him to the fourth place of the general classification, and allowed Lambot to take over the lead. Lambot stayed in the yellow jersey easily until Paris, so he won the 1922 Tour de France.|$|E

25|$|Although easy to ride slowly {{because of}} their high center of mass and the {{inverted}} pendulum effect, the penny-farthing is prone to accidents. To stop, the rider presses back on the pedals while applying a spoon-shaped brake pressing the tire. The center of mass being high and not far behind the front wheel means any sudden stop or collision with a <b>pothole</b> or other obstruction can send the rider over the handlebars. On long downhills, some riders hooked their feet over the handlebars. This made for quick descents but left no chance of stopping. A new type of handlebar was introduced, called Whatton bars, that looped behind the legs so that riders could still keep their feet on the pedals and {{also be able to}} leap forward feet-first off the machine.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{was posted}} to British East Africa (now Kenya) as a {{corporal}} {{in charge of}} a dog unit during the Mau Mau Uprising. On 8 October 1954, while en route to Thompson Falls (now Nyahururu) in a truck with ten men of the King's African Rifles, the vehicle hit a <b>pothole</b> in the road and flipped over. Sitting upfront, both Randall and the driver were covered in fuel and set alight. The soldiers {{in the back of the}} truck managed to scramble free, but Randall on leaving the cab saw that the driver was unconscious and re-entered the front of the truck to drag him to safety. Once the driver came around, Peter realized that a dog was chained up inside the burning truck. Removing his clothes, he went back into the truck once again and released the animal.|$|E

5000|$|Bourke's Luck <b>Potholes</b> - Bourke’s Luck <b>Potholes</b> are {{a series}} of natural {{geological}} formations that were formed by centuries of water flowing through the landscape. The <b>potholes</b> occur where the Treur River joins the Blyde River {{at the start of the}} Blyde River Canyon. In a continuous manner, the force of the water in these two rivers, combined with the particles of sand and rock that the rivers' transport, wears cylindrical <b>potholes</b> into the sandstone bedrock.|$|R
500|$|Flight testing {{started in}} late 1947, but only six test flights {{had been carried}} out before the I-211 struck a <b>pothole</b> on landing, which {{collapsed}} the undercarriage. Even the limited amount of flight testing showed it to be faster than the Sukhoi Su-11 which also used the TR-1 engine. Repairs were carried out and the opportunity taken to replace the troublesome engines with imported [...] Rolls-Royce Derwent V engines. Alekseyev {{took the opportunity to}} upgrade the aircraft to the I-215 configuration which had been in development since before the first flight of the I-211. The substitution of the centrifugal-flow Derwent for the axial-flow TR-1 forced the redesign and enlargement of the nacelles to accommodate the larger engine. Other modifications included increasing the fuel capacity from [...] to , provision for a ranging radar in the nose, and better protection for the pilot. The armament was revised to the originally specified N-37 guns, although the ammunition capacity was marginally increased to 35 rounds per gun. Despite good results from flight testing, the I-215 lost out in production orders to the newer generation of swept-winged fighters.|$|E
500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a <b>pothole,</b> or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{serving as}} a {{ventilation}} shaft for the mine, the <b>pothole</b> was fenced in by {{the owner of the}} land, Colonel Hackley, for tourists to look at it. The <b>pothole</b> soon became a renowned tourist attraction. Edward Jones led the tours for the locals and famous geologists. Archbald <b>Pothole</b> was turned over to public ownership in 1914, when the widow of Colonel Hackley deeded [...] surrounding the <b>pothole</b> to the Lackawanna Historical Society. Lackawanna County gained ownership of the <b>pothole</b> and the surrounding [...] in 1940.

2500|$|Archbald <b>Pothole</b> is [...] {{deep and}} [...] wide at its maximum diameter. The <b>pothole</b> cuts through layers of sandstone, shale and coal. A <b>pothole,</b> in {{geologic}} terms, is a hole that is worn into {{the bedrock of}} a stream in strong rapids or {{at the base of}} a waterfall. [...] The force of the water spins rock fragments, sand and gravel into a small indentation in the bedrock. After years and years of constant spinning, the stones and sands carve out an elliptical hole. Potholes are also formed by the action of glacial meltwater. Archbald <b>Pothole</b> is an example of just such a <b>pothole.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{problems}} {{posed by}} <b>potholes</b> to mining operations {{are rooted in}} the fracturing and fragmentation of the material in <b>potholes</b> and their surroundings.
