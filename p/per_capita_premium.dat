States are prohibited from providing coverage to children with family income above 300% of the FPL. For children in families above 200%, states cannot pay for coverage unless they are currently providing {{and will continue to}} provide coverage to at least 90% of eligible children below 200% of the FPL. These requirements extend to pregnant women. Consideration of individuals' and families' income must be based on their gross, or pre-tax, income. Excluding requirements under Section 2102 of the Social Security Act, minimum coverage requirements and limitations on beneficiary cost-sharing do not apply to these group plans. If the plans do not cover immunizations, well-baby and well-child care, dental care, or emergency services, then SCHIPs must provide these benefits as supplemental benefits. Premium payments to group plans in a single fiscal year are to be restricted to a maximum of the product of the national <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>premium</b> expenditure for the previous fiscal year, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) for the state in that fiscal year, and the number of low-income children or pregnant women receiving coverage. Children are not to be enrolled unless the child's parent or guardian has been informed of the coverage and are given at least one opportunity per fiscal year to switch coverage. State health plans are required to state how they will notify potential beneficiaries, to provide such notification during applications for enrollment, and post a description of coverage options on a public website. Proof of enrollment for low-income children in a group health plan is to be made every six months. The per capita dollar amount paid by the state to the plan provider is required to be at least 90% {{of the value of the}} benefits and must be uniform across all plans offered.|$|E

A simple model is constructed for the purpose of simulating growth scenarios up to the year 2020 for Burkina Faso, Côte d''Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Tanzania, and Uganda. Even if one makes relatively optimistic assumptions, Africa is not likely to reach "Asian tiger" levels of growth.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the forward-looking long-term equity risk by extrapolating {{the way it}} participated in the real economy. We decompose the 1926 - 2000 historical equity returns into supply factors including inflation, earnings, dividends, price to earnings ratio, dividend payout ratio, book value, return on equity, and GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita.</b> There are several key findings: First, the growth in corporate productivity measured by earnings {{is in line with}} the growth of overall economic productivity. Second, P/E increases account for {{only a small portion of}} the total return of equity (1. 25 % of the total 10. 70 %). The bulk of the return is attributable to dividend payments and nominal earnings growth (including inflation and real earnings growth). Third, the increase in factor share of equity relative to the overall economy can be more than fully attributed to the increase in the P/E ratio. Fourth, there is a secular decline in the dividend yield and payout ratio, rendering dividend growth alone a poor measure of corporate profitability and future growth. Contrary to several recent studies, our supply side model forecast of the equity risk premium is only slightly lower than the pure historical return estimate. The long-term equity risk premium (relative to the long-term government bond yield) is estimated to be about 6 % arithmetically, and 4 % geometrically. Our estimate is in line with both the historical supply measures of the public corporations (i. e., earnings) and the overall economic productivity (GDP <b>per</b> <b>capita).</b> Equity Risk <b>Premium...</b>|$|R
