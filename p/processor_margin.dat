Considering Mexico's status in recent years as the number one market for U. S. dairy exports, surprisingly {{little is known about the}} dairy sector of our southern neighbor. Most studies of the Mexican dairy sector have broadly examined social, economic and demographic factors of Mexico and concluded that with a milk production deficit in Mexico, rising income in the population and the proximity of the United States to Mexico, the trade in dairy products between the United States and Mexico should continue to increase. Actual analysis of producer and consumer prices for dairy products, <b>processor</b> <b>margins</b> for packaged milk and manufactured products with various component origins, the effects of differing trade scenarios on U. S. federal order and cooperative prices and examination of the incentives for Mexican producers to market milk in the United States have not been closely investigated. This study addresses these areas. As it would be impractical to study the entire border area, a case study reflecting the economic conditions along the border area of El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico was selected. This study examined Mexican producer and consumer milk and dairy product prices by utilizing and standardizing price data which was collected first-hand or by Texas A&M researchers. Gross <b>processor</b> <b>margins</b> were calculated by utilizing published and collected input prices and retail product prices. Actual ingredient costs to manufacture products were calculated by utilizing butterfat-skim accounting procedures, product yields and recipes. U. S. federal order and cooperative price effects of various trade scenarios were examined by utilizing a pooling model. The incentives for Mexican producers to market milk in the United States were examined by comparing producer prices, hauling costs, distances from production areas to potential markets and regulatory requirements. The results of this study indicated that currency rate fluctuations, at least in the short-run, can have major ramifications on trading patterns. In the wake of the December 1994 devaluation, Mexican produced milk could be transported considerable distance into the United States if it could receive U. S. prices. This study additionally identified cross border trade issues and identified opportunities for circumvention of existing U. S. federal order regulations...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian pork {{industry}} has been in crisis {{for much of the}} past two years. Producer margins have been negative for much of 2006, most of 2007 and all of 2008. Losses are ongoing and have reached historic highs of $ 70 per hog in late 2007. The crisis is not limited to pork producers. <b>Processor</b> <b>margins</b> have been largely negative for the past two years. Additionally, input suppliers such as feed companies and veterinary practices are facing financial ruin, as producers are unable to keep their accounts current. The crisis is due to the convergence of four key factors (Toma & Bouma, 2008 a) : • The rapid rise of the Canadian dollar. • Rapid rise of input costs – notably feed grains. • New and intense competition from our major customer (the U. S. A.) • The lack of processor competitiveness in Canada. The Canadian dollar has risen in value relative to the U. S. dollar more than 20 % in the past year and over 60 % since 2002. This has had a two-fold effect: (1) the immediate reduction in prices paid for pork since all Canadian prices are based on the U. S. market and U. S. currency; (2) increased competition in all markets (domestic and export) from the U. S., which has become the world’s largest pork exporter. Feed costs have more than doubled in two years. World grain prices are at historical highs driven by new demands from bio-energy developments an...|$|R

The Spanish {{market for}} salted cod has {{undergone}} important transformations in recent decades. The {{collapse of the}} Newfoundland fishery dramatically reduced local processors’ access to the raw material, which previously was mainly supplied by Spanish vessels. The price of salted cod increased and <b>processors</b> <b>margins</b> decreased. By using price integration procedures, competition across commodities and countries of origin is tested, as well as price transmission to the retail level. The price series of salted cod at the retail levels {{are available at the}} panel of food consumption provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food through the Observatory of Food Prices. Import prices were collected from the quantities and values ​​imported by Spain classified by countries of origin. Results found significant price linkages at the import level and along the domestic value chain.

40|$|As {{processor}} reliability {{becomes a}} first order design con-straint, this research argues for {{a need to}} provide continu-ous reliability monitoring. We present an adaptive critical path monitoring architecture which provides accurate and real-time measure of the <b>processor’s</b> timing <b>margin</b> degra-dation. Special test patterns check a set of critical paths in the circuit-under-test. By activating the actual devices and signal paths used in normal operation of the chip, each test will capture up-to-date timing margin of these paths. The monitoring architecture dynamically adapts testing interval and complexity based on analysis of prior test results, which increases efficiency and accuracy of monitoring. Experi-mental results based on FPGA implementation show that the proposed monitoring unit can be easily integrated into existing designs. Monitoring overhead {{can be reduced to}} zero by scheduling tests only when a unit is idle...|$|R
40|$|Canola {{has become}} an {{important}} crop {{in the last decade}} in the U. S. Production of canola is risky and competes with other crops which have a range of risk reduction mechanisms. Alternative contracting strategies were evaluated by comparing returns to labor and management for growers and gross <b>margins</b> for <b>processors.</b> Alternative contracting strategies included no contract, fixed price with and without act of god provisions, and an oil premium contract. Grower returns and <b>processor</b> gross <b>margins</b> were simulated and resulting distributions were evaluated using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. We estimated certainty equivalents and ranked contract preferences for both growers and processors by region in North Dakota. Grower and processor risk preferences varied by region. Producers and processors preferences differed for contract alternatives in the Northwest, Northeast and Eastcentral regions and were in agreement in the Northcentral region. This suggests that development of a single contract that would be widely adopted across the state would likely have to be altered by region to be acceptable to growers and processors.

30|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} actual processing costs of milk in Malawi. According to Imani Development Consultants (2004) these vary by product and generally, the less the value added the less the processing cost. The margin is also related to the added value. According to the <b>processors,</b> the net <b>margin</b> on liquid pasteurised milk is as low as 5  % whereas this can be as high as 15  % for products which have higher added value such as cheese. For these products a much higher gross margin was reported, but due to high operational costs, especially electricity, water and transport costs within Malawi, the net margin is estimated at between 3 and 10  %. Supermarkets are reported to take a margin of 15 to 20  %. According to Imani Development Consultants the processing sector attains profits despite its high costs by targeting the affluent part of the urban population.|$|R
40|$|If generic {{advertising}} is effective at increasing {{the demand for}} the advertised product, then there {{will not only be}} direct effects on the sponsors of the advertising, but also indirect effects on other market participants. This article addresses two such distributional issues using the U. S. dairy industry as a case study. First, how are fluid milk and cheese processors impacted by cheese and milk advertising conducted by farmers? We find that the welfare of both processor classes is improved due to the dairy farmer advertising program for fluid milk and cheese products. Second, how are fluid milk (or cheese) processors impacted by the other product's farmer-funded advertising? As expected, own-product advertising increased equilibrium output levels, while cross-advertising impacts slightly reduced supply levels. Generic advertising, regardless of product, positively affected fluid milk <b>processor</b> gross <b>margins,</b> while increases in cheese advertising reduced the price <b>margin</b> for cheese <b>processors.</b> In general, own-product advertising had larger price margin impacts for fluid milk processors, while cheese processors benefited more from larger supply gains. These larger supply effects translated further into larger increases in raw milk costs tightening cheese price margins. Because changes in cheese supplies affect both Class I and Class III prices, input prices to processors are affected relatively more by increases in cheese advertising, as opposed to fluid milk advertising. The relatively larger gains in output prices, combined with lower relative increases in input class prices contributed to higher producer welfare impacts for fluid milk processors than cheese processors when confronted with equivalent increases in their own-product advertising.

40|$|The gross soybean {{processing}} margin (the gross return per bushel of soybeans processed) {{is the main}} decision variable that processors use in deciding when and if to make binding commitments to process soybeans on future dates. Understanding how <b>processors</b> choose processing <b>margins</b> for future processing dates from among those available on successive days may help to resolve the ongoing concern {{about the level of}} competitiveness in processing agricultural commodities. Processing returns are treated as being equivalent to the returns to a call option. This approach provides the opportunity to simulate processor choice of {{processing margin}} by evaluating the incentive of waiting for a larger processing margin versus the incentive of locking in the currently available processing margin for a future date. The approach captures the irreversibility of the decision to process soybeans. Once the decision is made to process soybeans it cannot be economically reversed because of the contractual penalties involved. Processing margins selected using evaluations of these incentives explained variation in soybean crush, whereas spot margins for the corresponding processing dates did not. real options, option exercise, processing decision, processing margins, futures prices, soybean crush, Crop Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} agro- food chains and agro- food {{consumer}} prices in Slovenia considering its European Union (EU) membership. As the Slovenian agro- food markets were distorted {{prior to the}} EU accession with some agro- food prices that were greater than comparable EU prices, the empirical results confirm that with the EU membership Slovenian real agro- food consumer prices have largely downward adjusted. Besides policy changes, internalization of retailing and distribution chains by entries of supermarket s and hypermarket s have had impacts on market structures and rationalization of marketing activities. Supermarket s and hypermarket s are taking over a substantial proportion of retail trade in agro- food products with implications on increasing food chains efficiency by squeezing structures in consumer prices, including for farmers, <b>processors</b> and marketing <b>margins</b> for main agro- food staples. After the greater price adjustment changes that occurred by the EU membership, some stabilizations in agro- food markets are occurring, but {{at different levels of}} real consumer and producer prices and marketing margins. This imply that agro- food markets in the new EU member states are becoming much more integrated into internationally competitive markets, where pricing and sales promotion issues and branding are taking important role in market segmentation of agro- food products.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) {{technique}} called Razor which incorporates an in situ error detection and correction mechanism to recover from timing errors. We also present the implementation details and silicon measurements results of a 64 -bit processor fabricated in 0. 18 - m technology that uses Razor for supply voltage control. Traditional DVS techniques require significant voltage safety margins to guar-antee computational correctness at the worst case combination of process, voltage and temperature conditions, leading to a loss in energy efficiency. In Razor-based DVS, however, the supply voltage is automatically reduced {{to the point of}} first failure using the error detection and correction mechanism, thereby eliminating safety margins while still ensuring correct operation. In addition, the supply voltage can be intentionally scaled below the point of first failure of the processor to achieve an optimal tradeoff between energy savings from further voltage reduction and energy overhead from increased error detection and correction activity. We tested and measured savings due to Razor DVS for 33 different dies and obtained an average energy savings of 50 % over worst case operating conditions by scaling supply voltage to achieve a 0. 1 % targeted error rate, at a fixed frequency of 120 MHz.
