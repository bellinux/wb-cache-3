25|$|<b>Paperweights</b> {{are used}} to hold down paper. A {{paperweight}} is often placed {{at the top of}} all but the largest pages to prevent slipping; for smaller pieces the left hand is also placed {{at the bottom of the}} page for support. <b>Paperweights</b> come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or pictorial designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals.

25|$|The missing {{double eagle}} was {{acquired}} by King Farouk of Egypt, who was a voracious collector of many things, including imperial Fabergé eggs, antique aspirin bottles, <b>paperweights,</b> postage stamps—and coins, {{of which he had}} a collection of over 8,500. In 1944 Farouk purchased a 1933 double eagle, and in strict adherence with the law, his ministers applied to the United States Treasury Department for an export license for the coin. Mistakenly, just days before the mint theft was discovered, the license was granted. The Treasury Department attempted to work through diplomatic channels to request the return of the coin from Egypt, but World War II delayed their efforts for several years. In 1952, King Farouk was deposed in a coup d'etat, and many of his possessions were made available for public auction (run by Sotheby's) – including the double eagle coin. The United States government requested the return of the coin, and the Egyptian government stated that it would comply with the request. However, the coin disappeared and was not seen again in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for <b>paperweights,</b> marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.|$|E

500|$|The {{striking}} {{form of the}} New South Wales waratah {{became a}} popular motif in Australian art {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century and was incorporated in art nouveau designs of the time. Matchboxes, <b>paperweights</b> and especially tins have been decorated with the flower. Arnott's often used the waratah as an alternative to their parrot logo on biscuit and cake tins from the early 1900s. Shelleys soft drinks, established in 1893 in Broken Hill, also displayed it on their label. The French artist Lucien Henry, who had settled in Sydney in 1879, was a strong proponent of a definitive Australian art style incorporating local flora, particularly the waratah. [...] His most famous surviving work is a triptych stained glass window of Oceania flanked by numerous waratahs overlooking the Centennial Hall in Sydney Town Hall.|$|E
500|$|Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{had long}} been {{interested}} in finding Titanic. Despite early negotiations with possible backers being abandoned when it emerged {{that they wanted to}} turn the wreck into souvenir <b>paperweights,</b> more sympathetic backers joined Ballard to form a company named Seasonics International Ltd. as a vehicle for rediscovering and exploring Titanic. In October 1977 he made his first attempt to find the ship with the aid of the Alcoa Corporation's deep sea salvage vessel Seaprobe. This was essentially a drillship with sonar equipment and cameras attached {{to the end of the}} drilling pipe. It could lift objects from the seabed using a remote-controlled mechanical claw. The expedition ended in failure when the drilling pipe broke, sending [...] of pipe and $600,000 worth of electronics plunging to the sea bed.|$|E
500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and <b>paperweights.</b> His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that I looked at it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, and I took it to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese {{calligraphy}} {{is a form}} of aesthetically pleasing writing (calligraphy), or, {{the artistic}} expression of human language in a tangible form. This type of expression has been widely practiced in China and has been generally highly esteemed in the Chinese cultural sphere (including, historically, for example, [...] Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam). There are some general standardizations of the various styles of calligraphy in this tradition. Chinese calligraphy and ink and wash painting are closely related: they are accomplished using similar tools and techniques, and {{have a long history of}} shared artistry. Distinguishing features of Chinese painting and calligraphy include an [...] emphasis on motion charged with dynamic life. According to Stanley-Baker, [...] "Calligraphy is sheer life experienced through energy in motion that is registered as traces on silk or paper, with time and rhythm in shifting space its main ingredients." [...] Calligraphy has also led to the development of many forms of art in China, including seal carving, ornate <b>paperweights,</b> and inkstones.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the Mexican {{government}} decided that its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic citizens {{should not be}} subjected to proselytizing and banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80 percent of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station KDAY 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. However, Smith capitalized on his fame by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, {{becoming one of the}} first rock and roll syndicated programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually also marketed to oldies stations). He also appeared on Armed Forces Radio from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries. He was heard as far off as the Wild Coast, Transkei, on a station based there, Capital Radio 604. [...] In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, The Wolfman was paid handsomely to join WNBC in New York in August 1973, the same month that American Graffiti premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers stating that the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, WABC, which had [...] "Cousin Brucie" [...] (Bruce Morrow). The ads proclaimed, [...] "Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered", and thousands of small tombstone-shaped <b>paperweights</b> were distributed that said, [...] "Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack"., After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984-1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family. [...] In the 80s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robet Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas. [...] Ryman and legendary programmer Buzz Bennet rocketed the station to fame.|$|E

6000|$|These Japanese {{are indeed}} the apostles of cheapness. The Greeks lived {{to teach the}} world beauty, the Hebrews to teach it morality, and now the Japanese are {{hammering}} in the lesson that men may be honourable, daily life delightful, and a nation great without either freestone houses, marble mantelpieces, or mahogany sideboards. I have sometimes wished that my Aunt Charlotte could have travelled among the Japanese nation. She would, I know, have called it a [...] "parcel of trash." [...] Their use of paper--paper suits, paper pocket-handkerchiefs--would have made her rigid with contempt. I have tried, but I cannot imagine my Aunt Charlotte in paper underclothing. Her aversion to paper was extraordinary. Her Book of Beauty was printed on satin, and all her books were bound in leather, the boards regulated rather than decorated with a severe oblong. Her proper sphere was among the ancient Babylonians, among which massive populace even the newspapers were built of brick. She would have compared with the King's daughter whose raiment was of wrought gold. When I {{was a little boy}} I used to think she had a mahogany skeleton. However, she is gone, poor old lady, and at least she left me her furniture. Her ghost was torn in pieces after the sale--must have been. Even the old china went this way and that. I took what was perhaps a mean revenge of her for the innumerable black-holeings, bread-and-water dinners, summary chastisements, and impossible tasks she inflicted upon me for offences against her too solid possessions. You will see it at Woking. It is a light and graceful cross. It is a mere speck of white between the monstrous granite <b>paperweights</b> that oppress the dead on either side of her. Sometimes I am half sorry for that. When the end comes I shall not care to look her in the face--she will be so humiliated.|$|E
60|$|From {{talks with}} certain of our {{passengers}} whose home was Honolulu, {{and from a}} sketch by Mrs. Mary H. Krout, I was able to perceive what the Honolulu of to-day is, {{as compared with the}} Honolulu of my time. In my time it was a beautiful little town, made up of snow-white wooden cottages deliciously smothered in tropical vines and flowers and trees and shrubs; and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth, and as white as the houses. The outside aspects of the place suggested the presence of a modest and comfortable prosperity--a general prosperity --perhaps one might strengthen the term and say universal. There were no fine houses, no fine furniture. There were no decorations. Tallow candles furnished the light for the bedrooms, a whale-oil lamp furnished it for the parlor. Native matting served as carpeting. In the parlor one would find two or three lithographs on the walls--portraits as a rule: Kamehameha IV., Louis Kossuth, Jenny Lind; and may be an engraving or two: Rebecca at the Well, Moses smiting the rock, Joseph's servants finding the cup in Benjamin's sack. There would be a center table, with books of a tranquil sort on it: The Whole Duty of Man, Baxter's Saints' Rest, Fox's Martyrs, Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, bound copies of The Missionary Herald and of Father Damon's Seaman's Friend. A melodeon; a music stand, with 'Willie, We have Missed You', 'Star of the Evening', 'Roll on Silver Moon', 'Are We Most There', 'I Would not Live Alway', and other songs of love and sentiment, together with an assortment of hymns. A what-not with semi-globular glass <b>paperweights,</b> enclosing miniature pictures of ships, New England rural snowstorms, and the like; sea-shells with Bible texts carved on them in cameo style; native curios; whale's tooth with full-rigged ship carved on it. There was nothing reminiscent of foreign parts, for nobody had been abroad. Trips were made to San Francisco, but that could not be called going abroad. Comprehensively speaking, nobody traveled.|$|E
50|$|Victorian {{portrait}} {{and advertising}} <b>paperweights</b> were dome glass <b>paperweights</b> first made in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania using a process patented in 1882 by William H. Maxwell. The portrait <b>paperweights</b> contained pictures {{of ordinary people}} reproduced on a milk glass disk and encased within clear glass. This same process was also used to produce <b>paperweights</b> with the owner's name encased or an advertisement of a business or product. Pittsburgher Albert A. Graeser, patented a different process for making advertising <b>paperweights</b> in 1892. The Graeser process involved sealing an image to the underside of a rectangular glass blank using a milkglass or enamellike glaze. Many <b>paperweights</b> of the late 19th century are marked either J. N. Abrams or Barnes and Abrams and may list either the 1882 Maxwell or 1892 Graeser patent date. It has been theorized that Barnes and Abrams did not actually manufacture advertising <b>paperweights</b> for their customers, but instead subcontracted the actual manufacturing task out to Pittsburgh area glasshouses. The Paperweight Collectors Association Annual Bulletins published for 2000, 2001 and 2002 describe these in detail.|$|E

50|$|A <b>paperweight</b> {{is a small}} solid object {{which is}} placed on top of papers {{to keep them from}} blowing in the breeze or to keep a sheet from moving when {{painting}} with a brush (as with Japanese calligraphy). Paper, due to its light weight and large surface area, has a tendency to move easily when pushed by a slight breeze, which can create disorder on a work surface. Due to its greater density and compact shape relative to paper, a <b>paperweight,</b> when placed on top of one or more sheets of paper, will prevent the paper from moving. The object need not be particularly heavy itself to perform its function. Any small object, such as a cup or a stone, can serve as a <b>paperweight,</b> but decorative objects have been created specifically for this purpose.|$|R
