The {{material}} to be refined is pumped into the chamber at high-pressure rate in order to create an abrasive effect as the material is forced through the machine, abraided by the metal bars.

40|$|The {{turbulence}} generator is a {{key component}} of medium consistency centrifugal <b>pulp</b> <b>pumps,</b> with functions to fluidize the medium consistency pulp and to separate gas from the liquid. Structure sizes of the generator affect the hydraulic performance. The radius and the blade laying angle are two important structural sizes of a turbulence generator. Starting with the research on the flow inside and shearing characteristics of the MC pulp, a simple mathematical model at the flow section of the shearing chamber is built, and the formula and procedure to calculate the radius of the turbulence generator are established. The blade laying angle is referenced from the turbine agitator which has the similar shape with the turbulence generator, and the CFD simulation is applied to study the different flow fields with different blade laying angles. Then the recommended blade laying angle of the turbulence generator is formed to be between 60 ° and 75 °...|$|R
50|$|Bleached kraft is {{received}} in bales from Canadian mills. Fork trucks deliver a six-bale stack to bale handling equipment for destacking and dewiring. A dewiring system, the first automatic {{one in the}} industry, dewires bales before they are dumped from the conveyor to the pulper; the slush <b>pulp</b> is then <b>pumped</b> to a soak chest, refiners, and storage tank.|$|R
40|$|When {{the mass}} {{concentration}} exceeds 7 %, pulp suspensions stop flowing {{and act like}} a solid. To investigate the fluidization characteristics of medium-high-consistency pulp suspensions and achieve <b>pulp</b> fluidization and <b>pumping,</b> experiments were carried out with waste tissue pulp and unbleached kraft pulp. The objectives of this paper were to study the rheology of medium-high-consistency pulp and to determine accurate parameters for the physical Herschel-Bulkley model. To validate this model, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results were compared to experimental data. The simulation values were very similar and were in agreement with experimental results...|$|R
50|$|From {{high density}} storage or from slusher/pulper the <b>pulp</b> is <b>pumped</b> {{to a low}} density storage chest (tank). From there it is {{typically}} diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest. From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner. Refining is an operation whereby the pulp slurry passes between a pair of discs, {{one of which is}} stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60 Hz AC, respectively. The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance. This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the fibrils of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength. For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 49 A {{case history}} is {{presented}} pertaining to piping vibrations {{in a medium}} consistency paper <b>pulp</b> <b>pumping</b> system at a large North American integrated pulp and paper mill that ultimately resulted in pipe rupture. The system was designed to transfer pulp at 12 percent oven-dry consistency (12 percent fiber- 88 percent water by mass) from a washer stage to a storage tower through nearly 700 ft of 20 in diameter pipe. Testing and analyses were performed on the system to diagnose the problem and develop a solution to reduce the piping vibrations and prevent further failures. Initial tests on the system indicated the piping had pressure pulsations of between 50 psi and 100 psi peak-to-peak which were exerting a shaking force of approximately 15, 000 lb to 30, 000 lb peak-to-peak at each seventeen 90 degree elbows in the piping system. The frequencies of the major pressure pulsations were at 1. 3 Hz and 3. 8 Hz, which corresponds to the one-quarter and three-quarter (closed-open piping system) standing pressure waves in the piping system. These forces produced by the pulsation caused the piping system to respond at the natural frequencies of the pipe and support structure at each section of the pipe system. Attempts to reduce the amplitudes at the standing wave frequencies with attenuators (valve or shear plates) {{at the end of}} the pipeline were not successful due to the natures of the pulp and flow pulsation problems. Some success was achieved by changing the standing wave (acoustic) frequency with the addition of gas to the pulp in order to change the bulk density, but this was deemed an impractical solution. The problem was diagnosed as an interaction between the control system and the piping system. The source of the pulsation energy was traced to the control valve location immediately downstream of the centrifugal pump. Strouhal vortex shedding frequencies were generated at the exit of the control valve ball which excited acoustic standing waves in this particular piping system and amplified the pressure pulsations. Evidence is presented that shows that the pulsation amplitude was dependent upon the valve ball position and motion; therefore, the valve was removed and an alternate method of system control with a different mechanism was used that eliminated the source of the harmful pulsations. The authors present application guidelines intended to assist the reader in evaluating pipe system designs for potential of standing wave excitation. The Strouhal vortex energy from the control valve is discussed. Also, the calculation of acoustic velocity is covered including the effects of temperature, entrained air, and pulp consistency...|$|R

40|$|The {{project was}} {{performed}} at Siemens Industry Drive Technologies {{with the objective}} to provide actual values for the energy savings potential within Siemens scope of practice. In Sweden the electrical drives stand for about 30 % of the total electricity consumption and about 60 % of the electricity consumption within the industry. During the pre-study phase electrical drives with pump applications were identified as large energy users. Because of this a case study at one of Siemens customers, Stora Enso Fors was performed. The system that was evaluated during the case study was a throttled system with a centrifugal <b>pump</b> for <b>pumping</b> <b>pulp.</b> The results yielded that a saving of over 50 % could be achieved by replacing the throttle valve with a variable speed drive, a frequency converter. The payback period was two years and two months and the present value for the total life cycle cost of the variable speed system was 662. 566 SEK lower than for the throttled system. As a consequence, Stora Enso Fors is advised {{to invest in a}} frequency converter for regulation of the system. The general conclusion is that a focus on system efficiency is {{the most important factor in}} energy efficiency projects and that the system regulation method has a large impact on the overall system losses and hence its efficiency. Energy efficiency potential for throttled systems with centrifugal pumps is large and significant economical savings can be made through investments with short payback time...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. At Mondi Paper Ltd, Merebank, South of Durban, Paper Machine 2 has {{recently}} been transferred onto a Distributed Control System (DCS). This {{was seen as a}} good opportunity to enhance the control of the pulp feed to the machine. A prime concern in operating a paper machine is to ensure consistent set-point paper properties in the Cross-Direction (CD: ie. across the paper width) and in the Machine-Direction (MD: ie. along the paper length). Sophisticated adjustments are available to ensure an even feed of the stock (consistencies around 2 % m/m wood fibres in water) from the head-box across the receiving width of the paper machine. The properties of prime interest as the <b>pulp</b> is <b>pumped</b> through the head-box distributor onto the receiving belt of the machine are the basis weight (fibre mass per unit area) and moisture content (per unit area). However, the distribution system is highly dependent on the properties of the stock as it arrives at the head-box. Variations in upstream chest levels, the supplied pressure, flow-rate and fibre/water ratio, all cause MD and even CD variations. The problems of maintaining steady conditions at the head-box are well known, and are understood to arise from sub-optimal control in the preceding section involving a blend chest and machine chest, amongst other items, where several pulp streams and dilution water are combined. A number of control loops are involved, but appear to require different tuning for different paper grades. Often individual loops are taken off-line. In this study, an understanding of the controller interactions in the stock preparation section has been developed by detailed dynamic modelling, including all of the existing control loops. The model is built up in a modular fashion using a basic element, having one input (which can collect multiple streams originating elsewhere) and four outputs, linked through a vessel of variable volume. Several basic elements are linked together to form the overall system. All of the necessary properties can be defined so that the model allows the simulation of all features of the network: vessels, pipes, junctions, valves, levels and consistencies. A set of first order differential equations is solved which includes total water balance, species mass balances, derivatives of flow controller action, and derivatives of supervisory controller action. Supervisory controllers for consistency or level cascade onto flow controllers. Flow controllers manipulate valves which give a first-order dynamic response of actual flow. Where valves are manipulated directly by the supervisory level, the flow controller is effectively bypassed. This study involves a constraint problem around the blend chest, resulting in a loss of specification at the paper machine. This was solved by the implementation of a static optimiser. Its objective function penalizes deviations from setpoint of five parameters (ratios, consistency and level) using respective weight factors. Both the model and its optimiser were included in a simulator designed with the graphical user interface (GUI) of Matlab. The simulator has then been used to explore control performance over the operating range, by means of a set of scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{to gain a better}} {{understanding}} of the changes occurring in softwood strength properties and fiber wall structure after mechanical treatment was applied to the chip/fiber matrix during kraft cooking. Mechanical treatment of fibers during industrial and laboratory production of pulp is common. In the pulp mill the <b>pulp</b> is mixed, <b>pumped</b> and shear forces are applied to the fiber at different temperatures and under different chemical conditions. The main objective of this research was to investigate the reasons for fiber strength loss and to examine the changes that really affect fiber strength. Fiber damage, changes in the fiber wall structure, reduced single softwood kraft fiber strength and fiber deformations (curl, kinks and dislocations) all affected the fiber network properties. Mechanical treatment at the end of kraft cooking conditions resulted in fiber damage such that single fiber strength was reduced. This increased with increasing treatment temperature. It was concluded that both mechanical treatment at the end of cooking and homogenisation at room temperature of kraft pulp fibers increased the number of fiber deformations. The increase in fiber deformations did not reduce single fiber strength but did affect the strength properties of the fiber network. The fiber damage induced by mechanical treatment also decreased the z-directional strength of the fiber network, which was concluded to be due to separation of the structural elements on the fiber surface layer. The separation of structural elements could enhance the irregularities on the fiber surface layer and so reduce the bonding area. The bulking of the fiber surface layer, e. g. more separated layers, might reduce the ability to resist z-directional stresses. The effect of mechanical treatment on spruce fibers was more severe than on the corresponding pine fibers. The spruce fibers developed more deformations and damage as a result of mechanical treatment. The reasons for the lower bonding and strength properties of the damaged fibers could be due to differences in the fiber wall structures of spruce and pine. Overall the results suggested that fiber damage induced by mechanical treatment during cooking changed the fiber wall pore structure in such a way that the number of links (between fibrill aggregates) in the fibril (aggregate) skeleton of the fiber wall decreased. The reduced contact in the fibril aggregate skeleton of the fiber wall (because of fewer restrictions) affected the cell wall structure so that it could no longer support stresses in the fiber network. The zero-span tensile strength of fibers was not dependent on the degree of fiber deformation, but according to the hypothesis presented above, on the 3 -dimensional arrangement of the structural elements in the fiber wall. This 3 -dimensional arrangement of the structural elements in the fiber wall defines the axial load bearing ability of the softwood kraft fiber. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the {{development}} of an efficient system that can simultaneously pump and separate a gas-liquid mixture, in particular an oil-air mixture. Two-phase flows are encountered in many applications (petroleum extraction, flow in nuclear power plant <b>pumps,</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper processing, etc.) but this study is mainly focused on lubrication systems of aircraft gas turbine engines. The pump and separator system (PASS) for two-phase flows developed in this PhD thesis aims to perform three functions simultaneously: • Send back the oil to the tank (oil pumping) • Separate the air from the oil (de-aeration) • Separate the oil from the air (de-oiling) and release the sealing air into the atmosphere (venting). Particular care is given to the liquid flow rate lost at the gas outlet of the system. Consequently, it could replace the scavenge pumps and oil-air separators existing in present lubrication systems. This modification provides several advantages: simplification of the lubrication circuit, reduction of oil consumption and {{of the size of the}} lubrication system. This research is divided into three axes: the theoretical study of the important physical mechanisms taking place inside the two-phase flow pump and separator system, the experimental development, tests and optimization of different PASS prototypes, and also the numerical simulations of the two-phase flow inside these prototypes. Although the experiments were the central pillar of this research, the three axes were closely imbricated. The PASS design includes three main components: • An inlet chamber with one or several tangential inlets giving a natural centrifugation to the flow, • An impeller (forced centrifugation) with an axial and a radial part followed by a volute chamber, • A metallic foam that lets pass micron and sub-micron droplets and which is followed by an axial vent port. The centrifugation causes the liquid (oil) to move radially outwards in an annular body (a liquid ring) generating pressure. The thickness of this liquid ring inside the impeller is mainly determined by the pressure coefficient (related to the back-pressure and the rotational speed). When the back-pressure increases, the thickness of the liquid ring increases too. An advantage of the PASS is that it does not impose any relation between the liquid head and the liquid flow rate, contrary to common centrifugal pump. It self-regulates the radial position of the gas-liquid interface to sustain the operating conditions. The de-aeration efficiency mainly depends on the pressure coefficient (for a constant liquid viscosity or temperature) or on the thickness of the liquid ring. The pressure gradient which appears in the liquid rotating in an annular body acts like a dam for the gas phase. Indeed, the gas movement is mainly determined by the pressure field (buoyancy) while the liquid distribution is dominated by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Buoyancy tends to accumulate the gas phase near low pressure areas (PASS hub, suction side of the blades, clearances between closed impeller and casing). The first oil-air PASS prototype produces high viscous losses due to the high peripheral velocity and liquid viscosity. Therefore, the pumping efficiency is poor compared to common impeller pumps. However, the pumping is not the key function of the PASS and a power consumption below 5 kW is acceptable for the application considered in this work. For applications that require lower power consumptions, a reduction of the rotational speed must be considered. Thus, the rotational speed and the impeller diameter are two major constraints for the PASS design which determine the de-aeration and pumping efficiencies. The impeller diameter also influences the size of passage sections for the air flow. The air velocity must be kept as low as possible because the entrainment of droplets increases when the air velocity rises (drag forces on droplets). Indeed, this large influence of the air flow rate on the oil consumption (de-oiling efficiency) was demonstrated by a theoretical analysis, the experiments and the CFD simulations. The production of droplets in the inlet pipes when the two-phase flow is annular is a key phenomenon regarding the oil consumption. In addition to the air flow rate, other variables also influence the oil consumption: • Air-oil temperature: when the temperature rises, the oil consumption increases because the surface tension and the oil density are reduced. Moreover, as the air density also decreases, the air velocity rises. • Oil flow rate: the oil consumption rises more or less linearly with the oil flow rate. However, the influence of the oil flow rate on the inlet droplet size is uncertain. • Rotational speed: the rotational speed has obviously a strong impact on the oil consumption without metallic foam. However, experiments showed that the metallic foam efficiency is almost independent on the rotational speed. Therefore, the oil consumption with the Retimet foam does not depend on the PASS rotational speed. • Altitude or air density: the oil consumption decreases when the air density is reduced because the drag forces on droplets also decrease. The gas density (altitude) is also supposed to influence the de-aeration efficiency but this could not be tested or simulated in this work (the de-aeration efficiency gets probably better when decreasing the gas density because the buoyancy forces increase). Theory, experiments and numerical simulations also allowed the prediction of performance of the first oil-air prototype for real in-flight operating conditions. Two problems have been identified: the de-aeration efficiency at MTO and cruise ratings and the oil leak throughout the vent in cold start and windmilling. To solve them, some modifications of the lubrication system have been suggested. With these modifications, the oil-air PASS should become very efficient and attractive for engine manufacturers.
