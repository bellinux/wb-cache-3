50|$|To use Redux in its liquid/powder form, a {{thin film}} of the {{phenolic}} liquid is applied to both mating surfaces and then dusted with or dipped in the PVF powder to give an approximate ratio by weight of 1 part liquid to 2 parts powder. The coated joints are then allowed to stand for not less than 30 minutes and not more than 72 hours before the components are brought together under elevated pressure and temperature. The curing process is by condensation and a typical figure for Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775 is 30 minutes at 145 °C (293 °F) under a pressure of 100 lbf/in2 (690 kPa). This is not critical and variations in curing-time and/or temperature {{may be used to}} increase shear and creep strength at temperatures above 60 °C (140 °F). Extending the curing cycle gives benefits in fatigue strength at some cost in the room-temperature <b>peel</b> <b>strength,</b> the practical limit for aluminium alloys being approx 170 °C (338 °F) for one hour, due to the possibility of affecting the alloy's mechanical properties.|$|E

The effect of different rare earth and their different contents on the stripping property of ultra-thin copper foil with carrier when they are added in the H-G plating solution is investigated, and the influence of rare earth on the cathodic polarization curves and cyclic voltammetry curves of H-G alloy during its electrodeposition is analyzed too. Results show that rare earth elements of La, Sm, Y and Ce increase the <b>peeling</b> <b>strength</b> between ultra-thin copper foil and carrier to a certain extent and the <b>peeling</b> <b>strength</b> is increased from 0. 13 kgf •cm- 1 to the range of 0. 16 ~ 0. 20 kgf •c...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{resistance}} welding bonds: solid state, fusion, and reflow braze. In a solid state bond, also called a thermo-compression bond, dissimilar materials with dissimilar grain structure, e.g. molybdenum to tungsten, are joined using {{a very short}} heating time, high weld energy, and high force. There is little melting and minimum grain growth, but a definite bond and grain interface. Thus the materials actually bond while still in the solid state. The bonded materials typically exhibit excellent shear and tensile strength, but poor <b>peel</b> <b>strength.</b> In a fusion bond, either similar or dissimilar materials with similar grain structures are heated to the melting point (liquid state) of both. The subsequent cooling and combination of the materials forms a “nugget” alloy of the two materials with larger grain growth. Typically, high weld energies at either short or long weld times, depending on physical characteristics, are used to produce fusion bonds. The bonded materials usually exhibit excellent tensile, peel and shear strengths. In a reflow braze bond, a resistance heating of a low temperature brazing material, such as gold or solder, is used to join either dissimilar materials or widely varied thick/thin material combinations. The brazing material must “wet” to each part and possess a lower melting point than the two workpieces. The resultant bond has definite interfaces with minimum grain growth. Typically the process requires a longer (2 to 100 ms) heating time at low weld energy. The resultant bond exhibits excellent tensile strength, but poor peel and shear strength.|$|E
30|$|However, at high temperature, the {{cohesive}} failure {{increases in the}} CPTs, allowing {{to make a distinction}} between different adhesives. The <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> in the CPTs is linearly related with the <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> from the FRPTs. This means that, if the major failure mode is cohesive, an adhesive which has a relatively high <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> in Aluminium peel tests, it will also have a relatively high <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> in composite peel tests. This can be observed when comparing for example the adhesive Sup 10 HT with the adhesive AF 163 - 2. For FRPT, AF 163 - 2 has higher <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> than Sup 10 HT, and the same happens for CPT at high temperatures when {{cohesive failure}} is the dominant failure mode. If the failure mode is cohesive, the comparison between adhesives’ <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> is consistent disregarding of the type of peel-off adherend.|$|E
30|$|Differences in <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> (with 100 % {{cohesive}} failure) {{results from}} different ductilities of the adhesive material: higher ductility results in higher peel strengths. Therefore, from {{what has been}} written previously, AF 163 - 2 is more ductile than Sup 10 HT, since the <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> of 100 %CF of AF 163 - 2 {{is higher than the}} <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> of 100 %CF of Sup 10 HT. This conclusion is supported by the fracture surfaces analyses in SEM hereafter.|$|E

When the bonding temperature is increased below 973 K,the <b>peeling</b> <b>strength</b> of the aluminium with the AlN ceramic substrate rises linearly. While the bonding temperature is above 973 K, the temperature influence on the bonding strength is not significant.

30|$|The {{difference}} between the <b>peel</b> <b>strengths</b> obtained from floating roller peel tests and composite peel tests for joints with the same failure modes are due to the differences in stiffness and ductility of the peeling-off adherend and not due to different bond quality.|$|R

Higher or lower surface roughness can reduce the adhesive strength of FWC.

40|$|Fusibles {{are used}} to improve the {{aesthetic}} and performance characteristics of wool fabrics. The <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> of fused composites determines the durability of the pressing operation and they are influenced from the process conditions, the characteristics of fusible interlining and the fabric to whom they are sticked to. In this study, it was aimed to analyze the effect of fusible type and process conditions, weave type and different elastane compositions on <b>peel</b> <b>strength.</b> To this aim, two fusible types combined with eight different types of wool fabrics having different amount of elastane were studied. It was found out that only the fusible type and the process conditions are confirmed statistically that they influence the <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> values. Nonetheless, it was observed as the elastane composition increased, the <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> values tend to increase for twill type of fabrics and tend to decrease for plain type of fabrics. Moreover, the influence of composition may be in different direction when different type of Fusibles is used to form fusible composites. In conclusion, it can be stated that the dominant mechanism in determination of the <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> is the selection of fusible type and suitable process conditions for this fusible type and more investigations are necessary if {{the composition of the}} material is also influential on the <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> because of its compatibility with the fusible interlining. ...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{structural}} laminates made of titanium {{foil and}} carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite offer {{a potential for}} improved performance in aircraft structural applications. To obtain information needed for the automated fabrication of hybrid laminates, a series of bench scale tests were conducted of the magnetic induction bonding of titanium foil and thermoplastic prepreg tape. Foil and prepreg specimens {{were placed in the}} gap of a toroid magnet mounted in a bench press. Several magnet power supplies were used to study power at levels from 0. 5 to 1. 75 kW and frequencies from 50 to 120 kHz. Sol-gel surface-treated titanium foil, 0. 0125 cm thick, and PIXA/IM 7 prepreg tape were used in several lay-up configurations. Data were obtained on wedge <b>peel</b> bond <b>strength,</b> heating rate, and temperature ramp over a range of magnet power levels and frequencies at different "power-on" times for several magnet gap dimensions.

30|$|Considering the CPT {{fracture}} surfaces (2 nd row), {{the three}} failure modes can be observed: intra-laminar of the composite (ILFC), adhesive failure (AF) and cohesive failure (CF). The fracture {{surface of the}} cohesive failure has the same characteristics as for the CF observed for the FRPT. This means that the fracture mechanism of the CF is independent of the peeling-off adherend (composite or Aluminium). This supports the conclusion taken previously from Figure 8, the strength resulting from the same fracture mechanisms is comparable disregarding of the peel-off adherend. This has been observed for the results at HT when comparing, for example, AF 163 - 2 with Sup 10 HT. Disregarding the peel tests used, AF 163 - 2 has higher <b>peel</b> <b>strengths</b> than Sup 10 HT. This also supports the conclusion that, {{the difference between the}} <b>peel</b> <b>strengths</b> obtained from FRPT and CPT for bonded joints with the same failure modes are due to the differences in stiffness and ductility of the peeling off adherend and not due to lower cohesive strength.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesives (PSAs) with different monomer composition was prepared using emulsion polymerisation. The monomers were butyl- acrylate (BA), 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate (2 -HEA), acrylic acid (AA) and 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate (2 -EHA). The adhesive performance was studied at 4 %, 8 % and 12 % 2 -EHA content based on total monomer (BOTM) composition.

Comparing the effects of chemical swelling solvents on the <b>peeling</b> <b>strength</b> between copper foils and base plates from PCBs, solvent D, solvent F, acetone and water were selected as the typical chemical swelling solvents. After chemical swelling treatment, the monomer liberation degree and scrapping time were further investigated to obtain particles with certain size distribution. The experimental results showed that scrapping after chemical swelling treatment could remarkably increase the monomer liberation degree of metals. The chemical swelling effects of the four solvents were in the sequence solvent D > solvent F > acetone > water.

Peel loads can only be compared if using exactly the same type of flexible adherend (peeling off member). Only then, peel loads can be used as an indication of adhesion properties.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to find rubber compound adhesive formula for preparing leather shoes of direct vulcanizing process. Leather shoes manufactured by vulcanizing process need a suitable rubber compound adhesive for joining the leather uppers and unvulcanized rubber compound soles. The amount of tackifier in rubber compound adhesive influence the adhesive bonding strength. In preparing the adhesive formula, the effect of coumarone resin addition as tackifier were varies in the mount of 5, 10 and 15 phr respectively. Rubber compound adhesive was produced by two roll mill machine, after that compound were dissolved in wash benzene with ratio 1 : 10. The prepared adhesive then was applied to manufacture leather shoes using vulcanization moulding at temperature 1700 C and 150 kg/cm 2 pressure for 8 minutes.

The interface morphology, element distribution and bonding {{strength of the}} clad sheets after different annealing and cold rolling processes were investigated using optical microscopy, electron probe micro-analyzer and T-type peel test. The surfaces of the steel and aluminum sheets after peeling were studied using scanning electron microscopy. In the as-cast clad sheet, a 3 μm thick diffusional layer exists at the Fe/Al interface. The average <b>peel</b> <b>strength</b> is 12 N/mm. Suitable annealing treatment can greatly improve the bonding quality of the interface.
