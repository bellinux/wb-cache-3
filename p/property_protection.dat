Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual <b>property</b> <b>protection,</b> prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E

25|$|Being able to {{incorporate}} the sedimentary budget into a coastal management plan is becoming critical, especially in today's world {{where the majority of}} populations are living and owning property very close to the coast. One of the essential components drawn from sediment budget is being able to predict the morphological change that is likely to occur to a coastline over time, especially when creating plans associated with major environmental change such as sea level rise. Incorporating a sediment budget into a coastal plan has been recognised as highly important in the Hawke's Bay of New Zealand for finding information relating to hazard zones, beach <b>property</b> <b>protection,</b> and coastal erosion as well as assess the successfulness of current management strategies. The major setback with using the sediment budget for management and what is probably the underlining issue regarding the sediment budget is its complexity.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s and 1990s saw a {{range of}} {{inquiries}} into many aspects of copyright law. A key driver for those reviews was {{the establishment of the}} Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) in 1983 as an advisory body for copyright reform. The CLRC was disbanded in 2005 by the Australian government after it had produced a number of reports. Notable reports include: The meaning of Publication in the Copyright Act (1984), Use of Copyright materials by Churches (1985), Performers' Protection (1987), Moral Rights (1988), Report of Journalists' Copyright (1994), Computer Software Protection (1994), Simplification of the Copyright Act: Part 1 (1998), Simplification of the Copyright Act: Part 2 (1999), Jurisdiction and Procedures of the Copyright Tribunal (2002), Copyright and Contract (2002) and Crown Copyright (2005). The CLRC also published reports on specific areas of copyright, including Highways to Change: Copyright in the New Communications Environment: report by the Copyright Convergence Group on technological advancement and the ability of legislation to cope with change (1994), Stopping the Rip-Offs: intellectual <b>Property</b> <b>Protection</b> for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Peoples (1994), the Simpson Report 1995, long title Review of Australian Copyright Collecting Societies, the Bently and Sherman Report 1995, long title Performers' Rights: Options for Reform, the Janke Report 1999, long title Our Culture, Our Future, and the Ergas Report 2000, long title Report on Intellectual Property legislation under Competition Principles Agreement.|$|E
