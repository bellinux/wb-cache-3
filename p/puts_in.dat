5|$|Sawyer is in prison, {{trying to}} befriend Munson (Ian Gomez), {{a man who}} has hidden ten million dollars. He warns Munson that the warden (Bill Duke) is trying to con him out of his money. Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he <b>puts</b> <b>in</b> a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison.|$|E

25|$|In a {{partnership}} or joint venture where money is lent, the creditor only provides the capital yet is guaranteed {{a fixed amount}} of profit. The debtor, however, <b>puts</b> <b>in</b> time and effort, but is made to bear the risk of loss. Muslim scholars argue that such practice is unjust. As an alternative to usury, Islam strongly encourages charity and direct investment in which the creditor shares whatever profit or loss the business may incur (in modern terms, this amounts to an equity stake in the business).|$|E

25|$|We {{question}} ourselves {{how such}} a law can claim to guarantee human rights when it goes against the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it <b>puts</b> <b>in</b> danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible {{with the concept of}} tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.|$|E
25|$|During the {{successive}} Muslim offensives in 1116 and 1117 castles Castelo de Miranda do Corvo and Castelo de Santa Eulália were conquered and destroyed, which caused the desertion of castle Castelo de Soure. These castles provided {{a line of}} defence for Coimbra region and now castle Penela was threatened. Perhaps this position was also lost, which would explain king Afonso I Henriques assaulting it in 1129, although this version is not supported by any sources. There are documents attributed to the period when a Chart of Foral was granted to the town, which reference a donation of a house inside the castle dated by 1145. This <b>puts</b> <b>in</b> question the assertion that the castle was conquered in 1148, as it is claimed by historian Frei António Brandão (Monarchia Lusitana, 1632), which is also improbable in context of the Conquest of Santarém, and Lisbon since 1147 when the line of Muslim defences was pushed to river Sado.|$|E

500|$|... "Ghost of a Chance" [...] {{marked a}} {{development}} of Beau Felton's character by identifying {{not only his}} trademark bullying nature, but a kinder and sweeter side of his personality.

Howard's superstitious beliefs reappear in future episodes, particularly the [...] episode [...] "Heartbeat", which featured a black cat inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story, [...] "The Black Cat". A scene in which a busload of rookie police officers {{straight out of the}} academy are brought in to investigate the Adena Watson crime scene was inspired by strategies used by real police departments; the New York Police Department employed exactly the same tactic while searching for the remains of a missing girl in upstate New York in 1987.|$|E

Ian Nathan of Empire called the film [...] "A diabolical treat with Rourke and De Niro in top form." [...] Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote, [...] "The movie maintains intrigue at every turn and Rourke is spellbinding. Robert De Niro, Charlotte Rampling, and the assembled cast are all excellent. But this is Mickey Rourke's movie, and he <b>puts</b> <b>in</b> a mesmerising performance." [...] Richard Luck, writing for Film4, concluded in his review, [...] "The book's so good it deserves a better movie, but Rourke's performance is such that Angel Heart stands out from the necromancy movie crowd." ...|$|E

He also praised the supporting stories, claiming that [...] "Matthew Fox does a great job of playing the uneasy leader" [...] as Jack Shephard and that the Shannon-Charlie storyline [...] "does supply a little comic relief". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it described the revelation that Locke was a paraplegic as being [...] "one of the show's signature moments", and commented that the episode [...] "cemented the show as 'Must-See TV'" [...] and was [...] "a five-star effort." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today gave a mixed {{review of}} the collaboration, [...] commenting, [...] "Eminem <b>puts</b> <b>in</b> a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a {{tortured}} relationship from his Recovery album." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave a negative {{review of the}} song, stating, [...] "She collaborated with Eminem this summer on the controversial '"Love the Way You Lie"', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on [...] "Loud" [...] with [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", {{an extension of the}} melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and hugging her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Biel, an American {{cultural}} historian, {{notes the}} novelistic {{way in which}} Lord tells the story. The book depicts events {{through the eyes of}} multiple individuals, violating simple chronology to present an overlapping series of narratives. Nathaniel Philbrick, writing in the introduction to the fiftieth anniversary edition of A Night to Remember, notes {{that at the time of}} publication it was the first significant book about Titanic for nearly forty years. He argues that the book's hallmarks are its restraint, brevity and readability, which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead <b>puts</b> <b>in</b> the foreground the stories of the people on the ship. The narrative builds suspense, making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective. It tells the story in a highly visual and aural way, describing the sights and sounds of the night of the disaster [...] "with the immediacy of a live broadcast or a television documentary", as Biel puts it.|$|E
