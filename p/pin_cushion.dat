25|$|The play <b>Pin</b> <b>Cushion,</b> by Clay McLeod Chapman {{is based}} around {{a husband and}} wife knife {{throwing}} act and consists of the target girl delivering a monologue while her husband throws knives around her. It was performed as part of Chapman's Pumpkin Pie Show at The Red Room Theatre, New York, in May and June 2002. The performance involved a genuine knife throwing act, with actress Niabi Caldwell as the target girl and professional knife thrower Dr. David Adamovich (aka The Great Throwdini) playing her husband.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{researchers}} reported that tramadol {{was found in}} relatively high concentrations (1%+) in {{the roots of the}} African <b>pin</b> <b>cushion</b> tree (Nauclea latifolia). In 2014, however, it was reported that the presence of tramadol in the tree roots was the result of tramadol having been administered to cattle by farmers in the region: tramadol and its metabolites were present in the animals' excreta, which contaminated the soil around the trees. Therefore, tramadol and its mammalian metabolites were found in tree roots in the far north of Cameroon, but not in the south where it is not administered to farm animals.|$|E

5000|$|Pincushions are {{typically}} filled tightly with stuffing, {{so as to}} hold pins rigidly in place. Magnetic <b>pin</b> <b>cushions</b> are also sometimes used; though technically they are not [...] "cushions", they serve the same basic function of holding pins neatly.|$|R
50|$|Founded in Notting Hill, {{the firm}} was started in 1840 by a silk merchant, John Kirby Farnell, and made items such as <b>pin</b> <b>cushions</b> and tea cosies. After Farnell's death, his children, Henry and Agnes, {{continued}} the business from Acton in West London.|$|R
500|$|Potter's {{illustrations}} of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle were featured on biscuit tins made by Huntley & Palmer between 1974 and 1978, {{and on a}} series of enamel items made by Crummles of Poole, Dorset from 1974 to 1995. These included five different images on four different-sized enamel boxes, as well as an enamel thimble, needle case, and <b>pin</b> <b>cushion.</b> From 1977 to 1995 (when it went out of business), Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts made or distributed a series of items featuring the hedgehog washerwoman. These included one of the first ten Potter music boxes the company released in 1977. Schmid distributed two Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle Christmas ornaments ( [...] tall) and another music box, all made by the Italian firm ANRI, as well as a figurine made by Border Fine Arts, a Scottish firm, showing Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and other Potter characters around a Christmas tree.|$|E

Finally he [...] brings forth a large rubber life preserving suit. He makes a show [...] of putting all these things in the bag, including the life- [...] preserving suit; and reveals a certain sentiment, not too deep, for [...] the pillow, the pincushion and the toilet case. At length he strews [...] everything over the floor, and is surveying the litter with mock [...] despair when a girl appears on the lawn outside, through one of the [...] windows. She throws into the room a small parcel wrapped in tissue [...] paper, and disappears. GEORGE picks up the parcel and looks [...] surprised, and suddenly runs out of the door, upper right. He [...] presently returns, dragging the girl by the wrists, she resisting.|$|E

60|$|I {{assured her}} it was. Again she became silent; but looking up, as I took a <b>pin</b> from the <b>cushion,</b> I found myself {{an object of}} study: she held me under her eye; she seemed turning me round in her thoughts--measuring my fitness for a purpose, {{weighing}} my value in a plan. Madame had, ere this, scrutinized all I had, and I believe she esteemed herself cognizant of much that I was; but from that day, for the space of about a fortnight, she tried me by new tests. She listened at the nursery door when I was shut in with the children; she followed me at a cautious distance when I walked out with them, stealing within ear-shot whenever the trees of park or boulevard afforded a sufficient screen: a strict preliminary process having thus been observed, she made a move forward.|$|R
5000|$|That {{and almost}} {{everything}} else could be forgotten amidst Jane Aces linguistic mayhem, {{much of it}} provided by her wry husbands scripts and enough improvised by her.(Mary Hunters real laughter, at Janes malaprops or Aces arch barbs, was practically the shows laugh track, years before anyone ever thought of using canned laughter.) Known {{as often as not}} as [...] "Jane-isms," [...] the better remembered of her twisted turns of phrase were more than a match for Gracie Allens equally celebrated illogical logic, anticipating such later word and context manglers as Jimmy Durante, Lou Costello, Phil Harris, and, especially, All in the Familys Archie Bunker. The famed Jane-isms included: * Perish forbid! * Congress is back in season.* You could have knocked me down with a fender.* Up at the crank of dawn.* Time wounds all heels.* Now, theres no use crying over spoiled milk.* Im completely uninhabited.* Seems like only a year ago they were married nine years!* I am his awfully-wedded wife.* He blew up higher than a hall.* I look like the wrath of grapes!* I wasnt under the impersonation you meant me!* He shot out of here like a bat out of a belfry.* Im sitting on <b>pins</b> and <b>cushions.</b> * The coffee will be ready in a jitney.* This hangnail expression... I dont drink, Im a totalitarian.* Well be together like Simonized twins.* Well, youve got to take the bitter with the better. [...] Jane Aces malaprops were less limited in their word play than the Mrs. Malaprop of Richard Brinsley Sheridans The Rivals. She was scripted as having a knack for making right the muddled situations she made muddled in the first place, by stumbling into the solutions right before her original muddling might have blown everything to smithereens. Some critics such as the New York Herald-Tribunes John Crosby noted her language molestation betrayed a [...] "crazy like a fox" [...] intelligence with its own logical illogic, but as Crosby himself said, [...] "There are a lot of Malaprops in radio but none of them scrambles a cliché quite so skillfully as Jane." ...|$|R

50|$|A pincushion (or <b>pin</b> <b>cushion)</b> is a small, stuffed cushion, {{typically}} 3 - 5 cm across, {{which is}} used in sewing to store pins or needles with their heads protruding so as to take hold of them easily, collect them, and keep them organized.|$|E

5000|$|During the 18th century, {{weighted}} pincushions {{became popular}} among seamstresses.

50|$|Another type of act at the sideshow was {{the thrill}} act.

Some {{of these types}} of acts, such as the human fountain, were later found to be fakes. Daredevil shows like the globe of death which features motorcycles performing inside an enclosed sphere or a high diving act were sometimes included. Burlesque shows (slang term: kootch shows) were also part of the traveling carnival for a time as well. Displays like Bonnie and Clyde's death car or Hitler's staff car were also seen at some traveling carnivals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recorded}} {{origins of}} pincushions {{date back to}} the Middle Ages of Europe. In the English language, they became known by many names: [...] "pimpilowes, pimpilos, pimplos, pimploes, pin-pillows, pin-poppets". In 1376, Jehanne de Mesnil was bequeathed a silver pin case in a French text called Testament of Advice written by a woman known as La Monteure, from Rouen. Other references to pin cases during the Medieval era exist. By the 16th century, these were supplanted by references to [...] "pyn pillows". Some examples from various parts of Europe survive that have elaborate embroidery. Small porcelain baskets with a <b>pin</b> <b>cushion</b> inside were highly popular, as were small cushions such as wedding pillows or maternity pillows, embroidered with messages.|$|E
