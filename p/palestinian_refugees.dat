5|$|Jordan {{was home}} to 2,117,361 Palestinians in 2015, most of them Jordanian citizens. The first wave of <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> arrived during the 1948 Arab Israeli war and peaked in the 1967 Six Day War and the 1990 Gulf War. In the past, Jordan had given many <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> citizenship, however {{recently}} Jordanian citizenship is given only in rare cases. 370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps. Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan. West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or Jordanian citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of Jordanian citizenship if requested.|$|E

5|$|New arrivals {{consisting}} of Jordanians {{from the north}} and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947. About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from Safad, Haifa and Acre, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war. Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from Nablus. The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees,</b> mostly from Jaffa, Ramla and Lydda, to Amman, whose population swelled to 110,000. With Jordan's capture of the West Bank during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000. A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War. Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the centre of Amman.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian {{immigration}} into Israel first emerged {{among the}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, living in camps in Jordan (including the Jordanian-occupied West Bank), Lebanon, Egypt (including the Egyptian protectorate in Gaza), and Syria. Initially, most infiltrations were economic in nature, with Palestinians {{crossing the border}} seeking food or the recovery of property lost in the 1948 war.|$|E

In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} census {{taken by the}} Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in 1997, Bani Zeid had a {{population}} of 4,351 inhabitants. The gender make-up was 51.8% male and 49.2% female. More {{than half of the}} population was under the age of 20 (51.1%), while 27.7% were between the ages of 20 and 39, 15% between the ages of 40 and 64, and the remainder of the population being 65 or older (6%). <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> made up 6.8% of the residents in 1997.|$|E
5|$|With a {{population}} of 2,560 in 1945, Deir al-Balah was a relatively large village. The influx of <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> from nearby areas captured by Israel during the 1948 War drastically increased the population thereafter. In the 1997 census by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) Deir al-Balah's population was recorded as 42,839, a figure which included the adjacent Deir al-Balah Camp (the smallest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.) Nearly 75% of the population were below the age of 30.|$|E
5|$|A massive {{influx of}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> swelled Gaza's {{population}} after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population {{had grown to}} about six times its 1948 size. In 1997, 51.8% of Gaza's inhabitants were refugees or their descendants. The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 515,556 in 2012, making it the largest city in the Palestinian territories. Gaza City {{has one of the}} highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km² (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km² – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km² – 55,000/sq mi). In 2007 poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions were widespread and many residents received United Nations food aid.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{signing the}} accords, Arafat—as Chairman of the PLO and its {{official}} representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, {{on behalf of}} Israel, officially recognized the PLO. The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres. The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front of the PLO allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan {{as well as by}} many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories. However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat's promise for peace and economic well-being.|$|E

Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> fleeing from areas {{captured}} by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling {{in refugee camps}} {{in and around the}} city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure self-sufficiency, and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{from among}} the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees</b> who fled or were {{expelled}} from their villages {{as a result of}} the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, in the mid-1950s the fedayeen began mounting cross-border operations into Israel from Syria, Egypt and Jordan. The earliest infiltrations were often to access the lands agricultural products they had lost {{as a result of the}} war, or to attack Israeli military, and sometimes civilian targets. The Gaza Strip, the sole territory of the All-Palestine Protectorate—an Palestinian state declared in October 1948, became the focal point of the Palestinian fedayeen activity. Fedayeen attacks were directed on Gaza and Sinai borders with Israel, and as a result Israel undertook retaliatory actions, targeting the fedayeen that also often targeted the citizens of their host countries, which in turn provoked more attacks.|$|E
25|$|Displaced Palestinian Arabs, {{known as}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees,</b> were settled in Palestinian refugee camps {{throughout}} the Arab world. The United Nations established UNRWA as a relief {{and human development}} agency tasked with providing humanitarian assistance to <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees.</b> Arab nations refused to absorb <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugees,</b> instead keeping them in refugee camps while insisting that they be allowed to return.|$|E

Thus an oxymoronic situation: Despite the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005 and the creation in 1993 of a Palestinian Authority with jurisdiction over the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>refugee</b> camps in Gaza/West Bank, UNRWA remains the key social, medical, educational and professional service provider for Palestinians living in [...] "refugee" [...] camps.
