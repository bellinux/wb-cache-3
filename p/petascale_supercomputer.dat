40|$|Abstract — Currently {{deployed}} <b>petascale</b> <b>supercomputers</b> typ-ically use toroidal network topologies {{in three}} to five dimensions. While these networks perform well for topology-agnostic codes on a few thousand nodes, leadership machines with 20, 000 nodes require topology awareness to avoid network contention for communication-intensive codes. Topology adaptation is com-plicated by irregular node allocation shapes and holes due to dedicated input/output nodes or hardware failure. In {{the context of the}} popular molecular dynamics program NAMD, we present methods for mapping a periodic 3 -D grid of fixed-size spatial decomposition domains to 3 -D Cray Gemini and 5 -D IBM Blue Gene/Q toroidal networks to enable hundred-million atom full machine simulations, and to similarly partition node allocations into compact domains for smaller simulations using multiple-copy algorithms. Additional enabling techniques are discussed and performance is reported for NCSA Blue Waters, ORNL Titan, and ANL Mira...|$|R

5000|$|Tachyon was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} Intel iPSC/860, a distributed memory parallel computer based on a hypercube interconnect topology based on the Intel i860, an early RISC CPU with VLIW architecture and [...] Tachyon {{was originally}} written using Intel's proprietary NX message passing interface for the iPSC series, but it was ported to the earliest versions of MPI shortly thereafter in 1995. Tachyon was adapted to run on the Intel Paragon platform using the Paragon XP/S 150 MP at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The ORNL XP/S 150 MP was the first platform Tachyon supported that combined both large-scale distributed memory message passing among nodes, and shared memory multithreading within nodes. Adaptation of Tachyon {{to a variety of}} conventional Unix-based workstation platforms and early clusters followed, including porting to the IBM SP2. Tachyon was incorporated into the PARAFLOW CFD code to allow in-situ volume visualization of supersonic combustor flows performed on the Paragon XP/S at NASA Langley Research Center, providing a significant performance gain over conventional post-processing visualization approaches that had been used previously. [...] Beginning in 1999, support for Tachyon was incorporated into the molecular graphics program VMD, and this began an ongoing period co-development of Tachyon and VMD where many new Tachyon features were added specifically for molecular graphics. Tachyon was used to render the winning image illustration category for the NSF 2004 Visualization Challenge. [...] In 2007, Tachyon added support for ambient occlusion lighting, {{which was one of the}} features that made it increasingly popular for molecular visualization in conjunction with VMD. VMD and Tachyon were gradually adapted to support routine visualization and analysis tasks on clusters, and later for large petascale supercomputers. Tachyon was used to produce figures, movies, and the Nature cover image of the atomic structure of the HIV-1 capsid solved by Zhao et al. in 2013, on the Blue Waters <b>petascale</b> <b>supercomputer</b> at NCSA, U.

40|$|Procurement and the {{optimized}} {{utilization of}} <b>Petascale</b> <b>supercomputers</b> and centers is a renewed national priority.

Storage systems {{are known to be}} the primary fault source leading to data unavailability and job resubmissions.

In this work, we propose the coordination of job scheduling with data staging/offloading and on-demand staged data reconstruction to address the availability of job input data and to improve centerwide performance. Fundamental to both mechanisms is the efficient management of transient data: in the way it is scheduled and recovered. Collectively, from a center’s standpoint, these techniques optimize resource usage and increase its data/service availability. From a user’s standpoint, they reduce the job turnaround time and optimize the allocated time usage...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHazardous {{scenarios}} involving explosives {{are difficult}} to experimentally study and simulation is often the only viable approach to study highly reactive phenomena. Explosive simulations are computationally expensive, requiring supercomputing resources for continued scientific discovery in the field. Here an idealized mesoscale simulation of explosive grains under mechanical insult by a high-speed projectile with reaction represented by a novel kinetic model is designed to test the scalability of the Uintah software on <b>petascale</b> <b>supercomputers.</b> Good scalability is found up to 49 K processors. Timing breakdown of compu- tational tasks are determined with relocation of Lagrangian particles and interpolation of those particles to the grid identified as the most expensive operation and ideal for optimization. Potential optimization strategies are identified. Realistic model simulations rather than toy model simulations are found to better represent scalability of a science code on a supercomputer.

40|$|Abstract. Applications that {{generate}} bursty I/O load, like checkpointing, require additional support to perform efficiently on next generation <b>petascale</b> <b>supercomputers.</b> Tens {{of thousands of}} processors, generating terabytes of snapshot data at once at each timestep, can easily overwhelm a storage system. Further, even at the current peak I/O bandwidth rates, offered by parallel file system deployments at leadership class facilities, an application is likely to spend {{a significant portion of}} its runtime checkpointing. To address these issues, we propose a checkpoint storage device, built from memory resources, that acts as an intermediary to the central parallel file system. Our system comprises of a dedicated manager that aggregates memory resources from processors (benefactors) and makes it available as a collective space for checkpointing clients, using a standard POSIX file system interface. We argue that such a system has the potential to alleviate the I/O bandwidth bottleneck for bursty I/O operations like checkpointing by aggregating memory and interprocessor bandwidth...|$|R
