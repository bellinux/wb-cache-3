40|$|AbstractA {{physically}} based {{method is}} proposed to represent interpenetrating polymer networks and their electromechanical behavior. The mechanical {{behavior of the}} material is nonlinear elastic and the electromechanical coupling arises from electrostatic effects often called the Maxwell stress effect. Ha et al. have synthesized interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) that invalidate {{the need for an}} external pre-stretch mechanism in dielectric elastomers. IPNs of acrylic elastomer and 1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate were successfully synthesized to create free-standing films with preserved <b>prestretch.</b> This results in a dual polymer network, with one polymer network in tension and the other in compression. The <b>prestretch</b> is preserved chemically in the dominant network. The internal <b>prestretch</b> is accompanied by an overall stiffening of the dual polymer network leading to compromised actuation strains. A mechanistically simple representation of the networks is proposed by means of a model of two springs in parallel, replaced by an equivalent single spring. A material parameter is introduced to account for the effect of the weight percent of the secondary network. The effect of the additive on the preserved <b>prestretch</b> in the primary network and hence the overall stress strain response is determined. Specifically, a modified Ogden strain energy function is proposed that describes the mechanical behavior of the new interpenetrating polymer network. The electromechanical response of the material is described using a previously presented constitutive formulation that works well for single network polymers. The model results indicate that ideally an interpenetrating polymer network DE should not stiffen when the secondary network is formed to avoid reduced actuation strains...|$|E

The coupling efficiency from SMF to PCF was − 6. 2 [*]dB at 1554 [*]nm wavelength in the fabricated coupler. The structure of the SMF-PCF coupler to obtain high coupling efficiency was theoretically clarified by beam propagation analysis using an equivalent model of the coupler with simplification.

40|$|The {{influence}} of series elastic structures on {{the dynamics of}} the contractile machinery was examined in the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) of five male Wistar rats, with respect to enhancement of work of a muscle-tendon complex after active stretch. Imposed isotonic and isokinetic contractions were preceded by either an isometric phase (PI) or an active stretch (PS). The effects of fibre length differences at the onset of shortening, due to differences of extension of tendinous structures, were studied. For the isotonic experiments fibre length and shortening velocity were estimated 30 ms after release and compared with the PI length-velocity curve determined at the same force level. For shortening above the optimum length, about half of the enhanced shortening found after <b>prestretch</b> could be explained by PS—PI fibre length differences. Below the optimum length, PS shortening velocity was somewhat lower than expected on the basis of length-velocity characteristics. Enhancement of work output due to stretch was different for isokinetic and isotonic shortening. In isokinetic shortening, following <b>prestretch,</b> fibre work was limited because of enhanced shortening of the tendinous structures. In stretch-shortening cycles imposed on a muscle-tendon complex, the length of the complex affected all <b>prestretch</b> effects, i. e. potentiation of the contractile element, contractile element interaction with the tendinous structures, and elastic energy release. It is concluded that, besides potentiation effects and enhanced elastic energy release, the {{influence of}} series elastic structures on fibre dynamics determines active stretch-induced work enhancement. The contribution by these mechanisms to this work enhancement depends largely on the type of stretch-shortening cycle...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the intact heart, the {{distribution}} of electromechanical delay (EMD), the time interval between local depolarization and myocyte shortening onset, depends on the loading conditions. The distribution of EMD throughout the heart remains, however, unknown because current experimental techniques are unable to evaluate three-dimensional cardiac electromechanical behavior. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the three-dimensional EMD distributions in the intact ventricles for sinus rhythm (SR) and epicardial pacing (EP) by using a new, to our knowledge, electromechanical model of the rabbit ventricles that incorporates a biophysical representation of myofilament dynamics. Furthermore, we aimed to ascertain the mechanisms that underlie the specific three-dimensional EMD distributions. The results revealed that under both conditions, the three-dimensional EMD distribution is nonuniform. During SR, EMD is longer at the epicardium than at the endocardium, and is greater near the base than at the apex. After EP, the three-dimensional EMD distribution is markedly different; it also changes with the pacing rate. For both SR and EP, late-depolarized regions were characterized with significant myofiber <b>prestretch</b> caused by the contraction of the early-depolarized regions. This <b>prestretch</b> delays myofiber-shortening onset, and results in a longer EMD, giving rise to heterogeneous three-dimensional EMD distributions...|$|E

It is shown here that the large strain properties of the multiple networks are quantitatively controlled by the large strain properties of the stretched first network which acts as a percolating filler, while the small and intermediate properties are controlled by the entanglement density which can be largely superior to that of homogeneous networks. Different brittle and <b>prestretched</b> elastomer networks are embedded at a low volume fraction in a soft extensible matrix.

40|$|Series elastic {{stiffness}} of rat gastrocnemius medialis muscle {{was determined by}} means of sinusoidal movements (180 Hz, 0. 25 % of muscle length) for various contraction conditions. The effects of muscle length, activation level, velocity, <b>prestretch,</b> and temperature on the force-stiffness relationship were investigated. All force-stiffness curves were transformed to a linear force-α curve (Ettema and Huijing, 1993; Morgan, 1977) to distinguish mathematically two series elastic components; a force dependent and force independent compliance. For all isometric conditions a typical force-stiffness curve was found, where stiffness increased with force, and this increase levelled off at higher forces. Stiffness in dynamic shortening and lengthening contractions is related to force {{in a completely different}} way than in isometric condition. An increase in temperature caused a decrease in muscle stiffness for a given force, and the effects of muscle length, activation level, and <b>prestretch</b> were small.

40|$|Single fibres {{from the}} {{anterior}} tibialis muscle of Rana temporaria (temperature, 2 - 3 degrees C) were moderately fatigued at a <b>prestretched</b> sarcomere length (approximately 3. 6 microns) {{by reducing the}} intervals between 2 s tetani from 240 to 20 s. Changes in length of marked segments along the muscle fibre were monitored during fixed-end tetani using a photoelectric recording system. In contrast to the situation at 2. 2 microns sarcomere length, the central region of the fibre was elongated during tetanus at the <b>prestretched</b> fibre length, whereas the segments next to the fibre-tendon junctions (end segments) shortened correspondingly. These length changes were associated with a slow climb of force (tension creep). During development of fatigue, the maximum tetanic tension was reduced to about 78 % of the control value and {{the time course of}} the tetanus was markedly changed. The tension creep observed in control tetanus was greatly reduced during fatigue, the tetanic tension remaining nearly constant after an initial rising phase. The change in shape of the force myogram during fatigue was associated with a considerable reduction in the amplitude of segment movements along the fibre. The results are explainable by assuming that the end segments (having shorter sarcomeres) become more fatigued than other parts in series along the fibre. At the same time the central segments are likely to have acquired a higher ability to resist stretch by the end segments...|$|R

40|$|Work {{output of}} rat {{gastrocnemius}} medialis (GM) muscle (N= 5) was measured for stretch-shortening contractions, in which initiation of stretch occurred {{prior to the}} onset of activation, and for contractions with an isometric prephase. Duration of the active prephase (<b>prestretch</b> and pre-isometric) varied from 20 to 200 ms. Subsequent shortening (from optimum length+ 4 mm to optimum length— 2 mm) lasted 150 ms. Stretch velocities of 5, 10 and 20 mms~ 1 were used, and the shortening velocity was 40 mms~ 1. The effects of several combinations of active stretch duration and active stretch amplitude were compared. Using force-compliance characteristics, {{the work of the}} contractile element (CE), elastic energy storage and release of the undamped series elastic component (SEC) were distinguished. During shortening, an extra amount of work output was produced, induced by active stretch, of which the largest contribution (70 - 80 %) was due to higher elastic energy release. Enhancement of the storage and utilization of elastic energy during the stretch-shortening cycle, caused by higher transition-point forces (i. e. force at onset of shortening), increased with active stretch amplitude and was associated with a net loss of work, probably due to cross-bridge detachment during active stretch. Net work over the stretch-shortening cycle remained positive for all <b>prestretch</b> contractions, indicating that when a muscle performs this type of contraction, it is able to contribute to work performance on body segments. It is concluded that, in stretch-shortening movements of rat GM muscle, maximal positive work output is incompatible with maximal net work output.

40|$|We {{present a}} model that {{describes}} the deflection of a <b>prestretched</b> elastic beam under planar loading conditions. The kinematics is represented with a Cosserat directed curve with an extensible arc length. The strain within the cross-section of the rod is composed of bending strain and stretch of the centerline. Given that bending strains are relatively small, an effective flexural rigidity is defined based on the spatial cross-section and {{the slope of the}} hyperelastic stress–strain curve evaluated for the stretch along the neutral axis. Initially, no additional strain is assumed as the beam is deflected, and small deflections allow for the application of the small angle approximation. The solution is reduced to a fourth-order ODE that resembles an Euler–Bernoulli beam equation with a correction term accounting for axial loading. The model is further examined for the case of a stretched fixed–fixed beam under a point load applied at the center. An iterative approach is taken to accommodate further stretching as the load is applied. Experimental results are then compared to the theory. Silicone rubber beams are fixed to rigid blocks capable of shifting longitudinally to induce desired <b>prestretches.</b> Under various stretched conditions, the beams are then deflected vertically with a wedge while recording data on position and force. Although the Neo-Hookean constitutive model overestimates deflection at higher prestrains, a four-parameter Ogden model captures the behavior well and is in good agreement with experimental measurements for prestrains of up to 200 %.
