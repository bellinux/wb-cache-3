5|$|The {{number five}} {{is also found}} in the {{structure}} of the poem itself. Sir Gawain is 101stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> 22stanzas long. The second and second-to-last <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> only one stanza long, and the middle five <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the Ten Commandments). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.|$|E

5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these <b>parts</b> <b>are</b> arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze.
