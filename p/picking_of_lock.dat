6000|$|... "If {{there should}} {{chance to be}} any {{disturbance}} in the night, captain; if you should hear the <b>picking</b> <b>of</b> a <b>lock,</b> the cutting out of a pane of glass, a stealthy tread of steps about the house (and I need not fear to tell you, who bear a well-tempered, mettlesome heart under your girl's ribbon sash, that such little incidents are very possible in the present time), what would you do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I laughed, {{it was not}} a very cheerful laugh, I am {{bound to}} say, as I motioned him to keep it. [...] "A key is nothing," [...] I said, [...] "there are many duplicates, and anyhow it is not {{difficult}} to <b>pick</b> a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> this kind." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of July 15, the prisoners were all {{accounted}} for at the 01:50 headcount, then <b>picked</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> the cell, changed out of their prison uniforms, sneaked into the main camp area and crawled over a damaged wall and crossed a Soviet-era minefield to meet a getaway vehicle.|$|R

60|$|Gliding up {{the stairs}} on shoeless feet the burglar entered the dining-room, <b>picked</b> the <b>locks</b> <b>of</b> the {{sideboard}} with marvellous celerity, unfolded a canvas bag, and placed therein whatever valuables he could lay hands on. Proceeding next to the drawing-room floor, he began to examine and appropriate the articles of vertu that appeared to him most valuable.|$|R

He counted the minutes, as {{if such a}} course would make the time pass more rapidly, and was so {{thoroughly}} exhausted when, at nearly {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon, the work <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> the <b>lock</b> was begun, that he could not have made himself heard even had the gag been removed.|$|R
50|$|In August 1942 Bruce and Hunter were {{imprisoned in}} Colditz Castle (then {{prisoner}} of war camp Oflag IV-C), where Bruce's skills were immediately {{put to good use}} (he was a talented lock-picker and at a reunion at Colditz 40 years later, he managed to <b>pick</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> his cell before a disgruntled East German guard was able to find the correct key).|$|R

But, by good luck, I had warning of it by a friend's letter.|$|R
50|$|Disguises {{can be used}} {{to avoid}} {{alerting}} enemies when seen. When a character is knocked unconscious or killed without damaging the uniform, Strogov can change into their clothes. Some enemies are able to see through disguises and can be alerted if the player enters their vision, and all enemies can be alerted to suspicious behaviour which includes <b>picking</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> a door or looking through a door's keyhole, being in certain stances or having certain weapons visible.|$|R
50|$|Prisoner {{transport}} {{is risky}} {{due to the}} fact the dangerous inmates are being temporarily brought into the public along with the civilian population. Specially designed prisoner transport vehicles are used to fulfill security requirements. Many inmates see this time as an opportunity to escape. Some inmates prepare for escape during transport by bringing along tiny objects (e.g. paper clips {{that can be used to}} <b>pick</b> the <b>locks</b> <b>of</b> their handcuffs prior to escape from the vehicles.|$|R
60|$|Deprived of {{the young}} lady's society, Mr. Bob Sawyer {{proceeded}} to divert himself by peeping into the desk, looking into all the table drawers, feigning to <b>pick</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> the iron safe, turning the almanac with its face to the wall, trying on the boots of Mr. Winkle, senior, over his own, and making several other humorous experiments upon the furniture, all of which afforded Mr. Pickwick unspeakable horror and agony, and yielded Mr. Bob Sawyer proportionate delight.|$|R

At Jeff's insistence, the Blues find {{that she has a}} taste for jambalaya. Jeff hints several times that their {{daughter}} will learn the family business, such as when they break into a dead man's house during the night: [...] "See Mommy picking the big lock? Someday, when you're a big girl, she'll teach you how to <b>pick</b> <b>locks.</b> <b>Of</b> course she may still be picking this one." ...|$|R
50|$|As Jacob leaves, Helen Lovely {{returns to}} bring the green man some food and is happy to learn that {{he is able to}} speak. She unties his hands and tries to set him free using a hairpin to <b>pick</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> the cage. She touches him to see if the green comes off, but the green man {{explains}} that he is green as a result of genetics. After loosely tying his hands again, Helen leaves, promising to come back and visit.|$|R
60|$|<b>Picking</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> {{the iron}} door {{was out of}} the question, from the exposed nature of the {{situation}} which that mysterious iron barrier occupied. My only possible way to the second floor lay by the back of the house. I had looked up at it two or three times, while walking in the garden after dinner with Alicia. What had I brought away in my memory as the result of that casual inspection of my host's back premises? Several fragments of useful information.|$|R
5000|$|The {{courthouse}} {{was finally}} completed in 1928 {{at the cost}} of $4 million (USD 2013 $54.5 million). Initially, it served as both the Dade County Courthouse and the Miami City Hall. Jail cells occupied the top nine floors because these heights offered [...] "maximum security" [...] and were considered escape proof. In 1934, a prisoner housed on the twenty-first floor <b>picked</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> his jail cell window and used a fire hose to lower himself to freedom. In the years following, more than 70 prisoners escaped from this so-called [...] "secure" [...] prison.|$|R
5000|$|Lucas does arrive, late, but Sami {{has been}} talking to her best friend Jamie Caldwell (Miriam Parrish) {{on the phone and}} doesn’t {{especially}} care. She does look Lucas over, and feels that she has seen him somewhere before, but now that he is wearing his military academy uniform she cannot place him. However, she says [...] "I know you. You're Lucas Roberts. You're not a goody-goody. You're a bad boy!" [...] The bad boy busily <b>picks</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> his mother's liquor cabinet. Three days later, she places him, and blushes furiously.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, Reilly <b>picked</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> the office where the plans were kept, and was {{discovered}} by the foreman whom he then strangled before completing the theft. From Essen, Reilly took a train to a safe house in Dortmund. Tearing the plans into four pieces, he mailed each separately so that if one were lost, the other three would still reveal {{the gist of the}} plans. Cook casts doubt on this incident but concedes that German factory records show a Karl Hahn was indeed employed by the Essen plant during this time and that a plant fire brigade existed.|$|R

In the events surrounding the Paradigm's arrest, Gilgamos lost his wings. While the first was lost in combat against Orian, he tore the second off himself after being incarcerated by the US government, using the bones within to <b>pick</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> his cell. Following an unsuccessful attempt to kill the Plutonian and the revelation of his wife's infidelity, Gilgamos leaves the team and wanders the Earth alone. Gil returns in Issue #29 when Kaidan and Scylla's ghost bring him out of retirement.|$|R
50|$|Burton McKinnell, Judd's {{brother and}} a junior at the University <b>of</b> Southern California, <b>picked</b> Judd up from the train station unaware of the crime or the bodies. Judd {{departed}} with her brother, leaving her trunks behind. At around 4:30 pm that afternoon, Anderson called the Los Angeles Police Department to report the suspicious trunks. After <b>picking</b> the <b>locks</b> <b>of</b> each trunk, the police discovered the bodies. Meanwhile, Judd's brother had dropped his sister off somewhere in Los Angeles, where she proceeded to disappear. Judd hid out for several days until she surrendered to police in a funeral home the following Friday, October 23, 1931.|$|R
50|$|The car {{drives away}} and Rachel wakes {{up to see}} Polly being {{taken out of the}} car to be boarded onto a helicopter. She finds a torch, <b>picks</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> the boot with a hairgrip and sprays {{antiseptic}} into the librarian's eyes. They then get taken to a place where all the people who were working to find Freddy and Polly's father have been working on helping them to escape and Freddy and Polly are reunited with their Father, who built another cryonic suspension machine and froze himself inside it so that he would not grow old and die without his children. The story ends with Freddy and Polly trying to teach their father about 2009 life.|$|R
5000|$|Kristen's Water cell stunt {{requires}} her to {{hold her}} breath while she <b>picks</b> a series <b>of</b> <b>locks</b> that fasten chains and secure {{the lid of the}} cell. She averages 2 minutes and 48 seconds underwater on one breath, however she has occasionally taken up to 3 minutes and 18 seconds to free herself. The longest time she has ever held her breath is 5 minutes and 2 seconds. She ends her shows with this escape and has performed it as often as 30 times in ten days. She offers a $10,000 challenge to anyone who can prove that she takes a second breath, uses an underwater breathing apparatus or a key once she has dropped below the water. As of June 25, 2013 Kristen has attempted the water torture cell 1057 times to date. Escapologist and convention organizer Mark Cannon has stated that this escape [...] "is fast becoming one of the most talked-about stunts in the world of escapology". And Wayne N. Kawamoto from About: magic has written: [...] "Her escape was the most dramatic and involving that I have ever witnessed. Johnson set a high bar for the other performers that will be difficult to match." ...|$|R

Seventy-three were we, {{and no more}} when we sailed out of Plymouth Sound; and before we saw the Spanish Main, half were gastados, used up, as the Dons say, with the scurvy; and in Port Pheasant Captain Rawse of Cowes fell in with us, and that gave us some thirty hands more; and with that handful, my lads, only fifty-three in all, we <b>picked</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> the new world! And whom did we lose but our trumpeter, who stood braying like an ass {{in the middle of}} the square, instead of taking care of his neck like a Christian?

50|$|Competition in {{the lock}} {{business}} was fierce and there were various challenges issued {{in an attempt to}} prove the superiority of one type <b>of</b> <b>lock</b> over another. Joseph Bramah exhibited one <b>of</b> his <b>locks</b> in the window of his shop and offered 200 guineas (£210 or $343.16 at the time) to anybody who could devise a method <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> it. In 1832, a Mr Hart, replying to a challenge by Chubb, failed to <b>pick</b> one <b>of</b> his detector <b>locks.</b> After a number of people tried and failed, the first person to pick the six-lever Chubb lock was Alfred Charles Hobbs, the inventor <b>of</b> the protector <b>lock,</b> during the Great Exhibition in 1851.|$|R

5000|$|According to Bradlee's 1995 account - one of {{at least}} four {{conflicting}} versions of the events surrounding the diary - the search at Pinchot Meyer's art studio behind the Bradlee house began {{the day after the}} murder. Bradlee says he and his wife arrived at the studio with tools to obtain entry, since they had no key, and upon arriving they found Angleton in the process <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> the <b>lock</b> with special tools he had for that purpose. [...] "The fact that the CIA's most controversial counterintelligence specialist had been caught in the act of breaking and entering, and looking for her diary," [...] Bradlee said, was not something he considered appropriate for public disclosure. With respect to the diary itself, he added, he and his wife, upon reading it and seeing that it revealed Pinchot Meyer's affair with the late President Kennedy, [...] "concluded this was in no sense a public document, despite the braying of the knee jerks about some public right to know." ...|$|R

6000|$|It was as {{plain as}} {{the light of day}} that when Captain Leach went aboard of the pirate craft {{on the night of the}} 21st of July, Captain England would require him to explain his object in betraying the Cassandra into their hands; and it was equally plain that Leach would have to tell the truth; for it was not likely that he could deceive such a sharp and cunning blade as that famous freebooter. I {{recalled}} the strange look which Captain England had given me when he told me that Captain Leach had been [...] "shot by accident" [...] upon their coming aboard the Cassandra; whereupon, regarding matters from my present stand-point, I felt assured that England had killed Leach with his own hand, so that with him the secret of the stone might perish from amongst them. I also felt convinced that he must, with great care and circumspection, have <b>picked</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> the despatch-box and have despoiled it of its contents, which he had kept for himself without informing any of his shipmates of what he had found.|$|R
60|$|However, {{it was of}} no use at the moment. The old wretch bore me off to his domains with an ostentatious triumph; and then, his jealousy misgiving him, he shut me up in {{a castle}} on a rock, where he endeavoured from that day forth {{to keep me from}} the sight of living being. You may judge what sort of castle it was by its name--Altamura (lofty wall). It {{overlooked}} a desert on three sides, and the sea on the fourth; and a man might as well have flown as endeavoured to scale it. There was but one path up to the entrance, very steep and difficult; and when you were there, you must have pierced outwork after outwork, and <b>picked</b> the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> gate after gate. So there sat I in this delicious retreat, hopeless, and bursting with rage. I called upon death day and night, as my only refuge. I had no comfort but in seeing my keeper mad with jealousy, even in that desolate spot. I think he was jealous of the very flies.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most ancient Chinese {{padlocks}} are key-operated locks with splitting springs, {{and partially}} keyless letter-combination locks.
