5|$|Hydrochloric acid is a corrosive, strong {{mineral acid}} with many {{industrial}} uses. A colorless, highly <b>pungent</b> solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in water, when it reacts with an organic base {{it forms a}} hydrochloride salt.|$|E
5|$|Taramira oil, {{from the}} seeds of the arugula (Eruca sativa), grown in West Asia and Northern India. Used as a (<b>pungent)</b> edible oil after aging to remove acridity.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{fluorine}} is a gas of diatomic molecules, {{pale yellow}} when pure (sometimes described as yellow-green). It has a characteristic <b>pungent</b> odor detectable at 20ppb. Fluorine condenses into {{a bright yellow}} liquid at −188°C (−306°F), a transition temperature {{similar to those of}} oxygen and nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Onion powder is a {{seasoning}} {{widely used}} when the fresh ingredient is not available. It {{is made from}} finely ground, dehydrated onions, mainly the <b>pungent</b> varieties of bulb onions, and has a strong odour. Being dehydrated, it has a long shelf life and is available in several varieties: yellow, red, and white.|$|E
5|$|Onions are {{cultivated}} {{and used}} around the world. As a food item, {{they are usually}} served cooked, as a vegetable or part of a prepared savoury dish, but can also be eaten raw or used to make pickles or chutneys. They are <b>pungent</b> when chopped and contain certain chemical substances which irritate the eyes.|$|E
5|$|Predation of sea otters does occur, {{although}} it is not common. Many predators find the otter, with their <b>pungent</b> scent glands, distasteful. Young predators may kill an otter and not eat it. Leading mammalian predators of this species include orcas and sea lions; bald eagles also prey on pups by snatching them from the water surface.|$|E
5|$|The bulb of the radish {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a <b>pungent,</b> peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, {{also present in}} mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.|$|E
5|$|The related Turbinellus kauffmanii, {{found in}} western North America, is similar-looking {{but has a}} pale brown cap. Younger {{specimens}} of the latter species also have a <b>pungent</b> smell. Turbinellus fujisanensis, found in Japan, is another lookalike that has smaller spores than T.floccosus.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The <b>pungent</b> odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|Poor white {{farmers and}} black slaves ate much more humble fare and were quicker to {{incorporate}} American and African foodstuffs and flavorings. The food of poor {{whites in the}} 17th century was similar to soul food of the 20th century. Overall, both rich and poor southerners ate spicier and more <b>pungent</b> food than elsewhere in the early colonies, and feasting was {{an important part of}} life for all social classes.|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their <b>pungent</b> odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, peas, and nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the <b>pungent,</b> {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristic}} {{flavor of}} cabbage {{is caused by}} glucosinolates, a class of sulfur-containing glucosides. Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the tissue ages. Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its <b>pungent,</b> unpleasant odor and taste. These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.|$|E
5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, <b>pungent,</b> fruity smell. The {{mushroom}} is poisonous, containing muscarine compounds. Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and <b>pungent</b> smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour {{about three days}} after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the <b>pungent</b> odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the <b>pungent</b> varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic <b>pungent</b> odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{suggests}} {{breathing exercises}} {{in a variety}} of ways, such as breathing with one nostril and exhaling with another, asserting that a regular practice multiple times a day cleans up the Nadis (blood vessels), improves digestive powers, stamina, leanness and causes the skin to glow. The text recommends restraining oneself from salt, mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent <b>pungent</b> foods. The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee (clarified butter), cooked wheat, green gram and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 46–49. The Upanishad also recommends massage, particularly areas of body that tremor or profusely perspire during the practice of yoga.|$|E
5|$|Thelephora palmata (commonly {{known as}} the stinking earthfan or the fetid false coral) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae. The fruit bodies are {{leathery}} and coral-like, with branches that are narrow at the base before widening out like a fan and splitting into numerous flattened prongs. The wedge-like tips are whitish when young, but darken as the fungus matures. The common names of the fungus refers to its <b>pungent</b> odor, likened to fetid garlic. A widely distributed but uncommon species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, where it fruits {{on the ground in}} both coniferous and mixed forest.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{has a small}} {{swelling}} on the {{ventral side}} of its elbow called the brachial gland, which secretes a <b>pungent,</b> clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, {{and it has been}} shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi-volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris. The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex, age, health and nutritional status, and dominance.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite <b>pungent</b> in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee's {{breath was}} thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The <b>pungent</b> smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.|$|E
5|$|According to Larousse Gastronomique, the durian {{fruit is}} ready to eat when its husk begins to crack. However, the ideal stage of {{ripeness}} to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of D. zibethinus are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in southern Thailand prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. For some people in northern Thailand, the preference is for the fruit to be soft and aromatic. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be as ripe and <b>pungent</b> in aroma as possible and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic, the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.|$|E
5|$|No rivers or streams {{ran into}} the sound but note that early maps {{conflict}} and show that the River Cadoxton, originating from feeder brooks meeting at Michaelston-le-pit between Ely, Leckwith and Wenvoe to the north-east, passed through Dinas Powys and Sully Moors and bypassed the Barry shoreline to meet the sea near Cold Knap Point before decades later, Cold Knap promenade and Watchtower Bay was developed. With {{the coming of the}} docks, the River Cadoxton was re-routed from Sully moors through what was later to become the Supplies Reserve Depôt (SRD) and later still, the chemical complexes in the area, to discharge south-east of the dock's south-east breakwater at the Bendricks. For many years after the last war, with the dissolution of the SRD and coming of the chemical works, effluent discharge from some of them, was carried along the river to the sea and turned the water white in colour and it gave off a <b>pungent</b> effervescent odour until bylaws brought this pollution to an end and gradually the hitherto white shoreline at that area, returned to its normal sandstone colour.|$|E
