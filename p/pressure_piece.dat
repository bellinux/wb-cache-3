40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a door closer which has a closing spring for automatically closing the door. When the door is opened manually, the closing spring is compressed.

To obtain greater operating convenience, the invention strives to achieve as low an opening resistance in the door closer as possible when the door is opened manually, but nevertheless closing the door reliably during the closing process. This problem is solved {{by the fact that the}} characteristic of the torque acting on the leaf and depending on the rotary angle of the leaf is different for opening than for closing as a result of the interaction of the sliding spring with a control curve which has separate curve sections for opening and closing. This is achieved by a gear wheel in the form of a cam gear interacting with the closing spring with one opening cam and one closing cam. The separate control curve section for opening is on the opening cam and the separate control curve section for closing is on the closing cam.

Further pressure equilibration can then only be achieved either by gas diffusion in gas phase, or by gradual wetting of the pores...|$|R

In accordance with the {{thermal annealing}} model, {{a detailed description of}} the microscopic processes which result from the interaction of a 308 nm, 10 ps, Gaussian pulse with a Si(100) substrate has been embedded into a molecular-dynamics scheme. This was accomplished by explicitly accounting for carrier-phonon scattering and carrier diffusion. Below the predicted threshold fluence for ablation, F_th= 0. 25 J/cm^ 2, a surface breathing mode indicates that the solid restores internal equilibrium by the generation of pressure waves. Above F_th, our simulations reveal that matter removal is triggered by subsurface superheating effects: intense heating of the material leads to the thermal confinement of the laser-deposited energy. As a result, the material is overheated up to a temperature corresponding to the critical point of silicon and a strong pressure gradient builds up within the absorbing volume. At the same time, diffusion of the carriers into the bulk leads to the development of a steep temperature gradient beneath the surface.

In this paper, the Kalamay volcanic gas reservoir of the Junggar Basin in China was selected as the object of our research. The gas reservoir has typical fractured volcanic reservoirs, and the long-term percolation feature remains unclear. To study the percolation characteristics of single-phase gas under high pressure, the experimental method was designed to simulate these characteristics in the process of gas production by measuring the gas flow in the core and the input and output pressure at both ends. We carried out simulation experiments of single-phase gas flow percolation characteristics under high <b>pressure</b> using 11 <b>pieces</b> of vol-canic rock samples in three wells of the study area. The results show that as the core pore pressure increased, the per-meability of low-permeability cores of the volcanic rock decreased significantly at room temperature. However, this decrease became more gradual, which means that the higher the core pore pressure is, the smaller the permeability variation caused by gas slippage is; when the pore pressure is above 10 MPa, the permeability is nearly constant, slip-page effect significantly reduces in the process of gas percolation, so it can be completely ignored under these forma-tion conditions. As the pore pressure decreases, the slippage effect and stress sensitivity effect will gradually increase; when the pore pressure is less than 10 MPa, the permeability appears to increase significantly, and this is especiall...|$|R

However, a lack of knowledge still exists on how the geomorphic effects, quantity, and characteristics of in-channel wood may be altered by dif- ferent human pressures. For this reason, in-channel wood was surveyed in the Brenta, Piave, and Tagliamento gravel-bed rivers (northeastern Italy), which are altered by different degrees of human <b>pressures.</b> Both single <b>pieces</b> of wood (N 0. 1 m diameter, and/or N 1 m long) and accumulations of large wood were measured on cross sectional transects within the active channels. Overall, 3430 (8. 4, 13. 9 and 10. 7 elements/ha in the Brenta, Piave, and Tagliamento rivers, respectively) of isolated pieces and 591 (9. 8, 15. 0, and 11. 0 wood accumulations/ ha in the Brenta, Piave, and Tagliamento rivers, respectively) accumulations were surveyed in the study sites. In the Brenta and Piave rivers, which feature the greater human pressures, logs appear in a worse state of conserva- tion. In the less disturbed Tagliamento River, the logs appear to be smaller and in a better state of conservation with higher capacity for resprouting. In addition, higher geomorphic interactions were found between wood and sediments in the Tagliamento River. Because of its ability to create geomorphic effects, in-channel wood rep- resents an important source of complexity that can increase habitat diversity in river systems.

40|$|Abstract — In the industry, mill rollers are {{undergoing}} severe loading for 24 hours 7 {{days a week}} which results in formation of crack due to loading conditions, temperature and stress intensity. This leads to the demand in material selection according to its tribological needs which make the existing material to last for more time than the existing. Failures of rolls occur due to improper manufacturing and operational parameters. The samples of prematurely failed roll samples collected from steel plant were examined for their chemistry, inclusion content, microstructures, carbide characteristics, hardness and the retained austenite content. The residual stresses were also measured on the inner {{as well as the}} outer surface of the spalled roll pieces. The results obtained have been discussed in this paper. The higher content of retained austenite was primarily responsible for the spalling of indigenous rolls for which sub zero treatment has been recommended. Several suggestions have also been made for smooth operation of the mill and consequently for the extension of life of a work roll [1]. A procedure is described for the calculation of stress intensity factors for surface cracks in a section roll. Results are given in terms of the load acting of the roll and the average pressure acting on the roll/work piece interface. It is noted that the load acting on the roll can be determined for individual cases by experimentally measuring the deformation of the roll stands: this obviates the necessity of relying on theoretical estimates of the roll/work <b>piece</b> <b>pressure.</b> The stresses in the uncracked roll are determined using an axis symmetric finite element model. However, for the subsequent calculations of stress intensity factors the analysis is reduced to a plane strain model.

Some MSDs has been experienced for some years and {{to reduce the risk}} of MSDs there is a need for change in work operations. The project is limited to address the tasks involved in the workshop on the handling of samples and includes only the handling of the L 1 samples. The project aims both to present a number of concepts for how the operations on the sample handling can be improved from a ergonomic perspective and identify the work environment at the department for sample handling with regard to lightning and noise. In order to define the present situation in the department of sample handlings three different ergonomic analyzes were used; Ergonova, RULA and REBA. Based on the analysis the operations; Unloading the car, Slag tapping and Unloading from the acid cabinet was the worst result and thus affected the workloads greatest. In addition to these operations were also manual lifting and transporting a huge work <b>pressure.</b> Totally 13 <b>pieces</b> of concept proposals divided into work phases; Unloading the car, Slag tapping, Unloading from the acid cabinet and Transport in the workshop was generated. The concept proposals were evaluated against a specification of demands for each work phase and the winning concept proposal for each work phase was further developed. The lighting study consisted of measurements of illuminance and luminance, and control of light fittings in the location and shadowing at the workstations. The result of measurements of illuminance shows that the majority of areas in the workshop do not achieve the recommended illuminance of 500 lux. The measurements of luminance compared to the recommended luminance ratio 5 : 3 : 1, indicating that all the work stations have an incorrect luminance ratio. The noise measurements were based on the equivalent noise level, maximum level of noise and impulse peak value and compared to Arbetsmiljöverkets actions values. The results of the measurements of equivalent noise level can be used to determine which operations that causes maximum equivalent noise level and through specific changes lower this. The results of measurements of the maximum noise level and the impulse peak value showed no exceed of Arbetsmiljöverkets action values. SSAB EMEA AB in Luleå is recommended to first implement the equipment for cutting away the slag from the samples. Subsequently, they should evaluate the need for capacity in the acid cabinet to thereby determine the size of the new sample holder. I also recommend SSAB EMEA AB in Luleå to evaluate a detailed construction of the solution on the work situation Unloading the car. If they also decide to proceed with the implementation of conveyors in the workshop, they need to plan the lighting fixtures along the new locations of the workstations.
