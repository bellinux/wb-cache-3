5|$|Some moulds allow {{previously}} moulded <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> be reinserted {{to allow}} a new plastic layer to form around the first part. This {{is often referred to}} as overmoulding. This system can allow for production of one-piece tires and wheels.|$|E

5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, as he did on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|Art Director Roger Christian used {{scrap metal}} and <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> create set pieces and props to save money, a {{technique}} he employed {{while working on}} Star Wars. For example, some of the Nostromo corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used {{to create the illusion}} of longer corridors in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E

Moving from posts {{in the service of}} churches and courts to the town of Leipzig on the first Sunday after Trinity, 30 May 1723, he began the project of composing a new cantata for every occasion of the liturgical year. He began his first annual cycle of cantatas ambitiously with , in an unusual layout of 14 movements in two symmetrical <b>parts,</b> <b>to</b> be performed before and after the sermon. , performed a week later, has the same structure.|$|E
5|$|Frogs such as Physalaemus nattereri, Physalaemus deimaticus, and Pleurodema brachyops have {{a warning}} display behaviour. These animals inflate {{themselves}} with air {{and raise their}} hind <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> appear as large as possible, and display brightly coloured markings and eyespots to intimidate predators. Seven species of frogs in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in their case the display is likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black as a further warning.|$|E

Incorporating conceptual elements of Afrofuturism and science fiction, The ArchAndroid continues the series' fictional tale of a messianic android and features lyrical themes of love, identity, and self-realization. The album has been compared to the work of artists such as David Bowie, Outkast, Prince and Michael Jackson. The album features multiple collaborations with artists; Saul Williams, Big Boi, Of Montreal and Deep Cotton.|$|E

5|$|Like regular {{characters}} in Fortress mode, characters have thirst, hunger and exhaustion levels. To survive, they must eat, drink and sleep. They {{need to take}} shelter at night when evil creatures like bogeymen come out. In addition to the regular combat mechanism, in this mode, the player can also choose which body <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> strike. A player can visit their retired or ruined fortresses made in Fortress mode. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends mode among the historical figures.|$|E

5|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>to</b> be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} carefully designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.|$|E

50|$|The Empire has {{the feel}} of Western Europe {{around the time of}} the Reformation, but uses magic as a {{replacement}} for most technology. Despite the Empire's vast age, its culture has been remarkably stable, evolving only slowly.

5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be {{inserted into the}} cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.|$|E
5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target runtime was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed {{the task of}} shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view that nothing could possibly be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> restore or cut.|$|E

Some {{of the signs}} and paintings were recovered by the RASC, which had a permanent workspace located within the facility, and are now {{on display at the}} E.C. Carr Astronomical Observatory in Blue Mountain, Ontario and at David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill, Ontario. The original Zeiss-Jena projector was bought as a museum piece by York University for the sum of $1, subsequently dismantled, and placed into storage. More recently, the University has offered the mothballed projector to other planetaria seeking <b>parts</b> <b>to</b> repair their existing electro-mechanical planetarium projectors.|$|E

The scrapyard employees continued to feel sick during the following week, and on 12 February the scrapyard owner, believing the metal to be causing the illness, asked the scrap collector to take it elsewhere, and had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away.|$|E
