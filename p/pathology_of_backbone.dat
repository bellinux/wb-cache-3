40|$|The {{purpose was}} to reveal {{patterns}} of morphometric characteristics variability of lumbar vertebrae and sacrum for a choice of more adequate selection of standard sizes and introduction orientation of corrigent metalware at surgical treatment of spondylolisthesis. Preparations of lumbar vertebrae and sacrum of 60 skeletons, 110 Kt-grams {{of men and women}} of the first and second periods of mature age without visible <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> a <b>backbone</b> and 300 Kt-grams of patients with spondylolisthesis. The data on age variability and sexual dimorphism of lumbar vertebrae and sacrum were obtained. The analysis of results of surgical treatment of 288 patients with spondylolisthesis during 1995 - 2008 was carried out. 160 patients were managed with preoperative planning, taking into account morphometric characteristics of vertebrae and sacrum since 2003. It is necessary to install and arrange metalware at reduction taking into account features of back structures and forward basic complex of lumbar vertebrae and sacrum; that allows to receive adequate decompression of neurovascu-lar structures in 85 - 90 % cases, reliable correction and stabilization of damaged lumbosacral segment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{a number}} of applications, it is not {{sufficient}} to decide whether a given propositional formula is satisfiable or not. Often, one needs to infer specific properties about a formula. This paper focuses on the computation <b>of</b> <b>backbones,</b> which are variables that have the same value in all models of a Boolean formula. Backbones find theoret-ical applications in characterization of SAT problems but they also find practical applications in product configuration or fault localization. This paper presents an extensive evaluation <b>of</b> existing <b>backbone</b> computation algorithms on a large set of benchmarks. This evaluation shows {{that it is possible to}} compute the set <b>of</b> <b>backbones</b> for a large number of instances and it also demonstrates that a large number <b>of</b> <b>backbones</b> appear in practical instances. ...|$|R

Questionnaire for assessment of self feeling was used. For diagnostic <b>of</b> <b>backbone</b> mobility we used criterion of functional disorders and trainings effectiveness assessment. The diagnostic included eight tests for every girl student of risk group - Cervical spine mobility, Otta’s test, Chest excursion, Shober’s test, Tomayer’s test, Pavelky’s (left) test, Pavelky’s (right) test and Backbone index. The main research method was pedagogic experiment. Results: {{it was found that}} 50 % of 1 st year girl students have pain in back. Average level <b>of</b> <b>backbone</b> mobility (backbone index) in the tested group was 86. 9 % from approximate norm {{at the end of the}} research.

40|$|The local search {{algorithm}} WSat {{is one of}} {{the most}} successful algorithms for solving the satisfiability (SAT) problem. It is notably effective at solving hard Random 3 -SAT instances near the so-called `satisfiability threshold', but still shows a peak in search cost near the threshold and large variations in cost over different instances. We make a number of significant contributions to the analysis of WSat on high-cost random instances, using the recently-introduced concept <b>of</b> the <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> a SAT instance. The backbone is the set of literals which are entailed by an instance. We find that the number of solutions predicts the cost well for small-backbone instances but is much less relevant for the large-backbone instances which appear near the threshold and dominate in the overconstrained region. We show a very strong correlation between search cost and the Hamming distance to the nearest solution early in WSat's search. This pattern leads us to introduce a measure <b>of</b> the <b>backbone</b> fragility <b>of</b> an instance, which indicates how persistent the backbone is as clauses are removed. We propose that high-cost random instances for local search are those with very large backbones which are also backbone-fragile. We suggest that the decay in cost beyond the satisfiability threshold is due to increasing backbone robustness (the opposite <b>of</b> <b>backbone</b> fragility). Our hypothesis makes three correct predictions. First, that the <b>backbone</b> robustness <b>of</b> an instance is negatively correlated with the local search cost when other factors are controlled for. Second, that backbone-minimal instances (which are 3 -SAT instances altered so as to be more backbone-fragile) are unusually hard for WSat. Third, that the clauses most often unsatisfied during search are those whose deletion has the most effect on the backbone. In understanding the <b>pathologies</b> <b>of</b> local search methods, we hope to contribute to the development of new and better techniques...|$|R

Given a graph G = (V, E) and a spanning subgraph H <b>of</b> G (the <b>backbone</b> <b>of</b> G), a λ-backbone coloring for G and H is a proper vertex coloring V → { 1, 2, [...] . } of G in which the colors assigned to adjacent vertices in H differ by at least λ. The algorithmic and combinatorial properties <b>of</b> <b>backbone</b> colorings have been studied for various types <b>of</b> <b>backbones</b> {{in a number of}} papers. The main outcome of earlier studies is that the minimum number ℓ of colors for which such colorings V → { 1, 2, [...] ., ℓ} exist in the worst case is a factor times the chromatic number (for all studied types <b>of</b> <b>backbones).</b> We show here that for split graphs and matching or star backbones, ℓ is at most a small additive constant (depending on λ) higher than the chromatic number. Our proofs combine algorithmic and combinatorial arguments. We also indicate other graph classes for which our results imply better upper bounds on ℓ than the previously known bounds...|$|R
