40|$|Background Falciparum malaria is {{an acute}} {{systemic}} disease {{that can cause}} multi organ disorders including in kidney. The {{aim of this study}} was to figure out the association between P. falciparum <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> and renal function in children by measuring ureum, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Methods An analytic prospective study was conducted on all hos- pitalized falciparum malaria patients in the Department of Child Health, Manado Central General Hospital from November 2001 - February 2002. Low parasitemia was defined if P. falciparum found was ≤ 100 / 100 fields and high parasitemia if > 1 / 1 field. Data were analyzed by chi-square and student t–test. Results Among 34 patients, there were 11 with high parasitemia and 23 with low parasitemia. There were 19 with increased ureum and 8 with increased creatinine. There was significant elevation of ureum in high parasitemia (n= 10) compared to that in low para- sitemia patients (n= 9) with p= 0. 004. The increase of serum creati- nine was found in 2 high parasitemia and in 6 low parasitemia patients (p= 0. 611). Mean GFR was 107. 63 ± 30. 62 in high and 121. 94 ± 44. 06 in low parasitemia patients (p= 0. 341). Conclusion There was a significant association between P. falciparum <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> and serum ureum.

40|$|Abstract Malaria is a {{major public}} health problem, and Brazil is the largest {{contributor}} in America {{to the number of}} cases. In the country, the Amazon concentrates around 99. 5 % of the cases. This article aims to compare trends in deforestation rate and the <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> of malaria in the Amazon region between 1996 and 2012. The annual crude rate of deforestation and the Annual <b>Parasite</b> <b>Index</b> (API) of malaria between 1996 and 2012 were estimated. The rate of deforestation has great variability among the states every year, and a similar situation is observed for malaria API over the studied period. There are important variations across the states within this period. The historical series of crude deforestation rate and malaria API have markedly similar trends; with a 1 - 2 years lag between them, suggesting that the occurrence of fluctuations in deforestation numbers impacts malaria numbers in a period immediately following. The mapping of deforested areas and the analysis of temporal series are therefore useful in the analysis of malaria...|$|E

Secondary objective was to assess the Treatment patterns, clinical outcome, and outcome determinants leading to mortality. 150 Patients, diagnosed as malaria and admitted in medicine ward at Tertiary Care Center were enrolled over a period of 8 months after written informed consent. Their demographics as age, sex, and habitat and blood Investigations, especially <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> (PI), gametocyte study, hemoglobin, platelet count were noted. Treatment of patients and their progress and outcome was noted. Descriptive statistics was used for analysis. Out of 150 patients 127 (85 %) were males and 23 (15 %) were females. Young age and lower socio-economic class was more affected. 88 % patients showed typical symptoms. Artesunate (88 %) was most commonly used followed by Chloroquine (12 %). Cure rate was 93 %. Majority (73 %) patients had parasitic index up to 3 %. 40 (26. 68 %) patients showed parasitic index between 4 – 14 %. 93 Patients (62 %) had platelet count up to one lakh. P.

We used a comparative approach to examine the influence of host ecology and morphology on the diversity of chewing lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) among 52 species of Peruvian birds. For each host species we calculated two components of parasite diversity: 1) cumulative species richness, and 2) mean abundance. We tested for correlations between these <b>parasite</b> <b>indices</b> and 13 host ecological and morphological variables. Host ecological variables included geo-graphic range size, local population density, and microhabitat use. Host morpholog-ical variables included body mass, plumage depth, and standard dimensions of bill, foot and toenail morphology, all of which could influence the efficiency of anti-para-site grooming. Data were analysed using statistical and comparative methods that control for sampling effort and host phylogeny.

40|$|Malaria has {{declined}} {{in recent years}} in countries of the American continents. In 2011, 12 of 21 endemic countries had already met their 2015 Millennium Development Goal. However, this declining trend has not been adequately evaluated. An analysis of the number of cases per 100, 000 people (annual <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> [API]) and the percentage of positive blood slides (slide positivity rate [SPR]) during the period of 1959 – 2011 in 21 endemic countries was done using the joinpoint regression methodology. During 1960 – 1979, API and SPR increased significantly and peaked in the 1980 s. Since the 1990 s, there have been significant declining trends in both API and SPR. Additionally, both Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum species-specific incidence have declined. With the exception of two countries, such a collectively declining malaria trend was not observed in previous decades.

40|$|Abstract A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between local malaria transmission and malaria imported by travellers {{to identify the}} utility of national and regional annual <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> (API) in predicting malaria risk and its value in generating recommendations on malaria prophylaxis for travellers. Regional malaria transmission data was correlated with malaria acquired in Latin America and imported into the USA and nine European countries. Between 2000 and 2004, most countries reported declining malaria transmission. Highest API's in 2003 / 4 were in Surinam (287. 4) Guyana (209. 2) and French Guiana (147. 4). The major source of travel associated malaria was Honduras, French Guiana, Guatemala, Mexico and Ecuador. During 2004 there were 6. 3 million visits from the ten study countries and in 2005, 209 cases of malaria of which 22 (11 %) were Plasmodium falciparum.

40|$|Malaria is reemerging in endemic-disease {{countries}} of South America. We examined {{the rate of}} real growth in annual <b>parasite</b> <b>indexes</b> (API) by adjusting APIs for all years to the annual blood examination rate of 1965 for each country. The standardized APIs calculated for Brazil, Peru, Guyana, and for 18 other malariaendemic {{countries of}} the Americas presented a consistent pattern of low rates up through the late 1970 s, followed by geometric growth in malaria incidence in subsequent years. True growth in malaria incidence corresponds temporally with changes in global strategies for malaria control. Underlying the concordance of these events is a causal link between decreased spraying of homes with DDT and increased malaria; two regression models defining this link showed statistically significant negative relationships between APIs and house-spray rates. Separate analyses of data from 1993 to 1995 showed that countries that have recently discontinued their spray programs are reporting large increases in malaria incidence.

40|$|We {{analysed}} the viscera of 321 red foxes {{collected over}} the last 30 years in 34 of the 47 provinces of peninsular Spain, and identified their helminth parasites. We measured parasite diversity in each sampled province using four diversity indices: Species richness, Marg a l e f’s species richness index, Shannon’s species diversity index, and inverse Simpson’s index. In order to find geographical, environmental, and/or human-related predictors of fox parasite diversity, we recorded 45 variables related to topography, climate, lithology, habitat heterogeneity, land use, spatial situation, human activity, sampling effort, and fox presence probability (obtained after environmental modelling of fox distribution). We then performed a stepwise linear regression of each diversity index on these variables, to find a minimal subset of statistically significant variables that account for the variation in each diversity index. We found that most <b>parasite</b> diversity <b>indices</b> increase with the mean distance to urban centres, or in other words, foxes in more rural provinces have a more diverse helminth fauna. Sampling effort and fox presence probability (probably related to fox density) also appeared as conditioning variables for some indices, as well as soil permeability (related with water availability). We then extrapolated the models to predict these fox <b>parasite</b> diversity <b>indices</b> in non-sampled provinces and have a view of their geographical trends...|$|R
40|$|Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. malariae was {{studied in}} a village in Burkina Faso. Consecutive captures of mosquitos were {{organized}} twice a month over a year and the species of the mosquitos identified. Also, the prevalences and densities of Plasmodium spp. were determined every 2 months {{in a sample of}} children who lived in the village. Anopheles gambiae, A. funestus, and A. nili were the local vectors, but only the first two played a predominant role in both P. falciparum and P. malariae transmission. The parasitological sporozoite index (SI) was 4. 48 % for A. gambiae and 4. 22 % for A. funestus. The immunological SIs were higher: 5. 82 % of A. gambiae were infected with P. falciparum and only 0. 16 % with P. malariae; the corresponding proportions for A. funestus were 6. 45 % and 0. 41 %. Transmission of Plasmodium spp. by A. gambiae was important during the rainy season (July-October) and by A. funestus {{at the beginning of the}} dry season (September-November). Each child in the study village could receive about 396 P. falciparum-infected bites per year but only 22 of P. malariae.

Observations were conducted on a silt loam soil, and soil sampling was performed four times through the growing season of peach trees in the period from 2006 to 2008 in Pinggu, Beijing. The result showed that RPO differed from CPPO by its higher abundance of plant feeding nematodes but lower abundance of bacterivore nematodes, as well as significantly higher values of plant <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> but lower nematode biodiversity. Obviously, the absolute abundance of Paratylenchus in RPO was higher than that in CPPO, which could be a key factor for the peach replant problems from the part of soil nematode.

40|$|Soil {{nematode}} {{communities in}} the 0 - 15 soil layer are used as indicators for describing the processes of fallow succession in the semi-arid zone of West Africa (Senegal). Abundance of plant feeding nematodes, non-plant feeding nematodes, plant <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> (PPI), species richness and Shannon evenness of plant parasitic nematodes were measured at five stages of succession : fields, early (1 - 3 years), intermediate (8 - 10 years), old (18 - 20 years) fallows, and forest stage. These nematological indexes were analyzed simultaneously by multivariate analysis to show the indicative properties of nematode communities. Overall, changes in abundance of nematode groups, PPI and diversity, show continuous trends from early fallow to mature stages of the succession; these trends parallel theoretical trends in secondary succession. In addition, soil nematode parameters were meaningful and expressed interactions of various uncontrolled factors with successional processes, such as environmental conditions or cropping history. During the 3 years of the survey, the structure of nematode communities, described by index analysis, showed little temporal change and supported the use of nematodes as stable indicators.

40|$|From 2002 - 2005, Panama {{experienced}} a malaria epidemic {{that has been}} associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation weather patterns, decreased funding for malaria control, and landscape modification. Case numbers quickly decreased afterward, and Panama is now in the pre-elimination stage of malaria eradication. To achieve this new goal, the characterization of epidemiological risk factors, foci of transmission, and important anopheline vectors is needed. Of the 24, 681 reported cases in these analyses (2000 - 2014), ~ 62 % occurred in epidemic years and ~ 44 % in indigenous comarcas (5. 9 % of Panama's population). Sub-analyses comparing overall numbers of cases in epidemic and non-epidemic years identified females, comarcas and some 5 -year age categories as those disproportionately affected by malaria during epidemic years. Annual <b>parasites</b> <b>indices</b> (APIs; number of cases per 1, 000 persons) for Plasmodium vivax were higher in comarcas compared to provinces for all study years, though P. falciparum APIs were only higher in comarcas during epidemic years. Interestingly, two comarcas report increasing numbers of cases annually, despite national annual decreases. Inclusion of these comarcas within identified foci of malaria transmission confirmed their roles in continued transmission. Comparison of species distribution models for two important anophelines with Plasmodium case distribution suggest An. albimanus is the primary malaria vector in Panama, confirmed by identification of nine P. vivax-infected specimen pools. Future malaria eradication strategies in Panama should focus on indigenous comarcas and include both active surveillance for cases and comprehensive anopheline vector surveys...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science - BiologyParasitism is an {{extremely}} common life style that has evolved independently many times, and parasites are diverse with respect to that life style. Parasitic nematodes are commonly found in rodents and can serve as excellent model systems for understanding parasite-host interactions. Proechimys semispinosus (the Central American spiny rat) is a widely-distributed and common rodent in Neotropical forests. Several species of intestinal nematodes have been isolated from this rat, including Heligmostrongylus sp. I analyzed data collected from isolated populations of P. semispinosus. The data set included counts of eggs of Heligmostrongylus sp. that were shed in the feces of their rat hosts. The data were collected over a 13 -month period (January 1997 through January 1998) from rat populations on seven small islands in Gatun Lake, central Panama. Rats were censused monthly by live trapping, and monthly fruit availability was assessed by counting the numbers of trees and lianas that were producing ripe fruits. Rat populations on five islands were provisioned with supplemental food {{during the period of}} least food availability (November and December 1997 and January 1998) to test the effects of host nutritional status on reproductive activity of Heligmostrongylus sp. Rat fecal samples were collected from each captured individual, and nematode eggs were counted from each sample. I estimated monthly rat densities, fruit densities, and per capita fruit availability for each island. I also calculated three indices (egg density, prevalence, and egg density of egg-shedding individuals) of Heligmostrongylus sp. reproductive activity. Egg density and density of egg-shedding individuals were log 10 + 1 -transformed, and prevalence was arcsine square roottransformed. I computed cross-correlation functions of each pair-wise island combination to search for synchrony in nematode reproductive activity among insular populations of rats. I computed Spearman rank correlation coefficients of island-wide means of the three Heligmostrongylus sp. indices and rat density, fruit density, and per capita fruit availability. I used repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to search for differences in mean <b>parasite</b> <b>indices</b> with respect to treatment period, treatment group, population nested within treatment group, month, and the month x treatment group interaction. I then searched for differences in the mean number of eggs shed by rats according to age and sex by constructing a full ANOVA model that included age, sex, and the interaction. I compared the proportions of male and female rats that shed nematode eggs at some time in their capture histories. I used linear regression analysis to search for a relationship between the number of eggs shed and rat body weight. Reproductive activity of Heligmostrongylus sp. varied widely over time, but there was little evidence of synchrony among islands. There were no associations of the <b>parasite</b> <b>indices</b> with rat density, fruit density, or per capita fruit availability. Food provisioning had no effect on reproductive activity, but such activity varied among islands. There 2 were no differences in Heligmostrongylus sp. reproductive activity between age classes of rats, but female rats shed more eggs than did males. By contrast, the proportions of male and female rats shedding eggs did not differ, and there was no relationship between the number of eggs shed by a rat and it body weight. Results suggest that reproductive activity of Heligmostrongylus sp. is infrequent and aseasonal but spatially variable. Host nutritional status has little effect on nematode reproductive activity, but dietary or physiological consequences of female rat reproduction may increase nematode activity. I suggest that Heligmostrongylus sp. has little impact on host fitness or population-level processes...|$|R

METHODS: Data on basic sanitation and socioeconomic dimensions {{were taken from the}} Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) ] 2010 census. Epidemiological malaria information was taken from the Epidemiological Malaria Surveillance Information System [Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica de Malária (SIVEP/Malaria) ], between 2003 and 2013 of the Ministry of Health and from the SIVEP/Malaria forms of the municipality's Endemic Diseases Unit for 2, 013 cases. RESULTS: Our data do not confirm the correlation among indicators of basic sanitation, socioeconomic conditions, and water supply with malaria cases. Of the 1, 557 cases evaluated, most were caused by Plasmodium vivax, with rare cases of Plasmodium falciparum and mixed infections. There were 756 notifications in 2003.

40|$|Multiple {{parasite}} species simultaneously infecting a host {{can interact}} with one another, {{which has the}} potential to influence host-parasite interactions. Invasive species typically lose members of their parasite community during the invasion process. Not only do the founding population escape their parasites, but the rapid range expansion of invaders once in the invaded range can lead to additional stochastic loss of parasites. As such, parasite community dynamics may change along an invasion gradient, with consequences for host invasion success. Here, we use the bank vole, Myodes glareolus, introduced as a small founding population at a point source in the Republic of Ireland in c. 1920 's and its ecto- and endoparasites to ask: i) how does the parasite community vary across an invasion gradient, and ii) are parasite community associations driven by host traits and/or distance from the point of host introduction? We sampled the parasite community of M. Â glareolus at the proposed focal site of introduction, at mid-wave and the invasion front, and used a <b>parasite</b> interactivity <b>index</b> and statistical models to determine the potential for the parasite community to interact. Bank voles harboured up to six different parasite taxa, with a significantly higher <b>parasite</b> interactivity <b>index</b> at the foci of introduction (zÂ =Â  2. 33, pÂ =Â  0. 02) than elsewhere, suggesting the most established parasite community has greater opportunities to interact. All but one of four synergistic parasite community associations were driven by host traits; sex and body mass. The remaining parasite-parasite associations occurred at the mid-point of the invasion wave, suggesting that specific parasite-parasite interactions are not mediated by distance from a focal point of host introduction. We propose that host traits rather than location along an invasion gradient are more likely to determine parasite-parasite interactions in the invasive bank vole.

40|$|Background: Although malaria has {{presented}} {{a significant reduction}} in morbidity and mortality worldwide during the last decade, it remains a serious global public health problem. In Colombia, during this period, many factors have contributed to sustained disease transmission, with significant fluctuations in an overall downward trend in the number of reported malaria cases. Despite its epidemiological importance, few studies have used surveillance data to describe the malaria situation in Colombia. This study aims to describe the characteristics of malaria cases reported during 2010 to the Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) of the National Institute of Health (INS) of Colombia.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to stratify {{priority}} areas for malaria control in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil, based on spatial analysis. The variables used were: Annual <b>Parasite</b> <b>Index</b> (API), Plasmodium falciparum/Plasmodium vivax ratio, population variation, number of families settled, and percent of deforested area. The Moran's I and Local Moran Test were applied, visualized with the Box Map and Moran Map, for 1986 - 1991, 1992 - 1997, and 1998 - 2003. Box Map identified areas with high, low, and intermediate priority for control, and Moran Map identified municipalities with significant autocorrelation. In the high priority area, located in the North of Mato Grosso, malaria incidence decreased drastically despite the increase in the number of municipalities from the first to the last period. Other municipalities were added to the lower priority area, from the Southeast, Southwest, and Central-South of the State. The intermediate priority area was located along the border with neighboring States and municipalities classified as high and low priority.

Skeletal musculature was extracted, dissected in thin layers and observed with ultraviolet light to evaluate the presence of nematodes. Nematodes were counted, isolated and fixed in formaldehyde. Nematodes tissues were cleared in order to visualize their internal structures, and morphometric keys were used to confirm their identification. Results. Nematodes were found only in viscera and identified as Contracaecum spp in the third larval state (L 3). Prevalence was 100 % with light (88. 9 %) and moderate (11. 1 %) infestation. The condition factor value was 0. 036 ± 0. 04, the hepatosomatic, branchiasomatic and somatic spleen indices were 1. 65 ± 0. 37, 3. 40 ± 0. 43, 0. 09 ± 0. 04, respectively. There was no significant relationship between these indices and the <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> (r 0. 05). Conclusions. Moncholo sampled from Ciénaga Grande de Lorica were infected with Contracaecum spp. The condition factor index and the somatic organ indices were not significant predictors of infection...|$|E
40|$|The host {{specificity}} of a parasite {{is not merely}} a function of how many host species it can exploit, but also of how closely related these host species are to each other. Here, a new index of {{host specificity}} is proposed, one that takes into account the average taxonomic or phylogenetic distance between pairs of host species used by a <b>parasite.</b> The <b>index</b> is derived from measures of taxonomic distinctness used in biodiversity studies. It is easy to compute and interpret, ranging from a minimum value of 1 when all host species are members of the same genus, to a maximum of 5, when all host species belong to different classes. The variance of this measure can also be computed, and provides additional information on the taxonomic or phylogenetic structure of the host assemblage. Using data on helminth parasites of Canadian freshwater fishes, we show that the new index, unlike the mere number of known host species, is independent of study effort i. e. the number of published records of a <b>parasite.</b> Although the <b>index</b> and the number of known hosts are not entirely indepen-dent statistically, each captures a different aspect of host specificity. For instance, although acanthocephalans infect significantly more host species than trematodes, cestodes or nematodes, there is no difference in the average index value among these 4 helminth taxa, suggesting that the average taxonomic distances between the host species of a parasite do not vary among these higher taxa. We recommend the use of our new index in future comparative studies of host specificity, in particular when {{the focus is on the}} evolutionary history of parasites and of their past colonizations of host lineages. Key words: freshwater fishes, helminths, phylogenetic diversity, study effort, taxonomic distinctness...|$|R

40|$|Anthropogenic habitat {{fragmentation}} has well-established {{deleterious effects}} on populations and communities of native vertebrates, but the mechanisms underlying population decline under fragmentation remain poorly understood. Most studies of vertebrates in anthropogenically-fragmented habitats {{have focused on}} population density, demographics or fecundity. Relatively {{little attention has been}} given to indices of health status, body condition or physiological stress. In this study, 30 populations of a small marsupial, the agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis), living in anthropogenically-fragmented forest patches were sampled in two years (2007 and 2008). Immediately after sampling in each fragment, a population in a matched control site in similar, but unfragmented forest (a 'pseudofragment') was sampled. Indices of population density (relative abundance), estimated fat reserves (mass-size residuals), health status (erythrocyte variables), parasite load (simplified ectoparasite counts and eosinophil percentages) and chronic physiological stress (total and differential immune cell counts) were examined. Relative abundances were lower and <b>parasite</b> load <b>indices</b> higher in fragmented than continuous forest. Fragment populations displayed indications of regenerative anaemia, which is related to poor health status and potentially caused by chronic stress, frequent blood loss or heavy parasite loads. Estimated fat reserves were higher in fragment than continuous forest populations. Nonetheless, differential leukocyte counts suggested that chronic physiological stress was greater (i. e. greater neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios) (N:L) in populations in fragments. Anthropogenic fragmentation effects are not often distinguished in the ecological literature from those of co-occurring processes, such as habitat loss and degradation. To investigate the effects of these processes, environmental factors were examined that were thought to have a potential influence on agile antechinus (e. g. fragment patch core area, proportion of edge habitat, isolation, woody debris abundance, shrub density etc). Relative abundance of agile antechinus was positively correlated with forest patch core area and native tree-cover within a 0. 5 km radius of a study site. Estimated fat reserves, particularly in males, were greater in populations in fragments with a smaller core area, but statistical modelling indicated that the effect was an indirect one: males had greater estimated fat reserves where the abundance of conspecifics was lower, suggesting that this metric was responding to intraspecific competition and per capita food availability. Health status, indexed by erythrocyte indicators of regenerative anaemia,was positively associated with greater microhabitat heterogeneity, and abundance of shrubs, logs and native trees other than Eucalyptus species. Female abundances were lower in edge habitat (80 m from edge), and females had higher chronic stress indicators (N:L) where fragments were more highly dissected by edge habitat. Although <b>parasite</b> load <b>indices</b> and male N:L were higher in fragment than continuous forest sites, the environmental factors responsible were not identified. The study has demonstrated that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation, loss and degradation can have broadly negative effects on a native vertebrate, not only on its population density, but also in terms of health status and chronic physiological stress. This is a serious concern from a conservation management perspective, because chronic stress has pronounced fitness-reducing effects in vertebrates, including reduced reproductive investment, fecundity and survivorship...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Complicated Plasmodium falciparum {{infection}} {{is associated with}} a 6. 4 % mortality rate in India, yet its prognostication is incompletely understood. The conventional prognostic markers of falciparum malaria include clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters. However these factors are non-specific. Hence there is a need of an accurate inexpensive objective marker for prognosticating falciparum malaria infection outcomes. Angiopoietins, angiogenic factors, eotaxins, adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines have been studied for prognostication of this common disease. Determination of the first four is technically difficult and requires a high level of expertise and equipment. Intermediary cytokines have the most promising role. This study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the serum level of TNF-α in patients with P. falciparum malaria and carry out statistical analysis of levels of serum TNF-α with <b>parasite</b> <b>index,</b> age, severity of anaemia, hypoglycaemia, hepatic and renal dysfunction. In our study the average TNF alpha level in 91 healthy controls was 46. 42 pg/ml whereas that in mild falciparum malaria was 100. 45 pg/ml, in severe malaria – 278. 63 pg/ml and in cerebral malaria it was 532. 6 pg/ml. The mean TNF alpha level was significantly different in severe malaria and cerebral malaria compared to that in healthy controls (p <...|$|E
40|$|Gold-mining {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the maintenance of malaria worldwide. Gold-mining, mostly illegal, has significantly expanded in Colombia during the last decade in areas with limited health care and disease preven-tion. We report a descriptive study that was carried out to determine the malaria prevalence in gold-mining areas of Colombia, using data from the public health surveillance system (National Health Institute) during the period 2010 - 2013. Gold-mining was more prevalent in the departments of Antioquia, Córdoba, Bolívar, Chocó, Nariño, Cauca, and Valle, which contributed 89. 3 % (270, 753 cases) of the national malaria incidence from 2010 - 2013 and 31. 6 % of malaria cases were from mining areas. Mining regions, such as El Bagre, Zaragoza, and Segovia, in Antioquia, Puerto Libertador and Montelíbano, in Córdoba, and Buenaventura, in Valle del Cauca, were the most endemic ar-eas. The annual <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> (API) correlated with gold production (R 2 0. 82, p < 0. 0001); for every 100 kg of gold produced, the API increased by 0. 54 cases per 1, 000 inhabitants. Lack of malaria control activities, together with high migration and proliferation of mosquito breeding sites, contribute to malaria in gold-mining regions. Specific control activities must be introduced to control this significant source of malaria in Colombia...|$|E
40|$|Cross {{sectional}} {{studies on}} malaria prevalence {{was performed in}} 2001, 2002, and 2004 in Vila Candelária, an urban riverside area of Porto Velho, Rondônia, in the Brazilian Western Amazon, followed by longitudinal surveys on malaria incidence. Vila Candelária is a working class district, provided with electricity, water supply, and basic sanitation. Previous preliminary surveys indicated high malaria incidence in this community. At the end of year 2000 regular diagnostic and treatment measures for malaria were introduced, with active search of febrile cases among residents. Despite of both rapid treatment of cases and relative good sanitary and housing conditions, the malaria incidence persisted at high levels during the following years with an annual <b>parasite</b> <b>index</b> of 150 to 300 / 1000 inhabitants. Parasite surveys in 2001, 2002, and 2004 achieved through microscopy and polymerase chain reaction to diagnose malaria showed a constant high prevalence of asymptomatic carriers for both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax parasites. It was concluded that asymptomatic carriers represent an important reservoirs of parasites and that the carriers might contribute to maintaining {{the high level of}} transmission. Comparing our findings to similar geo-demographic situations found in other important urban communities of the Brazilian Amazon, we propose that asymptomatic carriers could explain malaria's outbreaks like the one recently observed in Manaus...|$|E

MethodsThe PSP were manufactured from preimpregnated Olyset Net. They were installed at windows, eaves and doors of 70 dwellings. 320 children aged 6 - 59 months were treated and 311 children were recruited in the control zone. Variables measured are: plasmodic index (IP), gametocyte <b>index,</b> <b>parasite</b> density (PD), fever, hemoglobin, anemia. ResultsThe global IP was 16. 62 % with PSP and 72. 20 % without PSP.

40|$|A {{series of}} [(aryl) arylsufanylmethyl]pyridines (AASMP) have been synthesized. These {{compounds}} inhibited hemozoin formation, formed complexes (KD � 12 to 20 �M) with free heme (ferriprotoporphyrin IX) at a pH {{close to the}} pH of the parasite food vacuole, and exhibited antimalarial activity in vitro. The inhibition of hemozoin formation may develop oxidative stress in Plasmodium falciparum due to the accumulation of free heme. Interestingly, AASMP developed oxidative stress in the parasite, as evident from the decreased level of glutathione and increased formation of lipid peroxide, H 2 O 2, and hydroxyl radical (·OH) in P. falciparum. AASMP also caused mitochondrial dysfunction by decreasing mitochondrial potential (��m) in malaria parasite, as measured by both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, the generation of ·OH may be mainly responsible for the antimalarial effect of AASMP since ·OH scavengers such as mannitol, as well as spin trap �-phenyl-n-tertbutylnitrone, significantly protected P. falciparum from AASMP-mediated growth inhibition. Cytotoxicity testing of the active compounds showed selective activity against malaria <b>parasite</b> with selectivity <b>indices</b> greater than 100.
