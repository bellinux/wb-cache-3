50|$|Although {{distortion}} can be irregular {{or follow}} many patterns, {{the most commonly}} encountered distortions are radially symmetric, or approximately so, arising from the symmetry of a photographic lens.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} correcting the effects of barrel and <b>pincushion</b> lens <b>distortion</b> that preserves {{the scale of the}} captured image. This is significant as the model is able to correct for a practical range of the aforementioned types of lens distortion while maintaining the scale helps minimize the loss of the corrected image’s resolution. The functional inverse of the model is derived and an algorithmic description for correcting lens-distorted images is presented. This model is tested on real images and is applied to the problem of image registration to underscore how critical distortion-free images are to this type of problem...|$|R

50|$|A typical {{example is}} the 24× Zoom Nikkor ED 4.6-110.4mm f2.8-5.0 on the Nikon Coolpix P90, which in 35 mm {{equivalent}} focal length terms is a 26-624mm. To reduce aberration in a lens with such ambitious specifications, these have quite complex constructions, using multiple aspheric elements and often anomalous-dispersion glass. In this example <b>pincushion</b> and barrel <b>distortion</b> can be corrected in the camera firmware as well. The ability to fit such a wide zoom range in one single small-diameter lens makes lens interchangeability {{for the purposes of}} focal length (as opposed to performance in low light or image quality) redundant for most photographers. Most bridge cameras allow the use of secondary lenses to improve wide-angle, telephoto or macro capabilities. These secondary lenses typically screw onto the front of the primary lens either directly or by use of an adapter tube.|$|R

50|$|The globe effect, {{sometimes}} called the rolling ball effect or the spinning globe effect, is an optical phenomenon that occurs with visual optical instruments, in particular binoculars and telescopes, {{that are designed to}} be free of distortion. When these instruments are panned, the moving image appears to roll over a curved, convex surface. In 1949, Horst Koehler at Zeiss (Jena) suggested adding some <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> to the optical design to eliminate the globe effect. August Sonnefeld conducted experiments with volunteers, which supported the claim that a supplementary distortion could improve the imaging of visual optical instruments. Since that time, most binocular manufacturers have followed Zeiss's example and added <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> to their optical design.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{featuring}} the shortest focal length of any prime lens currently manufactured by Sony, the 16mm lens is infamous for its strong <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion,</b> heavy chromatic aberration, and overall image softness.

50|$|Most often a {{prime lens}} will be used, both because the zoom is not {{necessary}} for posed shots (and primes are lighter, cheaper, faster, and higher quality), and because zoom lenses can introduce highly unflattering geometric distortion (barrel distortion or <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion).</b> However, zoom lenses may be used, particularly in candid shots or to encourage creative framing.|$|E

A Google Cardboard-compatible app splits the smartphone display image into two, one for each eye, while also applying barrel distortion to each image to counter <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> from the lenses. The result is a stereoscopic ("3D") image with a wide field of view.|$|E
5000|$|The Batis 135mm is sharp wide open, with {{consistent}} results across the frame. Chromatic aberration is [...] "very low" [...] {{at less than}} half a pixel wide open at the image edge. The lens has its sweet spot at around f/4. Vignetting is [...] "far from severe", but there is some noticeable <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> that can be eliminated with in-camera correction or raw processing.|$|E
50|$|In the Distortions filter, barrel or <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> can be controlled, {{horizontal}} and vertical perspective may be changed, the image may be stretched and squeezed, the image may be skewed, h-bend can be controlled, and vignetting can be corrected. This feature is especially useful for photographs taken with a wide-angle lens, as this often produces distorted images. Complete image flips and rotations of varying degrees may also be done.|$|E
50|$|In photography, a {{rectilinear}} lens is {{a photographic}} lens that yields images where straight features, {{such as the}} walls of buildings, appear with straight lines, {{as opposed to being}} curved. In other words, it is a lens with little or no barrel or <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion.</b> At particularly wide angles, however, the rectilinear perspective will cause objects to appear increasingly stretched and enlarged as they {{near the edge of the}} frame. These types of lenses are often used to create forced perspective effects.|$|E

5000|$|The {{zoom lens}} {{evolved from the}} focal length {{compression}} elements found in telephoto lens. Varying the spacing between a telephoto's front positive and rear negative cells changes the lens' magnification. However, this will upset focus and aberration optimization, and introduce <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion.</b> A real zoom lens needs a compensating cell to push the focal plane back to the appropriate place and took decades of development to become practical. The earliest zooms came out between 1929 and 1932 for professional motion picture cameras and were called [...] "Traveling," [...] "Vario" [...] and [...] "Varo" [...] lenses.|$|E
50|$|In photography, {{distortion}} {{is particularly}} associated with zoom lenses, particularly large-range zooms, {{but may also}} be found in prime lenses, and depends on focal distance - for example, the Canon EF 50mm 1.4 exhibits barrel distortion at extremely short focal distances. Barrel distortion may be found in wide-angle lenses, and is often seen at the wide-angle end of zoom lenses, while <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> is often seen in older or low-end telephoto lenses. Mustache distortion is observed particularly on the wide end of zooms, with certain retrofocus lenses, and more recently on large-range zooms such as the Nikon 18-200 mm.|$|E
50|$|Mathematically, {{barrel and}} <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> are quadratic, meaning they {{increase}} as {{the square of}} distance from the center. In mustache distortion the quartic (degree 4) term is significant: in the center, the degree 2 barrel distortion is dominant, while at the edge the degree 4 distortion in the pincushion direction dominates. Other distortions are in principle possible - pincushion in center and barrel at the edge, or higher order distortions (degree 6, degree 8) - but do not generally occur in practical lenses, and higher order distortions are small relative to the main barrel and pincushion effects.|$|E
50|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} with the problems of wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8 mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12 mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8 mm and 0.7% at 12 mm. It also reports that distortion switches to <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> of 1.4% at 16 mm. SLAR Gear reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13 mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E
50|$|Note that if {{the center}} of the image is closer than the edges (for example, a straight-on shot of a face), then barrel {{distortion}} and wide-angle distortion (taking the shot from close) both increase the size of the center, while <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> and telephoto distortion (taking the shot from far) both decrease the size of the center. However, radial distortion bends straight lines (out or in), while perspective distortion does not bend lines, and these are distinct phenomena. Fisheye lenses are wide-angle lenses with heavy barrel distortion and thus exhibit both these phenomena, so objects in {{the center of the}} image (if shot from a short distance) are particularly enlarged: even if the barrel distortion is corrected, the resulting image is still from a wide-angle lens, and will still have a wide-angle perspective.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} these distortions, {{it should be remembered}} that these are radial defects; the optical systems in question have rotational symmetry (omitting non-radial defects), so the didactically correct test image would be a set of concentric circles having even separation—like a shooter's target. It will then be observed that these common distortions actually imply a nonlinear radius mapping from the object to the image: What is seemingly <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion,</b> is actually simply an exaggerated radius mapping for large radii in comparison with small radii. A graph showing radius transformations (from object to image) will be steeper in the upper (rightmost) end. Conversely, barrel distortion is actually a diminished radius mapping for large radii in comparison with small radii. A graph showing radius transformations (from object to image) will be less steep in the upper (rightmost) end.|$|E
50|$|Designers of zoom lenses {{with large}} zoom ratios often trade {{one or more}} aberrations for higher image sharpness. For example, {{a greater degree of}} barrel and <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> is tolerated in lenses that span the focal length range from wide angle to {{telephoto}} with a focal ratio of 10× or more than would be acceptable in a fixed focal length lens or a zoom lens with a lower ratio. Although modern design methods have been continually reducing this problem, barrel distortion of greater than one percent is common in these large-ratio lenses. Another price paid is that at the extreme telephoto setting of the lens the effective focal length changes significantly while the lens is focused on closer objects. The apparent focal length can more than halve while the lens is focused from infinity to medium close-up. To a lesser degree, this effect is also seen in fixed focal length lenses that move internal lens elements, rather than the entire lens, to effect changes in magnification.|$|E
30|$|In 3 D {{broadcasting}} besides having visually good {{images for}} each stereo channel, {{it is also}} important that the channels match with each other. Research in stereo quality control has identified a number of factors affecting viewing experience, such as parallax (disparity) irregularities, focus mismatch, color mismatch, geometry mismatch, vertical parallax, object edge tearing, cardboard effect, <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion,</b> etc. Such distortion factors affecting 3 D video quality are well documented [1].|$|E
30|$|Based on both {{categorization}} {{frequencies and}} distortion ratings, non-prototypical symbols with superior psychometric properties were chosen. In addition to considering correct classifications and significant pairwise comparisons, a balanced representation of both barrel and <b>pincushion</b> <b>distortion</b> across symbols was sought. The resulting pattern comprised −[*] 30, −[*] 60, −[*] 90 for circle, −[*] 30, 60, −[*] 90 for square, 30, 60, −[*] 90 for star, and 30, −[*] 60, −[*] 90 for triangle.|$|E
