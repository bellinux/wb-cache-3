40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Epstein-Barr virus genome in primary <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> occurring {{in the absence of}} immune suppression. METHODS: Forty eight consecutive patients with lymphomas restricted to the central nervous system were identified, all of whom had had neurosurgical biopsies performed at the National Hospitals for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London. Only five patients had some form of underlying immune deficiency; 43 were apparently normal. The tumours were studied with immunohistochemical markers and by in situ hybridisation, using a biotinylated probe to the internal repeat region of Epstein-Barr virus. RESULTS: All the lymphomas were B cell in origin. Tumours from the five immunosuppressed patients all showed hybridisation, as did two of the "spontaneous" tumours. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas</b> so far probed for Epstein-Barr virus genome: as more are examined, it is suggested that a small proportion of the tumours from immunocompetent patients will also contain the virus...|$|R

40|$|We used a {{multiplex}} nested-PCR assay for {{the simultaneous}} detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of five human herpesviruses (HVs) (cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], varicella-zoster virus [VZV], {{herpes simplex virus}} [HSV], and human herpesvirus 6 [HHV- 6]) in a clinical evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients with neurological disorders. This method, which has the advantages of being rapid and economical, would be of particular interest for the diagnosis of neurological syndromes caused {{by more than one}} HV. We studied 251 CSF samples from 219 patients. HV DNA was demonstrated in 93 (37 %) of the CSF samples (34 % of the patients). CMV was the HV most frequently detected in our patients (25 %), while EBV, VZV, HSV, and HHV- 6 DNAs were present in significantly fewer cases (7, 4, 3, and 1 %, respectively). When results were compared with the final etiological diagnoses of the patients, the multiplex HV PCR showed high specificity for the diagnosis of CMV and VZV neurological diseases and for <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (0. 95, 0. 97, and 0. 99, respectively). The sensitivity of the assay was high for CMV disease (0. 87), was low for <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (0. 33), and was not evaluable for VZV disease due to the small number of patients with this diagnosis. Nevertheless, detection of VZV DNA had possible diagnostic value in four of the nine cases, and EBV DNA amplification always predicted the diagnosis of <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in patients with cerebral masses. Detection of HSV DNA was frequently associated with CMV amplification and fatal encephalitis. HHV- 6 was not considered to have a pathogenetic role in the three cases in which it was detected.

40|$|Intracerebral epidermoid cysts {{are rare}} lesions and {{may account for}} only 1. 5 % of {{intracranial}} epidermoid tumors. Cell entrapment from the mesectodermal origin of the neural crest within the <b>primitive</b> <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere {{may lead to the}} formation of such rare intracerebral lesions. An intracerebral epidermoid cyst located in the right temporal lobe that was surgically treated is presented. The origin, clinical course, radiological features, and surgical treatment of such uncommon lesions are discussed based on a review of the literature. Intraoperative findings revealed an epidermoid tumor. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged with no neurological deficits. On long-term follow-up (2 years), there were no signs of recurrence. Truly intracerebral epidermoid tumors are rarely found. Cells originating from mesectodermal lines may migrate and remain trapped within the <b>primitive</b> <b>cerebral</b> hemisphere while the neural tube is closing, leading to the formation of such intraparenchymal epidermoid tumors. Accurate preoperative diagnosis can be very difficult due to the radiological similarities to other common intracerebral cysts (e. g., astrocytomas or gliomas). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, especially with diffusion-weighted images, allow greater accuracy in the preoperative differential diagnosis. Radical surgical removal should be attempted, but a less aggressive surgical strategy should be considered if there is strong adherence between the tumor capsule and the brain tissue, particularly in eloquent areas...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} results of {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) and thallium- 201 (201 Tl) SPET scanning with laboratory analyses including CSF DNA detection, brain biopsy, and necropsy in the discrimination of <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS. METHODS: A retrospective study of 32 patients infected with HIV who had focal CNS lesions on MRI {{as a result of}} either lymphoma or toxoplasmosis. RESULTS: 18 patients had lymphoma, 12 had toxoplasmosis, and two had both. Toxoplasma IgG antibodies were detected in only seven patients [...] four with toxoplasmosis, two with lymphoma, and one with both diagnoses. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in CSF of all six patients with lymphoma and none of two with toxoplasmosis. MRI showed multiple lesions in 23 patients, appearances did not discriminate between lymphoma and toxoplasmosis; nine patients had single lesions, of these eight had lymphoma (p = 0. 044, two tailed Fisher's exact test) 201 Tl SPET showed accumulation in 17 with lymphoma and six with toxoplasmosis (p = 0. 034, two tailed Fisher's exact test). Of nine patients with single lesions on MRI and 201 Tl SPET with focal accumulation eight had lymphoma. 201 Tl SPET uptake ratios of > or = 2. 9 were only seen with lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of patients' toxoplasma serostatus does not aid discrimination between lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. Single lesions on MRI with focal accumulation of 201 Tl strongly suggest lymphoma. Multiple lesions on MRI with 201 Tl SPET uptake ratios > or = 2. 9 also suggest lymphoma; uptake ratios less than 2. 1 do not aid discrimination. Detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in CSF is highly sensitive and specific for <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{frequently}} affected {{in patients with}} the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition to opportunistic CNS infections and <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> approx. 20 % of the patients develop HIV-associated encephalopathies. Two major histopathological manifestations are observed. HIV leukoencephalopathy (progressive diffuse leukoencephalopathy) {{is characterized by a}} diffuse loss of myelin in the deep white matter of the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, with scattered multinucleated giant cells and microglia but scarce or absent inflammatory reaction. HIV encephalitis (multinucleated giant cell encephalitis) is associated with accumulations of multinucleated giant cells, inflammatory reaction and often focal necroses. In some patients, both patterns may overlap. In order to identify the HIV genome in the CNS, brain tissue from 27 patients was analyzed for the presence of HIV gag sequences using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers encoding a 109 base pair segment of the gag gene. Amplification of HIV gag succeeded in all 5 patients with clinical and histopathological evidence for HIV encephalopathy but was negative in the 20 AIDS patients with opportunistic bacterial, parasitic and/or viral infections or with <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> These results strongly suggest that the evolution of histopathologically recognizable HIV-encephalopathies closely correlates with the presence and/or tissue concentration of HIV. Since there were no cases with amplified HIV DNA in the absence of HIV-associated tissue lesions, we conclude that harboring and replication of HIV in the CNS rapidly causes corresponding clinical and morphological changes of HIV-associated encephalopathies. In two children with severe HIV encephalomyelitis, large amounts of HIV gag and env transcripts were detected in affected areas of the brain and spinal cord by in situ hybridization.

40|$|Primary <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> {{is a rare}} disease. The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{survival}} of the patients treated with radiotherapy alone vs. patients treated with a combined schedule of radio-chemotherapy. Our results will be compared with currently published data and main prognostic factors will be briefly discussed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1974 and 1990, 27 cases of primary <b>cerebral</b> <b>lymphoma</b> were diagnosed at our institution. All patients had biopsy-proven disease, the pathology of which was reviewed for this study. RESULTS: The overall median survival time was 24 months and one-, two- and three-year overall survival was 59, 46 and 29 % respectively. The median radiation dose was 46 Gy, ranging from 19. 5 to 60 Gy. The median dose per fraction was 2 Gy (ranging from 1. 61 to 3 Gy). The median elapsed treatment time was 32 days (ranging from three to 45 days). We were not able to demonstrate any statistically significant difference between patients who received radiotherapy alone (n = 14, median survival time = 24 months) and those who received a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (n = 11, median survival time = 30 months), (p = 0. 4). Prognostic factors of survival were tested using a univariate analysis (Wilcoxon test). Parameters such as mass appearance (unilobular, p = 0. 048), performance status at the time of the diagnosis (0 to 1, p = 0. 014), and CT imaging (hypodense, p = 0. 043) influenced positively survival. Centroblastic histology (Kiel) was found associated with a negative prognosis (p = 0. 043). CONCLUSION: In our experience, there is no statistically significant difference of survival between patients treated with radiotherapy alone or with a combined treatment of radio-chemotherapy. Other prognostic factors of survival were discovered, although the analysis was univariate, due to the limited number of patients. Multicentric prospective studies should be elaborated in order to optimize the treatment of this disease. Peer reviewe...|$|R
