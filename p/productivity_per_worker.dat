50|$|In Marxian economics, {{the rate}} of {{exploitation}} is the divergence between labor productivity and the wage rate. In Marx's analysis of capitalist development, technological progress yields a higher ratio of constant capital (non-labor inputs) to variable capital (labor inputs), which lowers the demand for labor relative to capital inputs. This causes unemployment that services to exert a downward pressure on wages while <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> rises, thus increasing {{the rate of}} surplus value extraction.|$|E
50|$|The Junkers held {{a virtual}} {{monopoly}} on all {{agriculture in the}} East Elbian part of the German Reich. Since the Junker estates were necessarily inherited by the eldest son alone, younger sons, all well educated and {{with a sense of}} noble ancestry, turned to the civil and military services, and dominated all higher civil offices, as well as the officer corps. Around 1900 they modernized their farming operations to increase productivity. They sold off less productive land, invested more heavily in blooded cattle and hogs, used new fertilizers, increased grain production, and improved <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker.</b> They obtained high tariffs that reduced competition from American grain and meat.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} {{elucidate}} {{the extent to which}} existing interregional inequality in aggregate <b>productivities</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> within the European Union can be attributed to differences in the sectoral composition of activities, rather than to productivity gaps that are uniform across sectors. To this effect we use the shift-share analysis and show that regional specialization has a very minor role and that interregional differences can essentially be explained by uniform productivity gaps only. Our empirical results turn out to be statistically very significant and robust to different definitions of Gross Value Added (market prices and factor costs), different degrees of sectoral breakdowns, dates and alternative sets of countries. Our findings thus provide support to regional development policies focusing on actions producing uniform increases in regional productivities, such as infrastructures and human capital.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{comparing}} two dynamic equilibria {{to each other}} is known as comparative dynamics. For example, in the neoclassical growth model, starting from one dynamic equilibrium {{based in part on}} one particular saving rate, a permanent increase in the saving rate leads to a new dynamic equilibrium in which there are permanently higher capital per worker and <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker,</b> but an unchanged growth rate of output; so it is said that in this model the comparative dynamic effect of the saving rate on capital per worker is positive but the comparative dynamic effect of the saving rate on the output growth rate is zero.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{formidable}} {{constraints and}} disruptions, the Chinese economy was never stagnant. Production grew substantially between 1800 and 1949 and increased fairly rapidly after 1949. Before the 1980s, however, production gains were largely matched by population growth, so that productive capacity {{was unable to}} outdistance essential consumption needs significantly, particularly in agriculture. Grain output in 1979 was about {{twice as large as}} in 1952, but so was the population. As a result, little surplus was produced even in good years. Further, few resources could be spared for investment in capital goods, such as machinery, factories, mines, railroads, and other productive assets. The relatively small size of the capital stock caused <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> to remain low, which in turn perpetuated the economy's inability to generate a substantial surplus.|$|E
50|$|Capital {{deepening}} is {{a situation}} where the capital per worker is increasing in the economy. This is also referred to as increase in the capital intensity. Capital deepening is often measured by the rate of change in capital stock per labour hour. Overall, the economy will expand, and <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> will increase. However, according to some economic models, such as the Solow model, economic expansion will not continue indefinitely through capital deepening alone. This is partly due to diminishing returns and wear & tear (depreciation). Investment is also required {{to increase the amount of}} capital available to each worker in the system and thus increase the ratio of capital to labour. In other economic models, for example, the AK model or some models in endogenous growth theory, capital deepening can lead to sustained economic growth even without technological progress. Traditionally, in development economics, capital deepening is seen as a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic development of a country.|$|E

A country's ability to improve its {{standard}} of living over time depends almost entirely on its ability to raise its output per worker.“ [...] This measure (output <b>per</b> <b>worker)</b> is, however, more problematic than the GDP or even invalid because this measure allows maximizing all supplied inputs, i.e. materials, services, energy and capital at the expense of producer income.|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} as to ARBED's willingness to make concessions to the German authorities was already heavily discussed during the post-war trial of Aloyse Meyer, the managing director. The different stances of ARBED and HADIR show that there was certainly some room for maneuver. Unlike the former, the management of HADIR refused {{to cooperate with the}} German occupiers. Yet many issues have yet to be examined by historians. It is unclear whether the decline in <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> was due to passive resistance, a lack of raw materials, or a shortage of qualified workers in wartime. Similarly, about 1,000 Ostarbeiter were employed in the Luxembourgish iron and steel industry, and their working conditions have yet to be examined. Paul Dostert claims that, in general, industry was able to continue production relatively undisturbed and still made considerable profits under German oversight, but these were disguised by the war-related production stoppages in 1940 and 1944-1945.|$|E
5000|$|The mine {{is notable}} {{among the many}} coal mines {{operating}} in the same region at the time for its leadership by Josephine Roche. She inherited a minority stock ownership from her father upon his death in 1927, becoming {{vice president of the}} company in 1928 and president by 1929. [...] Roche was a dedicated believer in labor unions, and soon after becoming president she invited the United Mine Workers of America back to Rocky Mountain Fuel Company's mines, offering top pay and taking actions to repair labor-management relations. [...] This was to the great chagrin of fellow mine owners, who broke the unions in 1914 after years of intense and often violent disputes, culminating in events such as the Columbine Mine and Ludlow Massacres. [...] Roche's pro-labor policies, however, were effective - within a few years, the company's <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> was the best in the state. [...] After leaving the company in 1934 to enter politics, Roche returned in 1937, but even with the active support of her workers she was unable to save the company, which folded in 1944. The company was ordered by bankruptcy court to liquidate assets and all mines ceased operation but the liquidation was not completed. Roche continued in control of the defunct company and the remaining assets and moved to Washington, D.C. Roche became president of Rocky Mountain Fuel Company in 1950 and maintained control of the company's non-liquidated assets until her death in 1976.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the contributions of}} physical capital, human capital, and unskilled labor to economic growth for 31 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. We find that growth in physical capital accounts for 67 percent of growth in real GDP, whereas growth in human capital accounts for only 22 percent of real GDP growth and, the rest 11 percent is accounted for by growth of raw labor. When it comes to growth of <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> employed <b>worker,</b> 90 percent is accounted for by growth rate of physical capital <b>per</b> employed <b>worker,</b> 46 percent by rate of increase in human capital <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> and negative 36 percent by rate of change of total factor of productivity (TFP).

40|$|Many {{historical}} {{comparisons of}} international productivity use measures of labour <b>productivity</b> (output <b>per</b> <b>worker).</b> Differences in labour productivity {{can be caused}} by differences in technical efficiency or differences in capital intensity. Moving to measures of total factor productivity allows international comparisons to ascertain whether differences in labour productivity arise from differences in efficiency or differences in factors utilized in the production process. This paper examines differences in output <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> in the manufacturing sectors of Canada and the United States in 1929 {{and the extent to which}} it arises from efficiency differences. It makes corrections for differences in capital and materials intensity <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> in order to derive a measure of total factor efficiency of Canada relative to the United States, using detailed industry data. It finds that while output <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> in Canada was only about 75 % of the United States productivity level, the total factor productivity measure of Canada was about the same as the United States level - that is, there was very little difference in technical efficiency in the two countries. Canada's lower output <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> was the result of the use of less capital and materials <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> than the United States.

40|$|The {{methods that}} use to measure {{productivity}} growth generally ignore the pollutants that {{are produced by}} the industrial process. For example, pollutant emissions generated as undesirable output beside the main output of Malaysia’s manufacturing sector are excluded from the productivity accounting framework. This study aims an extended productivity measure that takes pollutants into account internalisation of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) as measure of organic water pollutant emissions into production function as un-priced input. Two models were generated from the production functions to measure manufacturing sector productivity growth. The first model was the decomposition of output growth into changes of capital, labour, intermediate inputs, BOD emissions and total factor productivity growth. The second model was the decomposition of labour <b>productivity</b> (output <b>per</b> <b>worker),</b> into capital deepening (capital <b>per</b> <b>worker),</b> material-labour ratio (material <b>per</b> <b>worker)</b> BOD emissions intensity (BOD emissions <b>per</b> <b>worker)</b> and total factor productivity growth.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that commodity price variability causes problems for primary producing and dependent countries. This paper tests the effects of price uncertainty (volatility) on economic growth. The model is constructed using a yearly panel data for the ten biggest countries in South America. The results show that output <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> varies enormously across countries, even within the region. Our analysis shows that exogenous shocks continue having a significant negative effect on growth on developing countries. Despite volatility series are not constant through time, we found a homogenous negative effect within the region, but it is heterogeneous when we apply a causality test. The effect is commonly observed in economic time series and it shows that growth rates are significantly reduced by large discrete negative commodity price shocks. Our analysis documented that the impact on <b>productivity</b> (output <b>per</b> <b>worker)</b> is driven through capital formation and foreign investment, as well as, by differences in what we call ‘social infrastructure’ (i. e. institutions and government policies). ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we examine {{regional}} data on per worker GDP, disaggregated at sectoral level, by focusing our interest {{on the role of}} differences in the sectoral composition of activities, and in productivity gaps that are uniform across sectors, in explaining the catching-up process, which is realized through physical and human capital as well as technological knowledge accumulation. Our objective is to investigate how much of the interregional inequality in aggregate <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> is imputable to each component. A methodology for identifying and analyzing sources of inequality from a decomposed perspective is developed in the growth framework by combining a shift-share based technique and a SUR model specification for the conditional-convergence analysis. The proposed approach is employed to analyze aggregate interregional inequality of per worker productivity levels in Italy over the period 1970 – 2000. With respect to the existing empirical results, our approach provides a more comprehensive and detailed examination of the contribution of each identified component in explaining the regional productivity gaps in Italy. It is argued that region-specific productivity differentials, uniform across sectors, explain a quite large share of differences in <b>productivity</b> <b>per</b> <b>worker.</b> However, sectoral composition plays a non negligible role, although decreasing since the end of 1980 s, and very different productivity patterns emerge within geographical areas...|$|E

Using panel data for 88 US metropolitan sta-tistical areas, this study estimates congestion’s drag on employment growth (1993 to 2008) and <b>productivity</b> growth <b>per</b> <b>worker</b> (2001 to 2007).

While higher ADT per freeway lane appears to slow productivity growth, {{there is no evidence of}} congestion-induced travel delay impeding productivity growth. Results suggest that the strict policy focus on travel time savings may be misplaced and, instead, better outlooks for managing congestion’s economic drag lie in prioritising the economi-cally most important trips (perhaps through road pricing) or in providing alterna-tive travel capacity to enable access despite congestion...|$|R
