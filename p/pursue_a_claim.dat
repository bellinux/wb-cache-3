In September 2011, {{it was reported that}} the Dowler family had been offered £2m in personal damages. In January 2012, it was reported that Surrey Police and other police forces knew soon after Dowler's death that News of the World staff had accessed her mobile phone messages, but did not take issue with this. Instead a senior Surrey officer invited newspaper staff to a meeting to discuss the case.|$|E

50|$|The Ninth Circuit's {{ruling was}} {{reversed}} and remanded. In a 6-3 ruling, Ginsburg J. declared that laches cannot be invoked as <b>a</b> bar to <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for damages brought within §507(b)’s three-year window. However, in extraordinary circumstances, laches may, {{at the very}} outset of litigation, curtail the relief equitably awarded.|$|R
5000|$|Commentators {{have criticized}} {{reliance}} on arbitration fees to suggest unfairness towards the consumer. Edward A. Dauer {{said that the}} lowered costs of arbitration as compared to litigation may be more beneficial to businesses who tend to hire counsel at an hourly rate rather than consumers whose legal representation is subject to contingent fee agreements. Christopher R. Drahozal said that upfront arbitration costs should not affect the ability for consumers represented by lawyers on a contingent fee basis to bring claims in arbitration. [...] Stephen Ware {{said that it is}} erroneous to only compare arbitration forum fees with court fees because, he says, the entire cost of <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> in arbitration will likely be lower than the entire cost of <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> in litigation. Peter Rutledge criticized making a distinction between attorney's fees and arbitration fees, saying that, overall, they both represent out-of-pocket expenses for a consumer.|$|R

500|$|Beginning the {{day after}} the argument, the justices lobbied each other through written memorandum. At a conference held among justices on October 15, 1977, they decided to request further {{briefing}} from the parties on the applicability of Title VI. [...] The supplemental brief for the university was filed on November 16, and argued that Title VI was a statutory version of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and did not allow private plaintiffs, such as Bakke, to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> under it. [...] Bakke's brief arrived the following day. [...] Colvin submitted that Bakke did have a private right of action, and that his client did not want the university to suffer the remedy prescribed under Title VI for discriminatory institutions—loss of federal funding—but wanted to be admitted. In November, Justice Blackmun left Washington to have prostate surgery at the Mayo Clinic.|$|E
2500|$|Amanda Marcotte, in {{a column}} for the news site Talking Points Memo, criticized Nungesser's {{decision}} to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> under Title IX rather than file a libel suit, and characterized the suit as a [...] "nuisance lawsuit" [...] This characterization was disputed by Samantha Harris of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, who instead argued that the suit demonstrated the problem with requiring universities to investigate accusations of sexual assault, cautioning that [...] "until something changes, {{we are likely to}} see more cases like this one." ...|$|E

Thurlbeck had worked for News of the World for 21 years at the time of his dismissal.|$|R
50|$|Considering the Black Hills {{sacred and}} {{illegally}} taken, in the 20th century, the Lakota <b>pursued</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> against the US {{government for the}} return of the land. In the 1980 United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians the United States Supreme Court ruled that the land had been taken illegally, and the US government offered financial compensation in settlement. The Oglala Lakota are persisting in their demand to have the land returned to their nation; the account with their compensation is earning interest.|$|R
2500|$|Litigation {{among those}} within a company has {{historically}} been very restricted in UK law. The attitude of courts favoured non-interference. As Lord Eldon said in the old case of Carlen v Drury, [...] "This Court is not required on every Occasion to take the Management of every Playhouse and Brewhouse in the Kingdom." [...] If there were disagreements between the directors and shareholders about whether to <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim,</b> this {{was thought to be}} a question best left for the rules of internal management in a company's constitution, since litigation could legitimately be seen as costly or distracting from doing the company's real business. The board of directors invariably holds the right to sue in the company's name as a general power of management. So if wrongs were alleged to have been done to the company, the principle from the case of Foss v Harbottle, was that the company itself was the proper claimant, and it followed that as a general rule that only the board could bring claims in court. A majority of shareholders would also have the default right to start litigation, but the interest a minority shareholder had was seen as relative to the wishes of the majority. Aggrieved minorities could not, in general, sue. Only if the alleged wrongdoers were themselves in control, as directors or majority shareholder, would the courts allow an exception for a minority shareholder to derive the right from the company to launch a claim.|$|E

50|$|Delict {{deals with}} the righting of legal wrongs in civil law, on the {{principle}} of liability for loss caused by failure in the duty of care, whether deliberate or accidental. When considering <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> under delict, in Scots law, there are three criteria that have to be met: firstly you have to establish that you were owed a duty of care, secondly you have to prove that that duty of care has been breached and lastly you have to show a causal link between the breach of care and the loss you have suffered.|$|R

50|$|The SCA {{reversed}} the High Court’s decision. It granted ABSA’s {{application to intervene}} and dismissed Mr Fraser’s application for provision for legal expenses. The SCA held that the legislature could not have intended that a concurrent creditor, who had <b>pursued</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> and obtained <b>a</b> default judgment prior to the issuance of a restraint order, would be prevented from satisfying that judgment simply because the debtor’s assets had been restrained. As {{a consequence of the}} SCA’s decision, ABSA’s claim against Mr Fraser was secured. Mr Fraser applied for leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court against the judgment and order of the SCA.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, both tribal councils have {{authorized}} {{the development of}} casinos to generate revenue to support economic development, infrastructure, health care and education. The Ho-Chunk Nation is working on language restoration and has developed a Hoocąąk-language app for the iPhone. Since 1988, it has <b>pursued</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> to the Badger Army Ammunition Plant as traditional territory; the area has since been declared surplus, but the Ho-Chunk have struggled with changes in policy at the Department of the Interior.

5000|$|The primary {{remedy for}} breach of {{contract}} is expectation damages, or [...] "benefit of the bargain." [...] At law, this is monetary compensation. At equity, it can be specific performance or an injunction, among other things. For example, Dan and Pam have an enforceable contract {{for the sale of}} Dan's watch. The price they agreed to was $10. The actual value of the watch is $15. Pam would be able to successfully <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for $5. She might elect this route if {{she did not want to}} keep the watch but sell it to a third party for a profit. Alternatively, Pam could successfully <b>pursue</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> whereby the court would order Dan to sell the watch for the original price. She might elect this route if she actually wanted the watch for herself.|$|E

5000|$|Walter Henry {{was the son}} of Walter Coningsby Erskine, 12th Earl of Kellie and Elise Youngson. He succeeded as 13th Earl of Kellie on his fathers {{death in}} 1872. Coningsby Erskine had <b>pursued</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> for {{succession}} to the earldom of Mar which was unresolved on his death, but this claim was recognized in 1875 making Walter Henry the Earl of Mar also. However, this was modified in 1885 by a special Act of Parliament, limiting the claim to the seventh creation of the title, leaving Walter the 11th Earl of Mar concurrently with John Goodeve-Erskine, who was 27th Earl of Mar in its first creation. There have thereafter been two earls of Mar at any one time.|$|R
