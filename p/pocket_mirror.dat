500|$|On 1 March, Diamandis {{unveiled}} the album artwork {{for the standard}} version of Electra Heart, which depicts a blonde Diamandis wearing several hair rollers. The singer later revealed {{that because of the}} dye, her hair started to fall out, so she got a boy's haircut and wore a wig. Becky Bain from Idolator complimented its [...] "retro film stock look" [...] and opined that it [...] "is just a snapshot from some 1970s exploitation movie", while Bradley Stern from MuuMuse jokingly referenced the album track [...] "Homewrecker" [...] when stating that she [...] "looks like a proper Suzy Homemaker! (Or should I say Suzy Homewrecker?)" [...] The artwork for the deluxe version features the same picture of Diamandis, although it is tinted purple. The track listing for the standard version was confirmed on 1 March, while the track listing for the deluxe version was announced on 5 March. A limited edition box set of Electra Heart contained the deluxe version of the record, four photo art cards, a ring, perspex, necklace, and <b>pocket</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
500|$|Mukesh Chhabra was the film's casting director. Swara Bhaskar was {{the first}} to be cast in the role of Chanda Sahay, a single mother of a 15-year-old girl. Initially sceptical about playing a mother on screen early in her career, she changed her mind after reading the script. To {{understand}} the role better, Bhaskar stayed with professional domestic helpers from Agra, Uttar Pradesh, where the film is set. She bought such props as a handbag, a comb, a <b>pocket</b> <b>mirror,</b> and rubber chappals. She also drew guidance from her mother's experiences of handling a teenage daughter. After the film's release, Bhaskar {{said in an interview with}} Daily News and Analysis that her friends in the Hindi film industry advised her not to take up the role as they felt it would be a [...] "career suicide" [...] for her. She agreed to participate in the project because [...] "the story stayed in [...] mind". The next role to be cast was that of the 15-year-old daughter of the protagonist. Ria Shukla was selected for the role after auditions in Lucknow. Ratna Pathak and Pankaj Tripathi play supporting roles in the film. A group of around 25 local children played the students at the school.|$|E

5000|$|Evelyn {{became a}} popular cover face on women's {{magazines}} of the period, including Vanity Fair, Harper's Bazaar, The Delineator, Women's Home Companion, Ladies' Home Journal and Cosmopolitan. Inside the advertising pages of these magazines and in newspapers, her role became {{the business of}} creating consumer demand for toothpaste, face creams, and a sundry array of other commercial goods. Her likeness and form were ubiquitous, showcased on sheet music and souvenir items — beer trays, tobacco cards, <b>pocket</b> <b>mirrors,</b> postcards, chromolithographs. She often posed in vignettes, dressed in various guises: a Japanese geisha, country gal, woodland nymph, Grecian goddess or Roma maiden. The photo postcards were known as mignon (sweet, lovely), their pictorials being of a suggestive sensuality {{in contrast to the}} graphic display of the female body depicted in the notorious [...] "French postcards" [...] of the day. Evelyn Nesbit arguably became the first pin-up girl, posing for calendars for Prudential Life Insurance, Swift, Coca-Cola, and other corporations.|$|R

5000|$|To the {{indigenous}} peoples of this area, the tree was sacred. According to Mixtec myth, people originated from cypress trees, which were considered sacred and a genus. This particular tree {{was the site of}} a ritual which included the sacrifice of a dove and was realized for the last time in 1834. According to Mixe myth, the origin of this particular tree is the walking stick of a god or a king by the name of Conday, who stuck his walking stick, supposedly weighing 62 kilos, into the ground which he rested. From that point on, the tree began to grow, and according to the king version of the story, the king died the same day the tree began to grow. [...] The tree has gnarled branches and trunk, and various local legends relate to what appear to be animals and other shapes growing in the tree. Today, these forms have names such as “the elephant,” “the lion,” “the Three Kings,” “the deer”, “the pineapple,” “the fish,” “the squirrel’s tail” and “Carlos Salinas’ears.” Local guides point out the shapes using <b>pocket</b> <b>mirrors</b> to reflect the sun.|$|R
60|$|Desirous {{to dispel}} entirely this timidity, and {{to open a}} trade with the simple {{inhabitants}} of the hut, who, he did not doubt, had furs somewhere concealed, the captain now drew forth that grand lure {{in the eyes of}} a savage, a <b>pocket</b> <b>mirror.</b> The sight of it was irresistible. After examining {{it for a long time}} with wonder and admiration, they produced a musk-rat skin, and offered it in exchange. The captain shook his head; but purchased the skin for a couple of buttons--superfluous trinkets! as the worthy lord of the hovel had neither coat nor breeches on which to place them.|$|E

It proved to be very satisfactory, for while we were in the cave the Orofenans had brought {{absolutely}} everything belonging to us, together with a large supply of food from the main island. Not a single article was missing; even our books, a can with the bottom out, and the broken pieces of a little <b>pocket</b> <b>mirror</b> had been religiously transported, and with these a few articles that had been stolen from us, notably my pocket-knife. Evidently a great taboo had been laid upon all our possessions.

40|$|Copper {{complexes}} of tetraphenylporphyrin (H 2 TPP) and tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin (H 2 TPP(F)) deposited as {{thin films}} on Au(111) {{have been studied}} experimentally and theoretically. Core level emissions from C 1 s, N 1 s, F 1 s and Cu 2 p as well as valence states of CuTPP and CuTPP(F) have been investigated using surface photoelectron spectroscopy. The interpretation of experimental results has been guided by theoretical calculations carried out on isolated species {{in the habit of}} the density functional theory. Reference to experimental and theoretical outcomes pertaining to H 2 TPP and H 2 TPP(F) allowed a confident and detailed assignment of the title molecules' X-ray and ultraviolet photoemission data. With specific reference to the latter, similar to copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), whose coordinative <b>pocket</b> <b>mirrors</b> the CuTPP/CuTPP(F) ones, the lowest ionization energy of the title compounds implies electron ejection from a ring orbital rather than from the Cu 3 d-based singly occupied molecular orbital. Moreover, analogous to CuPc, the ionic contribution appears {{to play an important role}} in the Cu–N bonding. Nevertheless, differences in the number, symmetry, nature and relative position of CuTPP/CuTPP(F) occupied frontier orbitals compared to CuPc may be stated only by considering in great detail the Cu-ligand covalent interactions...|$|R

40|$|The unoccupied {{electronic}} structure of thick films of tetraphenylporphyrin and tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) - porphyrin Cu(II) complexes (hereafter, CuTPP and CuTPP(F)) deposited on Au(111) {{has been studied}} by combining the outcomes of near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy with those of spin-unrestricted time-dependent density functional (TD-DFT) calculations carried out either within the scalar relativistic zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) framework (C, N and F K-edges) or by using the Tamm– Dancoff approximation coupled to ZORA and including spin–orbit effects (Cu L 2, 3 -edges). Similarly to the model- ling of NEXAFS outcomes pertaining to other Cu(II) complexes, the agreement between theory and experiment is more than satisfactory, thus confirming the open-shell TD-DFT to be a useful tool to look into NEXAFS results pertinent to Cu(II) compounds. The combined effect of metalation and phenyl (Ph) fluorine decoration is found to favour an extensive mixing between Phs* and pristine porphyrin macrocyle (pmc) pmcp* virtual levels. The lowest lying excitation in the C and N K-edge spectra of both CuTPP and CuTPP(F) {{is associated with a}} ligand- to-metal-charge-transfer transition, unambiguously revealed in the CuTPPN K-edge spectral pattern. Moreover, the comparison with literature data pertaining to the modelling of the Cu(II) L 2, 3 features in the phthalocyanine– Cu(II) (CuPc) complex provided further insights into how metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer transitions associated with excitations from 2 pCu(II) AOs to low-lying, ligand-based p* MOs may contribute to the Cu(II) L 2, 3 -edge inten- sity and thus weaken its believed relationship with the Cu(II) –ligand symmetry-restricted covalency. Despite the coordinative <b>pocket</b> of CuTPP/CuTPP(F) <b>mirroring</b> CuPc, the ligand-field strength exerted by the phthalocyanine ligand on the Cu(II) centre is experimentally found and theoretically confirmed to be slightly stronger than that experienced by Cu in CuTPP and CuTPP(F). On the whole, the obtained results complement those published in the near past by the same group on the occupied and empty states of the H 2 TPP and H 2 TPP(F) free ligands {{as well as on the}} occupied states of both CuTPP and CuTPP(F), thus providing the final piece to get a thorough description of electronic perturbations associated with the metalation and the Ph halogen decoration of H 2 TPP...|$|R
