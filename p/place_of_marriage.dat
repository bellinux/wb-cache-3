50|$|Marriages {{between a}} Catholic and an unbaptized person are not sacramental and {{fall under the}} {{impediment}} of disparity of worship (Code of Canon Law, Cn.1086 § 1). They are invalid without a dispensation, for which authority lies with the ordinary of the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> (Cn. 1086 § 2). In addition, the Catholic Church recognizes the Pauline privilege, wherein a Catholic may marry an unbaptized previously married person who consents to convert, {{but only if the}} unbaptized person's spouse refuses to become a Catholic also (similar to Muslim views on marrying previously-married non-Muslims).|$|E

50|$|Some countries, such as Australia, permit marriages {{to be held}} {{in private}} and at any location; others, {{including}} England and Wales, require that the civil ceremony be conducted in a place open to the public and specially sanctioned by law for the purpose.

An exception can be made in the case of marriage by special emergency license (UK: licence), which is normally granted only when one of the parties is terminally ill. Rules about where and when persons can marry vary from place to place. Some regulations require one of the parties to reside within the jurisdiction of the register office (formerly parish).|$|E

5000|$|Addressing the {{concerns}} expressed in various amicus briefs {{about the potential}} harm same-sex marriage might cause to the institution of marriage, she wrote: Here, the plaintiffs seek only to be married, not to undermine the institution of civil marriage. They do not want marriage abolished. They do not attack the binary nature of marriage, the consanguinity provisions, {{or any of the}} other gate-keeping provisions of the marriage licensing law. Recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of the same sex will not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite-sex marriage, any more than recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of a different race devalues the marriage of a person who marries someone of her own race. If anything, extending civil marriage to same-sex couples reinforces the importance of marriage to individuals and communities. That same-sex couples are willing to embrace marriage's solemn obligations of exclusivity, mutual support, and commitment to one another is a testament to the enduring <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in our laws and in the human spirit. She then reviewed the history of constitutional law as one of [...] "'the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded'", quoting the U.S. Supreme Court once more, United States v. Virginia. She reviewed several examples related to marriage, including married women acquiring legal status apart from their husbands, the invalidation of anti-miscegenation laws, and no-fault divorce. As for creating conflict with the laws of other states, she wrote: We would not presume to dictate how another State should respond to today's decision. But neither should considerations of comity prevent us from according Massachusetts residents the full measure of protection available under the Massachusetts Constitution. The genius of our Federal system is that each State's Constitution has vitality specific to its own traditions, and that, subject to the minimum requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, each State is free to address difficult issues of individual liberty in the manner its own Constitution demands. She summarized the Court's decision: The marriage ban works a deep and scarring hardship on a very real segment of the community for no rational reason. The absence of any reasonable relationship between, on the one hand, an absolute disqualification of same-sex couples who wish to enter into civil marriage and, on the other, protection of public health, safety, or general welfare, suggests that the marriage restriction is rooted in persistent prejudices against persons who are (or who are believed to be) homosexual.... Limiting the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the basic premises of individual liberty and equality under law protected by the Massachusetts Constitution. Considering what relief to grant the plaintiffs, she noted that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had [...] "refined common-law meaning of marriage" [...] and then provided the Court's meaning: [...] "We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others." [...] The legislature retained its [...] "broad discretion to regulate marriage".|$|E
50|$|At {{its most}} anti-Roman Catholic period the English penal code stipulated {{perpetual}} imprisonment for saying Mass, declared Catholics incapable of purchasing or inheriting land {{and made the}} possession of a horse worth more than £5 a criminal offence. The Island did not follow these practices - until quite late in Elizabeth's reign the Earls of Derby were Catholic and did little to spread the reformation to the Island where it progressed relatively slowly. Though the Island displayed considerable religious toleration (however around the 1660s {{a small group of}} Maughold Quakers was persecuted) and had none of the penal laws about Catholics that so disfigured the English Statute book, they were of course required to obey the ecclesiastical laws of attendance at church, <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and burial etc. (several Catholic priests were briefly imprisoned in the 18th century for illegally celebrating marriage), another was presented in 1759 for attending a non-Catholic.|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in marking a {{transition}} to adulthood in {{the life cycle of}} young adults in south Wales and the north-east of England. By comparing two regions which faced high and protracted unemployment in the 1930 s, the article seeks to examine the impact of the depression on patterns of courtship and the decision to marry. How unemployment affected the construction of masculinity by disturbing the established pathway to marriage is considered, and the notion that young adults desired to cling to the freedom of youth is challenged. The article draws upon the rich literature generated by the ‘crisis’ period of the 1930 s and considers gendered patterns of leisure and courtship, the attempts to regulate the behaviour of young adults and representations of the moral foundations of marriage...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{some questions}} of marital {{behavior of the}} population in the Asian North of the Russian Federation with the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) as an example. This region is scarcely populated, yet it is the largest in the country by the occupied territory. The analysis of marital behavior revealed that on the background of some {{decrease in the number of}} marriages in the 1990 s and marriage market decline, the number of divorces was growing. The attitude of the population towards the main circumstances of organizing one’s private life in a marriage is shown on the materials of a sociological and demographic survey. The authors reveal the differences in the views of representatives of different generations on marriage, its forms, marriage union basic principles, causes of conflicts in a marriage and divorces. Regardless of the marital status or presence of children, there is general agreement between the respondents that a conflict situation in a marriage is caused by a complex of reasons, the impact of which, in many cases, takes the form of a chain reaction. One central problem gives birth to a chain of discord that eventually shows the vulnerability of existing relations. The authors conclude that emergence and impact of conflictogenic factors on marital stability are the result of change of the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in the hierarchy of an individual’s life values in terms of modernization of demographic behavior as...|$|E

40|$|The {{narrative}} of black marriage as citizenship enhancing has been pervasive in American history. As we mark the fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} Moynihan Report and prepare to celebrate the 150 th anniversary of Thirteenth Amendment, this Article argues that this narrative is one that we should resist. The complete story of marriage is one that involves racial subordination and caste. Even as the Supreme Court stands to extend marriage rights to LGBT couples, the Article maintains that we should embrace nonmarriage as a legitimate frame for black loving relationships — gay or straight. Nonmarriage might do just as much, if not more, to advance black civil rights. Part I explores marriage’s role in racial subordination {{by looking at the}} experiences of African Americans, as well as Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Asian Americans. Drawing on institutional structure analyses, it then considers how legal marriage has “married” Blacks to second-class citizenship. Part II explores the current <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in African America. It argues that, while the regulation of black loving relationships today differs dramatically from what we saw in earlier times, family law often has a punitive effect on such American families. Part III contemplates the benefits of adopting a focus on nonmarriage. It contends that meeting black families where they are holds the most potential for progress in addressing the structural barriers to success faced by those families. The Article ends with a “call to action” for legal scholars and others concerned about black families and citizenship. It maps a broad agenda for exploring in earnest the potential that supporting and valuing the existing networks, arrangements, and norms regarding gender and caretaking in African America has for promoting black citizenship and equality in the twenty-first century...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependency}} discourse {{has become}} a prominent concern in discussions of welfare policies in the United States. To address the cultural fear of dependence on welfare, the 1996 welfare reform greatly emphasized work and marriage promotion. Poor single mothers on welfare were mandated {{to move into the}} workforce under a cultural belief held by the Administration that work leads to independence. Feminists suggest that independence upheld by welfare reform is discussed from a middle-class, patriarchal perspective with an emphasis on financial self-sufficiency, which largely overlooks issues of gender and social class intertwined with poverty. Additionally, marriage promotion is deemed by feminists to discourage poor single mothers on welfare from pursuing independence. Moreover, voices of single mothers have been marginalized from discussions of in/dependence in the context of welfare. This qualitative study, informed by feminist standpoint theory, aimed to give voice to single mothers on welfare with a focus on redefining independence generating from their experiences and struggles with motherhood, marriage/relationship, and welfare policy through multiple in-depth interviews. The research participants indicated that commitment to and responsibility for the children 2 ̆ 7 s best interests enabled them to stay strong in tough circumstances, and make choices within an environment where resources were limited. Welfare was seen by the participants as one resource to help them on the path toward independence. They articulated two dimensions of independence [...] -financial and psychological [...] -and viewed financial independence as a path to achieve psychological independence. Marriage was not considered by the mothers until they achieved both financial and psychological independence. Marriage promotion was strongly criticized by the participants because it left poor single mothers in a dependency state from welfare to men. Access to education was suggested to taken the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> promotion by the research participants. Findings challenge the dominant discourse of dependency and have implications for professionals who work with mothers who receive welfare...|$|E
