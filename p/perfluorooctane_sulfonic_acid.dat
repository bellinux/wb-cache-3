40|$|Abstract: <b>Perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid</b> (PFOS) is a {{persistent}} and ubiquitous environmental contaminant {{that has been}} detected in organisms worldwide. Here, we evaluate whether long-term (1 and 4 months) exposure to PFOS contamination affects the behavioural performance of freshwater larvae of the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum (Insecta: Odonata). Our results show reduced behavioural performance with increasing PFOS concentration. In 1 month exposed larvae, no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) were 100 ìg/L for general activity. In 4 months exposed larvae, NOECs were 10 ìg/L, for each behavioural trait, except swimming acceleration of male larvae where the NOEC was 100 ìg/L. When faced with PFOS concentrations above the NOEC, E. cyathigerum larvae were less active, less capable to escape a simulated predator attack and less efficient in foraging. Together, our results show that damselfly larvae suffer reduced survival-related behavioural performance.

In recent years they have been detected in various environmental matrix and become the widespread organic pollutants. Based on their ubiquitous distribution, persistence and bioaccumulation, the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances have attracted remarkable attention from related scientists and organizations. The fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention (SC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) held at the Geneva in May, 2009, has decided to place <b>perfluorooctane</b> <b>sulfonic</b> <b>acid,</b> its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride into Annex B of the convention.
