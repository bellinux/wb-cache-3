40|$|Summary. Nowadays, a {{transportation}} industry creates {{a lot of}} metal scrap because production and use of cars are on the increase worldwide. This {{is based on the}} fact that increase in the production of cars increases usage of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> in transportationapplications. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the production of components from primary <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and increase their replacement with secondary—recycled—aluminium alloys because the production of recycled <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is less expensiveand less energy-intensive than the creation of new <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> through the electrolysis. In addition, the recycled <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> have comparable microstructural parameters and properties as the same primary <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys...</b>|$|R

The effects of varying (a) the yield strength, tensile {{strength and ductility}} of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> layer, (b) the surface treatment used for the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> layers and (c) the number of layers present in the FML have been studied.

Further, increasing the number of alternating layers of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and fibre composite also somewhat increases the quasi-static flexural properties of the FML. In contrast, increasing the strength of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> had relatively little effect on the impact perforation resistance of the FML, but increasing the number of alternating layers of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and fibre composite did significantly increase the impact perforation resistance of the FML.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is {{investigate}} the friction stir welding capability of the EN AW 2024 - 0 and EN AW 5754 -H 22 Al alloys are studied, because two <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> are widely used in the industry and friction stir welding is getting widened to be used to join the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Friction stir welding (FSW) is a new solid fhase technique invented and patented for <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> EN AW 2024 - 0 and EN AW 5754 -H 22 are <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> can be welded by fusion welding, but many welding problems arises from fusion welding. While the friction stir welding is a solid state welding process, some problems may be prevented. Findings: It is found in the course that these two <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> can be friction stir welded if fhe welding parameters are carefully selected. Hardness value in weld area for EN AW 2024 - 0, there is an increase about 10 - 40 Hv. Because of this is recrystalization and getting smaller grains. For EN AW 5754 -H 22 there is a decrease of hardness value because of recrystalization. Welding performance of EN AW 2024 - 0 is reached to 96. 6 %. This value is 57 % for EN AW 5754 -H 22. It is possible to perform dissimilar welding using different <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> elding performance of dissimilar <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> EN AW 2024 - 0 and EN AW 5754 -H 22 is reached a value of 66. 39 %.

50|$|An {{important}} structural {{limitation of}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> is their lower fatigue strength compared to steel. In controlled laboratory conditions, steels display a fatigue limit, {{which is the}} stress amplitude below which no failures occur - the metal does not continue to weaken with extended stress cycles. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> do not have this lower fatigue limit {{and will continue to}} weaken with continued stress cycles. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> are therefore sparsely used in parts that require high fatigue strength in the high cycle regime (more than 107 stress cycles).|$|R

Two types of materials are analysed, <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and stainless steels but focus will be on the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> Thermodynamic analysis has been used to evaluate the effect of the microstructure.

Separate models are developed for wrought <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> and stainless steels. For the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> this includes the solid solution hardening and the precipitation hardening.
