5|$|The {{transition}} to a more radical form of poetry {{seems to have taken}} place in 1913-1915, during the <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together.

40|$|Men's {{additional}} income from their guest-worker employment generates a pure income effect, which increases fertility. The timing of women's higher-wage employment relative to child bearing {{is crucial for}} its effect on fertility. If women work abroad {{during the same time}} <b>period</b> <b>when</b> they can bear children, their {{additional income}} generates a substitution effect, which reduces fertility. In contrast, if the time <b>period</b> <b>when</b> women work abroad does not coincide with the <b>period</b> <b>when</b> they bear children, their additional income generates the income effect on fertility, which is not different from that of men's additional income...|$|R

Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> {{he was reluctant to}} mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.|$|E

50|$|The {{centrifuge}} was activated as soon {{as possible}} once the satellite was in orbit and stabilized at 10−3g (10 mm/s²). The centrifuge applied gravity stimuli in cycles. Each cycle lasted about 8 minutes, and consisted of the following: a 1-minute period without acceleration, an 8-second <b>period</b> <b>when</b> rotation slowly began, 14 seconds of constant 0.6 g (6 m/s²), an 8-second <b>period</b> <b>when</b> rotation slowly stopped, and a 6-minute <b>period</b> <b>when</b> aftereffects of rotation could be measured. Cycles were performed every 30 minutes during the initial 3 hours in orbit, and less frequently {{during the rest of the}} flight.|$|R
5|$|However, nuclear DNA {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Bornean orangutans, much later, about 670,000 years ago. Orangutans travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> sea levels were much lower.

Though a left-footed player, he did not perform well when played as a left winger, and publicly expressed his distaste for playing in the position.|$|E
5|$|One {{field study}} found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> nectar {{concentrations}} in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, {{this could have been}} because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw (A. manglesii) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Selection has {{different}} effects on traits. Stabilizing selection acts {{to hold a}} trait at a stable optimum, and in the simplest case all deviations from this optimum are selectively disadvantageous. Directional selection favours extreme values of a trait. The uncommon disruptive selection also acts during transition <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> the current mode is sub-optimal, but alters the trait {{in more than one}} direction. In particular, if the trait is quantitative and univariate then both higher and lower trait levels are favoured. Disruptive selection can be a precursor to speciation.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{occupied}} {{the post of}} Lord Warden until 1765, save for two <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> it was filled by James Butler, the Duke of Ormonde and John Sidney, the Earl of Leicester. He carried out extensive work to make the castle more habitable, building extensions towards the north bastion and constructing a small house in the south bastion for the soldiers. Under the subsequent Lord Wardens, the politicians Robert Darcy, the Earl of Holderness, and Francis North, the Earl of Guildford, the castle continued to house artillery but it became increasingly less military in character.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected {{with a low}} cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 36. ACE is, broadly speaking, {{a measure of the}} power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength. Although officially, subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total, the figure above includes <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> storms were in a subtropical phase.|$|E

While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is both large and well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E

It is named (in both English and Chinese) after the Chinese mantou bun or roll, whose shape it (very approximately) resembles; the ground plan resembles a horseshoe. The kilns are roughly round, with a low dome covering the central firing area, and are generally only 2 to 3 metres across inside. However it is capable of reaching very high temperatures, up to about 1370°C. There is a door or bricked-up opening at the front for loading and unloading, and one or two short chimneys at the rear.|$|E
