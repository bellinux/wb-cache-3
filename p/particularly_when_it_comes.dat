Though vital drugs are not affected directly by the sanctions, the amount of hard currency available to the minister of health is severely limited. Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi, Iran's first female government minister since the Iranian Revolution, was dismissed in December 2012 for speaking out against the lack of support from the government in times of economic hardship. Furthermore, Iranian patients are at risk of amplified side effects and reduced effectiveness because Iran is forced to import medicines, and chemical building blocks for other medicines, from India and China, as opposed to obtaining higher-quality products from Western manufacturers. Because of patent protections, substitutions for advanced medicines are often unattainable, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis.|$|E
500|$|Born in Weatherfield, Mavis {{was brought}} up in Grange-over-Sands where her parents, despite being teetotal, ran an off-licence. Mavis first appears in Coronation Street in 1971 at Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) and Ernest Bishop's (Stephen Hancock) {{engagement}} party, as a friend/colleague of Emily's from the mail order warehouse and is invited to be a bridesmaid at the wedding. She is initially employed as a receptionist at the local vet and then as an assistant in the corner shop, but takes a job offered by Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) at The Kabin newsagents, 14Rosamund Street. [...] Mavis and Rita are complete opposites– Rita sexy and self-assured, Mavis mouse-like and dowdy– but they get on well and become friends. Rita often despairs at Mavis's choices in life, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to men. Rita's dominance over Mavis seems like bullying to outsiders, but she is only thinking of Mavis's best interests.|$|E

He also did not believe Amy and Rory would be gone for long, especially as the Doctor had placed them in more perilous situations before. IGN's Matt Risely rated the episode 7 out of 10, calling it [...] "a notably wonky episode, both in terms of tone and plot development" [...] that came off as [...] "a confused, slightly ill-fitting hodgepodge of a tale". [...] While he praised Hurran's directing and the performances of Walliams and Karan, he felt the characters were sidelined near the end. Risely noted that [...] "things certainly chugged along with a witty, sparkling vibrancy at least early on", but the tone [...] "lost its way halfway through" [...] culminating in a [...] "hollow and rushed" [...] final scene where he left Amy and Rory.|$|E

500|$|In {{the lumber}} {{industry}} Acer rubrum {{is considered a}} [...] "soft maple", a designation it shares, commercially, with silver maple (A. saccharinum). In this context, the term [...] "soft" [...] is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., [...] "soft maple", while softer than it's harder cousin, sugar maple (A. saccharum), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) in this regard. [...] Like A. saccharum, the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish. [...] However, the wood from Acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of A. saccharum, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains {{a greater percentage of}} [...] "curly" [...] (aka [...] "flame"/"fiddleback") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry. [...] As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.|$|E

By connecting with his associates, Ryan states, it's [...] "valuable {{when it comes to}} figuring out how to motivate somebody (...) because I want that guy to fight for me, just like I want to fight for him." [...] Fullback Tony Richardson, in an interview, stated Ryan [...] "loves his football team, loves his players" [...] and does as much as he possibly can to ensure their success. Despite his boisterous and brash comments that have caused increased media coverage of the team, Ryan has taken the attention and has managed to [...] " [...] it on himself" [...] so the players can focus on their tasks. Ryan has also stressed that the teaching process is an important one, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to providing a player information and building chemistry. However, there has to be flexibility as the process must also be insightful and positive. Ryan states that coaches are responsible for providing players with information that is vitally important otherwise [...] "if you emphasize everything, you've emphasized nothing." ...|$|E

Testing conducted on human remains, especially ancient ones, can include DNA testing, isotope analyses, and carbon 14 dating.

2500|$|Mattey elaborates further [...] on the positive, redeeming {{aspect of}} the {{seemingly}} bleak, frustrating themes of existentialism that are so apparent in Nausea: [...] "Sartre considered the subjectivity of the starting-point for what a human is as a key thesis of existentialism. The starting-point is subjective because humans make themselves what they are. Most philosophers consider subjectivity {{to be a bad}} thing, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> to the motivation for action... Sartre responds by claiming that subjectivity is a dignity of human being, not something that degrades us." [...] Therefore, the characteristic anguish and forlornness of existentialism are temporary: only a prerequisite to recognizing individual responsibility and freedom. The basis of ethics is not rule-following. A specific action may be either wrong or right and no specific rule is necessarily valid. What makes the action, either way, ethical is [...] "authenticity," [...] the willingness of the individual to accept responsibility rather than dependence on rules, and to commit to his action. Despair, the existentialist says, is the product of uncertainty: being oriented exclusively to the outcome of a decision rather than to the process yields uncertainty, as we cannot decide the future, only our action.|$|E

The VSG and VZS, based on local self-government institutions of city duma and zemstvo, were well suited for this task, but the central government did not trust them and delegated the task to the Tatiana Committee. By spring 1916, it counted more than 3.3 million refugees.|$|R
60|$|In the {{different}} states of Europe {{there must be}} some variations in the proportion between the number of inhabitants and the quantity of food consumed, arising from {{the different}} habits of living that prevail in each state. The labourers of the South of England are so accustomed to eat fine wheaten bread that they will suffer themselves to be half starved before they will submit to live like the Scotch peasants. They might perhaps in time, by the constant operation of the hard law of necessity, be reduced to live even like the Lower Chinese, and the country would then, with the same quantity of food, support a greater population. But to effect this must always be a most difficult, and, every friend to humanity will hope, an abortive attempt. Nothing is so common as to hear of encouragements that ought to be given to population. If the tendency of mankind to increase be so great as I have represented it to be, it may appear strange that this increase does not come when it is thus repeatedly called for. The true reason is that the demand for a greater population is made without preparing the funds necessary to support it. Increase the demand for agricultural labour by promoting cultivation, and with it consequently increase the produce of the country, and ameliorate the condition of the labourer, and no apprehensions whatever need be entertained of the proportional increase of population. An attempt to effect this purpose in any other way is vicious, cruel, and tyrannical, and in any state of tolerable freedom cannot therefore succeed. It may appear to be the interest of the rulers, and the rich of a state, to force population, and thereby lower the price of labour, and consequently the expense of fleets and armies, and the cost of manufactures for foreign sale; but every attempt of the kind should be carefully watched and strenuously resisted by the friends of the poor, <b>particularly</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> under the deceitful garb of benevolence, and is likely, on that account, to be cheerfully and cordially received by the common people.|$|E
