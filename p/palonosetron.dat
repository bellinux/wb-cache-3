5000|$|... 5-HT3 antagonists: 5-HT3 antagonists {{produce their}} anti emetic effect by {{blocking}} of the amplifying effect of serotonin on peripheral and central 5-HT3 receptors {{located on the}} various vagal afferent nerve endings and the chemoreceptor trigger zone. They are effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of CINV {{as well as in}} malignant bowel obstruction and renal failure which are associated with elevated serotonin levels. These substances include Dolasetron, Granisetron, Ondansetron, <b>Palonosetron,</b> and Tropisetron. They are often used in combination with other anti emetic drugs in people with high risk of emesis or nausea and are recommended as the most effective anti emetics in the prophylaxis of acute CINV.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonists {{are very}} effective antiemetics and constitute a great {{advance in the}} management of CINV. These drugs block {{one or more of the}} nerve signals that cause nausea and vomiting. During the first 24 hours after chemotherapy, the most effective approach appears to be blocking the 5-HT3 nerve signal. Approved 5-HT3 inhibitors include dolasetron (Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril, Sancuso), and ondansetron (Zofran). Their antiemetic effect due to blockade of 5HT3 receptor on vagal afferent in the gut. in addition they also block 5-HT3 receptors in CTZ and STN. The newest 5-HT3 inhibitor, <b>palonosetron</b> (Aloxi), also prevents delayed nausea and vomiting, which can occur during the 2-5 days after treatment. Since some patients have trouble swallowing pills, these drugs are often available by injection, as orally disintegrating tablets, or as transdermal patches.|$|E
5000|$|A newer {{class of}} drugs {{known as the}} NK1 antagonists are a {{recently}} developed class of very efficacious drugs for controlling CINV. These drugs are often used alongside 5HT3 inhibitors and corticosteroids to form a very potent cocktail of antiemetics that verge on achieving a nearly complete patient response (that is, completely stopping CINV). [...] The substance P inhibitor aprepitant (Emend), which became available in 2005, is highly effective in controlling nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Aprepitant {{has been shown to}} inhibit both the acute and delayed emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking substance P landing on receptors in the brains neurons. This has been proven by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, which have demonstrated that aprepitant can penetrate the brain and NK1 receptors in the brain. It has also been shown to increase the activity of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone, which are also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Netupitant has recently been approved by USFDA. It has also been marketed in combination with <b>palonosetron.</b> Rolapitant is the newest addition in the approved NK1 antagonist list. It has advantage of a very long half life, duration of action is around 150 hours. Rolapitant got its approval by USFDA in 2015.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of <b>palonosetron</b> in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), {{as well as}} chemo-therapy-induced nausea and vomiting, has already been demonstrated in multiple clinical studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether continuous infusion of <b>palonosetron</b> following single injection could reduce PONV to a greater extent than single injection only of <b>palonosetron.</b> Methods: In total, 132 women were enrolled in the study. All subjects were over the age of 20 years and were scheduled to undergo gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. In both groups, patients received 0. 075 mg of <b>palonosetron</b> intravenously, immediately before induction of anesthesia. In the continuous palo-nosetron infusion group, 0. 075 mg (1. 5 ml) of <b>palonosetron</b> was added to the patient-controlled analgesia device. In the single-injection <b>palonosetron</b> group, 1. 5 ml of normal saline was added. Results: The incidence of PONV 24 hours postoperatively was significantly lower in the continuous <b>palonosetron</b> infu-sion group than the single-injection <b>palonosetron</b> group (31. 8 vs. 56. 1 %, P = 0. 009). Conclusions: Continuous <b>palonosetron</b> infusion, following single injection, reduces the incidence of PONV compared with single injection only.

40|$|<b>Palonosetron</b> is {{the only}} 5 -HT 3 {{receptor}} antagonist approved {{for the treatment of}} delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that substance P (SP), the endogenous ligand acting preferentially on neurokinin- 1 (NK- 1) receptors, not serotonin (5 -HT), is the dominant mediator of delayed emesis. However, <b>palonosetron</b> does not bind to the NK- 1 receptor. Recent data have revealed cross-talk between the NK- 1 and 5 HT 3 receptor signaling pathways; we postulated that if <b>palonosetron</b> differentially inhibited NK- 1 / 5 -HT 3 cross-talk, it could help explain its efficacy profile in delayed emesis. Consequently, we evaluated the effect of <b>palonosetron,</b> granisetron, and ondansetron on SP-induced responses in vitro and in vivo. NG 108 - 15 cells were preincubated with <b>palonosetron,</b> granisetron, or ondansetron; antagonists were removed and the effect on serotonin enhancement of SP-induced calcium release was measured. In the absence of antagonist, serotonin enhanced SP-induced calcium-ion release. After preincubation with <b>palonosetron,</b> but not ondansetron or granisetron, the serotonin enhancement of the SP response was inhibited. Rats were treated with cisplatin and either <b>palonosetron,</b> granisetron, or ondansetron. At various times after dosing, single neuronal recordings from nodose ganglia were collected after stimulation with SP; nodose ganglia neuronal responses to SP were enhanced when the animals were pretreated with cisplatin. <b>Palonosetron,</b> but not ondansetron or granisetron, dose-dependently inhibited the cisplatin-induced SP enhancement. The results are consistent with previous data showing that <b>palonosetron</b> exhibits distinct pharmacology versus the older 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists and provide a rationale for the efficacy observed with <b>palonosetron</b> in delayed CINV in the clinic...|$|E
