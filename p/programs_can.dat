5|$|Policy: Social {{marketing}} <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> {{do well in}} motivating individual behavior change, {{but that}} is difficult to sustain unless the environment they're in supports that change for the long run.

5|$|Although most {{computer}} {{languages are}} not designed with commands or libraries for matrices, {{as early as}} the 1970s, some engineering desktop computers such as the HP 9830 had ROM cartridges to add BASIC commands for matrices. Some computer languages such as APL were designed to manipulate matrices, and various mathematical <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> be used to aid computing with matrices.|$|E
5|$|In recent times, {{the focus}} has been on {{creating}} an awareness of the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> help the public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Nokia {{released}} a Python interpreter for the Series 60 mobile phones named PyS60. It includes {{many of the}} modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the Symbian operating system. This project has been {{kept up to date}} to run on all variants of the S60 platform and there are several third party modules available. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, with the feature that <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> be both written and run on the target device.|$|E
5|$|The inverse {{square root}} of a {{floating}} point number {{is used in}} calculating a normalized vector. <b>Programs</b> <b>can</b> use normalized vectors to determine angles of incidence and reflection. 3D graphics programs must perform millions of these calculations every second to simulate lighting. When the code {{was developed in the}} early 1990s, most floating-point processing power lagged behind the speed of integer processing. This was troublesome for 3D graphics programs before the advent of specialized hardware to handle transform and lighting.|$|E

5|$|Running a {{full scan}} {{complies}} {{a list of}} Internet-enabled applications. Users set permissions or accept Norton's default settings. The firewall detects and blocks port scans and logs intrusion attempts. This version does not run a trace on attackers, however Symantec is planning an online tool to do so. To ensure rogue <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> not masquerade as trustworthy applications, Norton verifies programs against a list of digital signatures for known programs, update Tracker warns users if hackers attempt {{to gain access to}} users' computers. The firewall blocked all access attempts from Shields Up and Port Checker. This version includes a wizard to simplify firewall setup to accommodate for multiple computers sharing an Internet connection. With this release, Norton can prevent specified personal information from being transmitted via a compatible instant messenger client, e-mail, and websites. Ad-blocking includes the Ad Trashcan, where users can place ads that slipped past ad-filtering.|$|E
25|$|The {{functionality}} {{of a few}} computer <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> be {{hampered by}} active anti-virus software. For example, TrueCrypt, a disk encryption program, states on its troubleshooting page that anti-virus <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> conflict with TrueCrypt and cause it to malfunction or operate very slowly.
