5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> more than {{unproven}} slanders, but the whole experience was very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a single farm.|$|E
25|$|Logistics. The {{fast moving}} host, like all {{military}} formations, needed supplies. These {{were provided by}} young boys, who were attached to a force and carried rations, cooking pots, sleeping mats, extra weapons, rations, and other material. Cattle were sometimes driven on the hoof as a movable larder. Again, such arrangements in the local context were <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> unusual. What was different was the systematisation and organisation, a pattern yielding major benefits when the Zulu were dispatched on military missions. Shaka's general ratio of logistic personnel was one herdboy to three men.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Singer {{stated that}} Superman Returns {{was made for}} [...] "Perhaps more of a female audience. It wasn't what it needed to be, I guess." [...] Singer stated {{that he would have}} cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with [...] "the jet {{disaster}} sequence or something. I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don't know what would have helped. <b>Probably</b> <b>nothing.</b> If I could go again, I would do an origin. I would reboot it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the period}} after Hulagu, the Ilkhans {{increasingly}} adopted Tibetan Buddhism. [...] Christian powers were encouraged by {{what appeared to}} be an inclination towards Nestorian Christianity by Ilkhanate rulers, but this was <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> more than the Mongols' traditional even-handedness towards competing religions. The Ilkhans were thus markedly {{out of step with the}} Muslims they ruled. Ghazan, shortly before he overthrew Baydu, converted to Islam under influence of Nawrūz, and his official favoring of Islam as a state religion coincided with a marked attempt to bring the regime closer to the non-Mongol majority of the regions they ruled. Christian and Jewish subjects lost their equal status with Muslims and again had to pay the protection tax, jizya. Ghazan gave Buddhists the starker choice of conversion or expulsion and orderer their temples to be destroyed; though he later relaxed this severity slightly.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Bloom {{published}} The Western Canon, {{a survey}} of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focusing on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations and of the Western canon. Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, the major concern of the volume is reclaiming literature from those he refers to as the [...] "School of Resentment", the mostly academic critics who espouse a social purpose in reading. Bloom believes that the goals of reading must be solitary aesthetic pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal held by [...] "forces of resentment" [...] of improving one's society, which he casts as an absurd aim, writing: [...] "The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading Shakespeare is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools." [...] His position is that politics have no place in literary criticism: a feminist or Marxist reading of Hamlet would tell us something about feminism and Marxism, he says, but <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> about Hamlet itself.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Joe Klein of Time magazine in October 2008, Barack Obama expressed his intention {{to try to work}} with India and Pakistan to resolve the crisis. He said he had talked to Bill Clinton about it, as Clinton has experience as a mediator. In an editorial in The Washington Times, Selig S Harrison, director of the Asia Programme at the Center for International Policy and a senior scholar of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars called it Obama's first foreign policy mistake. In an editorial, The Australian called Obama's idea to appoint a presidential negotiator [...] "a very stupid and dangerous move indeed". In an editorial in Forbes, Reihan Salam, associate editor for The Atlantic, noted [...] "The smartest thing President Obama could do on Kashmir is <b>probably</b> <b>nothing.</b> We have to hope that India and Pakistan can work out their differences on Kashmir on their own". The Boston Globe called the idea of appointing Bill Clinton as an envoy to Kashmir [...] "a mistake". President Obama subsequently appointed Richard Holbrooke as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan. President Asif Ali Zardari hoped that Holbrooke would help mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue. Kashmir was later removed from Holbrooke's mandate. [...] "Eliminating ... Kashmir from his job description ... is seen as a significant diplomatic concession to India that reflects increasingly warm ties between the country and the United States," [...] The Washington Post noted in a report. Brajesh Mishra, India's former national security adviser, was quoted in the same report as saying that [...] "No matter what government is in place, India is not going to relinquish control of Jammu and Kashmir". [...] "That is written in stone and cannot be changed." [...] According to The Financial Times, India has warned Obama that he risks [...] "barking up the wrong tree" [...] if he seeks to broker a settlement between Pakistan and India over Kashmir.|$|E

6000|$|He {{walked along}} slowly, picturing {{as he went}} the home-corning of the long-absent son.

He wondered---- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I believe it's magic," [...] said Tip, positively, [...] "and {{that someone}} is playing a trick upon us. I've known old Mombi {{do things like that}} before. <b>Probably</b> it's <b>nothing</b> more than an illusion, and there are no {{sunflowers}} here at all." ...|$|R

6000|$|As {{the bulk}} of the {{response}} was without apparent relevancy, it was <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend that was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it was [...] "his word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You admit, then, {{that it will}} be amusing: all I contend for,” {{her husband}} replied. “But, as you say, we’re talking as if it were settled, whereas there’s <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> in it after all.

50|$|Mitsumoto: The last {{member of}} the group, Izuna doesn't treat him with any respect, mostly because he doesn't stand up for himself and doesn't {{seem to have any}} real ninja abilities. His skirt-chasing tendencies <b>probably</b> do <b>nothing</b> to raise his esteem in Izuna's eyes.|$|R
50|$|Besides, the law {{itself had}} been passed unconstitutionally, for an {{existing}} law confirmed these privileges, and by the constitution of Solon no law could be enacted until any existing law which it contravened had been repealed.

6000|$|At {{the door}} Mary turned round. [...] "Good-night," [...] she said, and {{wondered}} {{as she said}} the words why Anne was smiling in that curious way. It was <b>probably</b> <b>nothing,</b> she reflected. Anne often smiled for no apparent reason; it was probably just a habit. [...] "I hope I shan't dream of falling down wells again to-night," [...] she added.|$|E
6000|$|They escaped this melancholy fate, however, {{for some}} Chaldean shepherds, seeing a nebulous cloud {{drifting}} athwart the heavens, and obscuring a favourite planet {{they had just}} invented, brought out their most powerful telescopes and resolved it into independent cows--whom they proceeded to slaughter in detail with the instruments of smaller calibre. There have been occasional [...] "meat showers" [...] ever since. These are <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> more than-- ...|$|E

'We all confide, Redgauntlet, in your valour and skill--we admire your perseverance; and <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> short of your strenuous exertions, and the emulation awakened by your noble and disinterested conduct, could have brought {{so many of}} us, the scattered remnant of a disheartened party, to meet together once again in solemn consultation; for I take it, gentlemen,' he said, looking round, 'this is only a consultation.' ...|$|E

5|$|In 1968, {{residents}} of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to restore Old Pine Church: the church's original windows were repaired and the unpainted weatherboards painted; a new roof was installed and the original wood floor replaced.

60|$|<b>Probably</b> <b>nothing</b> else in {{the world}} could so soon have {{transformed}} Scarlett Trent from the Gold Coast buccaneer to the law-abiding tenant of a Surrey villa.

6000|$|No, as I have suggested, {{novelties}} {{are rare}} in the great capitals of modern times. Even the wool exchange in Melbourne could not be told from the familiar stock exchange of other countries. Wool brokers are just like stockbrokers; they all bounce from their seats and put up their hands and yell in unison--no stranger can tell what--and the president calmly says [...] "Sold to Smith & Co., threpence farthing--next!"--when <b>probably</b> <b>nothing</b> of the kind happened; for how should he know? ...|$|E
2500|$|Modifier {{keys are}} special keys that modify the normal action of another key, {{when the two}} are pressed in combination.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of two {{passages}} in the Historica Turchesca, where Angiolello seems to be quoting his own words, this work has often been ascribed to him.
