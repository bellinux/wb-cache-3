2500|$|The first {{navigation}} aid on Cleveland Point was {{a beacon}} established in 1847, by Francis Edward Bigge, Member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, at his expense, {{as part of}} his lobbying of Cleveland as the port for Moreton Bay. In the middle of the 19th century, small coastal steamboats became a main means of transport for farmers in Moreton Bay, specifically in Cleveland, Victoria Point, Redland Bay and along the Logan River and Albert River. Several lights were established around that period to assist navigation in Moreton Bay, notorious for its rocks and moving mudflats and sandbanks. In some places where no official light was established, locals would install their own lights, {{as was the case in}} Cleveland Point. In the 1860s the Government of Queensland decided to replace these lights with a <b>permanent</b> <b>light.</b> The first temporary government light was displayed in April 1864. The <b>permanent</b> <b>light</b> was constructed in late 1864 to early 1865. The original light source was a fixed kerosene operated light, visible for [...] In 1874 a refurbished Chance Brothers Fresnel lens from Comboyuro Point Light on Moreton Island replaced the original lens. The apparatus was upgraded to a more powerful Chance Brothers lens in 1879. Two red sectors, indicating close-by shoals were installed in 1920. In 1934 the lighthouse was converted to electricity and the City Electric Light Company Limited became the responsible operator. The light source was a round concentrated filament lamp.|$|E

They display an evolving collage of colored patterns and shapes while Eno's generative ambient music system plays discreetly in the background. The other aptly named [...] "Quiet Room for Montefiore" [...] (available for patients, visitors and staff) is a space set apart for meditative reflection. It is a moderately sized room with three large panels displaying dissolves of subtle colors in patterns that are reminiscent of Mondrian paintings. The environment brings Eno's ambient music more into focus as to allow its occupant(s) to cognitively drift, contemplate, or relax.|$|E

2500|$|Tenders for the {{construction}} of the lighthouse were called in February 1877, and the tender accepted on September of that year was by Archibald McIntyre. Construction commenced on December 1877 and complete in May 1878. However, the lighthouse was not officially lit, as the permanent apparatus was not available and a temporary one was used. The light was officially lit only on 27 December 1879 with the installation of the permanent apparatus. As typical for lighthouses of that period in Queensland, the tower is conical in shape, built of an internal timber frame, clad with galvanized iron plates. The foundation was [...] deep and [...] wide, made of stone and concrete. The lighthouse diameter is [...] at the bottom and [...] at the top. The height of the tower is [...] from the ground to the balcony, making it the shortest of the composite lighthouses ever built in Queensland.

An additional red sector was later installed to show further dangerous locations. The lighthouse is currently painted white with a red dome.|$|E

Funding for <b>permanent</b> <b>lights</b> was approved in 1913, and by 1914 <b>permanent</b> <b>lights</b> on the west breakwater were complete. The east breakwater itself was not completed until 1915, at which time work began on the east breakwater light and a station keeper's house {{at the foot of the}} breakwater. Construction was completed in August, and the new light was lit on August 17, 1916.|$|R

The lights were paid for by NBC, which has held the exclusive television rights to all home games since 1991. The <b>permanent</b> <b>lights</b> were added primarily to ensure sufficient lighting for mid-afternoon games in November; the university's agreements with NBC from 1991 to 2010 stipulated that there be no home night games. However, the stadium hosted its first night game in 21 years on October 22, 2011 when the Irish hosted USC.
