50|$|Between 1882 and 1905, about 10,000 Chinese appealed against {{negative}} immigration {{decisions to}} federal court, usually via a petition for habeas corpus. In {{most of these}} cases, the courts {{ruled in favor of}} the petitioner. Except in cases of bias or negligence, these petitions were barred by an act that passed Congress in 1894 and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in U.S. vs Lem Moon Sing (1895). In U.S. vs Ju Toy (1905), the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that the <b>port</b> <b>inspectors</b> and the Secretary of Commerce had final authority on who could be admitted. Ju Toy's petition was thus barred {{despite the fact that the}} district court found that he was an American citizen. The Supreme Court determined that refusing entry at a port does not require due process and is legally equivalent to refusing entry at a land crossing. All these developments, along with the extension of the act in 1902, triggered a boycott of U.S. goods in China between 1904 and 1906. There was one 1885 case in San Francisco, however, in which Treasury Department officials in Washington overturned a decision to deny entry to two Chinese students.|$|R

40|$|Increasing inter-continental {{trade of}} wood chips for biofuel {{represents}} a significant risk of introducing invasive pest species {{that can cause}} biome-scale impacts on forest ecosystems. Some potentially invasive species {{have the capacity to}} cause high tree mortality on the Eurasian continent and could cause significant impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Because eradication of established species is difficult, {{there is a need for}} scientific studies that can evaluate the reliability of current import control practices to ensure lowest possible risk of establishment of potentially harmful species. We used a stochastic simulation model and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the chance of detecting harmful pests in imported wood chips by sampling according to the current use of internationally accepted standards. As an example, we focused on the North American beetle Agrilus anxius (bronze birch borer) that can cause 100 % mortality of European and Asian birch species in North America. We simulated the process from logging in North America to sampling the wood chips upon arrival in Europe. The probability of pest detection for current sampling protocols used by <b>port</b> <b>inspectors</b> was very low (B 0. 00005), while a 90 % chance of detection may require sampling 27 million litres of wood chips per shipload...|$|R
