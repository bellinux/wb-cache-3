50|$|The Threlkeld House is a {{historic}} house at 1301 North Boston Avenue in Russellville, Arkansas. It is a -story wood frame structure, with a gable roof and weatherboard siding. At one corner, a recessed porch is supported by square posts, the corner one mounted on a <b>pier</b> <b>of</b> rusticated concrete <b>blocks.</b> The house was built in 1914, and is unusual as an early vernacular ("Plain Traditional") house in a neighborhood of later houses featuring other styles. The house was owned until 1995 {{by members of the}} Threlkeld family.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{built in}} wood, by the {{architect}} planner Jean-Antoine Morand Jouffrey in 1774, {{it is the}} second oldest bridge over the Rhone. It is 208 m long and 12 m wide It has several names: Pont Saint-Clair, bridge or Red Wood originally Affranchi bridge in 1793, deck wins in 1794, then Morand bridge (as in 1810). In 1825, the bridge collapses and is replaced by a flying bridge during reconstruction of the bridge. In 1854, it is resistant to flood the bridge carries St. Clair strikes the bridge <b>piers</b> <b>of</b> Morand and <b>block</b> the flow <b>of</b> water.|$|R
50|$|The shoals in {{this area}} were already marked by a stone daybeacon when the {{lighthouse}} board recommended construction of a light in 1871. This followed some years of unsuccessful attempts to replace the lightship at Hog Island Shoal with a fixed light (the two shoals forming {{the edges of the}} channel leading into Mount Hope Bay). Appropriation was made in 1873 and the first light was activated in August of the same year. The form of the structure remained essentially the same over the years: a small square house with a lantern and fog bell set on the roof, all perched on a <b>pier</b> <b>of</b> stone <b>blocks</b> scarcely larger than the house itself. The building, however, had to be rebuilt or massively repaired several times over the years, due to damage from moving ice. Damage to the pier in the winter of 1875 (the whole structure was shifted some four feet) led to enlargement <b>of</b> the <b>pier</b> in 1878, with the house being temporarily relocated to shore. In 1920 the pier was again damaged by ice, and four years later the house was rebuilt, the original single room dwelling being enlarged to four rooms.|$|R
50|$|The Lighthouse Board {{remained}} {{convinced that}} a permanent light was needed at the spot, and in 1873 succeeded in getting Congress to appropriate funds. Construction began the following year and was completed in 1875. Cross Ledge Light was unlike any other light in the area. It sat upon a hexagonal <b>pier</b> constructed <b>of</b> granite <b>blocks,</b> upon which sat an octagonal two story Second Empire frame house with the lantern at the crown of its mansard roof. A fourth-order Fresnel lens was installed. Before the house could be completed, the lightship, having taken refuge behind the Delaware Breakwater, was nonetheless dragged out to sea by ice in February 1875; {{it was able to}} resume station until the light was completed, however.|$|R
50|$|Pre-stressed {{concrete}} beams {{supported by}} <b>piers</b> made <b>of</b> concrete <b>blocks</b> span the 50 foot (15 m) width {{of each of}} the two main sections of the building, leaving them free of internal support columns. In line with his belief that structure should be made visible, Kahn distinguished the piers from the non-weight-bearing walls within which they are embedded by using concrete <b>blocks</b> the size <b>of</b> bricks for the piers and larger concrete blocks for the walls. The beams are clearly visible in the interior of the building as are the ends of the beams on top <b>of</b> the <b>piers</b> on the exterior. The piers, which are on the long sides of the building, project from the external walls to create a light-and-shadow effect. Kahn created additional visual interest by placing the twelve sets <b>of</b> <b>piers</b> in a pattern that is not quite equally spaced; the walls between the piers alternate between being slightly wider than expected and slightly narrower than expected.|$|R

50|$|As the {{caissons}} {{were being}} {{sunk into the}} riverbed, the piers were being built on top of them, adding weight and driving the caisson deeper into the river bottom. The <b>piers</b> were masonry <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> granite backed with concrete. The <b>piers</b> <b>of</b> the Harahan were located directly upstream <b>of</b> the <b>piers</b> <b>of</b> the Frisco Bridge to keep the navigation channels open to river traffic. Pier IV was moved 17 feet toward the river relative to the Frisco Pier IV. This enabled the engineers to design two suspended spans and three cantilevered arms identically.|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} “Opus africanum” {{has been}} used {{since at least the}} 1950 s to indicate, without further distinctions, a group of techniques characterised by a framework <b>of</b> vertical <b>piers</b> made <b>of</b> stone <b>blocks.</b> Partly because <b>of</b> its definition, opus africanum is traditionally assumed to be of Phoenician or Punic origin. In particular, according to most of the previous studies, it was adopted in the Punic regions, from whence it was transmitted to the western Mediterranean and principally to Sardinia, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, Campania and Etruria. During the Roman imperial age it spread mostly across North Africa. In {{the first part of this}} new study of opus africanum, starting from an analysis of the constructive and static characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>piers,</b> the technique is subdivided into 5 different types. The reasons for the use and diffusion of the various types are then examined in the territories of Campania and Etruria, where some of the most representative examples of the technique are found. In the conclusion, we examine how the use of opus africanum in the different territories should be explained not only in relationship to its cultural roots, but also taking into account its static characteristics, as well as the economic and social contexts where it was use...|$|R

60|$|But {{the stump}} of caes, or jetty, which was dashed to pieces {{more than a}} score of years ago, remains as it was; The landing-place calls loudly for a T-headed <b>pier</b> <b>of</b> {{concrete}} <b>blocks,</b> or a gangway supported upon wooden piles and metal pilasters: one does not remark the want in fine weather; one does bitterly on bad days. There has been no attempt to make a port or even a débarcadère by connecting the basaltic lump Loo (Ilheu) Fort with the Pontinha, the curved scorpion's tail of rock and masonry, Messieurs Blandy's coal stores, to the west. Big ships must still roll at anchor in a dangerous open roadstead far off shore; and, during wet weather, ladies, well drenched by the surf, must be landed {{with the aid of}} a crane in what should be the inner harbour. The broken-down circus near Reid's is to become a theatre, but whence the money is to come no one knows. The leper hospital cannot afford to make up more than nine or ten beds. The jail is in its old disgraceful state, and sadly wants reform: here the minimum of punishment would suffice; I never saw the true criminal face, and many of the knick-knacks bought in Madeira are the work of these starving wretches. The Funchal Club gives periodically a subscription ball, 'to ameliorate, if possible, the condition of the prisoners at the Funchal jail'--asking strangers, in fact, to do the work of Government. The Praça da Rainha, a dwarf walk facing the huge yellow Government House, alias Palacio de São Lourenço, has been grown with mulberries intended for sericulture. Unfortunately, whatever may here be done by one party (the 'ins') is sure to be undone when the 'outs' become 'ins.' There has been no change in the 'Palace,' except that the quaint portraits of one-eyed Zargo, who has left many descendants in the island, and of the earlier Captains-General, dignitaries who were at once civil and military, have been sent to the Lisbon Exhibition. The queer old views of Machim's landing and of Funchal Bay still amuse visitors. Daily observations for meteorology are here taken at 9 A.M. and 3 and 9 P.M.; the observatory standing eighty feet above sea-level.|$|R
