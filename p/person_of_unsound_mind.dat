2500|$|Partly in {{response}} to such criticism, the Confederate Congress amended the Second Conscription Act in May 1863, requiring among other things that any person exempted under the so-called [...] "Twenty Negro Law" [...] {{had to have been}} an overseer prior to April 16, 1862, on plantations that had not been divided after October 11, 1862 (as some plantation owners had been dividing their holdings so as to exempt more overseers). [...] Furthermore, only plantations under the control of a minor, a single woman, a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>unsound</b> <b>mind,</b> or a person who was serving in the Confederate military could qualify, and a $500 fee was required to process the application. [...] The Third Conscription Act of February 1864 dropped the number of slaves from 20 to 15, but in turn required the person so exempted to sell to the Confederacy at government-set prices one hundred pounds of bacon and/or beef for each slave, with the surplus to be sold to soldiers' families, also at government prices.|$|E
60|$|ST. HERBERT There {{is always}} a local lunatic, who, if harmless, is {{generally}} a popular character. James Washington McCaw {{appears to have been}} a particularly cheerful specimen. One of his eccentricities was to always have a skipping-rope in his pocket; wherever the traffic allowed it, he would go through the streets skipping. He said it kept him warm. Another of his tricks was to let off fireworks from the roof of his house whenever he heard of the death of anybody of importance. The Returning Officer refused his nomination--which, so far as his nominators were concerned, was intended only as a joke--on the grounds of his being by common report a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>unsound</b> <b>mind.</b> And there, so far as South-west Belfast was concerned, the matter ended.|$|E

25|$|The Representation of the People Acts 1983 and 2000 confer the {{franchise}} on British subjects and {{citizens of the}} Commonwealth and Ireland who are resident in the UK.

40|$|Background: Mental health {{legislations}} {{have the}} primary aim {{of protecting the}} rights of patients and providing appropriate care. Provision for civil commitment <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> <b>unsound</b> <b>mind</b> {{is an important component}} of this. In Tanzania as elsewhere the law places responsibility on the police and court for the identification <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> <b>of</b> <b>unsound</b> <b>mind</b> to be cared for. The extent of knowledge and awareness of the provisions of mental health legislation among patients, their relatives and relevant professionals is unknown. The views and preferences of patients, their relatives and other stakeholders regarding the process of implementation of the law is also unknown. Objectives: To determine degree of knowledge on mental health law among health workers, police officers, lawyers, judges, patients and their relatives as well as their opinion regarding the provisions ofthe law and its implementation Materials and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among police officers, lawyers, doctors, nurses, patients and their relatives. Data was collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire for patient and relatives and self administered questionnaire for professionals. Results: This study found that, the level of awareness of mental health law on civil commitment of mentally ill patient in Kinondoni division and Department of Psychiatry Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam city was low (34. 4 %) and the level of knowledge was even lower (24. 4 %). Awareness of mental health law on civil commitment of mentally ill patients appeared to increase with increasing level of education. Adherence to the laid down procedures of the law was found to be poor among all participant groups studied. Conclusion and Recommendations: This study indicates that the awareness and knowledge of mental health law on civil commitment of mentally ill patients is low. The level of awareness and knowledge should therefore be raised through education and training. There is a need to review the current law to bring it in line with the needs and requirement of relevant stakeholders and remove some of the barriers to its application. Such revision should be preceded by community based studies and consultations with relevant stakeholders...|$|R

50|$|Kidnapping - There are {{two kinds}} of {{kidnapping}}: kidnapping from Singapore, and kidnapping from lawful guardianship. A person is kidnapped from Singapore when he or she is conveyed beyond the limits of Singapore without his or her consent or the consent of some person legally authorised to consent on behalf of that person. Whoever takes or entices any minor under 14 years of age if a male, or under 16 years of age if a female, or any <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>unsound</b> <b>mind,</b> out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor or <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>unsound</b> <b>mind,</b> without the consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such minor or person from lawful guardianship. The punishment for kidnapping from Singapore or kidnapping from lawful guardianship is imprisonment for up to ten years, and a fine or caning. It may be noted that under the Kidnapping Act, it is an offence to abduct or wrongfully restrain or wrongfully confine a person with intent to hold that person for ransom. The penalty is death or imprisonment for life; if the offender is not sentenced to death, he is also liable to caning.|$|E
