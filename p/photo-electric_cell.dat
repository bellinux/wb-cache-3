50|$|Flame {{lift-off}} in {{oil fired}} pressure jet burners is an unwanted {{condition in which}} the flame and burner become separated. This condition is most commonly created by excessive combustion air and often results {{in the loss of}} flame as the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cell</b> fails to register the light of the flame, this in turn results in a safety lockout of the control box.|$|E
50|$|His CYSP 1 (1956) is {{considered}} the first cybernetic sculpture in art history in that it made use of electronic computations as developed by the Philips Company. The sculpture is set on a base mounted on four rollers, which contains the mechanism and the electronic brain. The plates are operated by small motors located under their axis. <b>Photo-electric</b> <b>cells</b> and a microphone built into the sculpture catch all the variations {{in the fields of}} color, light intensity and sound intensity. All these changes occasion reactions {{on the part of the}} sculpture.|$|R
5000|$|His weapons {{include a}} rotary saw {{that emerges from}} his left arm, and can {{transform}} his right arm into a heavy machine gun. Ratchet also has an assortment of other tools at his disposal; in the movie, he uses a red laser to scan and try to calibrate Bumblebee's voicebox as they are introduced to Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes. He has an enhanced sense of smell. According to the book Transformers - Meet The Autobots by Jennifer Frantz, Ratchet has X-ray vision. According to the Transformers U.K. magazine Ratchet can produce a [...] "chameleon" [...] effect with his surface <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cells</b> allowing him to blend with his environment.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "bedstead" [...] was {{a system}} of pulleys around which two {{continuous}} loops of tape were driven in synchrony. Initially this was {{by means of a}} pair of sprocket wheels on a common axle. This was changed to drive by friction pulleys with the sprocket wheels maintaining the synchrony when it was found that this caused less damage to the tapes. Speeds of up to 2000 characters per second were achieved for shorter tapes, but only 1000 for longer tapes. The tapes were guided past an array of <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cells</b> where the characters and other signals were read. Possible tape lengths on the bedstead were from 2000 to 11,000 characters.|$|R
50|$|The Optophonic Piano {{generated}} {{sounds and}} projected revolving patterns onto {{a wall or}} ceiling by directing a bright light {{through a series of}} revolving painted glass disks (painted by Vladimir Baranoff Rossiné himself), filters, mirrors and lenses. The keyboard controlled the combination of the various filters and disks. The variations in opacity of the painted disk and filters were picked up by a <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cell</b> controlling the pitch of a single oscillator. The instrument produced a continuous varying tone which, accompanied by the rotating Kaleidoscopic projections was used by Vladimir Baranoff Rossiné at exhibitions and public events.|$|E
50|$|The first form {{of optical}} sound was {{represented}} by horizontal bands of clear (white) and solid (black) area. The space between solid points represented amplitude and {{was picked up by}} the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cell</b> {{on the other side of}} a steady, thin beam of light being shined through it. This variable density form of sound was eventually phased out because of its incompatibility with color stocks. The alternative and ultimately the successor of variable density has been the variable area track, in which a clear, vertical waveform against black represents the sound, and the width of the waveform is equivalent to the amplitude. Variable area does have slightly less frequency response than variable density, but because of the grain and variable infrared absorption of various film stocks, variable density has a lower signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
50|$|In {{a flying}} spot scanner (FSS) or {{cathode-ray}} tube (CRT) telecine, a pixel-sized light beam is projected through exposed and developed motion picture film (either negative or positive) and collected by a special type of <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cell</b> known as a photomultiplier which converts the light into an electrical signal. The beam of light “scans” across the film image {{from left to right}} to record the horizontal frame information. Vertical scanning of the frame is then accomplished by moving the film past the CRT beam. In a colour telecine the light from the CRT passes through the film and is separated by dichroic mirrors and filters into red, green and blue bands. Photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes convert the light into separate red, green and blue electrical signals for further electronic processing. This can be accomplished in “real time”, 24 frames per second (or in some cases faster). Rank Precision-Cintel introduced the “Mark” series of FSS telecines. During this time advances were also made in CRTs, with increased light output producing a better signal-to-noise ratio and so allowing negative film to be used.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, Bernard Judge {{was awarded}} a United States patent for his {{innovative}} structural system based on a four-pole, pre-cut residential module. His own home in the Hollywood Hills is based on this construction.His “Triponent House”, a geodesic dome completed in 1962, was Judge’s effort to find an economically sound solution to housing using the finest technology of the day. He called his experimental house “Triponent” for its three intrinsic elements: the envelope, utility core, and interior spaces. The envelope consisted of a 50 foot diameter geodesic dome covered with transparent Mylar, and shaded by <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cells.</b> The utility core contained the manufactured plumbing, utilities, kitchen and bathroom appliances, mechanical and electrical systems. Interior spaces were left open for the individuals using them to design for themselves accordingly. The geodesic framework of the “Triponent House” is at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.|$|R
5000|$|When Britt Reid {{left his}} bedroom, {{he went through}} a secret passage between {{the walls of the}} {{apartment}} building into an old ramshackle structure front on another street. The fact that the rear of this place touched the fashionable apartment building, made the passage {{from one to the other}} possible to Britt Reid. On the first floor of this supposedly abandoned building was the motor car which Kato kept in perfect condition. The car with a motor of such power that it was that it was an easy matter to avoid pursuit. When the car was taken from its hiding place, <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cells</b> opened and closed cunningly disguised doors in the building. When Britt slipped beneath the steering wheel, he was no longer the happy-go-lucky young millionaire. He became grim and purposeful, willing to risk all in combat with criminals the law couldn't reach. He became the Green Hornet.|$|R
5000|$|Oramics is a drawn sound {{technique}} that involves drawing directly onto 35mm film stock. Shapes and designs etched into the filmstrips are read by <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cells</b> and transformed into sounds. According to Oram, [...] "Every nuance, every subtlety of phrasing, every tone gradation or pitch inflection must be possible just by {{a change in}} the written form." [...] The Oramics technique and the flexibility of control over the nuances of sound was an altogether new and innovative approach to music production. Financial pressures meant it was necessary to maintain her work as a commercial composer, and her work on the Oramics system covered a wider range than the Radiophonic Workshop. She produced music for not only radio and television but also theatre, short commercial films, sound installations and exhibitions. Other work from this studio included electronic sounds for Jack Clayton's 1961 horror film The Innocents, concert works including Four Aspects, and collaborations with opera composer Thea Musgrave and Ivor Walsworth.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{twenty years}} later, in 1933, Ryan {{was also the}} {{lighting}} designer for Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition, which again was notable for its lighting innovation. To match the art moderne architecture, Ryan used the new electric gaseous discharge lamps, especially neon (over 75,000 feet of neon tubing in addition to more than 15,000 incandescent lamps). The fair was conceived of in large part as a lighting display; building surfaces were brightly colored, smooth, and shiny with few openings, for optimum reflectivity, and the fair opened at night (with a fireworks display ignited by light from the star Arcturus that had originated {{at the time of}} the previous Chicago World's Fair, converted into an electrical pulse by a <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cell).</b> The exterior lighting required 3,000 kilowatts of power; the General Electric building had a simulated waterfall on its side that alone required 5,000 feet of blue tube lighting. But the use of new technology enabled Ryan to obtain the maximum amount of light for the fair's limited funds. Scintillators were used again, with smoke effects from the fireworks, but this time the modern lighting fixtures were placed in full view. The largest electric incandescent filament lamp in the world, 50 kilowatts, was on display. For its second year, in 1934, the illumination was increased by about half, and the Ford Building had a Pillar of Light created by 24 searchlights projecting a mile into the sky. The closing program for the exposition on October 31, 1934, was titled [...] "The Festival of Illumination: The Apotheosis of Man-Made Light." [...] Again, the fair was influential: the expositions at Dallas and Cleveland the following year both emulated both the architecture and the lighting of the Chicago fair.|$|E

40|$|The {{separation}} of the valuable portion from the waste portion of an ore is an individual problem for every ore. However, the various methods for accomplishing this end, more or less classify themselves by the physical properties of the constituents of the ore. Most of the properties of minerals have been utilized {{in some way or}} other to affect the {{separation of}} the valuable from the invaluable parts. Practically nothing has been done so far with color and luster to attain this purpose. It is believed that the <b>photo—electric</b> <b>cell</b> could also be used in concentrating a certain class of ores which are not well suited to other methods...|$|E
50|$|When Cly confronts Stark at the hospital, Tony {{realizes he}} has to face Stane directly; he {{collects}} his newly completed Silver Centurion and flies to Long Island. Stark confronts Stane on the property of Stane International and defeats Stane's agents, including the Chessmen, who had proven a match for his previous armor. Stane dons the Iron Monger armor and confronts Stark personally. The Iron Monger is {{more powerful than the}} previous Iron Man armor, but not the Silver Centurion model, which includes such features as the ability to absorb the heat from the Iron Monger's thermal rays and channel it into the armor's own energy supplies. Stane tries to defeat Stark by tricking him into entering a room where Happy, Pepper, and Mrs. Arbogast are being held in suspended animation tanks. The walls of the room are covered with <b>photo-electric</b> <b>cells</b> that will send 200,000 volts into their bodies if Stark moves. Stark uses his armor's sensors to find the trap's power source, and destroys it with his chest-plate's uni-beam weapon.|$|R
