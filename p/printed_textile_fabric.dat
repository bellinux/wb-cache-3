40|$|AbstractMaterials {{nowadays}} become {{smarter and}} “more intelligent”, containing novel functionalities or sensory components. In {{all areas of}} materials science, integrating new abilities into common materials belongs to the most important topics in research and development. In the textile area, several functions {{can be achieved by}} finishing techniques, i. e. physical and/or chemical modifications of textile surfaces. The integration of electronic components, however, still suffers from incompatibilities between soft, flexible, bendable <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> and rigid electronic parts. Connecting conductive yarns with electronic components, such as SMD-LEDs etc., cannot be performed by soldering nor by sewing. The typical connection technologies of both areas fail in these cases. A new possibility to achieve such electrical {{and at the same time}} mechanical connections is given by 3 D printing. In a recent project, we have studied chances and limitations of electric circuits combining <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> with 3 D <b>printing.</b> <b>Textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> were woven and knitted from common yarns as well as wires, strands and different conductive yarns. 3 D printing was used to connect SMD elements and other small electronic parts with these base circuits and compared with soldered and sewn contacts. The influence of conductive wires, yarns or filaments integrated in the printed elements was tested. The article will give an overview of possibilities and problems in electrical contacting of small electronic components on partly conductive <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> by conductive 3 D printed connections. Additionally, an outlook to other potential areas of application, such as sensors and actuators on <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> is presented...|$|R

Specific aims were {{to study how}} colours and compositions used in Old Amish Quilts can be systematically described, to study how simple and complex patterns in <b>printed</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are perceived and expressed verbally and to study judgements, concepts and values in relation to designed textile patterns as expressed by schoolchildren, consumers, teachers of textile handicraft and designers. The study design is qualitative in order to collect concepts used by subjects from different user groups when describing textile patterns and {{of the reasons for}} their judgements of the designed patterns. A modified Repertory Grid Method was used. Describing colour design and composition using graphic models was also attempted. The experience of aesthetic qualities in designed patterns is complex and not possible to describe using clear-cut concepts. Descriptions and choice of words are part of different language games outside the field of textile design and their contents are found in a dynamic interplay between a number of experiential contexts. The dominant inner contexts of individuals, basic perceptual patterns of apprehension, direct experiences of the surrounding world, and influences from the cultural context all give different and complex structures of attention. Different structures of attention lead to different perceptual choices and different descriptions, judgements, notions and values concerning designed printed patterns. The present study shows that subjects make their judgements on the basis of formal, functional, cultural and emotional contents. These content categories are related to the multiple contexts of different dimensions of experience. For judgement and communication in the process of design and in design education, mutual understanding calls not only for concepts and notions in the field of design, but also consideration of conditions of experience and communication in life...|$|R

Post-processing is something to think about: is the printed material easily confectioned, applied or handled. Should it be washed or does it need a finish (e.g. fire retardant, water repellent). A washed textile no longer has coating or ink residues and will, therefore, have a better feel. Moreover, it will be less prone to stains and it will last longer. However, digital <b>textile</b> <b>printing</b> <b>fabric</b> will fade out with repeated washings, so it should be labeled as dry cleaning only, and the best way is washing by hand with cold water or using washing machine with gentle cycle and use mild detergent.|$|R

40|$|In {{comparison}} to weaving or other techniques that are employed to embed conductive tracks in <b>textile</b> <b>fabric</b> structure, the obvious advantages of printing the desired conductive pattern are {{the simplicity of}} the process and the suitability for low volume production runs as well as high volume production runs. However, the generally inferior durability and poorer electrical performance of conductive inks that have been <b>printed</b> onto a <b>textile</b> <b>fabric</b> give rise to challenges. In this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment were used to formulate screen printing inks for use on textiles. On an equal weight basis, electrically conductive grades impart higher electrical conductivity compared to the printing ink grades of carbon black pigment. However, the conductive grades of carbon black are difficult to disperse and stabilise in aqueous media. Therefore in this study, a procedure was devised initially to prepare stable, waterborne dispersions of a number of highly conductive grades of carbon black pigment. The stability of pigment dispersions was characterised by conducting rheological, particle size and accelerated gravitational sedimentation analyses on appropriate formulations. In order to formulate finished inks from the optimised, stable pigment dispersions, various binders were incorporated in the formulations followed by characterisation of the stability and the electrical properties of the finished inks. Films of the formulated inks were deposited onto various textile substrates. This was followed by testing of the washing and creasing performance of these ink films. It was found that the formulated inks performed considerably better than the tested commercial inks. It was shown that following the ink preparation procedure devised in this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment can be used to formulate <b>textile</b> <b>printing</b> inks which not only possess very high electrical conductivity but are also durable to withstand washing and creasing of textiles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} for objectifying {{the handle of}} <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{is a very important}} factor in the textile and garment manufacturing and retailing industries. Handle is influenced by mechanical properties of <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the surface roughness. The KES-F system is standard objectified method among different measurement methods. But the measurement of surface roughness applied the KES-F which is contact method disturbs an accurate measurement for analysis of tactile perception. Hence we measure the surface roughness of <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> without deformation by a non-contact method applied the laser displacement sensor with a resolution of 1 µm and a accuracy of 0. 01 % and high precisely controlled linear motor for translated at constant speed. Since the <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are woven and knitted with various colored yarn and its surface treated with chemical treatment to make luster, we analyze the effect of color and luster {{in order to reduce the}} optical errors. And the results of surface roughness of various <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> compared with the surface characteristic values (MIU, MMD) measured by KES-F system. The data is controlled on computer and executed FFT by using MATLABTM for obtain roughness, the mean values and mean deviation from thirty plain and twill woven fabrics for men’s suit in winter.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new semi-supervised defect {{detection}} scheme for {{solving the problem}} of automated defect detection for <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In {{the development of the}} scheme, Gabor wavelet network (GWN) is deployed as the major technique to extract texture features from <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> An optimal Gabor filter is then designed {{on the basis of the}} features extracted. The proposed defect detection scheme consists of one real-valued optimal Gabor filter and one smoothing filter. The performance of the scheme is evaluated by using an offline test database with 78 homogeneous fabric images. The test results exhibit accurate defect detection with low false alarm, thus showing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is further evaluated by conducting real time tests using a prototyped automated defect detection system. The experimental results obtained clearly demonstrate that the proposed scheme is indeed an effective and efficient means for detecting defects in <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Keywords—Defect detection, filtering, Gabor function, Gabor wavelet networks, <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics...</b>|$|R
