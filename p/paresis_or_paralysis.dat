Though voice qualities may appear normal in some cases of vocal fold <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis,</b> mild {{differences}} in tension between the two vocal folds of the larynx can result in changes of voice pitch, intensity and reduced vocal stamina.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{patients}} with vocal fold <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis</b> {{are able to}} identify the onset of their symptoms. The most commonly reported symptom {{patients with}} either vocal fold <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis</b> make is having a rough voice quality. It {{is important to note that}} the symptoms of vocal fold paresis are not specific to the condition and tend to be common symptoms of other voice disorders as well. Vocal fold bowing, decreased vocal fold mobility, especially decreased mobility of the arytenoid cartilage, are often observed in vocal fold paresis. Glottal insufficiency is another common symptom observed in vocal fold paresis. In this case, the vocal folds do not come together properly. Glottal insufficiency may be hard to identify, especially when the area above the vocal folds is hyperfunctional. Hyperfunction may also make it difficult to detect the presence of vocal fold paresis. Hyperfunction of the area above the vocal folds may be considered a sign of glottal insufficiency and potentially, vocal fold paresis.|$|E

50|$|The main {{indications}} for dynamic smile reconstruction are unilateral or bilateral {{facial paralysis}} due to acquired and congenital causes. Trauma, Bell's palsy and tumour extirpation {{are examples of}} secondary or acquired facial paralysis. Bell's palsy or idiopathic facial paralysis is a condition which leads to facial paralysis, however, without a known cause. It has an acute onset and is mostly self-limiting. But if spontaneous recurrence of (near) normal function does not take place, surgical reanimation may be indicated. Some head and neck tumours invade or compress the facial nerve leading to facial <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis.</b> Examples of such tumours are facial neuromas, cholesteatomas, haemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, parotid gland neoplasms or metastases. Sometimes, the facial nerve cannot be preserved during resection of these tumours.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{with either}} vocal fold <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis</b> may exhibit a breathy voice quality. This voice quality {{results from the}} {{increased}} activity of the vocal folds {{to compensate for the}} immobility of the PCA muscle(s). Patients may need to use more effort than normal when speaking and may find that their voice quiets or grows tired after speaking for a long time. This is known as vocal fatigue. Patients may also complain about having a limited pitch range and trouble varying their pitch at quick rate. It is often difficult for the speaker to project their voice and speak loud enough to be heard in noisy environments, over background noise, or when speaking to someone from a distance. It is possible for symptoms to surface only in situations where the environmental acoustics are poor, such as outdoors. Patients may report feeling pain in the throat or experiencing bouts of choking. A patient presenting with diplophonia is of major concern as this typically means that the mass and tension of their vocal folds are asymmetrical which may also indicate vocal fold paresis.|$|E

40|$|Skull base {{surgeons}} {{are frequently}} required {{to operate in}} close proximity to the facial nerve. At times, a skull base tumor is resected with the facial nerve grossly infact, only to have the patient awaken with a unilateral facial <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis.</b> In the selected cases where the surgeon is certain that the facial nerve has been left intact and return of function is expected, methods are needed to ameliorate the temporary <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis</b> of the eyelids. In our institution, eyelid closure has been achieved by placement of a gold weight in the upper eyelid. These weights were placed with the knowledge that they could be removed once facial nerve function returned. We report on 11 such patients who had gold weights placed within 3 weeks of their original intracranial or skull base procedure. All patients were discharged with adequate eyelid closure. Three patients later required lower lid surgery for poor tone or persistence of paralysis.

40|$|Palsies {{involving}} the anterior interosseous nerve comprise less than 1 % of all upper extremity nerve palsies. Patients often present initially with acute {{pain in the}} proximal forearm, lasting several hours to days. The pain subsides, {{to be followed by}} <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> total <b>paralysis</b> of the pronator quadratus, flexor pollicis longus and the radial half of the flexor profundus, either individually or together.

The patient was admitted initially for chronic osteomyelitis of the left calcaneum. He had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line inserted into a brachial vein for the administration of intravenous antibiotics, and developed anterior interosseous nerve palsy as a complication of this procedure. The catheter was subsequently removed and a new line was placed on the other side, and his neurological deficit has been improving since. This case highlights the potential hazards of venupuncture or arterial puncture of the brachial vein or artery respectively, even under controlled conditions with the benefit of ultrasound guidance.

40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) {{has been}} successful in the prediction of motor recovery in acute stroke patients with initially severe <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis</b> of the upper extremity. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) appear to have a high specificity but a rather low sensitivity with regard to motor recovery. The silent period (SP) has been proposed as an additional factor to the MEP for predicting motor recovery that might optimize the sensitivity of TMS. The authors reviewed the literature and case series focusing on the additional value of the SP to the MEP for predicting poststroke hand motor recovery. Studies that have analyzed the SP for predicting poststroke motor recovery have rather inconsistent results and suffer from heterogeneity in technical methods, methodology, and patient characteristics. In most studies, prolonged SPs have been found immediately after stroke, whereas in the (sub) acute phase thereafter, different patterns of SP duration have been found. These differences are thought to be related to stroke localization, though contraction-induced reduction phenomena and recovery-related intracortical phenomena may also be responsible. Although the SP might be used to identify clinically silent or minor strokes, in acute stroke patients with initial severe <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis,</b> the SP seems to have no additional value to MEP for predicting poststroke motor recovery. Nevertheless, the SP (poststroke-reduced SPs and contraction-induced inhibitory phenomena) has been proposed as a prognostic factor for poststroke spasticity. This review emphasizes the significance of the SP in predicting poststroke motor recovery and spasticity. Although the relation among the SP, recovery-related intracortical phenomena, and spasticity remains unclear, a neurophysiologic model underlying the SP is discussed. However, more research is needed on the value of the SP for predicting poststroke spasticity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Vocal cord <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>{{paralysis}}</b> occurs due to lesion in the vagus nerve. Vocal cord paralysis {{can lead}} to dysphonia as well as dysphagia which lead the patient to frustration and emotional problems. The literature available on the etiology and the problems faced by them in Indian population is very scanty. Hence a prospective study was done on 41 Patients with vocal cord palsy who were referred to the Department of ENT for voice assessment and management from March 1 st 2012 till 1 st August 2012. The medical and surgical reports were examined. They were evaluated by an otorhinolaryngologist, and a Speech Language Pathologist. Diagnosis was made based on video stroboscopic findings. We also examined voice-related quality of life (V-RQOL) outcomes in these patients. In this study, endo-tracheal intubation (15 / 41; 36. 5 %) was the majo...|$|E

40|$|The Anterior Compartment Syndrome is a {{relatively}} rare affection with {{a wide spectrum of}} etiologies. Like every compartment syndrome, it is a condition in which high pressure in a rigid osteofascial space reduces capillary blood perfusion so that tissue viability is threatened. When pressure remains sufficiently high for a number of hours, normal muscle and nerve functions become disturbed which may lead to myoneural necrosis. Therefore, an early decompression by means of fasciotomy is essential. Clinical examination is of critical importance in reaching a diagnosis: first of all a painful swelling occurs, followed by muscular <b>paresis</b> <b>or</b> <b>paralysis,</b> and finally loss of sensation and a "silent" electromyogram (EMG). In some cases pressure measurements are necessary, in which tissue pressures over 30 to 40 mm Hg are considered abnormal. The EMG-examination is useful in order to achieve a diagnosis and to assess the degree of injury. It may be an important guide for further rehabilitation. status: publishe...|$|E
