To make a living, Berwald started an orthopedic and physiotherapy clinic in Berlin in 1835, which turned out to be profitable.

It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.|$|E
25|$|Ledley's {{first goal}} of the 2005–06 season came in a 2–1 League Cup victory over Macclesfield Town. He scored the {{equaliser}} after the League Two side had taken the lead. A month later, on 18 October, he scored in Cardiff's 2–2 draw against Preston North End. Four days later Cardiff beat Crewe Alexandra 6–1, with Ledley scoring the second to put them 2–1 up shortly after half time. Cardiff had been tipped for relegation {{at the start of}} the season but this victory <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of the play-off places. Ledley's fourth {{goal of the}} season came in a 2–1 victory over Southampton on 31 December.|$|E

The two men walk along the terrace, when Lord Charles is startled by a figure leaving the study by the French window, although Sir George sees nothing. When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe and he <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. He was distracted when he heard a woman's scream in the hallway and ran out to find Leonie, Mrs. Vanderlyn's maid, who claimed that she had seen a ghost. Carlile had not otherwise left the study.

25|$|On {{the opening}} drive of the game, a heavy pass rush by Oilers {{defensive}} tackle Glenn Montgomery caused Montana {{to throw a}} rushed pass that was intercepted by Steve Jackson, who returned it 14 yards to the Chiefs 23-yard line. Houston went three-and-out, including Lewis' 9-yard sack of Moon on third down, but Al Del Greco kicked a 49-yard field goal to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board. Then after forcing a punt, Moon led the Oilers 80 yards in 11 plays on a drive that consumed just 6:37, starting if off with a 16-yard completion to Gary Wellman and later completing a 30-yard pass to Wellman deep in Chiefs territory. Once inside the red zone, Moon threw an incompletion on third down, but Thomas was penalized for being offsides, and Moon threw a first down completion to Haywood Jeffires at the 2-yard line on the next play. Running back Gary Brown took {{the ball into the}} end zone from there, increasing Houston's lead to 10–0.|$|E
25|$|May {{started with}} home fixture against East Bengal. Bengaluru had never {{registered}} a win against East Bengal in previous five encounters across various tournaments. Though East Bengal started on attacking note, It was Bengaluru {{who came out}} on top as Sean Rooney, Sunil Chhetri and Robin Singh scored a goal each and man of the match Lalthuammawia Ralte maintained a clean-sheet {{in the game and}} Bengaluru secured its first win against East Bengal. Bengaluru then travelled to Shillong, where a win against Shillong Lajong could <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the table. After taking the lead {{towards the end of the}} first half through Sean Rooney's goal, Bengaluru could not hold on to the lead and conceded a penalty in 65th minute and the game ended in 1–1 draw. After facing defeat against Persipura Jayapura in the AFC cup, Bengaluru returned to form against Salgaocar when they registered 3–1 win. After leading in the first half by 26th-minute goal from Thoi Singh, Bengaluru faced equalizer from Darryl Duffy, but Eugeneson Lyngdoh quickly restored the lead. Man of the match Curtis Osano scored his first goal ever for the team in 80th minute and got on the scoresheet for the victory. In the last away game of the season, Bengaluru played against Dempo. Bengaluru took the lead through Robin Singh's goal, but could not hold on to the lead as Uttam Rai scored one back and the match ended at 1–1 with Bengaluru trailing the table toppers, Mohun Bagan by 2 points. In the final home game against Mohun Bagan, Bengaluru needed an outright win to defend the title. Bengaluru looked on course to defend the title when John Johnson scored his first goal of the season with a header, from Rino Anto's cross, but Mohun Bagan defender Bello Razaq scored the equalizer in 87th minute. Bengaluru's subsequent attack could not find the winner and they conceded the title to Mohun Bagan, though Bengaluru ended the season with the longest unbeaten run of 13 games, equalizing the record set by East Bengal in 2010–11 season.|$|E
500|$|While Brown's {{tenure in}} Cleveland ended in bitterness, the coach was a {{prolific}} innovator with the team.

Brown also invented the [...] "taxi squad", a group of promising players who did not make the roster but were kept on reserve.

500|$|The console {{versions}} of the game were noted for their robust feature set which <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same level as the PC release.

While the PlayStation 3 version suffered from minor framerate and loading time issues as well as reduced graphical fidelity, reviewers observed {{that all of these}} problems were eliminated in the PlayStation 4 version, creating parity with the PC release. Kollar and Leif Johnson of IGN also found that the game played admirably on PlayStation Vita via Remote Play with only minor lag.|$|E

500|$|Most of Manchester's {{infantry}} under Sergeant Major General Lawrence Crawford were on {{the left}} of the front line. A brigade of Lord Fairfax's foot was in the centre. Two Covenanter brigades each of two regiments, the [...] "vanguard" [...] of the main battalia commanded by Lieutenant General William Baillie, made up the right of the front line. The second line consisted of four Covenanter brigades, their [...] "main battle", commanded by Lumsden. There is confusion as to the disposition of the third line and of the infantry deployment on the right wing, as the only map (Lumsden's) is badly damaged. The usual interpretation, based on Peter Young's reconstruction, is that the third line contained two or three Covenanter brigades and the Earl of Manchester's own regiment of foot. Young placed the main body of Fairfax's foot on {{the left of the}} third line, although more recent interpretations of accounts <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right of the third line or even behind the cavalry of the right wing. An unbrigaded Covenanter regiment may have formed an incomplete fourth line. (There were a total of nineteen Covenanter regiments of foot, some of them incomplete, present at the battle.) ...|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} {{administrative}} difficulties during the tour. Bill Dowling—the {{chairman of the}} Australian Board of Control—had informed Loxton that no Test match was to begin until a receipt for 6,500 pounds had been handed over to Australian authorities. The Australian manager had also been told to rebuff any Pakistani overtures for a reciprocal tour, as it was feared that they lacked public appeal and would have caused financial losses due to a fall in ticket sales. Despite previous assurances to prepare turf pitches, the locals made a matting surface for the First Test. During the Second Test, when asked by General Ayub Khan—head of the ruling military junta—why Pakistan had not been invited to Australia, Loxton exploited the opportunity {{to complain about the}} wickets. When the tourists were greeted by another matting track in the Third Test, Ayub threatened to shoot the groundsmen if they prepared any more non-turf surfaces. The financial issue reared its head before the Second Test against India in Kanpur, when Loxton belligerently refused to start the match after the payment had failed to arrive on time. An Indian official asked the Australian manager to not [...] "spoil a beautiful friendship over money", to which the Australian manager replied [...] "Try me. I want it please...You know the rules." [...] The match proceeded after the cheque was delivered, and India inflicted Australia's only defeat for the tour and their first Test win over the visitors. Another mishap occurred during the Fifth Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta; the Australians left their hotel and took to the field with ten men, having failed to notice that Ian Meckiff had overslept and been left behind by the team bus. During the First Test against Pakistan in Dacca, one of the umpires took off his shoes and <b>put</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground while play was in progress. Loxton took a photo of the scene and lodged it to cricket authorities, asking them to make a ruling on whether a batsman would be out if the ball struck the umpire’s loose shoes and bounced up into a fielder’s hands. However, he never received a reply.|$|E
