40|$|A major {{component}} of total resistive force in cycling is aerodynamic drag. For speeds greater than ~ 14 m/s aerodynamic drag accounts for approximately 90 % of total resistive force (Debraux et al., 2009 : International Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 266 - 272). Together with the air density, the coefficient of drag and the velocity of the cyclist-bike, an important determinant of aerodynamic drag is <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area.</b> Several techniques {{have been used to}} estimate the <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> of a cyclist-bike, including the weighing of photographs and image digitising (Debraux et al., 2009). These techniques are similar as they involve extracting the cyclist-bike from a two-dimensional (2 D) image and using scaling information from a plane of known dimensions. With the weighing photographs method this is done physically using sensitive weighing scales whereas image processing software is used for the image digitising technique. Both techniques require the collection of a calibration plane, involve considerable post-processing and cannot be performed in real time. We have developed a depth camera-based system for estimating cyclist-bike <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> which addresses these issues. The depth camera algorithm works by creating a metrically scaled, three-dimensional point cloud of the cyclist-bike. The point cloud is projected on to a 2 D representation of the scene and the area of the point cloud is calculated using a technique similar to ‘voxelization’; points in the cloud occupy spaces in a fine grid – the sum of the occupied grid spaces gives total area. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the agreement between our new method and the image digitising technique. After institutional ethics approval, eight regular cyclists volunteered to participate and provided written informed consent. Participants wore their normal cycling clothing and their bicycle was mounted on a stationary indoor trainer. The bicycle was positioned against a white background to help with the image digitising method. Participants placed their feet on the pedals and held the cranks parallel to the floor. A digital camera (Canon EOS 400 D, 10. 1 megapixel) and Kinect depth camera (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) were mounted on tripods at a height of 1. 1 m and positioned 5 m and 2. 2 m in front of the participant, respectively. Similar to Debraux et al. (2009), participants adopted two positions on the bike: 1. Upright – upright torso with hands close to the stem and 2. Drops Position – hands on the drops. Three repeat captures were performed in each position, with the participant relaxing between each capture. The digitising method was performed as described by Debraux et al. (2009). Agreement between methods was assessed using limits of agreement (LOA - Bland and Altman, 1986 : Lancet, 1, 307 - 310). A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (method by position) was used to assess the effect of cyclist position on the systematic difference between measurement methods. There was no interaction between cyclist position and measurement method (p = 0. 201) indicating that the same effect of cyclist position was observed using both measurement techniques. A significant main effect for cyclist position (p = 0. 017) indicated that <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> was smaller with hands on the drops (upright: 0. 485 m 2, drops: 0. 434 m 2). There was also a significant main effect for measurement method (p < 0. 001) indicating a significantly smaller estimation of <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> using the Kinect (Kinect: 0. 416 m 2, Image: 0. 503 m 2). A predominantly systematic difference between methods was also suggested by the LOA analysis (upright: 0. 086 ± 0. 029 m 2, drops: 0. 090 ± 0. 033 m 2). The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between a common method of estimating cyclist-bike frontal area and a new depth camera-based technique. The new technique estimated systematically smaller <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> than the image digitisation method but there was relatively little random variation and the same effect of cyclist position was observed with both techniques. Which technique gives the most accurate estimate of <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> is not clear as the image digitisation technique - to which the new technique was compared - has associated errors e. g. identification of the cyclist-bike outline and out-of-plane errors. However, it was apparent during testing that the depth camera-based system often failed to identify parts of the bike and this is most likely the cause of the difference between techniques. Regardless, the results of this study suggest that the new technique can be used to assess changes in <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> – as the cyclist changes position, for example. Further, the new technique offers the possibility of analysing changes in <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> in real time – there is no requirement for calibration or post-processing...|$|E

Here we use natricine snakes to test for such patterns of convergence in morphology and function. Our data show that frontal strikers have converged on a similar morphology characterized by narrow elongate heads with a reduced <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> surface <b>area.</b> Moreover, simple computational fluid dynamics models show that the observed morphological differences are likely biologically relevant as they affect {{the flow of water}} around the head.

However, Ad has traditionally been difficult to measure. Our purpose {{was to determine the}} value of adding field-measured Ad as a correlate of level cycling time trial performance. In the field, 19 male cyclists performed a level (22. 1 km) time trial. Separately, field-determined Ad and rolling resistance were calculated for subjects along with <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> assessed directly (AP) and indirectly (Est AP). Also, a graded exercise test was performed to determine V̇O_ 2 V̇O 2 peak, lactate threshold (LT), and economy.

The correlation with performance time improved significantly (p < 0. 05) when these variables were normalized to Ad.

40|$|PURPOSE: Since {{the aim of}} the men's team pursuit in {{time trial}} track cycling is to {{accomplish}} a distance of 4000 m as fast as possible, optimizing aerodynamic drag can contribute to achieving this goal. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the drafting effect in second, third and fourth position during the team pursuit in track cycling as a function of the team members' individual <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> in order to minimize the required power. METHOD: Eight experienced track cyclists of the Dutch national selection performed 39 trials of 3 -km in different teams of four cyclists at a constant velocity of 15. 75 m/s. <b>Frontal</b> <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> were determined and together with field derived drag coefficients (Cd) for all four positions, the relationships between <b>frontal</b> <b>areas</b> of team members and drag fractions were estimated using Generalized Estimating Equations. RESULTS: The <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> (Ap) of both the cyclist directly in front of the drafter and the drafter himself turned out to be significant determinants of the drag fraction at the drafter's position (p< 0. 05), for all three drafting positions. Predicted required power for individuals in drafting positions differed up to 35 W depending on team composition. For a team, a maximal difference in team efficiency (1. 2 %) exists by selecting cyclists in a specific sequence.

40|$|International audienceFor {{different}} purposes, the <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> surface <b>area</b> (Af) {{of various}} organisms is often measured through image analysis. Such Af estimates are particularly {{used to assess}} the drag coefficient (Cd) in hydro- or aerody- namic studies of organisms. So far, estimates of Af from image analysis were generally biased (as subsequent Cd assessments) for flexible organisms at a given flow, as these estimates were obtained using the same scale for parts of the body being close to or far from the camera. To assess this problem, I used image analyses on 3 flex- ible freshwater macrophytes, each exposed to 3 different flows. For these, using a single image scale resulted in ~ 20 % errors of Af estimates if compared with a multiple scale (16 subscales, providing the "reference area") assessment. Using 4 subscales and a human-controlled plant contour definition for Af estimates was a good trade-off between accuracy of Af estimates (error < 3 % if compared with the reference area) and analysis effort (6 to 10 min for 1 plant in 1 flow condition). In comparison, using an automated definition of the plant con- tour (through computer software) and a composite scale (i. e., the mean of the 4 previous subscales) provided slightly worse Af estimates (error < 5 % if compared with the reference area). Using the automatic procedure reduced the time to estimate Af for 1 plant in 1 flow condition by ~ 30 %.

40|$|The most {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} Basal Forebrain (BF) is the collec-tion of large cortically projecting neurons (basal nucleus of Meynert) that serve as {{the primary source of}} cholinergic input to the entire cortical mantle. Despite its broad involvement in cortical activation, attention, and memory, the functional details of the BF are not well understood due to the anatomical complexity of the region. This study tested the hypothesis that basalocortical connections reflect cortical connectivity patterns. Distinct retrograde tracers were de-posited into various frontal and posterior cortical areas, and retrogra-dely labeled cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons were mapped in the BF. Concurrently, we mapped retrogradely labeled cells in pos-terior cortical areas that <b>project</b> to various <b>frontal</b> <b>areas,</b> and all cell populations were combined in the same coordinate system. Our studies suggest that the cholinergic and noncholinergic projections to the neocortex are not diffuse, but instead, are organized into seg-regated or overlapping pools of projection neurons. The extent of overlap between BF populations projecting to the cortex depends on the degree of connectivity between the cortical targets of these pro-jection populations.

These three parameters are indeed related by the following equation: C=W(d) /(eta(P). eta(o)) where eta (o) is the overall efficiency of swimming. The experiments were carried out on 72 swimmers (38 M and 34 F; 8 - 19 years) who were asked to swim at 1 m s(- 1). The static position in water was assessed by measuring the underwater torque (T'); the dynamic position in water by measuring the <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> (A (eff)). The ratio between the average values of the eldest to youngest class of age was 3. 84 and 2. 27 for T', 2. 13 and 1. 68 for A (eff), and 1. 13 and 1. 24 for eta (P) (in M and F, respectively). The increase in T' and in A (eff) was larger than the increase in efficiency suggesting that, in this age range, C should increase, the more so in M than F. Indeed, C increased by 1. 58 in male and 1. 17 in female swimmers.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a numerical investigation of ducted tidal turbines, employing three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. Bidirectional ducted turbines are modelled {{with and without}} aperture, referred to as ducted and open- centre turbines respectively. The work consists of two investigations. In the first, the turbine rotors are represented by actuator discs, a simplification which captures changes in linear momentum and thus the primary interaction of the turbine with the flow through and around the duct, while greatly reducing computational complexity. In the second investigation, the turbine rotors are represented through a CFD-integrated blade element momentum model, employing realistic rotor data, capturing swirl and blade drag {{in addition to the}} extraction of linear momentum. Both modelling techniques were employed to investigate the performances of bare, ducted, and open-centre turbines, relating these to the flow fields exhibited. For axial flow, substantial decreases in power generated by the ducted and open-centre turbines were found, relative to a bare turbine of equal total device diameter. For open-centre turbines, an increase in aperture size leads to a further reduction in power generated. Increased blockage was shown to positively affect the performance of all devices. Two further measures of performance were employed: power density, normalising the power by the rotor area, and basin efficiency, relating the power generated to the overall power removed from the flow. Moderate increases in power density can be achieved for the ducted and open-centre devices, while their basin efficiencies are of similar value to that of the bare turbine. For yawed inflow, the performance of the bare turbine decreases, whilst that of the ducted and open-centre turbines increases. This is due to an increased flow velocity following flow acceleration around the inlet lip of the duct and also an increase in effective blockage as ducts present greater <b>projected</b> <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> when approached non-axially.

To evaluate {{the role of}} individual vegetation parameters in this water-vegetation interaction, we conducted drag force measurements under {{a wide range of}} wave loadings in a large wave flume. Artificial vegetation elements were used to manipulate stiffness, <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> in still water and material volume as a proxy for biomass. The aim was to compare: (i) identical volume but different still <b>frontal</b> <b>area,</b> (ii) identical stiffness but different still <b>frontal</b> <b>area,</b> and (iii) identical still <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> but different volume. Comparison of mimic arrangements showed that stiffness and the dynamic <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> (i. e., <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> resulting from bending which depends on stiffness and hydrodynamic forcing) determine drag forces. Only at low orbital-flow velocities did the still <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> dominate the force-velocity relationship and it is hypothesised that no mimic bending took place under these conditions. Mimic arrangements with identical stiffness but different overall material volume and still <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> showed that forces do not increase linearly with increasing material volume and it is proposed that short distances between mimics cause their interaction and result in additional drag forces. A model, based on effective leaf length and characteristic plant width developed for unidirectional flow, performed well for the force time series under both regular and irregular waves.

In the human brain it {{occupies}} approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior <b>frontal</b> gyrus. Brodmann <b>area</b> 46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), although the borders of area 46 are based on cytoarchitecture rather than function. The DLPFC also encompasses part of granular <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex.|$|R
40|$|Fatty {{acid and}} alcohol {{profiles}} and stable nitrogen and carbon isotope values, d 15 N and d 13 C, of Calanus finmarchicus CV were studied in June 2004 to estimate their trophic status {{along the northern}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge i. e. the Reykjanes Ridge (RR), extending from Iceland in the north to the productive region of the Sub-Polar Front (SPF) in the south. Two main groups of stations were defined {{in the study area}} based on fatty acid (FA) and fatty alcohol compositions, the stations in the RR area constituted one group and the stations in the <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> constituted another. The sum of relative amounts of the dietary FAs was significantly higher in the RR area than in the <b>frontal</b> <b>area.</b> Conversely, the long-chained FAs, 20 : 1 and 22 : 1, were found in significantly lower relative amounts in the RR area than in the <b>frontal</b> <b>area,</b> thus indicating later ascent of the animals in the <b>frontal</b> <b>area.</b> Further support of this is provided by the fatty alcohols ratio 20 : 1 / 22 : 1 which differed significantly between the two areas. The d 15 N values were significantly higher in the <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> compared to the RR area indicating higher trophic position and/or different pelagic-POM baseline in these areas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} urban wind ventilation mapping, {{using the}} concept of "building <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> index", and uses the Kowloon peninsula of Hong Kong {{as an example of}} a dense, sub-tropical urban environment where ventilation is critical for human health. The <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> index is calculated for uniform 100 m grid cells, based on three dimensional buildings in each cell, for eight different wind directions. The <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> index is then correlated with a land use map, and the results indicate that high density commercial and industrial areas with large building footprints had higher values than other urban land use types. Using the map of <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> index, the main ventilation pathways across the urban area are located using least cost path analysis in a raster GIS. Field measurements of urban winds confirmed the significance and functionality of these modelled ventilation paths. Comparison of the pathways with a map of the urban heat island suggests that ventilation is a key parameter in mitigating heat island formation in the study area. Planning and environmental authorities may use the derived <b>frontal</b> <b>area</b> index and ventilation maps as objective measures of environmental quality within a city, especially when temperatures in the inner city are a major concern.
