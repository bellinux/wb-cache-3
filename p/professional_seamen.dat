500|$|The Imperial Fleet was a {{different}} case, as it was not tied to the thematic administration, but was considered {{as one of the}} tagmata, the professional central reserve forces. Consequently, the commander of the Imperial Fleet remained known as the droungarios tou basilikou ploïmou (later with the prefix megas, [...] "grand"). Originally very lowly ranked, the office rose quickly in the hierarchy: by 899 he was placed immediately before or after the logothetēs tou dromou and ahead of various senior military and civil officials. He was also notable in not being classed with the other military commanders, whether of the themes or of the tagmata, but in the special class of military officials, the stratarchai, where he is listed second after the hetaireiarchēs, the commander of the imperial bodyguard. His title is still found in the Komnenian era, albeit as commander of the imperial escort squadron, and survived until the Palaiologan era, being listed in the 14th-century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos. The office of a deputy called topotērētēs is also mentioned for the Imperial Fleet, but his role is unclear from the sources. He may have held a post similar to that of a Port Admiral.

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1935, {{civilian}} {{employees of the}} Luftwaffe {{had been sent to}} fixed intercept stations of the German Army for training. A Luftwaffe officer, a technician and a civilian inspector who has been associated with the German Army Intelligence Service during World War I were transferred to the Luftwaffe Chi-Stelle. The two people canvassed for assistants among their old circle of acquaintances, former soldiers who had served in World War I as intercept technicians or Cryptanalysts. There numbers were no means sufficient for the task at hand. They consisted of people who at one time, either in civilian or military life, had received radio training or who were fluent in foreign languages. Among them were old soldiers, former <b>seamen,</b> <b>professional</b> travellers, adventurers and political refugees. In contrast to the Army, security measures taken in admitting people to the Agency were superficial, and a great number were found to be of questionable character. These trainees made training more difficult. Owning to their privileged position, they had a derogatory influence on the Luftwaffe Agency.|$|R

50|$|These Portuguese ships had guns {{of greater}} calibre, better {{artillery}} crews, and were better manned and better built.

50|$|The {{need for}} a Sailors’ Home had been identified:to provide for seamen frequenting the port of Liverpool, board, lodging and medical attendance, at a {{moderate}} charge; {{to protect them from}} imposition and extortion, and to encourage them to husband their hard-earned wages; to promote their moral, intellectual, and professional improvement; and to afford them the opportunity of receiving religious instruction. A reading-room, library, and savings bank will be attached to the institution; and with a view to securing to the able and well-conducted seamen a rate of wages proportionate to his merits, a registry of character will be kept. Among the ulterior objects in contemplation are schools for sea-apprentices, and the sons of seamen, with special regard to the care of children who have lost one or both their parents receiving religious instruction.As well as providing safe accommodation for an average of 200 men each night, the home provided a vital service, introducing <b>professional,</b> experienced merchant <b>seamen</b> to captains of safe seaworthy vessels. This combined with the expansions of its docks, greatly improving the reputation and efficiency of Liverpool as a merchant port.|$|R
25|$|Christchurch {{was popular}} with smugglers {{for a number}} of reasons: Firstly, the only land {{approaches}} to the town were across two bridges, and one of these was frequently out of use. The other could easily be blocked, perhaps by a herd of sheep or a heavy cart, giving the smugglers time for a leisurely escape. Secondly, it was close to the Cotentin Peninsula but not so close that a boat placed mid channel could observe both coasts. In good weather the coast of France is visible from the Kent coast but a vessel crossing to and from Dorset would be out of site for almost half the journey, and would therefore be able to claim it had come from another port or had been involved in the business of fishing. The beaches around Christchurch were sandy and gently sloping so boats could be run ashore without fear of damage. Although remote from its neighbours, cut off by heathland and forest, the roads inland were good; added to which the two rivers provided alternative routes for contraband, at a time when transport by water was faster and cheaper than overland movement of goods. Finally, there was the harbour itself. The entrance to which is a narrow channel, the Run, which was negotiable only with extreme care. Entering the harbour was made even more difficult by sandbanks that could shift overnight. To the smugglers, most of whom were <b>professional</b> and experienced <b>seamen</b> the harbour entrance was an open gate. But to the less skilled sailors on the revenue cutters, who had no local knowledge, the Run acted as 'a barrier that they feared to pass'.|$|R
40|$|The View {{from the}} Mast-Head: Antebellum American Sea Narratives and the Maritime Imagination” {{examines}} the first-person sea narratives {{of the federal}} and antebellum periods. Popular American sea narratives, both fictional and non-fictional, include for their readers details such as latitude and longitude notation, maps, and descriptions of ship labor. This narrative quantification provides {{a way for the}} texts to chart an American physical and imaginative presence on a landscape that, unlike most natural environments, cannot be marked or stabilized. A genre whose popularity with a landed readership continually increased between 1783 – 1860, sea writing has been marginalized in current critical discourse as “low” or rough, much as sailors themselves were typed. Yet sea narratives—which are continually engaged with contemporary crises of nation- and self-hood—describe a process of coming to imaginative mastery from a state of physical incompetence that productively speaks to larger issues in antebellum American literature and culture. In maritime literature, this process can find expression, for example, in the experience of shipwreck, which is incomprehensible to those lacking fluency in the mundane details of maritime life. Barbary captive Archibald Robbins explains, “To a seaman, the description of a shipwreck is familiar from his knowledge of a vessel, the tackle, and the nautical terms of sea-faring men; but by that portion of readers who are not thus acquainted, no adequate conception can be formed of the appalling horrors of such a scene. ” This methodology, by which the facts of nautical labor can anchor the subject {{in the face of what}} is not conceptually “familiar,” is used by sea narratives to articulate a vision of the world predicated on fluency with the material and the imaginative. ^ In stressing the value of experiential knowledge, sea narratives invest in another kind of materiality as well: the materiality of the printed text. Sailors were attentive to the conditions and requirements of textual publication. Even as sailor authors retained the <b>professional</b> status of <b>seamen,</b> they demonstrated a keen interest in the book trades, and negotiated their writerly position in a publication industry whose codes and expectations sailors both adopted and defied. ...|$|R

50|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, technical innovations and the disorganization of the French Navy wrought by the revolution had combined to give British ships a distinct superiority over the ships of the French and Spanish navies. Britain had a far larger ocean trade than any of her principal enemies, and a much bigger reserve of <b>professional</b> <b>seamen</b> from which to man her warships. Throughout the 18th century the French and, particularly, the Spanish navy suffered from serious manning difficulties and were often forced to complete the ships' crews with soldiers or landsmen.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) has {{its origins}} in the Register of Seamen, {{established}} in 1835 to identify men for naval service {{in the event of}} war, but just 400 volunteered for duty in the Crimean War in 1854 out of 250,000 on the Register. This led to a Royal Commission on Manning the Navy in 1858, which in turn led to the Naval Reserve Act of 1859. This established the RNR as a reserve of <b>professional</b> <b>seamen</b> from the British Merchant Navy and fishing fleets, who could be called upon during times of war to serve in the regular Royal Navy. The RNR was originally a reserve of seamen only, but in 1862 this was extended to include the recruitment and training of reserve officers. From its creation, RNR officers wore on their uniforms a unique and distinctive lace consisting of stripes of interwoven chain.|$|E

5000|$|Merchant seamen are civilians of {{both sexes}} who elect to work at sea, their working {{practice}} in 1939 had changed little in hundreds of years.

5000|$|The Sea Organization (often simply {{referred}} to as the [...] "Sea Org") was incorporated under the name 'Operational Transport Committee' in the United Kingdom in 1966 for legal maritime registration purposes. The Sea Org is an unincorporated fraternal religious order founded in 1967 by Hubbard as he embarked on a series of voyages around the Mediterranean Sea in a small fleet of ships staffed by Scientologists and hired <b>professional</b> <b>seamen.</b> Hubbard—formerly a lieutenant junior grade in the US Navy—bestowed the rank of [...] "commodore" [...] of the vessels upon himself. The crew who accompanied him on these voyages became the foundation of the Sea Organisation. The very first members of 'The Sea Project' (1966-67) were high-level trained staff and OTIII completions personally chosen by L. Ron Hubbard from Saint Hill Manor and overseas church missions. The purpose was to establish an effective base of operations for the OTC research voyages to assist LRH to verify his discoveries and research into past-lives. Hubbard was also keen {{to see if he could}} recover any deposits of treasure that he believed that he had hidden in dozens of locations around the Mediterranean region. Teams of divers and metal-detectorists were dispatched to remote locations to dig for these alleged deposits. There is evidence of some success in locating identified targets, but only two probable eye-witness testimonies of any artifacts being recovered. One from under a temple complex on Sicily and another from an underwater temple at Carthage. Witnesses have claimed to have seen small craft unloading gold bullion onto the 'Athena' vessel and later seen in Hubbard's personal hold aboard The Apollo Flag ship in 1968 by staff members.

40|$|The paper investigates {{conditions}} and {{circumstances of the}} occurrence of emergencies during ship exploitation. The concept and different forms of emergencies are defined while conditions of their occurrence are simulated, as well as possible modes of prevention of their occurrence or development. On {{the basis of the}} results of the investigation covering 240 <b>professional</b> <b>seamen</b> an appropriate organisational algorithm of participative ship management is defined as foundation for the application of the management algorithm in emergencies. On this basis the method of Risk and Hazard Assessment is applied. Also, the algorithm of Decision Making Process is derived from the related investigations. The proposed algorithm is not based only on the organisational presuppositions of participative management but also on complex human relationships as well as acting in stressful circumstances through all the phases of emergencies. The appropriate decision support system to help decision-makers during the emergencies is described.
