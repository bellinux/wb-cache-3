40|$|The recent {{establishment}} of <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> residencies at the University of Nevada School of Medicine has raised important questions about local priorities {{in the training}} of physicians to provide <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> for adults.

The University of Nevada has a singular opportunity to organize a strong <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> internal <b>medicine</b> residency, but national problems of internal medicine emphasis exist.
