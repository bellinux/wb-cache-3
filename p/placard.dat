Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally, in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication is also an offence.|$|E
50|$|Following the UN Model, the DOT divides {{regulated}} {{hazardous materials}} into nine classes, {{some of which}} are further subdivided. Hazardous materials in transportation must be <b>placarded</b> and have specified packaging and labelling. Some materials must always be <b>placarded,</b> others may only require <b>placarding</b> in certain circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{political}} <b>placards</b> and satiric caricatures {{were made}} during World War II. Well-known artists as H.Khaligov, I.Akhundov, A.Hajiyev and S.Sharifzade were authors of such politic <b>placards.</b>|$|R

5|$|Persons {{suspected}} of having sexual relations with non-Aryans were charged with Rassenschande (racial defilement) and tried in the regular courts. Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such cases was largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours, co-workers, or other informants. Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a <b>placard</b> around their necks detailing their crime. Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement, special courts were convened to allow {{the death penalty for}} some cases. From the end of 1935 through 1940, 1,911 people were convicted of Rassenschande. Over time, the law was extended to include non-sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting someone with a kiss or an embrace.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to speak or stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of {{an amendment to the}} Parks and Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner – no banner, film, photograph, <b>placard</b> or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy X-2 reintroduces the series' classic {{character}} class system (seen previously in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy Tactics) through {{the inclusion of}} dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch {{character class}}es, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere {{with the use of}} Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a <b>placard</b> featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{his father}} Charles V, Philip {{was very much}} opposed to the Protestant teachings of Martin Luther, John Calvin and the Anabaptists, which had gained many adherents in the Netherlands by the early 1560s. To {{suppress}} Protestantism he had promulgated extraordinary ordinances, called <b>placards,</b> that outlawed them and made them capital offenses. Because of their severity these <b>placards</b> caused growing opposition among the population, both Catholic and Protestant. Opposition, even among Catholics, was generated because the <b>placards</b> were seen as breaches of the constitutional privileges of the local authorities and the civil liberties of the people, like the Jus de non evocando, as enshrined in the [...] "Joyous Entry", {{the constitution of the}} Duchy of Brabant, to mention a prominent example. For that reason local authorities regularly protested against the <b>placards</b> and the way they were implemented in 1564 and later years. That these protests were systematically ignored and the <b>placards</b> stringently enforced only helped intensify the opposition.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{one hundred}} {{thousand}} people marched in Dink's Funeral to protest against his assassination, holding <b>placards</b> that said [...] "We are all Armenian" [...] and [...] "We are Hrant Dink" [...] in both Turkish, Kurdish and Armenian.(See funeral above.) Later, these <b>placards</b> were protested by the far-right MHP. The leader of MHP described the <b>placards</b> saying [...] "We are all Armenian" [...] as [...] "a freak show organized by {{those who do not}} participate in martyr funerals". On the other hand, a party council member of the main-opposition CHP, a member of Socialist International, said [...] "We became ashamed of being Turkish. I am Turkish and I protest the assassination. Maybe we should have carried the <b>placards</b> saying 'We are all Human' instead of 'We are all Armenians'. The <b>placards</b> that say [...] "assassin 301" [...] are also wrong. As long as {{we do not want to}} denigrate Turkishness, we cannot call 301 an assassin." ...|$|R

25|$|Hui women once {{employed}} foot binding, at {{the time}} a common practice across China. It was particularly prevalent in Gansu. The Dungan people, descendants of Hui from northwestern China who fled to Central Asia, also practised foot binding until 1948. However, in southern China, in Canton, James Legge encountered a mosque that had a <b>placard</b> denouncing footbinding, saying Islam did not allow it since it violated God's creation.|$|E

When assembled on stage the ladies represented the Italian Alps' beauty, strength, and poise.|$|E
25|$|Judging by {{the medals}} won, Luxembourg painter Jean Jacoby {{is the most}} {{successful}} Olympic artist, winning the gold medal for his 1924 painting Étude de Sport, and for his drawing Rugby in 1928. Swiss artist Alex Diggelmann won three medals, a gold one in 1936 (for his poster Arosa I <b>Placard),</b> and a silver and a bronze in the 1948 applied arts & crafts class, both with commercial posters. Danish writer Josef Petersen won a silver medal on three occasions: in 1924, 1932, and 1948.|$|E
25|$|A <b>placard</b> {{is usually}} {{placed in a}} lower corner of the playfield. It may simply show pricing information, but should also show {{critical}} details about special scoring techniques. This information is vital to achieving higher scores; it typically describes {{a series of events}} that must take place (e.g., shoot right ramp and left drop targets to light 'extra ball' rollover). Learning these details makes the game more fun and challenging. With practice — and a machine in good operating condition — a player can often achieve specific targets and higher scores and trigger exciting events.|$|E

25|$|The class {{graduates}} {{participate in}} an Ivy Day which installs a granite <b>placard</b> {{onto one of the}} academic or residential buildings on campus. They serve {{as a symbol of the}} class and their respective history both academically and socially. Some classes donate to the college, in the form gates, facades, and door outlines, by inscribing or creating their own version of symbolic icons of the college's seal or other prominent insignia. This usually occurs on graduation day, but may occur on later dates with alumni returning to the campus. This tradition is shared with the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University. On Ivy Day, members of Phi Beta Kappa are announced.|$|E
25|$|Anti-military protest {{took place}} in {{dramatic}} form at Colorado State from 1968–70. On March 5, 1968, several hundred students and faculty with anti-war sentiments marched to Fort Collins' downtown War Memorial and wiped blood on a <b>placard</b> tied to the memorial. Hecklers and blockaders created such a disturbance that police had to disperse the non-marchers. In May, 1970, as campus peace activists held {{the second day of}} a student strike in the gymnasium in response to the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the student deaths at Kent State University, one or more arsonists set Old Main ablaze, destroying the 92-year-old cornerstone of Colorado State.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies. This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International Container Office BIC agreed to only issue ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to only issue ownership reporting marks for swap bodies ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal ISO containers and intermodal swap bodies must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming <b>placard.</b>|$|E
