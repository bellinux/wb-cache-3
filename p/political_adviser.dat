40|$|The {{tension between}} {{political}} advisors and civil servants {{is inherent in}} democratic administrative structures. How do countries define appropriate roles for <b>political</b> <b>advisers</b> and civil servants as rooted in their history? What regulations govern their respective functions? How do <b>political</b> <b>advisers</b> and civil servants cooperate? What are points of contention and how are disagreements resolved? Are there national innovations, also with regard to training? The aim of this questionnaire-based study is to present a variety of national traditions regarding the roles and responsibilities of <b>political</b> <b>advisers</b> and civil servants, {{as well as the}} institutional arrangements put into place to mediate inbuilt sources of conflict. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{defining}} appropriate {{roles for}} <b>political</b> <b>advisers</b> {{is a highly}} relevant topic in most democracies and especially in EU NMS, as well as candidate and CARDS countries today, surprisingly little comparative information exists. To fill this gap, in Autumn 2005, the Sigma Programme launched a questionnaire-based study to collect country experience, {{as well as a}} series of seminars on the topic. The first part of this publication provides an overview on the role of <b>political</b> <b>advisers</b> and their relationship with civil servants in OECD countries.

By this time, Minh's junta had been replaced in a 1964 January coup by Khánh.

5|$|The {{inconclusive}} {{report was}} the subject of bitter and personal debate among Kennedy's senior advisers. Various courses of action towards Vietnam were discussed, such as fostering a regime change or taking a series of selective measures designed to cripple the influence of Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's brother and chief <b>political</b> <b>adviser.</b> Nhu and his wife Madame Ngô Đình Nhu were seen as the major causes of the political problems in South Vietnam. The inconclusive result of Krulak and Mendenhall's expedition resulted in a follow-up mission, the McNamara–Taylor mission.|$|E
5|$|O'Malley {{obtained}} commitments {{from over}} 80 prospective Park Grill investors, {{including some of}} Mayor Daley's friends and neighbors. Each share of the restaurant cost investors $200,000. Among the investors are Daley's friend Fred Barbara, a nephew of the late Chicago Alderman Fred Roti. Barbara has ties to the Hired Truck Program scandal and the blue bag recycling controversy. Other investors include relatives of Daley's <b>political</b> <b>adviser</b> Timothy Degnan, two neighbors of the mayor, Ray Chin, an O'Hare Airport contractor, and Rick Simon, a controversial figure who runs a janitorial business {{and sits on the}} board of the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau. Also among the investors was Daley's cousin Theresa E. Mintle, then the Chicago Transit Authority’s director of governmental affairs and former congressman Morgan F. Murphy, who has had business dealings with convicted labor union official John Serpico. Among the vendors for Park Grill was an architectural metal company owned by the son of then Chicago Alderman Burton Natarus (42nd).|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{hoped that}} he would be a {{compromise}} candidate for the presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, he sent two of his sons and his chief <b>political</b> <b>adviser</b> to represent his interests in the backroom deal-making. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator John Bell running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln. The election of Lincoln, known to be against the spread of slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.|$|E
5|$|Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on 30 January 1828 in the Merina village of Ilafy, one of the twelve sacred hills of Imerina, into a family of statesmen. His father, Rainiharo, was a {{high-ranking}} military officer and a deeply influential conservative <b>political</b> <b>adviser</b> to the reigning monarch, Queen Ranavalona I, {{at the time that}} his wife, Rabodomiarana (daughter of Ramamonjy), gave birth to Rainilaiarivony. Five years later Rainiharo was promoted to the position of Prime Minister, a role he retained from 1833 until his death in 1852. During his tenure as Prime Minister, Rainiharo was chosen by the queen to become her consort, but he retained Rabodomiarana as his wife according to local customs that allowed polygamy. Rainilaiarivony's paternal grandfather, Andriatsilavo, had likewise been a privileged adviser to the great King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810). Rainilaiarivony and his relatives issued from the Andafiavaratra family clan of Ilafy who, alongside the Andrefandrova clan of Ambohimanga, constituted the two most influential hova (commoner) families in the 19th-century Kingdom of Imerina. The majority of political positions not assigned to andriana (nobles) were held by members of these two families.|$|E
5|$|The February 1852 {{death of}} Prime Minister Rainiharo left the queen without her consort, long-time <b>political</b> <b>adviser</b> and {{military}} Commander-in-Chief. She consequently awarded Rainilaiarivony a double promotion to Twelfth Honor ten days afterward, {{in preparation for}} an increase in military and political responsibilities. Shortly thereafter the queen expressed romantic interest in Rainilaiarivony and proposed that he assume the former role of his father as prince consort and Prime Minister. The young man refused on the double basis of their age difference, the queen being forty years his senior, as well as the perceived impropriety of becoming intimate with his father's former lover. Ranavalona continued to harbor feelings for him throughout her lifetime but she did not express resentment over his refusal to reciprocate them and went on to take another high-ranking official as consort: Rainijohary, who was jointly awarded the role of Prime Minister along with the new Commander-in-Chief, Rainivoninahitriniony. Within a year the queen had assigned the 24-year-old Rainilaiarivony to his first position of responsibility within the military, and promoted him to Royal Secretary, keeper of the Royal Seal, and supervisor to the Royal Treasurer.|$|E

50|$|In August and September, the UN {{conducted}} two {{operations to}} arrest and repatriate mercenary soldiers and the Belgian <b>political</b> <b>advisers</b> from Katanga by military force, deeming that such foreigners were the backbone behind the regime. The first operation {{was carried out}} by Indian UNF troops, who began rounding up mercenaries at 5am, culminating in the bloodless capture of nearly 400 men. Not a single shot had been fired. Although Belgium's consul in Katanga was ordered to deport the remaining Belgian nationals, including <b>political</b> <b>advisers,</b> he countered that he could only exercise legal authority over those who were official staff affiliated with his nation's government or military.|$|R

5|$|Piccadilly {{was named}} Portugal Street in 1663 after Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II. Its {{importance}} to traffic increased after an earlier road from Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner {{was closed to}} allow the creation of Green Park in 1668. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, Charles II encouraged the development of Portugal Street and the area to the north (Mayfair)and they became fashionable residential localities. Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of the street. Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and close <b>political</b> <b>adviser</b> to the king, purchased land for a house; Clarendon House (now the location of Albemarle Street) was built in 1664, and the earl sold the surplus land partly to Sir John Denham, who built what later became Burlington House. Denham chose the location because {{it was on the}} outskirts of London surrounded by fields. The house was first used to house the poor, before being reconstructed by the third Earl of Burlington in 1718. Berkeley House was constructed around the same time as Clarendon House. It was destroyed by a fire in 1733, and rebuilt as Devonshire House in 1737 by William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire, and was subsequently used as the headquarters for the Whig party. Devonshire House survived until 1921, before being sold for redevelopment by Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire for £1 million. Burlington House has since been home to the Royal Academy of Arts, the Geological Society of London, the Linnean Society of London, the Royal Astronomical Society, the British Astronomical Association, the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Zahir had an {{aide who}} jointly {{served in the}} {{capacity}} of mudabbir (manager) and wazir (vizier) to assist him throughout much of his rule in matters of finance and correspondence. This official {{had always been a}} Melkite (local Greek Catholic). His first wazir was Yusuf al-Arqash, followed by Yusuf Qassis in 1749. Qassis continued in this role until the early 1760s when he was arrested for attempting to smuggle wealth he had accumulated during his service to Malta. He was succeeded by Ibrahim Sabbagh, who had served as a personal physician for Zahir in 1757 when he replaced Zahir's longtime physician Sulayman Suwwan. Suwwan was a local Greek Orthodox Christian and when he failed to properly treat Zahir during a serious illness in 1757, Qassis used the opportunity to replace him with Sabbagh, a friend and fellow Melkite. Sabbagh became the most influential figure in Zahir's administration, particularly as Zahir grew old. This caused consternation among Zahir's sons as they viewed Sabbagh to be a barrier between them and their father and an impediment to their growing power in Zahir's territory. Sabbagh was able to gain increased influence with Zahir largely because of the wealth he amassed through his integral role in managing Zahir's cotton monopoly. Much of this wealth was acquired through Sabbagh's own deals where he would purchase cotton and other cash crops from the local farmers and sell them to the European merchants in the Syria's coastal cities and to his Melkite partners in Damietta, Egypt. Sabbagh served other important roles as well, including as Zahir's <b>political</b> <b>adviser,</b> main administrator and chief representative with European merchants and Ottoman provincial and imperial officials.|$|E
