40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} study is to investigate how teachers and students perceive <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> in the English subject in upper secondary school. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with nine vocational students, three teachers who teach English at vocational education programs and observations of three English classes. The study examines the needs of, and the challenges teachers and students face {{in the implementation of}} <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> in the teaching. The starting point of the study is the FYR-project and its objective to improve <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> and the relevance of the common core subjects in vocational education programs. The findings show that both students and teachers are positive towards <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation,</b> but that they experience a number of problems in its implementation. For students, the problem is primarily that the <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> is not perceived as authentic. They find that the <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> they have had in English does not always match the expectations they have for their future jobs. The <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> is therefore of little relevance to the students. For the teachers, there are two main problems with <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation.</b> First, the teachers find {{that they do not have}} sufficient competence in the students’ specializations to make their teaching authentic, a finding that matches the students’ experiences. In addition, their school made no attempts to improve the vocational competence of the teachers through courses, or by letting them build experience by teaching the same program over several years. Next, conflicting goals in the vocational education undermine the implementation of <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation.</b> Central parts of the English subject, such as the written exam, do not include <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation.</b> In this way, teaching must focus on a more general vocational competence, instead of being tailored to each profession. To sum up, the teachers' lack of vocational competence and the contradictory goals they are expected to follow results in a <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> that has little relevance for the students. This study ends by discussing issues important for the successful implementation of <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> and the FYR initiative...|$|R

40|$|A {{vocational}} {{decision is}} one of the most important decisions that an individual must make in a lifetime. Deciding on further education or choosing one's profession depends on many factors. In this master's thesis we introduced and analyzed factors that influence a child/adolescent's vocational decision. We were interested in whether or not there exist any differences between pupils with special needs and those without special needs. The theoretical part of the thesis introduces a history of <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation,</b> professional terminology, activities and phases of <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation,</b> theories of choosing one's profession and characteristics and education of children with special needs. Because school represents one of the important factors of a successful <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation,</b> the empirical part researched the pupils' satisfaction with school counseling work concerning vocational information and counseling. We also researched how pupils get the majority of information about profession and further education and how involved they are themselves in the process of information gathering. We also wanted to find out how pupils in the ninth grade make their decision about further schooling and in which secondary school programs they mostly enroll in. When making their vocational decisions, pupils mostly consider their own wishes, interests and abilities. They receive the majority of information regarding their vocational field from their parents, school counselors, and on the internet. Although we found out that the majority of pupils are satisfied with vocational information and counseling in elementary school, there is nevertheless still a lot to be done regarding this subject. We suggest that school counselors devote more of their time for <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> which could be done by relieving them of administrative work, with introducing lessons on <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> in the school curriculum, with vocational education at different school subjects, with better cooperation with institutions connected with professions, etc. Furthermore, in our opinion, a vocational field should be included in individual programs for pupils with special needs; at least starting from grade six. ...|$|R

This dissertation aims to contribute to filling this research gap. Based on a design research study it is argued how ‘communities of learners for vocational orientation’ can be fostered and lead to the enhancement of student engagement {{in the early years of}} Dutch initial vocational education. Further research is recommended to refine and consolidate the community of learners model, including the heuristics for the design of learning environments that foster such communities of learners.

Guided by the literature, {{the focus was on}} the <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> to learning and orientations to learning were further investigated within the <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> based on orientations developed for part-time students found in the literature. In addition, it was investigated whether students' expectations have been met and if they were satisfied with the college experience. Lastly, the study examined the relevance of college learning to the world of work and the contribution it made to the career development of learners in a globalising world. The research shows that part-time students enrol at FET colleges predominantly for vocational reasons and the majority of the students were enrolled in order to advance their careers and associated with a <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> to learning. However, it emerged that reasons for learning within the <b>vocational</b> <b>orientation</b> to learning are often multi-faceted and complex. The most important findings are 3 new learning orientations for part-time students that were identified: 'education for a qualification', 'education for adults who previously made the wrong choice' and 'education for adults as a model for their children'. Furthermore, the findings indicate that learners were satisfied with the programme they were enrolled in because they believed that the qualification would enable them to achieve their vocational aims which were primarily to find a new job, to be promoted and to increase their income.
