State and local officials completed an investigation into Jones-Kelley's order, concluding that the searches were improper. On December 17, 2008, Jones-Kelley resigned. In response to the event, Republican Ohio state representative Shannon Jones sponsored House Bill 648, which mandates civil and criminal <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>improper</b> access of personal information on state databases.

40|$|Transfer pricing {{is an area}} {{of major}} concern for tax administrations. The growth of {{multinational}} enterprises and an increase in cross border transactions has highlighted the significance of a regulated transfer pricing system. However, this regulated system imposes high <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>improper</b> transfer pricing. To reduce the risk of high transfer pricing penalties, multinational enterprises have resorted to advance pricing agreements with tax administrations. These agreements, though, are not a simple solution {{to reduce the risk of}} penalties. The process of executing these agreements carries with it the major drawback of information disclosure. Given this drawback, the APA programs in the United States and Canada, as they stand today, are not long term solutions to transfer pricing disputes which arise out of improper transfer pricing or improper adoption of transfer price determination methods...|$|R

Simulation software with real-time response is often used in gaming, but it also has important industrial applications. When the <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>improper</b> operation is costly, such as airplane pilots, nuclear power plant operators, or chemical plant operators, a mock up of the actual control panel is connected to a real-time simulation of the physical response, giving valuable training experience without fear of a disastrous outcome.|$|R

40|$|Concentrating optics {{generally}} produce spatially and spectrally non-uniform optical profiles {{across the}} multijunction solar cells (MJSC) typically used in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems, degrading fill factors and thereby reducing module efficiencies. These effects {{may be more}} pronounced if the primary-to-receiver working distance is sub-optimal and if the system does not track the sun accurately. We integrate ray tracing with a distributed equivalent circuit model to simulate {{the performance of a}} four-junction solar cell under a Fresnel-lens-based CPV system of 1250 X geometric concentration. The impacts on system efficiency of varying both the primary-to-receiver working distance as well as the tracking accuracy are evaluated. Our results indicate a relative enhancement of 6. 67 % when we optimize the working distance based on an integrated systems approach using the full optical distribution as an input to a 2 -D distributed equivalent circuit model of the MJSC, as opposed to a uniform profile 1 -D treatment. With a more optimized system, we find a relative reduction in efficiency of 10. 7 % for a tracking error of 1 º, with the <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>improper</b> tracking increasing <b>for</b> sub-optimal primary-to-receiver working distances...|$|R

40|$|When {{reasoning}} about reasoning, one often {{needs to}} carry out some proof steps within a different theory from the current one and then to lift the conclusions back into the original theory. The deductive rules required {{to carry out}} these steps involve either reflection principles or some other notion of proof in context. Reflection principles have to be carefully restricted {{in order to avoid}} paradoxes. Such restrictions however limit significantly their usefulness and also defeat intuition while building proofs in context. Standard formulations of the reflection rules also assume explicit knowledge of the theory one reasons about. This is not always the case for theories representing agents or for theories which refer to each other, as those required for expressing common knowledge.
