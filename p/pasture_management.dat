The ABBA continued to grow during the 1960s and 1970s. Its headquarters, Brahman House, Rockhampton (the former AMP Building), was officially opened on 20 August 1971 by the Association's patron Mr Edgar Hudgins of Hudgins Ranch, Texas, USA; making it the first beef cattle breed association in Australia to own its own building. By 1971 there were 26,900 purebred Brahmans and 57,800 Appendix registered Brahmans in Australia. During the early 1970s the ABBA's membership increased dramatically, exceeding 900 in 1972. With the increase in membership, cattle registration also increased dramatically, which in turn increased the genetic supply available to the commercial industry. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) research underpinned the growth by demonstrating the biological basis for the Brahmans adaption.|$|E
500|$|Forage {{conversion}} to milk with Shetland ewes is excellent, {{second only to}} Lleyn ewes in the UK. Because of the Shetland ewe's forage conversion efficiency, lamb growth is fast. A good Shetland ewe on adequate forage can wean off 150% of her body weight in purebred twins by fall. Some ewes wean singles nearly as big as themselves. A heavier Shetland ewe at 80 lbs (36 kg) can wean 60 lb (27 kg) purebred twins. What makes the Shetland ewe an optimal maternal base for grassfed lamb production is her prowess in producing hybrid market lambs: take the same ewe and breed her to, for example, a Leicester, Texel, Charollais or Berrichon ram, and keep her on the same <b>pasture</b> <b>management</b> system. In some flocks, ewes can wean off pairs of 90 lb (40 kg) twins at only 120-150 days old- each crossbred lamb weighing more than their dam.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{interactions}} between cattle husbandry, <b>pastures</b> <b>management</b> and arthropods biodiversity in the summer farms of Trento province (Italian Alps). Twenty-one summer farms used by dairy cattle were sampled during the summer 2012. Data collected were: utilized pasture surface (UPS, georeferenced on GIS), herd size and composition (breed and livestock categories), supplementary feeding (quantity and quality), milk yield and quality. In addition, in each pasture butterflies and grasshoppers were sampled and counted, and weed encroachment was estimated {{at the end of}} the summer season. Average UPS was 82. 8 ha (SD= 70. 5), average elevation 1, 687 m asl (SD= 307) and average slope 16. 7 Â° (SD= 4. 6). The average herd size was 65 Livestock Units (LU) (SD= 34), with a prevalence of Brown Swiss and Simmental breeds. All the farms with cows on milk used supplementary feeding, with an average of 4. 0 kg of concentrates/cow per day (SD= 1. 2). The stocking rates varied widely from 0. 4 to 2. 1 LU/ha (average: 1. 1 LU/ha). The amount of supplementary feeding was positively correlated with milk yield; for both these variables no correlations were found with stocking rate, weed encroachment and insect biodiversity indexes. Pastures used only by heifers showed higher levels of weed encroachment than those used by dairy cows. Insect biodiversity indexes were weakly influenced by differences in average stocking rate and weed encroachment between pastures, but within pastures increased with increasing distance from the farms buildings. In conclusion, livestock productivity seems more supported by supplementary feeding than by <b>pastures</b> <b>management</b> and therefore cannot be directly related to pastures conservation, as indexed by weed encroachment, and to insect biodiversity...|$|R

We also manage cattle (B. taurus) grazing {{during the growing}} season in separate, but adjacent <b>pastures.</b> <b>Management</b> reflects the divergent evolution of bison and cattle with their respective human cultures and landscapes. Bison exhibit a stronger preference for the perennial grasses that form the prairie matrix, and they are strongly attracted to open landscapes {{during the growing season}}. Cattle include more forbs in their diet, and they use wooded areas and riparian zones more intensively. At similar annual stocking rates, the amount of grass remaining {{at the start of the}} dormant season is higher under year-long bison grazing compared to growing season cattle grazing. There are inherent differences between bison and cattle, suggesting that they be managed differently. Under our respective management regimes, bison are less productive than cattle, but they require less processed feed and labor inputs. We recommend that the focus of mixed prairie conservation be on developing ecologically sound goals and practices for grazing management, rather than on whether bison or cattle are more appropriate grazers...|$|R
40|$|Different {{species of}} helminths cause {{intestinal}} infections which may potentially compromise {{health and welfare}} of horses. The most prevalent are nematodes belonging to the Strongylinae and Cyathostominae subfamilies and Parascaris equorum, and the tapeworm Anoplocephala perfoliata. Hence, knowledge of the diffusion of these parasites is crucial in horse operations for reliable worm control programs. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the presence of common horse endoparasites in the Military Riding Operation of Montelibretti and the Army's Veterinary Operation of Grosseto, throughout three different copromicroscopic techniques. Faecal samples from 238 horses were examined and animal details were registered in a questionnaire. The results showed a high presence of Strongylid infections (55 %), while other parasites were found with lower prevalence (P. equorum, 2. 5 %; A. perfoliata, 10. 5 %). These results demonstrated that all major horse helminthes were present in the examined stables, thus potentially causing relevant diseases. Also, it was showed that the occurrence of different horse parasites should be evaluated with suitable copromicroscopic methods. In fact, a reliable knowledge on the helminth prevalence would allow appropriate effective worm control programs. Such an approach, along with <b>pasture</b> <b>managements,</b> would improve health, welfare and performances of horses kept in these important Military Operations and in horse stables in general...|$|R

40|$|The {{ancient city}} of Sagalassos {{is located on}} the {{southern}} slope of the Taurus mountains, about 100 km north of present-day Antalya (Turkey). The area was occupied from Classical-Hellenistic times to the mid-Byzantine period. Nowadays, the surroundings of Sagalassos are quite degraded due to intensive overgrazing, resulting in a short open vegetation. However, the past environment was more wooded, the climate was warmer and more humid and the main river of the nearby valley beneath probably held more water at least up to the late Roman period. Throughout the occupation, the animal economy relied mainly on husbandry with cattle, sheep, goat, pig and chicken providing most of the animal proteins. The analysis of the carbon and nitrogen isotope composition in bone collagen from more than 400 animal bone samples from the nearby Classical/Hellenistic site of DÃ¼zen Tepe and from Sagalassos (Roman to mid-Byzantine periods) revealed diachronic and specific variations in the diet of cattle, ovicaprines and pigs, likely reflecting changes in husbandry practices and landscape use. To investigate livestock diet at a seasonal scale, sequential Î´ 18 O and Î´ 13 C analyses are being performed on pig, cattle and ovicaprines teeth, targeting the Early Byzantine period, during which millet (a C 4 plant) appears in the botanical records and could have been used as fodder.
