500|$|For Underwood's plan to work, however, Claire has {{to pardon}} him and Stamper, which would damage her {{credibility}} with the public. Claire promises him that she will grant the pardons, but {{makes no mention of}} them during her first address to the nation as president. Angered, Underwood calls her several times, but each time he gets her voicemail, causing him to worry that she has abandoned him. He breaks the fourth wall and says, [...] "If she doesn't <b>pardon</b> <b>me,</b> I'll kill her." ...|$|E

500|$|Cooper {{described}} himself as [...] "a truly terrible public speaker" [...] and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during {{his career in the}} Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him [...] "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?" [...] Cooper responded, [...] "If you'll <b>pardon</b> <b>me,</b> I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best." ...|$|E

2500|$|Weeks {{before the}} April 2006 {{legislative}} election, the Democrat Party-led opposition and the People's Alliance for Democracy petitioned Bhumibol {{to appoint a}} replacement prime minister and cabinet.

2500|$|Opposition to the TRT {{government}} rose in Bangkok after Thaksin's family {{announced their}} tax-free sale of their 49.6% stake in Shin Corp to Temasek for almost 73.3 billion Baht on January 23, 2006. The People's Alliance for Democracy {{began a series}} of anti-government protests. Several Democrat Party leaders also joined the PAD, which accused Thaksin of disloyalty to the throne and asked King Bhumibol to appoint a replacement Prime Minister. Thaksin Shinawatra dissolved the House of Representatives on February 24, 2006 and called for an election. On March 24, 2006, Abhisit Vejjajiva publicly backed the People's Alliance for Democracy's call for a royally-appointed government. Bhumibol, in a speech on 26 April 2006, responded, [...] "Asking for a Royally-appointed prime minister is undemocratic. It is, <b>pardon</b> <b>me,</b> a mess. It is irrational".|$|E
2500|$|Rav Bibi bar Abaye {{taught that}} {{on the eve of}} the Day of Atonement, a person should confess saying: [...] "I confess all the evil I have done before You; I stood in the way of evil; and as for all the evil I have done, I shall no more do the like; may it be Your will, O Lord my God, that You should <b>pardon</b> <b>me</b> for all my iniquities, and forgive me for all my transgressions, and grant me atonement for all my sins." [...] This is {{indicated}} by [...] which says, [...] "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts." [...] Rabbi Isaac compared it to a person fitting together two boards, joining them one to another. And Rabbi Jose ben Hanina compared it to a person fitting together two bed-legs, joining them one to another. (This harmoniously does a person become joined to God when the person genuinely repents.) ...|$|E

And I'm sure that, after you hear our first broadcast, you're going to say that show was impossible. (Laughter) Oh, no, that doesn't sound quite right, does it? (Laughter) But NBC says nothing is impossible. All it takes is courage, vision, and a king-sized bundle of dough. Each week, there will be comedy, drama, music, all performed by the biggest stars of the time. Of course, darlings, now and then a clinker may sneak in, but we're going to try-- ...|$|E
2500|$|Gates {{approved}} the address in advance. Alexander Hamilton also urged {{the army to}} take action against Congress. A second address appeared on the 12th that tried to co-opt Washington into the conspiracy. Washington moved quickly to quell the impending mutiny by calling an officers' meeting on 15 March. He also notified Congress that it needed to act soon on the army's grievances. At the officers' meeting Washington appealed to his audience not to carry out, [...] "any measures which, viewed in the calm light of reason, will lessen the dignity and sully the glory you have hitherto maintained." [...] At the end of his speech he took out a letter to read. Unable to read it, he took out his spectacles and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you must <b>pardon</b> <b>me.</b> I have grown gray in your service and now find myself growing blind". Some of his officers were reduced to tears. In a unanimous vote, the officers expressed confidence in Congress and repudiated the Newburgh Addresses. On 22 March Congress voted to adopt the compensation plan which the officers then accepted.|$|E

5000|$|Upon hearing Yuan Shao's defeat, {{the warden}} on the prison thought that Yuan {{will come to}} his senses and free Tian {{because he had been}} correct. However, Tian said [...] "The Imperial Protector (Yuan Shao) appears liberal on the outside but is small-minded and {{insecure}} on the inside; he is jealous and forgetful of honest advice. Had he been victorious, he might have <b>pardoned</b> <b>me.</b> Now that he has been defeated and put to shame, I do not hope to live." [...] Yet again, he was correct. When Yuan returned, he was told by another advisor Pang Ji (who disliked Tian) that Tian had been laughing at Yuan's defeat and overly prideful of his predictions earlier. Yuan was furious and ordered Tian to be executed. Tian was told of his fate and chose to commit suicide.|$|R
