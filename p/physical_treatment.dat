25|$|While a {{high level}} of {{testosterone}} is often associated with an increase in aggression, this is not a noticeable effect in most trans men. HRT doses of testosterone are much lower than the typical doses taken by steroid-using athletes, and create testosterone levels comparable to those of most cisgender men. These levels of testosterone have not been proven to cause more aggression than comparable levels of estrogen. It is assumed that the effect of the start of <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> is such a relief, and decreases pre-existing aggression so much, that the overall level of aggression actually decreases.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Bourne {{published}} {{a paper on}} increasing disillusionment in the psychiatric literature about insulin coma therapy for schizophrenia. He suggested there were several reasons why it had received almost universal uncritical acceptance by reviews and textbooks for several decades despite the occasional disquieting negative finding, including that by the 1930s when it all started schizophrenics were considered inherently unable to engage in psychotherapy, and ICT [...] "provided a personal approach to the schizophrenic, suitably disguised as a <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> so as to slip past the prejudices of the age." ...|$|E

Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority.

As she gained practical skills in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, she combined <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> of physical diseases with holistic methods centered on [...] "spiritual healing." [...] She became well known for her healing powers involving practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones. She combined these elements with a theological notion ultimately derived from Genesis: all things put on earth are for the use of humans. In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.|$|E

60|$|Guesses at the undiscovered must {{necessarily}} be vague, but my anticipations {{fall into two}} groups, and first I am disposed to expect a great systematic increment in individual human power. We probably have no suspicion as yet {{of what may be}} done with the human body and mind by way of enhancing its effectiveness I remember talking to the late Sir Michael Foster upon the possibilities of modern surgery, and how he confessed that he did not dare for his reputation's sake tell ordinary people the things he believed would some day become matter-of-fact operations. In that respect I think he spoke for very many of his colleagues. It is already possible to remove almost any portion of the human body, including, if needful, large sections of the brain; it is possible to graft living flesh on living flesh, make new connections, mould, displace, and rearrange. It is also not impossible to provoke local hypertrophy, and not only by knife and <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> but by the subtler methods of hypnotism, profound changes can be wrought in the essential structure of a human being. If only our knowledge of function and value were at all adequate, we could correct and develop ourselves in the most extraordinary way. Our knowledge is not adequate, but it may not always remain inadequate.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Mitchell rose convulsively {{and took}} a step towards his persecutor, {{breathing}} noisily through the criticised organ. He was a chivalrous man, a warm admirer of the sex, but he was conscious of a wish that it was in his power to give Mary what he would have described as [...] "hers." [...] She was one of the parlour-maids, a homely woman with a hard eye, and it was part of his grievance against her that his Maggie, alias Celestine, Mrs. Pett's maid, had formed an enthusiastic friendship with her. He had no evidence to go on, but he suspected Mary of using her influence with Celestine to urge the suit of his leading rival for the latter's hand, Biggs the chauffeur. He disliked Mary intensely, even on general grounds. Ogden's revelation added fuel to his aversion. For a moment he toyed with the fascinating thought of relieving his feelings by spanking the boy, but restrained himself reluctantly at the thought of the inevitable ruin which would ensue. He had been an inmate of the house long enough to know, with a completeness which would have embarrassed that gentleman, what a cipher Mr. Pett was in the home and how little his championship would avail {{in the event of a}} clash with Mrs. Pett. And to give Ogden that <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> which should long since have formed the main plank in the platform of his education would be to invite her wrath as nothing else could. He checked himself, and reached out for the skipping-rope, hoping to ease his mind by further exercise.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical insufflation– exsufflation {{improves}} {{outcomes for}} neuromuscular disease patients with respiratory tract infections. Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2005; 84 : 83 – 88. Objectives: The efficacy of mechanical insufflation– exsufflation, {{in addition to}} standard chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments,</b> was investigated as a first-line intervention for patients with neuromuscular diseases with respiratory tract infections and airway mucous encumbrance. Design: The short-term outcomes of 11 consecutive neuromuscular disease patients with respiratory tract infections and tracheobronchial mucous encumbrance who were administered mechanical insufflation– exsufflation and conventional chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> in an intensive care unit were compared with the outcomes of 16 historical matched controls who had received chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> alone. Treatment failure {{was defined as the}} need for cricothyroid “minitracheostomy” or endotracheal intubation, despite treatment. The number of subjects administered bronchoscopy-assisted aspiration during the hospital stay was also compared. Results: Treatment failure was significantly lower (P 0. 05) in the mechanical insufflation– exsufflation group than in the conventional chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> group (2 / 11 vs. 10 / 16 cases). The use of bronchoscopy-assisted aspiration was similar in the two groups (5 / 11 vs. 6 / 16 cases). Mechanical insufflation– exsufflation did not produce serious side effects and was well tolerated by all subjects. Conclusions: Provision of mechanical insufflation– exsufflation in combination with standard chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> may improve the management of airway mucous encumbrance in neuromyopathic patients; its use {{should be included in the}} noninvasive approach to treatment of respiratory tract infections with impaired mucous clearance...|$|R

30|$|High {{temperature}} (above 100  °C) companied {{with appropriate}} irradiation or microwave treatment showed excellent {{performance on the}} shelf-life extension of CSB. However, the greatly extended shelf life was mainly ascribed to the inhibited microbial growth in CSB. Increasing hardness and taste variation were observed with the prolonging of storage time. Different from irradiation or microwave treatment, photon treatment was supposed to prolong the shelf life of CSB due to its anti-staling activity, but much faster microbial growth occurred during storage comparing to irradiation or microwave treatment. Because the limitation of different <b>physical</b> <b>treatments,</b> composite <b>treatments</b> or <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> combined with food additives should be considered for the shelf-life extension of CSB.|$|R
