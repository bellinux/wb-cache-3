50|$|A {{sound wave}} propagates through a {{material}} as a localized pressure change. Increasing {{the pressure of}} a gas or fluid increases its local temperature. The local speed of sound in a compressible material increases with temperature; as a result, the wave travels faster during the high pressure phase of the oscillation than during the lower pressure phase. This affects the wave's frequency structure; for example, in an initially <b>plane</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>wave</b> of a single frequency, the peaks of the wave travel faster than the troughs, and the pulse becomes cumulatively more like a sawtooth wave. In other words, the wave self-distorts. In doing so, other frequency components are introduced, which can be described by the Fourier series. This phenomenon is characteristic of a non-linear system, since a linear acoustic system responds only to the driving frequency. This always occurs but the effects of geometric spreading and of absorption usually overcome the self distortion, so linear behavior usually prevails and nonlinear acoustic propagation occurs only for very large amplitudes and only near the source.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to the {{modeling}} of dynamic triggering of earthquakes by a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>wave.</b> I consider a 2 D antiplane finite fault of length L under a linear slip‐dependent friction law, characterized by a nondimensional weakening parameter β. The finite fault is perturbed by an incident <b>sinusoidal</b> stress <b>wave</b> of wavelength λ and amplitude a. The positive pulse of the wave loads the fault and promotes the instability, while the negative pulse tends to heal the initiation process that may lead to the rupture. The occurrence of triggering depends on the balance between the loading terms and the intrinsic mechanics of the fault. Both amplitude and frequency exert a clock advance effect on the triggering. A threshold in frequency for the incident wave to trigger the rupture is revealed, which depends on the non‐dimensional weakening parameter β and separates a nontriggering domain with stable slip from a triggering domain with unstable slip...|$|R

40|$|The {{passage of}} a {{columnar}} vortex broadside through a shock is investigated. This has been suggested as a crude, but deterministic, model of the generation of 'shock noise' by the turbulence in supersonic jets. The vortex is decomposed by Fourier transform into <b>plane</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> shear <b>waves</b> disposed with radial symmetry. The plane sound waves produced by each shear wave/shock interaction are recombined in the Fourier integral. The waves possess an envelope that is essentially a growing cylindrical sound wave centered at the transmitted vortex. The pressure jump across the nominal radius R = ct attenuates with time as 1 /(square root of R) and varies around the arc in an antisymmetric fashion resembling a quadrupole field. Very good agreement, except near the shock, is found with the antisymmetric component of reported interferometric measurements in a shock tube. Beyond the front r approximately equals R is a precursor of opposite sign, that decays like 1 /R, generated by the 1 /r potential flow around the vortex core. The present work is essentially an extension and update of an early approximate study at M = 1. 25. It covers the range (R/core radius) = 10, 100, 1000, and 10, 000 for M = 1. 25 and (in part) for M = 1. 29 and, for fixed (R/core radius) = 1000, the range M = 1. 01 to infinity...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} isotropic viscoelastic materials {{characterized by a}} linear relation between stress σ and strain ε and their time derivatives up to the order m,n. We observe that Coleman's thermodynamics does not imply the causality of the model but that a stronger requirement of Meixner does always imply it. The thermodynamical restrictions of Meixner are stated {{on the basis of}} theorems for rational positive functions. The propagation of <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> in infinite medium is studied when m ≤ 2. In the cases m = 0, n = 2 and m = 1, n = 3, it is shown that, when the dissipation is weak, the logarithmic decrement δ of the waves is smaller than 2 π only in a finite frequency band.

50|$|Leopold Infeld, {{who arrived}} at Princeton University at this time, later remembered his utter astonishment on hearing of this development, since {{radiation}} {{is such an}} essential element for any classical field theory worthy of the name. Infeld expressed his doubts to a leading expert on general relativity: H. P. Robertson, who {{had just returned from}} a visit to Caltech. Going over the argument as Infeld remembered it, Robertson was able to show Infeld the mistake: locally, the Einstein-Rosen waves are gravitational plane waves. Einstein and Rosen had correctly shown that a cloud of test particles would, in <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves,</b> form caustics, but changing to another chart (essentially the Brinkmann coordinates) shows that the formation of the caustic is not a contradiction at all, but in fact just what one would expect in this situation. Infeld then approached Einstein, who concurred with Robertson's analysis (still not knowing it was he who reviewed the Physical Review submission).|$|R
40|$|Forced and {{naturally}} occurring, self-sustaining oscillations of transonic flows in two-dimensional diffusers were computed using MacCormack's hybrid method.

In the case of forced oscillations, a <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>plane</b> pressure <b>wave</b> at frequency 300 Hz was prescribed at the exit. A sufficiently large amount of data were acquired and Fourier analyzed. The distrbutions of time-mean pressures, the power spectral density, and the amplitude with phase angle along the top wall and in the core region were determined. Comparison with experimental results for the forced oscillation generally gave very good agreement; some success was achieved for the case of self-sustaining oscillation despite substantial three-dimensionality in the test.

40|$|This work {{starts from}} {{the premise that}} <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> cease to be {{solutions}} of field theories when turning on an interaction. A nonlinear interaction term generates harmonics analogous to those observed in nonlinear optical media. This calls for a generalization to anharmonic waves in both classical and quantum field theory. Three simple requirements make anharmonic waves compatible with relativistic field theory and quantum physics. Some non-essential concepts have to be abandoned, such as orthogonality, the superposition principle, {{and the existence of}} single-particle energy eigenstates. The most general class of anharmonic waves allows for a zero frequency term in the Fourier series, which corresponds to a quantum field with a non-zero vacuum expectation value. Anharmonic quantum fields are defined by generalizing the expansion of a field operator into creation and annihilation operators. This method provides a framework for handling exact quantum fields, which define exact single particle states. Comment: 30 pages, 4 figures, updated Ref.
