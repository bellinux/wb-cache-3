5000|$|Zero-drag {{satellites}} or equivalently [...] "drag-free satellites" [...] are satellites {{where the}} payload follows a geodesic path through space only affected by gravity {{and not by}} non-gravitational forces such as drag of the residual atmosphere, light pressure and solar wind. A zero-drag satellite has two parts, an outer shell and an inner mass called the <b>proof</b> <b>mass.</b> The <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> floats freely inside the outer shell, while {{the distance between the}} outer shell and the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> is constantly measured. When a change in the distance between the outer shell and the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> is detected, it means that the outer shell has been influenced by non-gravitational forces and moved relative to the <b>proof</b> <b>mass.</b> Thrusters on the outer shell will then reposition the outer shell relative to the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> so that its distance is the same as before the external influence changed it. The outer shell thus protects the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> from nearly all interactions with the outside that can cause acceleration, except those mediated by gravity, and by following the <b>proof</b> <b>mass,</b> the outer shell (which is to say, the rest of the spacecraft, carrying instruments, etc.) itself follows a geodesic path.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} source of noise in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is residual acceleration on the <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> {{at the heart of}} the interferometer system. Two <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> are carried by each sciencecraft in the LISA constellation, oriented along each of two laser links that are maintained between the distant partners in the constellation.

50|$|One way {{to think}} about a zero-drag {{satellite}} is to see the shell/proof mass setup as being an accelerometer, measuring the acceleration of the outer shell. The input from the accelerometer is then used to control the satellites thruster to exactly compensate for the measured acceleration, ensuring that over time the satellite has zero acceleration. Since the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> is floating free within the outer shell, neither the initial drag nor the thruster's compensation for it is experienced by the <b>proof</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E

50|$|Under the {{influence}} of external accelerations the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> deflects from its neutral position. This deflection is measured in an analog or digital manner. Most commonly, the capacitance between a set of fixed beams {{and a set of}} beams attached to the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> is measured. This method is simple, reliable, and inexpensive. Integrating piezoresistors in the springs to detect spring deformation, and thus deflection, is a good alternative, although a few more process steps are needed during the fabrication sequence. For very high sensitivities quantum tunneling is also used; this requires a dedicated process making it very expensive. Optical measurement has been demonstrated on laboratory scale.|$|E

The {{success of}} the LISA project depends {{on the ability of}} the {{disturbance}} reduction system to shield the <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> from all external forces and maintain tight pointing requirements relative to the other two spacecrafts. µN-thrusters are required to compensate for the solar radiation pressure acting on the spacecraft. The force noise from these thrusters must be low enough to not disturb the freely floating <b>proof</b> <b>masses.</b> To date, these noise requirements have not been demonstrated, mostly because no thrust-stand exists with sufficient sensitivity.

The gyroscope is formed using substrate material having lower and upper layers sandwiching a sacrificial insulating layer. An exemplary gyroscope comprises a low-resistivity single-crystal silicon substrate having a lower support layer and an upper flexible support layer. Two opposed <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> that {{are separated from}} the lower support layer lie in and are supported by the upper flexible support layer. Two drive electrodes are disposed adjacent to the <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> and are insulatably supported by the lower support layer and are separated from the upper flexible support layer.

The spacecraft will be steered around the <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> and laser interferometer will monitor the distances between the <b>proof</b> <b>masses.</b> One of the main challenges to test LISA interferometry on the ground is the long light travel time of 16 s between the spacecraft. At UF, we developed a technique to experimentally simulate the light travel time that enables us to build a LISA benchtop interferometer and test many aspects of LISA interferometry. We plan to test time delay interferometry, stabilize the laser frequency to a LISA arm, generate LISA-like signals, verify on-board data reduction schemes, and host mock data challenges well before LISA is launched.

50|$|The switch {{shown to}} the right is {{intended}} to disable an electric fuel pump in automotive applications. This functionality is required in some vehicle racing applications, since an electric fuel pump may otherwise continue operating after a collision or rollover. If the fuel line is broken or the vehicle is inverted, fuel may be spilled, creating a fire hazard. A small loose weight (called a <b>proof</b> <b>mass)</b> is trapped within a spring-loaded cage. A shock in any direction will cause movement of the mass relative to the cage. If sufficiently shocked, the cage will spring open which actuates an associated switch. The switch is reset by pressing the cage closed through the flexible (red) top cover, retrapping the mass. These switches are also used to open a contactor (a large relay) to disable the high power circuit of a battery electric vehicle upon collision.|$|E

By use of laser ranging equipment on the spacecraft and retroreflectors attached to the <b>proof</b> <b>mass,</b> the relative position of the spacecraft and <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> would be determined. Meanwhile, the position of the spacecraft relative to the Earth would be determined by ranging by use of a laser transponder. The vector sum of the two sets of ranging measurements would be the position of the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> relative to the Earth. Unlike the acceleration of the spacecraft, the acceleration of the <b>proof</b> <b>mass</b> should not include a residual component attributable to leakage of fuel.

40|$|The small {{satellite}} 'Galileo Galilei' (GG) {{will test}} {{the universality of}} free fall and hence the weak equivalence principle which is the founding pillar of general relativity to 1 part in 10 (17). It will use <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> whose atoms differ substantially from one another in their mass energy content, so as to maximize the chance of violation. GG will improve by four orders of magnitude the current best 'Eot-Wash' tests based on slowly rotating torsion balances, which {{have been able to}} reach their thermal noise level. In GG, the expected violation signal is a relative displacement between the <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> of similar or equal to 0. 6 pm caused by a differential acceleration alpha(GG) similar or equal to 8 x 10 (- 17) ms(- 2) pointing to the center of mass of the Earth as the satellite orbits around it at nu(GG) similar or equal to 1. 7 x 10 (- 4) Hz. GG will fly an innovative acceleration sensor based on rapidly rotating macroscopic test masses weakly coupled in 2 D which up-converts the signal to nu(spin) similar or equal to 1 Hz, a value well above the frequency of natural oscillations of the masses relative to each other nu(d) = 1 /T-d similar or equal to 1 /(540 s). The sensor is unique in that it ensures high rotation frequency, low thermal noise and no attenuation of the signal strength (Pegna et al 2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 107 200801). A readout based on a very low noise laser interferometry gauge developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (similar or equal to 1 pm Hz(- 1 / 2) at 1 Hz demonstrated) allows the short integration time to be fully exploited. A full scale sensor with the same degrees of freedom and the same dynamical features as the one to fly in GG has been setup on ground (GGG). The <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> of GGG are affected by acceleration and tilt noise acting on the rotating shaft because of ball bearings and terrain microseismicity (both absent in space). Overall, by means of appropriate 2 D flexure joints, these noise sources have been reduced by a factor almost 10 (5) down to a differential acceleration between the <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> of similar or equal to 7 x 10 (- 11) m s(- 2) (at 1. 7 x 10 (- 4) Hz up-converted by rotation to similar or equal to 0. 2 Hz). The corresponding noise in the relative displacements of the <b>proof</b> <b>masses,</b> read by co-rotating capacitance bridges, is similar or equal to 180 pm, which is 300 times larger than the target in space. GGG error budget shows that it can reach a differential acceleration sensitivity alpha(GGGgoal) similar or equal to 8 x 10 (- 16) m s(- 2), not limited by thermal noise. This value is only a factor 10 larger than what GG must reach in space to meet its target, and slightly smaller than the acceleration noise of the torsion balance. It can be achieved partly by means of weaker joints and an optimized mechanical design-so as to improve the attenuation factor-and partly by replacing the current ball bearings with much less noisy air bearings (also used in torsion balance tests) so as to reduce input noise. A laser gauge readout with noise level r(laser-ro) similar or equal to 30 pm Hz(- 1 / 2) at 0. 2 divided by 3 Hz will be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract - We discuss specific, recent {{advances}} {{in the analysis of}} an experiment to test the Equivalence Principle (EP) in free fall. A differential accelerometer detector with two <b>proof</b> <b>masses</b> of different materials free falls inside an evacuated capsule previously released from a stratospheric balloon. The detector spins slowly about its horizontal axis during the fall. An EP violation signal (if present) will manifest itself at the rotational frequency of the detector. The detector operates in a quiet environment as it slowly moves with respect to the co-moving capsule. There are, however, gravitational and dynamical noise contributions that need to be evaluated in order to define key requirements for this experiment. Specifically, higher-order mass moments of the capsule contribute errors to the differential acceleration output with components at the spin frequency which need to be minimized. The dynamics of the free falling detector (in its present design) has been simulated in order to estimate the tolerable errors at release which, in turn, define the release mechanism requirements. Moreover, the study of the higher-order mass moments for a worst-case position of the detector package relative to the cryostat has led to the definition of requirements on the shape and size of the <b>proof</b> <b>masses...</b>|$|R
