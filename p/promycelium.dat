5000|$|The {{characteristic}} {{part of the}} life-cycle of smuts is the thick-walled, often darkly pigmented, ornate, teliospore that serves to survive harsh conditions such as overwintering and also serves to help disperse the fungus as dry diaspores. The teliospores are initially dikaryotic but become diploid via karyogamy. Meiosis {{takes place at the}} time of germination. A <b>promycelium</b> is formed that consists of a short hypha (equated to a basidium). In some smuts such as Ustilago maydis the nuclei migrate into the <b>promycelium</b> that becomes septate (i.e., divided into cellular compartments separated by cell walls called septa), and haploid yeast-like conidia/basidiospores sometimes called sporidia, bud off laterally from each cell. In various smuts, the yeast phase may proliferate, or they may fuse, or they may infect plant tissue and become hyphal. In other smuts, such as Tilletia caries, the elongated haploid basidiospores form apically, often in compatible pairs that fuse centrally resulting in [...] "H"-shaped diaspores which are by then dikaryotic. Dikaryotic conidia may then form. Eventually the host is infected by infectious hyphae. Teliospores form in host tissue. Many variations on these general themes occur.|$|E
5000|$|Salmacisia {{species are}} defined as those with fruiting {{structures}} (technically known as sori) that originate only in the ovaries of infected plants, where clumps of dirty-brown agglutinated spores are formed. The spores are covered with surface ornamentations (spines or [...] ), and arise from cells of spore-creating mycelia, frequently encased in a translucent jelly-like sheath. The spores germinate by means of continuous <b>promycelium</b> (the germ tube of the spore) that bear primary basidiospores that can be have either one nucleus, which conjugate, or two nuclei, giving rise to secondary basidiospores.|$|E
50|$|In {{preferred}} weather conditions, a teliospore {{which has}} successfully {{attached to a}} susceptible host will germinate to produce {{what is known as}} a <b>promycelium.</b> At the apex of this structure, then, can be found 65-180 primary sporidia. Secondary sporidia can then either bud from the primary sporidia or from the fungal threads of the mycelium itself. These secondary sporidia are responsible for infecting young host plants through the ovary wall in the flowering stage. Secondary sporidia accomplish this by penetrating the epidermis of host glumes via germ tubes. Sporidia are then able to enter the maturing kernels and leave vast numbers of teliospores where healthy kernel tissue used to be. During harvest teliospores fall from the kernels to the soil from which point they may be carried elsewhere by wind or tools, thereby restarting the disease cycle.|$|E

5000|$|Rusts (Pucciniales, {{previously}} {{known as}} Uredinales) at their greatest complexity, produce five {{different types of}} spores on two different host plants in two unrelated host families. Such rusts are heteroecious (requiring two hosts) and macrocyclic (producing all five spores types). Wheat stem rust is an example. By convention, the stages and spore states are numbered by Roman numerals. Typically, basidiospores infect host one, {{also known as the}} alternate or sexual host, the mycelium forms pycnidia, which are miniature, flask-shaped, hollow, submicroscopic bodies embedded in host tissue (such as a leaf). This stage, numbered [...] "0", produces single-celled spores that ooze out in a sweet liquid and that act as nonmotile spermatia, and also protruding receptive hyphae. Insects and probably other vectors such as rain carry the spermatia from spermagonium to spermagonium, cross inoculating the mating types. Neither thallus is male or female. Once crossed, the dikaryons are established and a second spore stage is formed, numbered [...] "I" [...] and called aecia, which form dikaryotic aeciospores in dry chains in inverted cup-shaped bodies embedded in host tissue. These aeciospores then infect the second host, known as the primary or asexual host (in macrocyclic rusts). On the primary host a repeating spore stage is formed, numbered [...] "II", the urediospores in dry pustules called uredinia. Urediospores are dikaryotic and can infect the same host that produced them. They repeatedly infect this host over the growing season. At the end of the season, a fourth spore type, the teliospore, is formed. It is thicker-walled and serves to overwinter or to survive other harsh conditions. It does not continue the infection process, rather it remains dormant for a period and then germinates to form basidia (stage [...] "IV"), sometimes called a <b>promycelium.</b> In the Pucciniales, the basidia are cylindrical and become 3-septate after meiosis, with each of the 4 cells bearing one basidiospore each. The basidiospores disperse and start the infection process on host 1 again. Autoecious rusts complete their life-cycles on one host instead of two, and microcyclic rusts cut out one or more stages.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{teliospore}} of Tilletia caries germinates {{to produce}} a <b>promycelium</b> with a whorl of primary sporidia at its tip. The time between emergence of the <b>promycelium</b> {{and the development of}} primary sporidia averaged 2. 3 h. Fusion between compatible sporidia occurred within an additional 3. 8 h. Primary sporidia appeared to be blastic and at maturity were 37 - 57 pm long and c. 0. 7, 1. 8 and 1. 2 μm wide at the tip, middle and base respectively. While still attached to the <b>promycelium</b> sporidia usually fused in pairs with a short tube near their midpoints. Sporidia in individual whorls were usually packed tightly together, and fused sporidia that were dislodged also remained close together along their entire length. Promycelia contained many small vacuoles and mitochondria, and numerous lipid bodies. As the primary sporidia developed, the promycelial cytoplasm passed into the nascent cells. Septa developed between the bases of mature sporidia and the tips of the denticles. Sporidia that abscised from the denticles commonly had prominent birth scars at their bases. The sporidia had very thin walls, few vacuoles, attenuated mitochondria, and numerous lipid bodies. Conjugation pegs were generally produced by both members of a conjugating pair of primary sporidia and there were bud scars where they emerged. The sporidial walls were apparently hydrolyzed during emergence of the pegs. Vesicles were sometimes present at the tips of the conjugation pegs and electron-dense accumulations were sometimes observed between the tips of advancing pegs just before fusion. The approaching conjugation pegs were precisely aligned, suggesting intercellular communication. The walls of the conjugation pegs fused and then were hydrolyzed. Fused sporidia were relatively homogeneous in content. The nucleus in a sporidium was often close to the conjugation tube and occasionally was partly within the tube. When lunate secondary sporidia of opposite mating types were paired on agar, conjugation pegs developed as hyphal protuberances from sporidia or their germination tubes. Sometimes, germination tubes developed into conjugation pegs. A conjugation peg from one sporidium sometimes appeared to induce a peg in its partner, after contact. Conjugation pegs met precisely tip-to-tip before fusion. This often required, or caused, curvature of the pegs. Secondary sporidia of opposite mating types initially adjacent to each other were pushed apart during conjugation. Conjugation tubes were formed by the fusion of conjugation pegs from sporidia of opposite mating types or by fusion of a conjugation peg from a sporidium of one mating type with the body or germination tube of another sporidium of opposite mating type. The times required for development of conjugation pegs and formation of conjugation tubes depended on the relative orientations of the sporidia in a mating pair. Conjugation was most rapid with sporidia positioned end-to-end. Conjugation was favored by a pH of 4. 5 - 6 and at pH 6, conjugation occurred as readily on water agar as on a nutrient medium. The time required for conjugation increased as the initial distance between mating sporidia was increased. On agar, there were most intersporidial contacts in pairs of sporidia of opposite (+ -) mating types than in pairs of like (+ + or - -) mating types. Pre-conjugation pegs were produced by sporidia after displacement of stimulating (opposite mating type) sporidia and the pegs continued to elongate. Sporidia of opposite mating types conjugated when subjected to a treatment that would disrupt fimbrial connections. Multiple hyphal tips were produced by differentiating sporidia separated from monokaryons (mycelia and sporidia) of opposite mating type by distances of 70 - 200 pm. The response was sex-specific. In some experiments the factors causing these responses were retained in the agar substrate. These factors may initiate the formation of conjugation pegs...|$|E
40|$|Orange rust of Rubus is an {{interesting}} disease {{because of the fact}} that it can be caused by three different rust fungi that produce virtually identical symptoms. One is Gymnoconia peckiana (Howe in Peck) Trotter, which is a demicyclic species, while the other two are endocyclic forms historically referred to as Gymnoconia nitens (Schwein.) Kern 2 ̆ 6 H. W. Thurston. Although the spores produced on infected Rubus leaves by these latter two forms are morphologically identical to the aeciospores of G. peckiana, they actually function as teliospores. However, the teliospores of one of the forms gives rise to two-celled promycelia that bear only two basidiospores, while teliospores of the other produce four-celled promycelia bearing four basidiospores. Here, we examined the teliospores of the four-spored form along with the sequence of events that lead to basidiospore development. Developing and mature teliospores were binucleate, and we saw no evidence that karyogamy occurred in these spores. Upon germination, both spore nuclei migrated into the <b>promycelium</b> and underwent mitosis to form a total of four nuclei. Four transverse septa then developed, creating four uninucleate cells. A tapered sterigma arose from each cell and gave rise to a basidiospore. These findings indicate that the basidiospores of the four-spored form of G. nitens were formed in an asexual fashion...|$|E
40|$|The {{maize smut}} fungus Ustilago maydis {{switches}} from yeast to hyphal growth to infect maize (Zea mays) plants. This switching is promoted by mating of compatible cells {{and seems to}} be required for plant penetration. Although many genes distinctively expressed during this dimorphic switch have been identified and shown to be essential for the infection process, none seems to be explicitly required for polar growth control. Here, we report the characterization of pcl 12, encoding a cyclin that interacts specifically with Cdk 5, an essential cyclin-dependent kinase with regulatory roles in morphogenesis in U. maydis. Pcl 12 fulfills the requirements to be a virulence-specific regulator of polar growth in U. maydis. First, pcl 12 expression is induced during the pathogenic development. Secondly, Pcl 12 is sufficient to induce hyperpolarized growth in U. maydis cells, as haploid cells overexpressing pcl 12 in axenic conditions produce filaments that were morphologically indistinguishable from those produced during the infection process. Finally, cells defective in pcl 12 showed impaired polar growth during the formation of the b-dependent filament, the induction of the conjugation tubes, or the formation of a <b>promycelium</b> in spore germination. However, in spite of this pivotal role during morphogenesis, pcl 12 mutants were virulent. We discuss the implications of these results for the role of polar growth during the infection process...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that fungal growth and pathogenic development are supported by exocytosis. However, the role of endocytosis during these growth processes has not been elucidated yet. It was {{the aim of the}} present study to use the temperature-sensitive mutant of the endocytic t-SNARE Yup 1, to analyse the importance of endocytosis for fungal growth and pathogenic development in Ustilago maydis. U. maydis is a basidiomycete fungus that infects maize plants and causes the formation of tumors in the corncob {{and other parts of the}} plant. Pathogenic development is initiated by pheromone recognition of compatible haploid partner cells. Yup 1 ts cells are defective in pheromone recognition and do not initiate the subsequent mating reaction. Key player for pheromone recognition is the G-protein coupled pheromone receptor Pra 1. In the absence of pheromone, biologically active Pra 1 -GFP is constitutively endocytosed from the plasma membrane and degraded in the vacuole. After pheromone ligand binding, growth of conjugation hyphae is initiated and Pra 1 -GFP localises to the tip of conjugation hyphae while in yup 1 ts cells, Pra 1 -GFP accumulates in small endocytic vesicles, which are no longer able to fuse with early endosomes. These findings suggest a role for Yup 1 on early endosomes at the intersection of incoming endocytic vesicles and the degradation pathway as well as a putative recycling pathway. Therefore recycling and degradation of Pra 1 are inhibited in yup 1 ts cells. In an independent experiment it was found that wild-type Pra 1 -GFP is recycled. Thus it is thought that Pra 1 -GFP is depleted from the plasma membrane due to malfunction of Yup 1. The recycling deficiency of Pra 1 -GFP in yup 1 ts results in the defect in pheromone perception. Interestingly, increased expression of Pra 1 -GFP can rescue this perception defect. However, even the restored partner recognition could not resolve the subsequent mating defects identified for cell-cell fusion, while filamentous growth, formation of appressoria and plant infection which follow cell-cell fusion, are only affected to a small extend. Interestingly, the tumors that are formed in the maize plant after Ustilago infection are empty, indicating a lack of teliospore formation in the absence of yup 1 -mediated endocytosis. Independently, germination of teliospores is reduced and the <b>promycelium</b> shows morphological alterations in yup 1 ts cells. Endocytosed cargos responsible for these phenotypes have not been determined so far. First indications point to an involvement of chitin synthases. One of their representatives, the myosin chitin synthase 1 (Mcs 1) was shown to be endocytosed in a yup 1 -mediated fashion. The presented results are supported by the analysis of the U. maydis genome, which reveals the presence of components commonly discussed to mediate endocytosis. Taken together the results clearly proof the existence and the importance of endocytosis for growth and virulence in the filamentous fungus U. maydis...|$|E
