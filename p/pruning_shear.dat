40|$|Throughout {{the years}} 2008 to 2010, we {{analyzed}} approximately two thousand oriental melon samplescollected from Seongju, using electron microscopy and testing by RT-PCR using primers specific for eightcucurbit-infecting viruses. Data from RT-PCR indicated that Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV),Watermelon mosaic virus 2 (WMV 2) and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) were {{present and the}} otherviruses were not detected. Among them, CGMMV and WMV 2 were the most prevalent pathogens. CGMMVwas thought to infect oriental melon from the early growing season, and reached nearly 100 % in the later ofgrowing period. Otherwise, WMV 2 emerged from June, several months later compared to CGMMV. CGMMV was detected from all aerial parts of the oriental melon including seeds, but not from the roots ofthe grafted pumpkin rootstock. Seed of two out of five commercial varieties were shown to be CGMMVpositive. Nine varieties of pumpkins used as rootstocks were not infected with CGMMV. When the seedlingsof grafted oriental melon were transplanted into pots mixed with the oriental melon debris infected withCGMMV, they were not infected by CGMMV. Cutting of <b>pruning</b> <b>shear</b> and the contact of tendrilscontributed 48 % and 30 % to the transmission of the virus, respectively...|$|E

However, the development of metal working, first in copper and later in iron and steel, enabled the manufacture of more durable tools. Industrial metalworking enabled the manufacture of efficient cutting tools, including <b>pruning</b> <b>shears</b> (secateurs - for example anvil <b>pruning</b> <b>shears),</b> grass shears, loppers and larger, more efficient powered tools such as the trencher.|$|R

The officers and strikebreakers were attacked, after removing street barricades, while attempting to move their truck through the crowd of strikers. One of the strikers, identified as John Lopez, attacked one of the strikebreakers, identified as Arthur Boom, with <b>pruning</b> <b>shears.</b> Boom leaped from the truck and attacked Lopez, starting a riot between about 300 strikers, strikebreakers, and officers.

5000|$|<b>Pruning</b> <b>shears,</b> {{also called}} hand pruners (in American English), or secateurs, are {{a type of}} {{scissors}} for use on plants.

40|$|Dieback, or “dead arm,” in noncoastal California grapevines is most {{commonly}} caused by Botryosphaeria spp. Using Koch’s postulates, we demonstrated that isolates of B. obtusa are pathogenic on grapevines. We initiated studies {{to investigate the}} life cycle of B. obtusa and ways to control it with cultural practices. Fungal spores disseminated by rainstorms were collected in traps in an Arbuckle vineyard from December 2006 through spring 2007. The data suggests that B. obtusa was rain-disseminated throughout winter and spring, and that pycnidia on deadwood in the vines is a major source of inoculum for new infections. Transmission may also be possible via vegetative propagation, <b>pruning</b> <b>shears</b> and insects.

40|$|The {{small tree}} Melientha suavis Pierre subsp. suavis (Opiliaceae) {{is in the}} Philippines so far known from two localities in Mindanao, only (Misamis Or., Claveria; Cotabato, Port Lebak: Hiepko, 1979, 1984). During {{vegetation}} studies on Mt Pangasugan, Leyte, Eastern Visayas (Langenberger, 2000), it was found scattered along ridges between 250 and 530 m altitude. The trees reached a height of about 8 m. The bark is greyish brown with fissures exposing the white inner bark. Fruits developed in February and became creamish yellow when ripe, very sweet and tasteful, but could be observed rotting on the trees. The high hunting pressure {{has led to a}} near extermination of local bird and primate populations (local farmers: pers. comm.). Twigs are hard to cut with <b>pruning</b> <b>shears</b> probably due to the high wood density. The fact that the timber is used for charcoal in Thailand supports this assumption. The occurrence of calcium carbonate cystoliths may be an additional reason.

The collected branches were placed in clean polyethylene bags without touching with bare hands and brought to the laboratory, after which leaves about 5  cm in length with small stems were separated from the branches without distinction of leaf age and used for extraction of microbial genomic DNA. Leaf samples (10  g) were placed into 50 -mL sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), after which 30 – 40  mL of sterile potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was added. Microbial cells from the leaves were collected by ultrasonic disintegration (45  kHz, 10  min) and centrifugation (5800 ×g, 10  min, 5  °C), after which the DNA for genetic analyses was extracted from the precipitates using a FastDNA SPIN kit for Soil (Q-Biogene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All sampling and DNA extraction processes were conducted while wearing a clean pair of nitrile rubber gloves.|$|R
