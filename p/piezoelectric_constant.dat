50|$|Commercially, it {{is usually}} not used in its pure form, rather it is doped with either acceptors, which create oxygen (anion) {{vacancies}}, or donors, which create metal (cation) vacancies and facilitate domain wall motion in the material. In general, acceptor doping creates hard PZT while donor doping creates soft PZT. Hard and soft PZT's generally differ in their piezoelectric constants. Piezoelectric constants are proportional to the polarization or to the electrical field generated per unit of mechanical stress, or alternatively is the mechanical strain produced by per unit of electric field applied. In general, soft PZT has a higher <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>constant,</b> but larger losses in the material due to internal friction. In hard PZT, domain wall motion is pinned by the impurities thereby lowering the losses in the material, but {{at the expense of}} a reduced <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>constant.</b>|$|E

50|$|Piezoelectric {{materials}} {{used for the}} purpose of accelerometers fall into two categories: single crystal and ceramic materials. The first and more widely used are single-crystal materials (usually quartz). Though these materials do offer a long life span in terms of sensitivity, their disadvantage is that they are generally less sensitive than some piezoelectric ceramics. The other category, ceramic materials, have a higher <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>constant</b> (sensitivity) than single-crystal materials, and are less expensive to produce. Ceramics use barium titanate, lead-zirconate-lead-titanate, lead metaniobate, and other materials whose composition is considered proprietary by the company responsible for their development. The disadvantage of piezoelectric ceramics, however, is that their sensitivity degrades with time making the longevity of the device less than that of single-crystal materials.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a 3 -D {{connectivity}} model that enables better understanding, at the micro-structural level, the effect of fiber orientation, matrix properties, and inter-fiber contact on the effective piezoelectric properties of a composite consisting of a unidirectional piezoceramic fiber yarn in a polymeric matrix. It is assumed in the 3 -D connectivity model that the piezoceramic fiber and matrix are connected in parallel in the fiber direction and in series transverse to the fiber direction. The poling direction is at an arbitrary angle from the fiber axis. Using these assumptions and coordinate transformation, the effective piezoelectric properties of yarn composites can be determined. It is concluded that the effective <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>constants</b> are very sensitive to the fiber orientation. There is a significant effect of the dielectric permittivity of the matrix material on the effective <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>constants,</b> and the effective <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>constants</b> obtained from the 3 -D connectivity model can change dramatically depending on the non-contact and contact assumptions of the fibers. 1...|$|R
