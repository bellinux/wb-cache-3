50|$|By {{pretending to}} still be {{powerless}} and addicted, Andy manages to gain crucial information by pushing his psychiatrist. Under Rainbird's guidance, Charlie begins to demonstrate her power, which has grown to fearsome levels. After the suicide of his psychiatrist, Andy is able to meet and <b>push</b> <b>Cap,</b> using him to plan his and Charlie's escape from the facility, {{as well as to}} finally communicate with Charlie. Rainbird discovers Andy's plan, however, and decides to use it to his advantage.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dix whistled softly and, {{glancing up}} at the tall, white-faced young man before him, <b>pushed</b> his <b>cap</b> back and {{scratched}} his head.|$|R

50|$|The team traded baskets in {{the third}} quarter, with Spain cutting the deficit further to seven. A three-point field goal by Rudy Fernandez cut the lead into two, the {{smallest}} deficit with 8:13 left in the fourth. Kobe Bryant and Wade extended the lead with three-pointers to 103-92 but Spain had a final <b>push,</b> <b>capped</b> with another three-pointer from Carlos Jimenez to reduce the lead 108-104. In the final 2 minutes a three-pointer by Dwyane Wade and a Kobe Bryant field goal extended the lead back to 9. It was then when the Americans began hitting their free throws when the Spanish got frustrated and were called for technical fouls to seal the game for the Americans.|$|R
6000|$|The mate {{looked at}} the skipper and <b>pushed</b> his <b>cap</b> back. [...] "We {{had no reason to}} think otherwise," [...] he said shortly. [...] "It’s a mystery to me altogether. He can’t have gone home by train because he had no money." ...|$|R

60|$|The pet {{squirrel}} leaped {{lightly on}} Alfred's shoulder, ran over his breast, peeped {{in all his}} pockets, and even <b>pushed</b> his <b>cap</b> {{to one side of}} his head. Then he ran down Alfred's arm, sniffed in his coat sleeve, and finally wedged a cold little nose between his closed fingers.|$|R
6000|$|He {{struck a}} {{careless}} attitude, {{looked down the}} road this way and that, lifted his eyebrows, <b>pushed</b> his khaki <b>cap</b> on one side, and answered: ...|$|R
50|$|Samsung even {{announced}} in late 2006 that by 2008 {{it would put}} such a device into production at the 40 nm process node, but over the five years following this announcement many device designers found ways to <b>push</b> the <b>cap</b> structure to increasingly tighter process geometries, successfully producing NAND down to 20 nm node with this approach.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few moments}} that seemed years he looked at her--looked till the lure of her eyes drew {{him to his feet}} as a man rises in sleep-walking. As he slowly stood up, the low-hanging bough of a fir tree <b>pushed</b> his <b>cap</b> down over his face and blinded him. When he {{snatched}} it off, she was gone.|$|R

6000|$|Seeing {{that her}} dinner {{was a success}} {{in spite of its}} homeliness, Edith added the last surprise, which had also been one to Patty and herself when it arrived, just in time to be carried out. She forgot to be Madam now, and said with a face full of mingled merriment and satisfaction, as she <b>pushed</b> her <b>cap</b> askew and pulled off her mitts: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{not think}} {{her the most}} {{beautiful}} creature you ever saw in your life?" [...] He <b>pushed</b> back his <b>cap</b> {{and looked at her}} without making any immediate answer. [...] "I do. Now tell me what you think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you don't}} pipe your eye and look squally when I sheer off as you used to, and that's a comfort. I {{like to leave}} port in fair weather and have a jolly {{send-off}} all round. Specially this time, for {{it will be a}} year or more before we drop anchor here again,' answered Emil, <b>pushing</b> his <b>cap</b> back, and glancing about him as if he loved old Plum and would be sorry never to see it any more.|$|R
60|$|There was a halt. The publican evidently {{would say}} nothing. Berry {{looked at the}} {{mahogany}} bar-counter, slopped with beer, at the whisky-bottles on the shelves. Sutton, his <b>cap</b> <b>pushed</b> back, showing a white brow above a weather-reddened face, rubbed his cropped hair uneasily.|$|R
60|$|No answer. An {{old man in}} a Scotch cap sitting {{among others}} on a form at the table, eating out of a tin porringer, <b>pushes</b> back his <b>cap</b> a little to look at us, claps it down on his {{forehead}} again with the palm of his hand, and goes on eating.|$|R
60|$|She took no heed, but walked on. He went uncomfortably at her side, {{making his}} funny remarks {{from time to}} time. But she was as if stone deaf. He glanced at her, and to his dismay saw the tears running down her cheeks. He stopped suddenly, and <b>pushed</b> back his <b>cap.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MK 1 is a time-fused {{fragmentation}} grenade and has 32 serrations on it. To start the fuse, the user has {{to pull the}} safety pin, then <b>push</b> off the <b>cap</b> {{on top of the}} grenade. Right before throwing, the user has to move the switch on the lever away from the grenade in order to start the fuse.|$|R
60|$|The time, a {{pleasant}} Sunday {{afternoon in the}} early autumn of 1861. The place, a forest's heart in the mountain region of southwestern Virginia. Private Grayrock of the Federal Army is discovered seated comfortably {{at the root of}} a great pine tree, against which he leans, his legs extended straight along the ground, his rifle lying across his thighs, his hands (clasped in order that they may not fall away to his sides) resting upon the barrel of the weapon. The contact of {{the back of his head}} with the tree has <b>pushed</b> his <b>cap</b> downward over his eyes, almost concealing them; one seeing him would say that he slept.|$|R
50|$|This {{mechanism}} (also {{known as}} depletion drive) {{depends on the}} associated gas of the oil. The virgin reservoir may be entirely liquid, but {{will be expected to}} have gaseous hydrocarbons in solution due to the pressure. As the reservoir depletes, the pressure falls below the bubble point, and the gas comes out of solution to form a gas cap at the top. This gas <b>cap</b> <b>pushes</b> down on the liquid helping to maintain pressure.|$|R
50|$|In {{front of}} Bastian Baker, Marc Michaud {{plays the role}} of someone who is upset and offended. He pretends that Bastian Baker has {{deliberately}} tried to humiliate him and that he wants to discredit him by the way he would have shown his professional and superior vocal art if one compares it to the amateur’s voice of Marc Michaud who had kindly started to hum one famous song from Bastian Baker’s repertoire in order to honor him. Then, Marc Michaud <b>pushes</b> the <b>cap</b> one notch above when he declares to be madly in love with Bastian Baker who answers him that he cannot share his feelings. As a reaction, Marc Michaud expresses his utter despair for not being loved as much as he loves him, then he starts to cry in front of his guest who is more and more embarrassed.|$|R
5000|$|With {{a little}} imagination, it is {{possible}} to see the profile of a human face in the rocky outline, but as John Page said in 1889: [...] "If his nose bore any resemblance to the topmost layer of the pile, it cannot have boasted much comeliness." [...] Other writers have seen the topmost layer as a cap, for instance Ruth St. Leger-Gordon wrote in 1965: [...] "With grey <b>cap</b> <b>pushed</b> well back from a face consisting mainly of the parrot-like feature which gives him his name...".|$|R
60|$|The long {{stocking}} caps {{they wear}} {{as a sort}} of crest, as a lizard wears his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth <b>pushes</b> his <b>cap</b> back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then he shifts it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points, like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black stockinette stuff.|$|R

Tried it once myself and broke the bridge of my nose," [...] he said, tapping that massive feature with a laugh which showed that fifty years of farming had not taken all the boy out of him. [...] "Now then, let's see about this little chore, and lively, too, for it's late, and these parties ought to be housed," [...] he added, {{throwing}} down his whip, <b>pushing</b> back his <b>cap,</b> and nodding at the wounded with a reassuring smile.|$|R
40|$|The {{honey bee}} {{has been an}} {{important}} model organism for studying learning and memory. More recently, the honey bee has become a valuable model to understand perception and cognition. However, the techniques used to explore psychological phenomena in honey bees have been limited to only a few primary methodologies such as the proboscis extension reflex, sting extension reflex, and free flying target discrimination-tasks. Methods to explore operant conditioning in bees and other invertebrates are not as varied as with vertebrates. This {{may be due to the}} availability of a suitable response requirement. In this manuscript we offer a new method to explore operant conditioning in honey bees: the <b>cap</b> <b>pushing</b> response (CPR). We used the CPR to test for difference in learning curves between novel auto-shaping and more traditional explicit-shaping. The CPR protocol requires bees to exhibit a novel behavior by <b>pushing</b> a <b>cap</b> to uncover a food source. Using the CPR protocol we tested the effects of both explicit-shaping and auto-shaping techniques on operant conditioning. The goodness of fit and lack of fit of these data to the Rescorla-Wagner learning-curve model, widely used in classical conditioning studies, was tested. The model fit well to both control and explicit-shaping results, but only for a limited number of trials. Learning ceased rather than continuing to asymptotically approach the physiological most accurate possible. Rate of learning differed between shaped and control bee treatments. Learning rate was about 3 times faster for shaped bees, but for all measures of proficiency control and shaped bees reached the same level. Auto-shaped bees showed one-trial learning rather than the asymptotic approach to a maximal efficiency. However, in terms of return-time, the auto-shaped bees' learning did not carry over to the covered-well test treatments...|$|R
60|$|Then he {{came home}} angry with his mother for having turned the girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow, who walked with long strides, {{sometimes}} frowning, often with his <b>cap</b> <b>pushed</b> jollily {{to the back of}} his head. Now he came in frowning. He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand, and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry, she trembled inwardly.|$|R
50|$|Bell <b>pushed</b> for a <b>cap</b> {{as small}} as 25 {{gigabytes}} of transfer per month, plus a $1-2 CAD surcharge for every GB over the limit. The stated intent was to prevent the customers of independent ISPs from congesting Bell's network, because many independent ISPs offer service with unlimited bandwidth, while most major Canadian ISPs do not. The CRTC was criticized for allowing Bell to use anti-competitive practices to favour its own Internet and television offerings. Bell is also under fire for forcing its own pricing structure and business on its wholesalers. Bell admits that more than 10 percent of its subscribers (at the time of said download cap) exceed their limit, resulting in additional billing.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the violent}} eruptions {{of the first}} two phases, the {{remainder}} of the thick magma slowly rose to the surface in a series of domes. Each dome began with an outpouring of the viscous, rhyolitic lava which hardened and formed a cap over the vent. As magma continued to <b>push</b> up, the <b>cap</b> (or dome) shattered and fell to the outside of the newly formed dome. This happened so many times that a new mountain was created out of these broken pieces, called crumble breccia. The mountain continued to build in this manner until the force within the volcano weakened and no more new domes formed. The final one still stands today.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of screw-capped {{tubes and}} bottles in bacteriology, following their introduction by McCartney (McCartney, 1933; Mackie and McCartney, 1948), suggests many applications for a method which has been used successfully for dispens-ing pooled human serum for transfusion. The prin-ciple ofthe method adopted is that the glass container is autoclaved with its cap fitting loosely, but suitably wrapped, the wrappings are removed and the <b>cap</b> <b>pushed</b> into a " gripper " under a hood, while the container is filled under the same hood by trans-ferring its neck to a spring-loaded valve which delivers sterile fluid. The " gripper, " a hard rubber ring with a tapered inner hole, is used both to remove and to replace the cap. On filling to th...|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} on 17 April 1913 by Tómas Tómasson, who began {{production of a}} (1% alc/vol) beverage, malt extract. Today it's the oldest beer-producing factory in Iceland; and now it's also a wholesaler of food and beverages. At first, the operations of Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson were based in two bedrooms {{in the basement of}} the Þórshamar house at Templarasund in Reykjavik, which Tómas had leased. Today, this house is owned by the Icelandic parliament (Althing). A year later, the company moved to the Thomsen house at Tryggvagata, and with this, the operating area grew significantly.The scope of operations was not large at first. The brewing boiler was only 65 litres, and bottles were closed by <b>pushing</b> the <b>cap</b> onto the bottle with a flat palm and binding it with wire. During the first production year, Ölgerðin sold around 38 thousand litres, mostly malt extract and white beer. The light beer Egils Pilsner came to market in the same year, as the ban on alcohol was implemented in 1915, after which it was illegal to produce alcoholic beer with more than 2.25% alcohol content. Generally, brewmasters from Germany and Denmark were hired to oversee the beer production. The company also produces soft drinks (e.g. Egils Appelsín).|$|R
60|$|This buffoonery just fitted {{the taste}} of the audience; the fierucola was but a small occasion, so the townsmen might be {{contented}} with jokes that were rather less indecent than those they were accustomed to hear at every carnival, put into easy rhyme by the Magnifico and his poetic satellites; while the women, over and above any relish of the fun, really began to have an itch for the Brevi. Several couples had already gone through the ceremony, in which the conjuror's solemn gibberish and grimaces over the open book, the antics of the monkey, and even the preliminary spitting, had called forth peals of laughter; and now a well-looking, merry-eyed youth of seventeen, in a loose tunic and red <b>cap,</b> <b>pushed</b> forward, holding by the hand a plump brunette, whose scanty ragged dress displayed her round arms and legs very picturesquely.|$|R
40|$|The current <b>push</b> for {{bandwidth}} <b>caps,</b> tiered usage pricing, {{and other}} measures in both wireless and wireline communications is usually justified by invoking the specter of “bandwidth hogs ” consuming an unfair share of the transmission capacity and being subsidized by {{the bulk of the}} users. This paper presents a conventional economic model of flat rates as a form of bundling, in which consumption can be extremely unequal, and can follow the ubiquitous Pareto distribution. For a monopoly service provider with negligible marginal costs, flat rates turn out to maximize profits in most cases. The advantage of evening out the varying preferences for different services among users overcomes the disadvantage of the heaviest users consuming more than the average users. The model is tractable enough that it allows for exploration of the effects of non-zero marginal costs (which in general strengthen the case for metered pricing), and of welfare effects. 1...|$|R
