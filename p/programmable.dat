5|$|The Sinclair Scientific {{calculator}} was a 12-function, pocket-sized {{scientific calculator}} introduced in 1974, dramatically undercutting in price other calculators {{available at the}} time. The Sinclair Scientific <b>Programmable,</b> released a year later, was advertised as the first budget <b>programmable</b> calculator.|$|E
5|$|Both the Sinclair Scientific and the Sinclair Scientific <b>Programmable</b> were {{manufactured}} in England, {{like all other}} Sinclair calculators except the Sinclair President.|$|E
5|$|He {{modified}} the ENIAC {{by making it}} <b>programmable</b> and then wrote programs for it to do the H-bomb calculations verifying that the Teller-Ulam design was feasible and to develop it further.|$|E
5|$|The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, often {{referred}} to as the 808, is a drum machine introduced by the Roland Corporation in 1980 and discontinued in 1983. It was one of the earliest <b>programmable</b> drum machines, with which users could create their own rhythms rather than having to use preset patterns.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair Scientific <b>Programmable</b> was {{introduced}} in 1975, with the same case as the Sinclair Oxford. It was larger than the Scientific, at , and used a larger PP3 battery, but could also be powered by mains electricity.|$|E
5|$|The {{upcoming}} USB Power Delivery Specification revision3.0 defines {{new power}} rules based on supplied wattage. <b>Programmable</b> power supply protocol allows granular control over VBUS power in 10mV steps to facilitate constant current or constant voltage charging. Revision 3.0 also adds extended configuration messages, fast role swap, and deprecates the BFSK protocol.|$|E
5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable <b>programmable</b> {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A <b>programmable</b> calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 in the U.S., the PancakeBot pancake machine {{received}} over $141,000 on Kickstarter. Its target donation request on {{the website}} was $50,000. PancakeBot can produce custom pancakes in various designs, which is performed {{by the use of}} pancake batter in a bottle that is moved by a <b>programmable</b> machine arm atop the griddle. The machine utilizes custom software to accomplish this.|$|E
5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working <b>programmable,</b> fully {{automatic}} computer, with binary digital arithmetic logic, but it lacked the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, it was successfully presented {{to an audience}} of scientists of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was electromechanical rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, {{but it was not a}} general-purpose machine.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{requiring}} all desired functionality to be {{built into}} the language's core, Python {{was designed to be}} highly extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a <b>programmable</b> interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the start because of his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite mindset.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Chevrolet Volt comes {{standard}} with cruise control; remote vehicle start-up system; 17-inch 5-spoke forged painted aluminum wheels; Bluetooth {{wireless technology}} for select phones; audio and navigation {{system with a}} center console capacitive touch panel and DVD and MP3 playback, with voice recognition; OnStar with five years of service; BOSE premium speaker system, with six speakers and sub-woofer; 30 GB hard drive for audio data storage; USB port; three auxiliary, 12-volt, power outlets; power door locks and windows; power adjustable mirrors; <b>programmable</b> time of day charge control; and a 110-volt charge cord.|$|E
5|$|The NPL did {{not have}} the {{expertise}} to build a machine like ACE, so they contacted Tommy Flowers at the General Post Office's (GPO) Dollis Hill Research Laboratory. Flowers, the designer of Colossus, the world's first <b>programmable</b> electronic computer, was committed elsewhere and was unable {{to take part in the}} project, although his team did build some mercury delay lines for ACE. The Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) was also approached for assistance, as was Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} modern AI were planted by {{classical}} philosophers {{who attempted to}} describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in {{the invention of the}} <b>programmable</b> digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley Park is {{a former}} private estate located in Old Bletchley and modern Museum of Cryptography. Conveniently located at the {{junction}} of the Varsity Line with the West Coast Main Line, Bletchley Park, code-named Station X, was {{the location of the}} Allied main code-breaking establishment during World War II. Codes and ciphers of several Axis powers were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. Colossus, the world's first <b>programmable</b> electronic digital computer was put to work here as part of the codebreaking effort. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of World War II is debated.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of <b>programmable</b> electronic computers.|$|E
5|$|The ENIAC (1946) was {{the first}} machine that was both {{electronic}} and general purpose. It was Turing complete, with conditional branching, and <b>programmable</b> to solve {{a wide range of}} problems, but its program was held in the state of switches in patchcords, not in memory, and it could take several days to reprogram. Researchers such as Turing and Zuse investigated the idea of using the computer's memory to hold the program as well as the data it was working on, and it was mathematician John von Neumann who wrote a widely distributed paper describing that computer architecture, still used in almost all computers.|$|E

25|$|The first desktop <b>programmable</b> calculators were {{produced}} in the mid-1960s by Mathatronics and Casio (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first <b>programmable</b> pocket calculator was the HP-65, in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the HP-25C introduced continuous memory, i.e., programs and data were retained in CMOS memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first alphanumeric, <b>programmable,</b> expandable calculator, the HP-41C. It could be expanded with random access memory (RAM, for memory) and read-only memory (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like bar code readers, microcassette and floppy disk drives, paper-roll thermal printers, and miscellaneous communication interfaces (RS-232, HP-IL, HP-IB).|$|E
25|$|In {{a digital}} circuit, an FSM may be built using a <b>programmable</b> logic device, a <b>programmable</b> logic controller, logic gates and flip flops or relays. More specifically, a {{hardware}} implementation requires a register to store state variables, {{a block of}} combinational logic that determines the state transition, and a second block of combinational logic that determines the output of an FSM. One of the classic hardware implementations is the Richards controller.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>programmable</b> {{thermostats}} {{are available}} to control line-voltage systems. Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a <b>programmable</b> thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some Honeywell models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control {{rather than relying on}} the averaging effects of hysteresis). Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.|$|E
