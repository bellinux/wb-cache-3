500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in New England, the Arnolds joined {{a group of}} {{settlers}} from Hingham, Norfolk, England, where they established the new town of Hingham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [...] William Arnold received title to a house lot here in September 1635, but the following spring he and several other settlers were persuaded by Roger Williams {{to join him in}} establishing a new settlement on the Narragansett Bay named Providence Plantation. [...] The younger Arnold wrote in the family record, [...] "Memm. We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636. <b>per</b> <b>me</b> Bennedict Arnold." [...] Arnold received a house lot on what is now North Main Street in Providence, and his father was granted the second lot south of his.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} John Barry, William Arnold was {{banished from}} Hingham {{for reasons that}} were not religious, {{but he does not}} give the actual reason, nor does he cite any sources. [...] Years later, Arnold's son Benedict recorded in the family record: [...] "Memm. [...] We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636. [...] <b>per</b> <b>me</b> Bennedict Arnold." [...] He was using the name Providence loosely, since Providence Plantation had not yet been founded. The Arnolds initially settled with Roger Williams at Seekonk near the western edge of Plymouth Colony where Rehoboth is today. [...] William Arnold stated in 1659: [...] "for as much that I was one that the very first day entred [...] with some others upon the land of providence, and so laid out my money to buy and helpe pay for it". [...] The settlers could not remain in Seekonk because, if they did, Plymouth would be harangued by Massachusetts for harboring its fugitives. [...] Plymouth governor Edward Winslow gently urged Williams to move with his fellow settlers across the Seekonk River into the lands of the Narragansetts. [...] Most historians agree that it was about June 1636 when the small group of settlers moved across the river and settled {{on the bank of the}} Moshassuck River at a place which Williams named Providence Plantation.|$|E

With the addition of music for Lady Macbeth, Macbeth's aria in act 3 was completely re-written—as was a considerable amount of the rest of act 3; a ballet was added in act 3; a chorus began act 4; and the ending of act 4 was [...] also changed, Verdi being determined to drop Macbeth's final aria Mal <b>per</b> <b>me</b> che m'affidai ("Trusting in the prophecies of Hell") in favour of an off-stage death, to end with the triumphal chorus.|$|E
