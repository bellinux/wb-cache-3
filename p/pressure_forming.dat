The following day a decreasing ridge of high pressure {{to the north and}} a trough of low <b>pressure</b> <b>forming</b> off the East Coast of the United States caused Dean to slow in its forward motion and turn northwest. The trough of low <b>pressure</b> <b>forming</b> off the East Coast of the United States was deepening, causing Dean to curve northward while remaining nearly stationary. After remaining nearly stationary, Dean began to accelerate to a forward speed of 17mph (28km/h) as it headed toward Bermuda. Thereafter, Dean intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, whilst the eastern half of the eyewall brushed Bermuda. Dean continued to intensify slightly after passing the island of Bermuda and became a Category 2 hurricane on August 7. While Dean was a Category 2 hurricane, it attained its peak intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) and a minimum pressure of 968mbar (hPa; 28.59inHg).|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for partial forming of a work piece for interior high <b>pressure</b> <b>form,</b> comprises carrying out the forming process via a tool though which a discharge geometry of the work piece is approximated in a sub region of a work piece cross section of the interior high <b>pressure</b> <b>form</b> to create work piece geometries. The work piece cross section is changed by the forming process asymmetrically and symmetrically to a work piece axis (3). The work piece cross section is changed in different radial levels, which are spaced apart from each other in direction of a work piece axis. The tool has a pressing roll (5) with a surface section (4) and the pressing roll is subjected with a force in such a manner that the surface section with the work piece is brought into unit to transform the work piece in a partially transforming step. The pressing roll and the work piece are moved relatively to each other. The surface section of the pressing roll has multi regions of different geometry, by which a definite region is brought into the unit with the work piece by swiveling the pressing roll around a swivel axis (8). The tool has multi pressing rolls, which are aligned in radial direction around the work piece to change the work piece cross section. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a device for partial forming of a work piece for interior high pressure form; and (2) an interior high pressure- formed work piece produced from semi-finished product. USE - Useful for partial forming of a tubular work piece for interior high <b>pressure</b> <b>form</b> (claimed).

50|$|Tropical Storm Heidi was {{the last}} of the four {{tropical}} systems to develop from the extended surface trough of low <b>pressure,</b> <b>forming</b> on September 11 northeast of the Bahamas and intensifying into a tropical storm the next day. After initially moving to the northwest, Heidi curved northeastward and attained its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 14 off the coast of Virginia. The storm failed to become a well-organized system, and it gradually weakened while accelerating north-northeastward. On September 15, shortly after Heidi moved ashore in Maine, it was absorbed by a broad extratropical cyclone over the northern Appalachians.|$|E
50|$|Also in Europe, {{parallel}} research yielded {{an innovative}} {{approach to the}} concept. By 2006, the HEATform method of hot metal gas forming showed evidence of unique metal shapes that had “historically only been possible {{in the domain of}} glass blowing and blow molded parts” with aluminum forming in excess of 270% expansion ratio at a production intended cycle time of 20 seconds. Citing that hardening and subsequent breakage will limit forming of the aluminum alloy below 460 C, the best flow behavior was observed at 550 C. This is significantly higher than the capabilities of warm liquid or warm gas <b>pressure</b> <b>forming.</b> The HEATform techniques of end feeding control achieved uniform wall thickness up to 300% strain values.|$|E

50|$|Voiced {{speech is}} {{produced}} by air streaming from the lungs through the vocal cords, setting them into an oscillating movement.

50|$|The {{rainy season}} is between June and mid-July. It {{is caused by}} hot and humid high <b>pressure</b> <b>forming</b> in the Sea of Okhotsk due to the North Pacific {{anticyclone}} combining with Asiatic continental high pressure. When the two meteorological events meet they form a long jangmajeonseon (Hanja: 장마前線). Beginning in late-May, the North Pacific high pressure forces the weaker continental anticyclone south of the island of Okinawa. This fall to the south then reverses and gradually strengthens as it moves northwards back towards the Korean peninsula. On landfall, heavy monsoon rains lead to torrential downpours and flooding. By August the system has weakened as the southern systems retreat towards the Filipino archipelago.|$|E
50|$|Masonite {{is formed}} using the Mason method, in which wood chips are {{disintegrated}} by saturating them with 100 psi steam, then increasing the steam or air pressure to 400 psi and suddenly releasing them through an orifice to atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> <b>Forming</b> the fibers into boards on a screen, the boards are then pressed and heated {{to form the}} finished product with a smooth burnished finish. (Later a dry process with two burnished surfaces was also used.) The original lignin in the wood serves to bond the fibers without any added adhesive. The long fibers give Masonite a high bending strength, tensile strength, density, and stability. Unlike other composite wood panels, no formaldehyde-based resins are used to bind the fibers in Masonite.|$|E
50|$|For {{several years}} now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a {{pressure}} or high pressure (thermo)forming process {{is used to}} fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) 3-5 and for three-dimensional cell cultivation 6-8. The process {{is derived from the}} macroscopic trapped sheet forming process 2. This is a simple variation of vacuum or <b>pressure</b> <b>forming</b> without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.|$|E
40|$|The Earth 2 ̆ 7 s general {{atmospheric}} circulation {{in the tropics}} and subtropics is simply described. Intense heating by the sun at the equator causes air to rise and spread out polewards in the upper troposphere. As this air moves toward the poles it cools and begins to descend back to the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface at 200 - 300 {{north and south of}} the equator. Upon reaching the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface this air either returns to the equator or moves polewards. Where air rises in this circulation, low air <b>pressure</b> <b>forms</b> and there is intense instability and condensation of moisture with subsequent heavy rainfall. Where air descends, high air <b>pressure</b> <b>forms</b> with intense evaporation, clear skies and stability. This tropical circulation of air is termed the Hadley cell and the high <b>pressure</b> that <b>forms</b> encircles the globe coincident with the great sub-tropical deserts. Australian climate is dominated by this circulation cell and the deserts that form as a consequence. The Hadley cells migrate annually with the apparent movement of the su n north and south of the equator...|$|R
