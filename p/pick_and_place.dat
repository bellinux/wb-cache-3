40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{to develop}} a novel strategy to relax the adhesion forces for <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> <b>placing</b> operation in a micro range. In a micro range, the attracting forces such as the van der Waals, capillary, and electrostatic forces become dominating due to a scaling effect. The attractive forces cause the adhesion between the object and the endeffector. Therefore, {{it is hard to}} manipulate an object in a micro range. This paper shows that when an oscillating endeffector approaches to an object, the adhesion between the object and the oscillating endeffector can be reduced. Also, based on the experimental analysis, we clarify the relation between the oscillation and the pushing amount of the endeffector on the object, where the adhesion force can be released effectively. Using this relaxation method and the relation, we develop a strategy for <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> <b>placing</b> operation in a micro range. This strategy provides an accurate manipulation. Some experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach...|$|R

40|$|A spline-based {{method of}} {{programming}} smooth trajectories for pick-and-place operations is introduced. Unlike continuous-path operations, which impose a unique Cartesian trajectory, {{an infinite number}} of smooth trajectories can be described between any given <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> its corresponding <b>place</b> configuration. The method begins with the mapping of the <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> the <b>place</b> configuration in Cartesian space into joint-coordinate space, using a general-purpose inverse kinematics package that handles singularities and redundancies. Next, a trajectory, composed of a C 2 -continuous, periodic cubic spline segment, is defined between the <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> the <b>place</b> configurations in the joint-coordinate space. It is demonstrated that C 2 -continuity will prevail in Cartesian space as well. The software implementing this method includes a graphics package as well as an interface to an offline programming system to realize the synthesis of the actual robot motion. Details of the procedure are illustrated with a numerical example applied to a commercial industrial robot...|$|R

40|$|Vision guided {{robotics}} {{for manufacturing}} {{is an area}} which has diversified applications and geometry based issues to be addressed. The paper {{is an attempt to}} solve a typical problem that could be faced by an bearing manufacturing industry incorporating vision assisted robot based sorting of annular metallic ball bearings. The robots incorporating magnetic grippers are the ones which are more prone to the problem of picking up closely placed components where in picking of one component would disturb the position of the other. It is obvious that in an electromagnetic gripper this task could be achieved by controlling the current in the windings of the gripper from which the magnetic field could be altered to apply only the required gripping force. Though online cameras could be a better choice for such application whereby new position of the dislocated neighboring component could be easily found, this paper is just an attempt to avoid the neighbouring parts being disturbed from their actual positions. The component’s priority for being <b>picked</b> <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> in the respective containers might have to be varied dynamically based on the locations of the object of interest and the neighboring object. Generally this is a particular issue required to be addressed during the <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> <b>placing</b> operation involving ferromagnetic parts handled by an electromagnetic gripper. The main objective of the paper is to develop an instantaneous inverse kinematics scheme for the typical cases of closed located bearings which has to be taken care for change in priority of <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> spatial positioning of the electromagnetic gripper.

The traditional rigid grippers and vacuum packaging systems, which {{have been widely used}} in food industry, have difficulties to perform such a task because the rigid gripper may damage the food material and the vacuum system needs a flat surface to allow suction. New grasping mechanism providing gentle grasps is required to cope with this task.|$|R
