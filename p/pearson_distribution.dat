40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose and compare two {{different}} methods, based either on multicanonical Monte-Carlo (MMC) simulations or Pearson fitting, for performance evaluation of realistic wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission systems. Both methods are able to account for linear and nonlinear propagation effects, and {{can be applied to}} any modulation format. As regards MMC, we estimate the distribution of the received sample, accounting for noise, intersymbol interference (ISI) and inter-channel nonlinearities, by adopting a combined noise and pattern perturbation method. As an alternative to simulations, Gaussian or chi-square fitting techniques have been proposed in the literature. Anyway, none of them is able to provide accurate performance estimation for both on-off keying (OOK) and differential (quadrature) phase-shift keying (D(Q) PSK) modulations. In this work we show that the pdf of the received sample is well approximated by <b>Pearson</b> <b>distributions</b> in all the above-mentioned cases. <b>Pearson</b> <b>distributions</b> are completely determined by their first four moments, which can be estimated by standard Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with less computational burden than typically needed by the MMC method. Finally, for each modulation format, we assess the accuracy of the various fitting techniques by comparing the fitted distributions with those obtained by either MMC simulations in the nonlinear propagation regime, or exact analytical methods in the linear propagation regime...|$|R
50|$|Till {{the end of}} 19th century, Pearson {{noticed the}} {{existence}} of significant skewness within some biological observations. In order to model the observations regardless of being normal or skewed, Pearson, {{in a series of}} articles published from 1893 to 1916, devised the <b>Pearson</b> <b>distribution,</b> a family of continuous probability distributions including normal distribution and many skewed distributions, and proposed a method of statistical analysis consisted of using the <b>Pearson</b> <b>distribution</b> to model the observation and performing the test of goodness of fit to remark how well the model and the observation really fits.|$|E

5000|$|The basic {{ideas and}} {{approaches}} were stated in his doctor thesis “Mathematical Processing of Astronomic and Space Information {{in case of}} the Non-Gauss Observation Errors”, presented by Dzhun in 1992. His scientific works are devoted mainly to {{different aspects of the}} nonclassical theory of errors development, studying of its axiomatic foundations and creation of the adapted procedures at mathematical modelling and data analysis. He developed the analytical theory of the weight functions and the method of the mathematical models diagnostics on its base. Y.V. Dzhun firstly in the world practice disclosed that the relative random vibrations of the major index series in global economy submitted to the VII type Pearson’s distribution. Unfortunately this fact is overpassed by the scientists. For example, R.C. Merton (Harvard University) and M.S. Sholes (Stanford University) in their work “Formula for the Valuation of Stock”, took the Nobel Prize in 1997 in the sphere of economics, traditionally use the Gauss Law, though this Law doesn’t give the guarantee of normality. Regardless of American mathematician V.M. Gentelman, Y.V. Dzhun developed the theory Lp - of evaluation and presented non-diagonal of the informative matrix Lp - distribution. He created the theory of informative methods of evaluation of astronomic observations accuracy in case of the Non-Gauss errors distribution. He developed the theory of the VII type <b>Pearson</b> <b>distribution</b> with the diagonal information matrix, and he proposed the method of getting of its parameters effective estimations, which is simpler, than the method proposed by Jeffreys. Y.V. Dzhun proposed to substitute the fundamental principle of the Gauss maximal weight by the Fisher principle of maximum of information with the purpose of evolution and generalization of the procedures of the least squares classic method. The basic results of Y.V. Dzhun researches are published in the magazine: “Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies” - Allerton Press, Inc. New York.|$|E

40|$|Differential {{equation}} {{models of}} infectious disease have undergone many theoretical extensions that are invaluable {{for the evaluation}} of disease spread. For instance, while one traditionally uses a bilinear term to describe the incidence rate of infection, physically more realistic generalizations exist to account for effects such as the saturation of infection. However, such theoretical extensions of recovery rates in differential equation models have only started to be developed. This is despite the fact that a constant rate often does not provide a good description of the dynamics of recovery and that the recovery rate is arguably as important as the incidence rate in governing the dynamics of a system. We provide a first-principles derivation of state-dependent and time-varying recovery rates in differential equation models of infectious disease. Through this derivation, we demonstrate how to obtain time-varying and state-dependent recovery rates based on the family of <b>Pearson</b> <b>distributions</b> and a power-law distribution, respectively. For recovery rates based on the family of <b>Pearson</b> <b>distributions,</b> we show that uncertainty in skewness, in comparison to other statistical moments, is at least two times more impactful on the sensitivity of predicting an epidemic's peak. In addition, using recovery rates based on a power-law distribution, we provide a procedure to obtain state-dependent recovery rates. For such state-dependent rates, we derive a natural connection between recovery rate parameters with the mean and standard deviation of a power-law distribution, illustrating the impact that standard deviation has on the shape of an epidemic wave...|$|R
