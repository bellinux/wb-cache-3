50|$|<b>Pluronic</b> P123(PEG-PPG-PEG) {{symmetric}} {{triblock copolymer}} constitutes of poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO) and poly (propylene oxide) (PPO). The unique characteristic of PPO block exhibiting hydrophobicity at temperatures above 288K and {{solubility in water}} at temperatures below 288K lead to formation of micelle consisting of PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymers. Some studies report that the hydrophobic core contains PPO block, and a hydrophilic corona consists of PEO block. In 30wt% aqueous solution <b>Pluronic</b> P123® forms a cubic gel phase.|$|E
50|$|Triton X {{detergents}} are distantly {{related to}} <b>Pluronic</b> range of detergents marketed by BASF. The pluronics are triblock copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide with the ethylene oxide segments being more hydrophilic than the propylene oxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pluronic</b> P-123 is the tradename for a triblock {{copolymer}} manufactured by the BASF Corporation. The nominal chemical formula is HO(CH2CH2O)20(CH2CH(CH3)O)70(CH2CH2O)20H, which {{corresponds to a}} molecular weight of around 5800 g/mol. Triblock copolymers based on poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(propylene glycol)-poly(ethylene glycol) are known generically as poloxamer, and similar materials are manufactured by other companies.|$|E
50|$|Pluronics {{have been}} {{utilized}} in printing application {{due to their}} unique gelation properties. Below physiological temperatures, the pluronics exhibit low viscosity. However, at physiological temperatures, the pluronics form a gel. However, the formed gel is dominated by physical interactions. A more permanent pluronic-based network can be formed through the modification of the <b>pluronic</b> chain with acrylate groups that may be chemically cross-linked.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{the lengths}} of the polymer blocks can be customized, many {{different}} poloxamers exist that have slightly different properties. For the generic term [...] "poloxamer", these copolymers are commonly named {{with the letter}} [...] "P" [...] (for poloxamer) followed by three digits: the first two digits x 100 give the approximate molecular mass of the polyoxypropylene core, and the last digit x 10 gives the percentage polyoxyethylene content (e.g. P407 = poloxamer with a polyoxypropylene molecular mass of 4,000 g/mol and a 70% polyoxyethylene content) [...] For the <b>Pluronic</b> and Synperonic tradenames, coding of these copolymers starts with a letter to define its physical form at room temperature (L = liquid, P = paste, F = flake (solid)) followed by two or three digits, The first digit (two digits in a three-digit number) in the numerical designation, multiplied by 300, indicates the approximate molecular weight of the hydrophobe; and the last digit x 10 gives the percentage polyoxyethylene content (e.g., L61 indicates a polyoxypropylene molecular mass of 1,800 g/mol and a 10% polyoxyethylene content). In the example given, poloxamer 181 (P181) = <b>Pluronic</b> L61 and Synperonic PE/L 61.|$|E
50|$|Poloxamer 407 is a {{hydrophilic}} {{non-ionic surfactant}} {{of the more}} general class of copolymers known as poloxamers. Poloxamer 407 is a triblock copolymer consisting of a central hydrophobic block of polypropylene glycol flanked by two hydrophilic blocks of polyethylene glycol. The approximate lengths of the two PEG blocks is 101 repeat units while the approximate length of the propylene gycol block is 56 repeat units. This particular compound is also known by the BASF trade name <b>Pluronic</b> F127 or by the Croda trade name Synperonic PE/F 127.|$|E
5000|$|The {{only other}} group besides Woods' to report {{successful}} 7 day storage of kidneys was Liu and Humphries [...] in 1973. They had 3 out of 7 dogs surviving, after their kidneys had been stored for 7 days followed by reimplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy. Their best dog had a peak post reimplantation creatinine of 50 mg/l (0.44 mmol/l). Liu used well hydrated dogs undergoing a mannitol diuresis and stored the kidneys at 9 °C - 10 °C using a perfusate derived from human PPF. The PPF was further fractionated {{by using a}} highly water-soluble polymer (<b>Pluronic</b> F-38), and sodium acetyl tryptophanate and sodium caprylate {{were added to the}} PPF as stabilisers to permit pasteurisation. To this solution were added human albumin, heparin, mannitol, glucose, magnesium sulphate, potassium chloride, insulin, methyl prednisolone, carbenicillin, and water to adjust the osmolality to 300-310 mosmol/kg. The perfusate was exchanged after 3.5 days storage. Perfusate pressure was 60 mm Hg or less, at a pump rate of 60 per minute. Perfusate pH was 7.12-7.32 (at 37 °C), Pco2 27-47 mm Hg, and Po2 173-219 mm Hg. In a further report on this study Humphries [...] found that when the experiments were repeated with a new batch of PPF no survivors were obtained, and histology of the survivors from the original experiment showed glomerular hypercellularity which he attributed to a possible toxic effect of the <b>Pluronic</b> polymer.|$|E
50|$|All-terrain {{microfluidics}} is {{a method}} used to transport liquid droplets over non-traditional surface types. Unlike traditional microfluidics platform, which are generally restricted to planar and horizontal surfaces, ATDA enables droplet manipulation over curved, non-horizontal, and inverted surfaces. This is made possible by incorporating flexible thin sheets of copper and polyimide into the surface via a rapid prototyping method. This device works very well with many liquids, including aqueous buffers, solutions of proteins and DNA, and undiluted bovine serum. ATDA is compatible with silicone oil or <b>pluronic</b> additives, such as F-68, which reduce non-specific absorption and biofouling when dealing with biological fluids such as proteins, biological serums, and DNA. A drawback of a setup like this is accelerated droplet evaporation. ATDA {{is a form of}} open digital microfluidics, and as such the device  device needs to be encapsulated in a humidified environment in order to minimize droplet evaporation.|$|E
50|$|Sericin {{has also}} been used in {{medicine}} and cosmetics. Due to its elasticity and tensile strength, along with a natural affinity for keratin, sericin is primarily used in medicine for wound suturing. It also has a natural infection resistance, and is used variably due to excellent biocompatibility, and thus is used commonly as a wound coagulant as well. When used in cosmetics, sericin {{has been found to}} improve skin elasticity and several anti-aging factors, including an anti-wrinkle property. This is done by minimizing water loss from the skin. To determine this, scientists ran several experimental procedures, including a hydroxyproline assay, impedance measurements, water loss from the epidermis and scanning electron microscopy to analyze the rigidity and dryness of the skin. The presence or sericin increases hydroxyproline in the stratum corneum, which in turn, decrease skin impedance, thus increasing skin moisture. Adding in <b>pluronic</b> and carbopol, two other factors that can be included in sericin gels, perform the action of repairing natural moisture factors (NMF), along with minimizing water loss, and in turn, improving skin moisture.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 and <b>Pluronic</b> F 68 as excipients for formulating in situ gelling systems for ocular drug delivery. Thermal transitions have been studied in aqueous solutions of <b>Pluronic</b> F 127, <b>Pluronic</b> F 68 {{as well as their}} binary mixtures using differential scanning calorimetry, rheological measurements, and dynamic light scattering. It was established that the formation of transparent gels at physiologically relevant temperatures is observed only in the case of 20 wt % of <b>Pluronic</b> F 127. The addition of <b>Pluronic</b> F 68 to <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 solutions increases the gelation temperature of binary formulation to above physiological range of temperatures. The biocompatibility evaluation of these formulations using slug mucosa irritation assay and bovine corneal erosion studies revealed that these polymers and their combinations do not cause significant irritation. In vitro drug retention study on glass surfaces and freshly excised bovine cornea showed superior performance of 20 wt % <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 compared to other formulations. In addition, in vivo studies in rabbits demonstrated better retention performance of 20 wt % <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 compared to <b>Pluronic</b> F 68.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{following}} research was to provide an optimized particle stabilized foam of Laponite and <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 in water by understanding (1) the Laponite-Pluronic interactions and properties for improved performance in a particle stabilized foam and (2) the interfacial properties between air and the Laponite-Pluronic complex. These studies were conducted using both bulk and interfacial rheology, XRD, sessile droplet, TGA and UV-vis. Two novel and simple techniques, lamella break point and capillary breakup extensional rheometry, were used to both understand the Laponite <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 interaction and determine a different mechanism for foaming properties. Bulk rheological properties identified an optimal Laponite concentration of 2 % with <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 ranging from 2. 5 % and 6. 5 %, due to the ease of flow for the dispersion. The <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 was observed to enhance the Laponite bulk rheological properties in solution. Additionally TGA showed a similar trend in thermal resistance to water with both addition of Laponite and <b>Pluronic</b> L 62. XRD demonstrated that 0. 25 % <b>Pluronic</b> intercalated into Laponite from dried 2 % Laponite films. XRD demonstrated that the Laponite matrix was saturated at 1 % <b>Pluronic</b> L 62. UV-vis demonstrated that a monolayer of <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 is observed up to 0. 65 % <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 onto Laponite. Interfacial rheology showed that Laponite enhances <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 at the air-liquid interface by improving the storage modulus as low at 0. 65 % <b>Pluronic</b> L 62 with 2 % Laponite. The lamella breakpoint of Laponite with <b>Pluronic</b> films indicate strong film interaction due to higher increases in mass. Extensional rheology indicates that 2. 5 % to 6. 5 % <b>Pluronic</b> with 2 % Laponite show the most filament resistance to stretching...|$|E

When associated with liposomes, the PEO moiety of the block co-polymer is expected to inhibit liposome–cell adhesion.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{systematic}} investigation into the gelation behavior of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) and <b>Pluronic</b> (poly(ethylene oxide). poly(propylene oxide) -poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymers) pseudopolyrotaxane (PPR) hydrogels are reported here {{in terms of the}} effects of temperature, alpha-CD concentration, and <b>Pluronic</b> type (<b>Pluronic</b> F 68 and <b>Pluronic</b> F 127). It was found that alpha-CD significantly modifies the gelation behavior of <b>Pluronic</b> solutions and that the PPR hydrogels are highly sensitive to changes in the alpha-CD concentration. In some cases, the addition of alpha-CD was found to be detrimental to the gelation process, leading to slower gelation kinetics and weaker gels than with <b>Pluronic</b> alone. However, in other cases, the hydrogels formed {{in the presence of the}} alpha-CDs reached higher moduli and showed faster gelation kinetics than with <b>Pluronic</b> alone and in some instances alpha-CD allowed the formation of hydrogels from <b>Pluronic</b> solutions that would normally not undergo gelation. Depending on composition and ratio of alpha-CD/Pluronic, these highly viscoelastic hydrogels displayed elastic shear modulus values ranging from 2 kPa to 7 MPa, gelation times ranging from a few seconds to a few hours and self-healing behaviors post failure.

40|$|A {{simple and}} facile method for the {{patterning}} of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) was described via selective ion irradiation and oxygen plasma etching. Thin <b>Pluronic</b> films containing HAuCl 4 as the precursor of GNPs were selectively irradiated through a pattern mask with 200 keV proton ions to generate GNP-embedded <b>Pluronic</b> patterns.

Full-thickness excision skin wounds were made in normal and diabetic Wistar rats to evaluate the effect of saline, saline plus vitamin C (antioxidant sol), <b>Pluronic</b> F 127, or <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 plus vitamin C (antioxidant sol-gel). The rate of wound contraction, the levels of epidermal and dermal maturation, collagen synthesis, and apoptosis production in the wound tissue were determined. In vitro data showed that after 6 hours of air exposure, the order of the scavenging abilities for HOCl, H 2 O 2, and O 2 [*]- was antioxidant sol-gel > antioxidant saline > <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 = saline. After 7 and 14 days of wound injury, the antioxidant sol-gel improved wound healing significantly by accelerated epidermal and dermal maturation, an increase in collagen content, and a decrease in apoptosis formation.

40|$|The {{long term}} in vivo {{biocompatibility}} {{is an essential}} feature for the design and development of sustained drug release carriers. In the recent intraocular drug delivery studies, hydrogels were suggested as sustained release carriers. The biocompatibility test for these hydrogels, however, was commonly performed only through in vitro cell culture examination, which is insufficient before the clinical applications. We compared three thermosensitive hydrogels that have been suggested as the carriers for drugs by their gel-solution phase-change properties. A new block terpolymer (PEOz-PCL-PEOz, ECE) and two commercial products (Matrigel® and <b>Pluronic</b> F 127) were studied. The results demonstrated that the ocular media remained translucent for ECE and <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 in the first 2 weeks, but cataract formation for Matrigel occurred in 2 weeks and for <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 in 1 month, while turbid media was observed for both Matrigel and <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 in 2 months. The electrophysiology examinations showed significant neuroretinal toxicity of Matrigel and <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 but good biocompatibility of ECE.

40|$|High quality {{magnetite}} crystals {{have previously}} been synthesized in a <b>pluronic</b> medium using a biomineralization protein, mms 6, derived from magnetotactic bacteria. However, until present {{these studies have}} been conducted only in the solution phase, for which particle aggregation and movement of particles {{to the bottom of the}} <b>pluronic</b> medium limit characterization opportunities, including how the particles affect the <b>pluronic</b> structure. In this study, magnetite synthesis is completed in a solid <b>pluronic</b> gel phase for which magnetite particles are suspended and can be characterized using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). This study has shown that the proteins alone do not affect the <b>Pluronic</b> structure, except slightly for the case of the highest concentration of His-mms 6. In addition, mixed chlorides may act to stabilize the self-organization of the <b>Pluronic</b> due in electrostatic interactions. This study has shown that magnetite synthesis in <b>Pluronic</b> is a function of several parameters including the concentration and size of the protein used for templating, the concentration of the magnetite, and the viscosity of the <b>Pluronic</b> gel. Our results indicate that magnetite particle synthesis in <b>Pluronic</b> causes the inter-micellar distance to decrease, most notably for the case of the highest concentration of His-mms 6. This may be attributed to an apparent compression in the gel because of the magnetite particles and the large size of His-mms 6. Large magnetite particles can be formed in solid <b>Pluronic</b> gel in the absence of protein, indicating that <b>Pluronic</b> alone may template particle synthesis. This is in contrast to magnetite formation in the solution phase, for which either the His-mms 6 or C 25 protein is required for templating. Disruption in the FCC structure is observed for the case of the highest His-mms 6 concentration, which is consistent with the larger size of the His-mms 6 protein. Disruption of the FCC structure may eliminate the possible templating ability of the <b>Pluronic</b> gel, as evidenced by the lack of large particles present in the case of the highest His-mms 6 concentration. The large scattering due to the magnetite particles suggests the use of a lower concentration of iron chlorides so as to be able to resolve all the higher order peaks in the gel. Compared to the solution phase experiments, the solid gel phase synthesis method results in a gel with a much higher viscosity, which is likely to impede particle growth. Thus, the viscosity of the gel may be used to control the particle size in the biomineralization synthesis platform...|$|E

The MTX-loaded <b>Pluronic</b> P 105 /F 127 mixed micelle exhibited the spherical shape with about 22 nm in diameter, high encapsulation efficiency (about 85 %) and pH-dependent in vitro drug release. In this study, A- 549 and KBv cell lines were selected as multidrug resistance tumor cell models, while H- 460 and KB cell lines were chosen as sensitive tumor cells. The MTX-loaded <b>Pluronic</b> P 105 /F 127 mixed micelle exhibited significant higher in vitro cytotoxicity in multidrug resistant tumor cells than that of control (MTX injection) mainly because of higher cellular uptake of MTX. The pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the <b>Pluronic</b> micelles significantly prolonged systemic circulation time of MTX compared to MTX injection. Moreover, a much stronger antitumor efficacy in KBv tumor xenografts nude mice was observed in the MTX-loaded <b>Pluronic</b> P 105 /F 127 mixed micelle group, than MTX. Collectively, <b>Pluronic</b> P 105 /F 127 mixed micelles could significantly enhance the antitumor activity of MTX and might be a promising drug delivery platform for multidrug resistance modulation.

30|$|Recently, a triblock {{amphiphilic}} copolymer, poly (ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide-b-ethylene oxide) F 127 (known as <b>Pluronic</b> F 127), {{has been}} demonstrated to enhance the stability and activity of free OPHs through {{the interaction between the}} hydrophobic segments of polymers and the hydrophobic regions of enzyme surface (Suthiwangcharoen and Nagarajan 2014; Kim et al. 2014 b). In addition to OPHs, various enzymes can be modified by direct conjugation or covalent binding with <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 (Wu et al. 2014, 2015; Zhang et al. 2013). Although advances in the conjugation of <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 and free enzymes have been made so far, the application of <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 in immobilized enzymes has not been achieved. One possible reason is that the current methods of preparing enzyme-polymer conjugates are performed in aqueous phase (Suthiwangcharoen and Nagarajan 2014; Kim et al. 2014 b) and the carrier-immobilized enzymes are not soluble in aqueous solution. More importantly, the improving effect of <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 in the catalytic properties of free OPH has not been demonstrated in immobilized OPH yet. Thus, it is of interest to develop a simple method of preparing immobilized OPH-Pluronic F 127 conjugates with the expectation of maintaining the high stability and activity of OPH with <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|Summary This paper, for {{the first}} time, {{demonstrates}} that exposure of cells to the poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) block copolymer, <b>Pluronic</b> P 85, results in a substantial decrease in ATP levels selectively in MDR cells. Cells expressing high levels of functional P-glycoprotein (MCF- 7 /ADR, KBv; LLC-MDR 1; Caco- 2, bovine brain microvessel endothelial cells [BBMECs]) are highly responsive to <b>Pluronic</b> treatment, while cells {{with low levels of}} P-glycoprotein expression (MCF- 7, KB, LLC-PK 1, human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs] C 2 C 12 myoblasts) are much less responsive to such treatment. Cytotoxicity studies suggest that <b>Pluronic</b> acts as a chemosensitizer and potentiates cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in MDR cells. The ability of <b>Pluronic</b> to inhibit P-glycoprotein and sensitize MDR cells appears to be a result of ATP depletion. Because many mechanisms of drug resistance are energy dependent, a successful strategy for treating MDR cancer could be based on selective energy depletion in MDR cells. Therefore, the finding of the energy-depleting effects of <b>Pluronic</b> P 85, in combination with its sensitization effects is of considerable theoretical and practical significance. © 2001 Cance...|$|E

The final concentration of <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 was adjusted to 37 % (m/V) at 4 oC. Afterwards, {{the samples were}} lyophilized. Characterization was performed in purified samples (after <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 removal), samples with 10 % (m/V) of <b>Pluronic</b> F 127 and calcined samples at 1000 oC by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Analyses by XRD of non-calcined samples showed that hydroxyapatite was obtained, in which the samples prepared at 0 oC exhibited larger peaks attributed to lower crystallite sizes. For the calcined samples, both Raman spectroscopy and XRD exhibited hydroxyapatite for the syntheses at 37 and 90 oC whereas the one prepared 90 oC were identified as β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). Morphological analysis by SEM indicated that the hydroxyapatite was sphere or rod agglomerates in mesoporous morphology for the nanocomposites prepared at 0 and 37 oC, while the sample prepared at 90 oC was nanospheres agglomerated into a smother matrix.
