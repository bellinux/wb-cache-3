50|$|The base of {{the soup}} can be water but is more {{commonly}} a type of fish stock. Normal fish stock can be used, but anchovy stock is a common choice. Various ingredients, such as onions, garlic, ginger and bean paste, also {{can be added to}} the stock to provide more flavor, although some preparations are so simple that nothing more than <b>plain</b> <b>stock</b> is used. In Malaysia, you can also try the dried version with soup served separately.|$|E
50|$|The Model 1890 was a slide action, top {{ejecting}} rifle with an 18 inch magazine tube {{under the}} barrel. It had a 24 inch octagonal barrel, a <b>plain</b> walnut <b>stock,</b> and an overall weight of approximately 6 lbs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{parent company}} held a strong {{position}} from New England and the mid-Atlantic coast to the far Western <b>plains.</b> Its <b>stock</b> holdings were enormous. In 1910, {{it was the second}} largest stockholder in the Pennsylvania Railroad and the third largest in the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad, besides owning large blocks of American Express, Norfolk & Western Railroad and other shares.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1903 was {{available}} in a [...] "standard" [...] and a [...] "deluxe" [...] version (also called [...] "plain" [...] and [...] "fancy" [...] versions). The standard version had a <b>plain</b> walnut <b>stock</b> with a plan straight grip. The deluxe version had a checkered walnut pistol grip stock with a checkered forearm. A tubular magazine located in the buttstock held ten cartridges.|$|R
5000|$|S-prefix: were {{manufactured}} for a 1962 United States military contract. S-prefixed {{serial numbers}} ran from approximately 1,000 to 23,000 with [...] "U.S." [...] on {{the receiver and}} [...] "P" [...] proof markings on the barrel and receiver. The guns have a Parkerized finish with a 20 in barrel and <b>plain</b> <b>stock</b> with plastic butt plate and no sling swivels. A few later contracts produced smaller numbers of guns with sling swivels and serial numbers in the high 900,000 range. Some had [...] "duckbill spreader" [...] shot diverters for use by United States Navy SEALs. Others were fitted with a ventilated handguard and bayonet adopter. New bayonets were manufactured by General Cutlery, Inc. and Canada Arsenal, Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|The church exterior, in <b>plain</b> red <b>stock</b> brick with Monks Park stone {{dressings}} for {{the doors}} and windows, slated roof and small bell-turret on its western gable, is not particularly impressive; but with its concrete vaulted roof supported on stone ribs, Pevsner and Lloyd, in their Buildings of England: Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, considered that it has [...] "an intriguing and distinguished design internally".|$|R
60|$|They {{were now}} in the bosom of the second Bighorn ridge, with another lofty and snow-crowned {{mountain}} full in view to the west. Fifteen miles of western course brought them, on the following day, down into an intervening <b>plain,</b> well <b>stocked</b> with buffalo. Here the Snakes and Flatheads joined with the white hunters in a successful hunt, that soon filled the camp with provisions.|$|R

50|$|Frederick Walker traversed the Hughenden {{district}} in October 1861, leaving a blazed tree where Hughenden is today. William Landsborough explored the region the following year. Both parties had {{been searching for}} evidence of the ill-fated Burke & Wills expedition. Although the search itself was not successful, the real success lay in Landsborough's investigation of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the inland rivers. The discovery {{of the importance of}} the Flinders and Gregory <b>Plains</b> for <b>stock,</b> and of the Albert River as an export and supply port led to the opening up of Western Queensland.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame members}} are {{generally}} made from <b>plain</b> rectangular <b>stock</b> but are often visually enhanced {{through the application}} of cock beading or applied mouldings. Typically a frame member will be between 25mm to 50mm in width, depending upon the application and the desired appearance of the cabinet. For built in cabinets, it is common for stiles that are to abut a wall to be cut wider than the final size so that these may be scribed to the shape of the wall. This compensates for out of plumb or uneven walls, which are common in many houses.|$|R
500|$|After {{the very}} close {{relationship}} between the quagga and extant plains zebras was discovered, Reinhold Rau started the Quagga Project in 1987 in South Africa to create a quagga-like zebra population by selectively breeding for a reduced stripe pattern from <b>plains</b> zebra <b>stock,</b> with the eventual aim of introducing them to the quagga's former range. [...] To differentiate between the quagga and the zebras of the project, they {{refer to it as}} [...] "Rau quaggas". The founding population consisted of 19 individuals from Namibia and South Africa, chosen because they had reduced striping on the rear body and legs. The first foal of the project was born in 1988. Once a sufficiently quagga-like population has been created, it will be released in the Western Cape.|$|R
50|$|In Singapore, Hainanese chicken rice {{is served}} {{everywhere}} from school canteens, hawker stalls to major restaurants. There are Hainanese chicken rice stalls that have established franchise or branch outlets, and these include Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice, Boon Tong Kee, Loy Kee, Wee Nam Kee and others which have many outlets island wide. It {{is very common}} to find Rice Balls in such chain eateries. The price range is around S$2.50-4.50 (the latter if the dish includes a drumstick). Most stalls serve extras such as braised dark soy hard boiled egg, chicken liver, braised dark soy firm tofu (Tau-kwa) and kai-lan with oyster sauce as side dishes {{and a bowl of}} <b>plain</b> chicken <b>stock</b> soup. The choice of white (steamed) or roasted chicken is commonly available at almost all eateries.|$|R
5000|$|The erxian (called yi6 yin4 二弦 in Cantonese) {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the yizai (二仔) amongst older Cantonese opera musicians. The neck of most erxian is made of hardwood (often suanzhi ( [...] , rosewood) or zitan ( [...] , rosewood or red sandalwood). The sound chamber is made of a large section of bamboo with a dome-shaped ring of hardwood glued on the front end, making the actual playable face of the chamber about half the size of the entire face. The back of the sound chamber is not covered with any lattice work like those of erhu or gaohu. Erxian can be found with very ornate dragon heads, ruyi (如意) heads, or a very <b>plain</b> box-cut <b>stock</b> head. Earlier erxian very closely resembled the jinghu of Beijing opera in size, construction, and playing technique.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Arsenal Gatehouse or Beresford Gate stands solitary at {{the north}} end of the square, {{isolated}} from the Arsenal since the rerouting of the A206. It was designed by Colonel John T. Jones in 1828. The oldest parts are of <b>plain</b> yellow <b>stock</b> brick with some stone detailing. The later additions are of red brick and feature three large windows on each side and a clock at the top of its south-facing gable. The gate has three openings which are currently closed off by iron fences. The gatehouse is flanked by two original pavilions, both adorned with recessed rectangular panels and surmounted by brass mortars. An 1859 western annex features a bell tower. Two cattle drinking troughs of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association from the 1890s and two modern stone benches have been placed on the south side of the gatehouse.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1870s, cattle {{ranching}} {{and related}} livestock raising {{was a large}} and prosperous business in Montana. Cattle and horses were valuable commodities and always subject to rustling by thieves. [...] After 1879, with the threat from the Indian wars diminished on the <b>plains</b> of Montana, <b>stock</b> ranches and open range cattle ranching moved east into Central and Eastern Montana.

40|$|The {{death of}} the last quagga on August 12, 1889 {{represented}} {{the loss of a}} long-term resident of the Artis Magistra Zoo in Amsterdam, at the time a private institution accessible only to members. The mare’s death was not recognised at the time as signifying the extinction of the quagga, largely due to the vague and general usage of the term ‘quagga’. The delay in understanding the significance of this death, {{and the way in which}} quaggas rapidly disappeared in the wild in southern Africa in the nineteenth century, have been overshadowed in scientific and historical accounts by debates concerning the classification of the quagga and its re-creation by elective breeding from <b>plains</b> zebra <b>stock.</b> This paper examines quaggas in terms of their relationships with each other and with other animals on the southern African plains, considering how they have been remembered in different contexts and reflecting on what has been lost in the light of attempts to erase and redeem their extinction...|$|R

60|$|But Babo had no notion to {{go hungry}} the second time, so he hunted around till {{he found a}} stone as big as his head. All day he carried it, first under one arm, and then under the other. The wise man stepped along briskly enough, but the sweat ran down Babo's face like drops on the window in an April shower.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new insight enabling the empirical study of media capture: minority shareholders of newspapers and readers face similar risks. Both are adversely affected when corrupt insiders use the newspaper for personal profit and receive invisible revenues. This means that relevant data on influence and exploitation of newspaper has been hiding in <b>plain</b> sight in <b>stock</b> exchange or over-the-counter prices, since stock transactions reflect {{the value of}} this capture. Empirical data is consistent with increasing levels of looting in France during the 1930 s. We provide a comparison with Britain and argue that Britain managed to protect its newspapers better...|$|R

50|$|The {{withdrawal}} of card money in 1717 without a valid replacement left New France in recession (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). In 1722 {{there was an}} attempt to introduce copper coins; however, they were not widely accepted, especially by merchants, and therefore were discontinued (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). Finally in 1727, in response {{to the demands of the}} merchants, the king re-issued card money as the official tender of New France (Bank of Canada 2013). This new reissued card money was printed on <b>plain</b> card <b>stock</b> without colors and was marked for value by either cutting or removing the corners from the cards (Marsh 1985). The new card money would be redeemed each year for goods or bills of exchange, which could be redeemed in France (Bank of Canada 1990, 7). Unfortunately, the new card money quickly gave rise to the same issues as before, and during the War of the Spanish Succession finances in France went from bad to bankruptcy (Heaton 1928, 655). By 1757, the government of New France had discontinued all payments made in specie and was relying on card money, “ordonnances” (promissory notes from the government) and treasury notes in order to fund operations within the colony (Bank of Canada 1990, 7-8).|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} on the Canterbury Plains in New Zealand has lead to {{the degradation}} of natural streams and rivers through lowering of water quality and significant reduction of surface flows {{from the use of}} ground and surface water resources. However, this same agricultural expansion has {{led to the development of}} a network of permanently flowing open water races to supply stock water to farms across the Canterbury <b>Plains.</b> <b>Stock</b> water races form an extensive network, with approximately 6, 500 km of races. Initially I surveyed 62 water races and compared habitat characteristics, water quality, benthic invertebrate and fish communities with nearby natural streams. Races are characterised physically by straight, narrow and shallow channels, and small, uniform substrate. Water races are more turbid than natural streams, and can have high summer temperatures. The benthic macroinvertebrate communities of water races contained a range of taxa, including some not found in natural streams, but communities were less diverse than communities in natural streams, and tended to be dominated by a limited set of generalist taxa. A longitudinal study of three water races showed gradients in physical characteristics of races, including a downstream decrease in channel width, water depth, current velocity and substrate size. However, few strong longitudinal changes to community structure were found, as the generalist taxa commonly occurring in water races were able to tolerate conditions throughout the race network. To test if macroinvertebrate communities were limited by the homogeneous habitat of water races, I conducted a substrate manipulation experiment, where large cobbles and small boulders were added to reaches in five water races. Despite an increase in substrate and current heterogeneity, there were few significant changes to the macroinvertebrate communities over the four months of the manipulation. This outcome does not eliminate low habitat heterogeneity as a limiting factor for water race communities. Rather, the benthic invertebrate community throughout the water race network is a product of the homogeneous habitat, which limits the availability of colonists of taxa that would benefit from increased habitat diversity. A survey of the fish assemblages of water races found races had a depauperate fish community. Only two species were commonly found in water races, and the average species richness of races was 1. 5. By contrast natural streams had a higher diversity of fish species (mean 4 three species), and contained representatives of a greater number of species that are typical of streams and rivers on the Canterbury Plains. My research has shown that stock water races provide an important source of aquatic biodiversity on the plains, both in addition to natural streams and in their own right. However, the biodiversity value of stock water races could be improved with enhancement of in-stream habitat...|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the Royal Arsenal Gatehouse, or Beresford Gate as it was originally called, took place in stages. The oldest parts (1828, 1859, 1889) are of <b>plain</b> yellow <b>stock</b> brick with some stone detailing. The last additions of 1891 are of red brick and feature three large windows on each side and a clock {{at the top of}} its south-facing gable. The central part has three openings, which are currently closed off by iron fences. The middle opening was always wider and was meant for horses and carriages; the flanking openings were for pedestrians. The latter were widened in 1936. The gate openings {{on the south side of}} the building correspond with those in the north side and lead into a covered plaza. The rooms above rest on metal beams with arched floors. The central section of the gate is flanked by two lodges from 1828, both adorned with recessed rectangular panels and surmounted by brass mortars. The western annexe of 1859 has a bell tower. The building features several plaques, inserted in the buttresses and below the windows. The inscriptions are [...] "1829 B" [...] and [...] "G.R. IV"; one bears a shield with three guns. Two cattle drinking troughs of the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association from the 1890s and two modern stone benches have been placed on the south side of the building.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a fast solver for {{discrete}} free boundary value problems {{which is based}} on hierarchical higher order discretizations is presented. The numerical method consists of a finite element discretization with B–spline ansatz functions of arbitrary degree combined with a monotone multigrid method for the efficient solution of the resulting discrete system. In particular, the potential of the scheme in the fast and accurate computation of American style option prices in the Black–Scholes framework and of their derivatives with respect to the underlying is investigated. Due to the higher order discretization, the derivatives, also called Greek letters, can be stably and accurately determined via direct differentiation of the basis functions. Considering the valuation of <b>plain</b> vanilla American <b>stock</b> options, we show that our solution method is competitive to the best schemes proposed in the literature when accurate approximations to the derivatives are required. It provides the first multigrid approach based on higher order basis functions which is directly applicable to American option pricing...|$|R
