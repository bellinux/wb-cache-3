50|$|The {{estate was}} {{gradually}} being developed between 1900 and the 1930s. New housing {{began to grow}} significantly in the 1950s and 1960s. The land south of the Foscote Private Hospital in Calthorpe and Easington farm was mostly open farmland until the early 1960s, {{as shown by the}} Ordnance Survey maps of 1947, 1955, and 1964. It had only a few farmsteads and houses, an allotment field (now under the Sainsbury's store), and the Municipal Borough of Banbury's small reservoir just south of Easington farm; a water spring lay to the south of it. Two minor streams ran from a spring near the allotment gardens and the land under today's Timms estate. An old clay <b>pit,</b> <b>kiln</b> and brick works lay near the Poets' Corner estate.

50|$|From {{at least}} the 17th century, Dunton Green was a centre for making bricks and tiles. In 1862 the Dunton Green Brick, Tile and Pottery Works was established: a large concern with clayholes or <b>pits,</b> <b>kilns</b> and an engine house. Whilst digging for clay many fossils were discovered.|$|R
25|$|During {{construction}} of the metro tunnels, artifacts of archaeological interest were discovered and rescue archaeology was employed. Teams of archaeologists worked ahead of, then with, engineers for six years, protecting and recording archaeological finds (streets, houses, cemeteries, sanctuaries, public workshops, foundry <b>pits,</b> <b>kilns,</b> aqueducts, wells, cisterns, drains and sewage tunnels). This afforded new insight into the city's ancient topography, through unprecedented infrastructure development combined with the study and preservation of archaeological data. Exhibitions of ancient artifacts or replicas are found {{at a number of}} metro stations, including Monastiraki and Syntagma.|$|R
2500|$|Comalcalco {{was also}} an {{important}} centre of clay figurine production and commerce between 600 and 1000 CE In and around the site, archaeologists have found identical clay moulds and figures, as well as tools, <b>pit</b> <b>kilns</b> and dumping grounds, indicating standardized mass production. Figurines found on Jaina Island, approximately [...] away on the Yucatán Peninsula, use clay with the same chemical composition as those of Comalcalco. Unlike the funerary objects used on Jaina Island, the figurines of Comalcalco seemed to be meant for daily use. Certain representations appear more frequently in the ceremonial core (rulers, dwarfs, articulated figures), while others (women) are more common in residential areas.|$|R
30|$|Further, {{there is}} a strong {{antagonism}} between K and Mg uptake by rubber plants (Weerasuriya and Yogaratnam 1989; Singh et al. 2005) and application of biochar could alter the balance between the availability of the two nutrients in the soil. It has been observed that application of 1 % (w/w) timber mill waste charcoal, made from hardwood at low temperatures using <b>pit</b> <b>kiln</b> technique, significantly decreased the dry matter accumulation of rubber seedling plants even when combined with 50 % recommended N-P-K-Mg fertilizers (Dharmakeerthi et al. 2010). Moreover, application of timber mill waste charcoal increased K concentration and reduced Mg and Mn concentrations in leaves of rubber seedlings. Therefore, application of biochar could affect nutritional status and growth of the rubber plant depending on the pH buffer capacity of the rubber growing soils and other fertilizers applied.|$|E
40|$|Biochar has {{potentials}} for {{soil fertility}} improvement, {{climate change mitigation}} and environmental reclamation, and charred biomass can be deliberately incorporated into soil for long-term carbon stabilization and soil amendment. Many different methods {{have been used for}} biochar production ranging from laboratory to industrial scales. However, in countryside of developing countries, biomass is generally used for cooking but not charred. Biochar production techniques at farmer scale have remained poorly developed. We developed and tested biochar production kilns for farmers with a dimension of 50. 8 cm × 38. 1 cm (height × diameter), using three different setups for optimizing oxygen (O 2) limitation and syngas circulation: airtight with no syngas circulation (Model I), semi-airtight with external syngas circulation (Model II) and semi-airtight with internal syngas circulation (Model III). A comparative assessment of these biochar production kiln models was made considering biochar pyrolysis time, fuel to biomass ratio, biochar to feedstock ratio and thermogravimetric index (TGI). Among the models, the best quality biochar (TGI = 0. 15) was obtained from Model I kiln taking the longest time for pyrolysis (12. 5 h) and the highest amount of fuel wood (1. 22 kg kg - 1 biomass). Model III kiln produced comparatively good quality biochar (TGI = 0. 11), but with less fuel wood requirement (0. 33 kg kg - 1 biomass) and shorter pyrolysis time (8. 5 h). We also tested Model III kiln in a three times larger size under two situations (steel kiln and <b>pit</b> <b>kiln).</b> The biochar to feedstock ratio (0. 38) and quality (TGI = 0. 14) increased slightly for the larger kilns. Quality of biochar was found to be mainly related to pyrolysis time. The costs for the biochar stove and <b>pit</b> <b>kiln</b> were US$ 65 - 77, while it was US$ 154 for the large size steel kiln. Model III kiln can potentially be used for both cooking and biochar production at farmer scale. </p...|$|E

50|$|Claypits Close {{was built}} circa 2007 and {{named after the}} old clay pit it was built on. There were many small, Victorian clay <b>pits</b> and <b>kilns</b> in the south west of Banbury, but they had closed by the 1920s.|$|R
25|$|The Tiwanaku and Wari {{cultures}} shared {{dominance of}} the Andes, roughly from 500 to 1000 BCE. The Tiwanaku civilizations originated in Lake Titicaca region of Bolivia, and a staff-bearing deity figured largely in their artwork. Tiwanaku artists continued the tradition of naturalistic, ceramic portrait vessels. The ubiquitous Wari ceramics carried over imagery from their textiles and metalwork, such as llama and alpaca imagery. Qunchupata in Peru was the epicenter of Wari ceramic production, featuring <b>pit</b> <b>kilns</b> and firing rooms. The stone floors of the firing rooms had rounded depressions for accommodating larger pots. Some Wari palaces had their own attached kilns. Broken potsherds were used as forms for building new pots and for scrapers. Evidence shows ceramics were often ritually destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Ash <b>pits</b> and <b>kilns</b> of {{considerable}} size were observed on the northwestern and eastern peripheries of the site. One among these was {{a feature that}} is suspected to be a series of faience kilns. Their furnace walls exhibit vitrification indicative of extremely high temperature craft activities.|$|R
50|$|Potash <b>pits</b> were <b>kiln</b> sites {{which were}} dug and lined with {{drystone}} walling {{for the production}} of potash prior to the Industrial Revolution. The scouring or degreasing of the natural lanolin from wool requires the application of soft soap produced using fat and an alkaline potash solutionthat contains water-soluble potassium salts such as potassium carbonate and potassium hydroxide.|$|R
50|$|The {{island was}} also the site of lime <b>pits</b> and <b>kilns.</b> There is {{evidence}} of limestone quarries {{going back to the}} 14th century. The industrialist Donato Brambani established a large scale lime kiln that was in full operation from 1892 to 1899. It was shut down in 1902, but a large kiln remains intact as one of the attractions of the island.|$|R
5000|$|In his pottery, de la Serna fuses {{both very}} early and modern New Mexican practices. His use of {{micaceous}} clay with its subtle sparkle, harkens back {{not only to}} the ancient traditions of mica flecked clay used by early Neolithic Iberians, Celti-Iberians, and the Taos and Picuris Pueblos, but also to the Hispanic people in New Mexico and early Spanish settlers in Santa Elena, la Florida (1566-1587) [...] who also produced micaceous pottery during the colonial period and {{in the early nineteenth century}} in New Mexico. de la Serna hand-builds his pots using coil-and-scrap technology, and fires his pottery in the style of open <b>pit</b> <b>kilns</b> traditionally used by indigenous peoples. However, de la Serna's pottery, although indicative of ancient forms such as ollas and bean pots, are thoroughly modern. His minimalist, elegant lines are highly sculptural, and have moved beyond the concept of pottery in a practical sense. de la Serna's work is known for being executed with a high degree of technical prowess given the monumental sizes compared to those often rendered using the same techniques.|$|R
50|$|Around 120 AD stone {{buildings}} with courtyards were erected after a devastating {{fire in the}} center of the village. On its periphery were timber framing houses with long rectangular floor plans were built. Commercial buildings were oriented to the street, facing away from the street, in the same buildings also the living quarters were situated. In the backyards, probably one- to two-roomed smaller buildings were erected, as well as areas for gardens, animal husbandry, rubbish <b>pits</b> and <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Mehrgarh Period II (5500 BCE–4800 BCE) and Merhgarh Period III (4800 BCE–3500 BCE) were ceramic Neolithic, using pottery, {{and later}} chalcolithic. Period II is at site MR4 and Period III is at MR2. Much {{evidence}} of manufacturing activity {{has been found}} and more advanced techniques were used. Glazed faience beads were produced and terracotta figurines became more detailed. Figurines of females were decorated with paint and had diverse hairstyles and ornaments. Two flexed burials were found in Period II with a red ochre cover on the body. The amount of burial goods decreased over time, becoming limited to ornaments and with more goods left with burials of females. The first button seals were produced from terracotta and bone and had geometric designs. Technologies included stone and copper drills, updraft <b>kilns,</b> large <b>pit</b> <b>kilns</b> and copper melting crucibles. There is further evidence of long-distance trade in Period II: important {{as an indication of}} this is the discovery of several beads of lapis lazuli, once again from Badakshan. Mehrgarh Periods II and III are also contemporaneous with an expansion of the settled populations of the borderlands at the western edge of South Asia, including the establishment of settlements like Rana Ghundai, Sheri Khan Tarakai, Sarai Kala, Jalilpur and Ghaligai.|$|R
5000|$|Before opening, {{the area}} was first used for clay {{extraction}} <b>pits</b> and <b>kilns</b> for brick making in the 1970s. The design of the park began at that time, with the tennis courts and grass area developed. The reserve was officially opened on April 12, 1976 by The Hon Tom Uren, {{the leader of the}} Opposition at that time. Many trees were lost in the park {{as a result of a}} severe storm in February 2002. The boardwalk and deck structure was built in 1993, which was designed to allow disabled persons to access the edge of the main lake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the buildings date from the 19th century, and the church from 1835 when {{the centre of the}} Anglican parish of Shotley Low Quarter was moved from St Andrew's chapel on <b>Kiln</b> <b>Pit</b> Hill to the new site. [...] The parish itself, now known as Shotley St John, is within the deanery of Corbridge in the Diocese of Newcastle.|$|R
50|$|Smelting is {{the process}} of extracting metal from ore. Charcoal-fueled {{smelting}} in both <b>pits</b> and <b>kilns</b> had been used in Utah since at least 1872. Overall, there were 36 beehive-shaped smelting kilns operating in the district. The five granite beehive-shaped charcoal smelting kilns that have survived in Frisco were created by the Frisco Mining and Smelting Company under the supervision of Benjamin Y. Hampton, primarily for the Horn Silver Mine, between 1877 and 1880 for $500-$1000 apiece. Each kiln varies in size from the other, anywhere from 16 to 32 feet in diameter. The company was hard-hit by the Horn Silver Mine cave-in, and eventually closed up shop in 1884. The surviving kilns were added to the National Register of Historic Places March 9, 1982 {{as an integral part of}} Utah's history.|$|R
5000|$|The {{techniques}} {{for making the}} pottery have changed little during these centuries, with plates serving as potters’ wheels and design remaining traditional. One change has been the replacement of underground <b>pits</b> by <b>kilns</b> for firing the pieces. However, the most important innovation has been a polishing method devised by ceramic artist and potter Doña Rosa in the 1950s. Doña Rosa discovered that by polishing the nearly dry clay before firing, the gray color turned to a shiny black. This has made the pottery far more popular, and many pieces are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utilitarian. Since then, the aesthetic qualities of [...] "barro negro" [...] (black clay) pottery has become further appreciated due {{to the work of}} artisan-sculpture Carlomagno Pedro Martinez, who has displayed his barro negro work nationally and internationally.|$|R

Moreover, sensitivity analyses were executed to investigate the effect of biomass moisture on the pyrolysis process...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{acquisition}} by Robert Dunning in 1924, the works were considerably expanded to provide {{supplies to the}} Midhurst Brickworks. By this time, the chalk was being extracted solely from the upper chalk pit and an overhead ropeway was constructed {{to speed up the}} transport of chalk from the chalk <b>pit</b> to the <b>kilns.</b> This ropeway ran just {{to the north of the}} later roadway with the upper [...] "terminus" [...] being situated at [...] At about this time, six new draw kilns were built, which are now the centre of the south battery.|$|R
500|$|The slave {{houses were}} {{constructed}} out of tabby and {{built by the}} slaves probably in the 1820s or 1830s, although evidence exists that indicates {{two of them were}} inhabited by 1814. [...] Tabby was constructed of shells left over from Timucua middens, burned by the barrel-full in open <b>pits</b> or <b>kilns,</b> then pounded into lime particles, mixed with water, sand, and whole oyster or clam shells, then poured into wooden foundations about [...] high, and set to dry. The process was repeated and stacked until the desired height of the wall was reached. The floors of the kitchen house and the basement of the owner's house were also constructed of tabby. The material made the houses remarkably durable, resistant to weather and insects, better insulated than wood, and the ingredients were accessible and cheap, although labor-intensive. The slave quarters at Kingsley Plantation are widely considered some of the best surviving examples of the use of this building material.|$|R
50|$|The Rodekirchen {{family is}} {{believed}} to have lived at first in the small weatherboard cottage still on the property. The solid brick house they built to replace it featured two external staircases, one to the south that faced the <b>pit</b> and <b>kilns</b> and the other, which was the main staircase for the house, facing west. Ethel Lloyd's reminiscences suggest that, as originally constructed, the rendered brick stairs on the southern facade finished at a landing approximately one metre below the level of the verandah. Subsequent owners have speculated that at some time the stairs may have separated at this point and joined the verandah on each side. An undated, early photograph featured in the 1988 Morning Bulletin article showed an opening in the balustrading that is filled by a long piece of similarly styled gate. It also suggests that ornately carved timber brackets were fitted to the verandah posts at least until the 1930s. The balustrading appears very similar to that which is currently in place.|$|R

Behind the street fronts were large yards and cultivation plots, as well as industrial features such as metal casting <b>pits</b> and lime <b>kilns.</b> A feature of the Medieval town were burgates, enclosed urban estates attached to some of the larger dwellings. As well as around 13 inns, the town also contained around 15-20 taverns.|$|R
50|$|In 1870 Mr. T. R. Cobb {{sold his}} web-girth making mill {{to a company}} that later became the Banbury Tweed Co. Grain, brewing, wool and cloth were the centuries-old trade of Banbury, but the Banbury Tweed Co. factory finally closed its factory in 1932, {{bringing}} an end to an era. The historic background to Banbury's industry began with a few grain merchant's mills and weavers' looms under the Normans and this was continuing in some form until the last tweed factory closed in the 1920s, despite of the then new industry's like the nearby lime kiln and cabinet manufacture works, Neithrop's timber yard or Grimbury's clay <b>pit</b> and clay <b>kilns.</b>|$|R

50|$|Kiln No. 3, to {{the north}} of Kiln No. 2, was about the same size, being an oval barrel nine feet six inches in {{diameter}} from side to side and nine feet nine inches in diameter front to rear. A large Douglas fir tree grew up from the <b>pit</b> of this <b>kiln.</b> At an undetermined date before 1940 the entire arched entrance to this kiln was removed and rebuilt in Bolinas as part of a barbecue pit. Some individual moss-covered stones were removed from that and perhaps the other kilns for such uses as rock gardens, fireplaces, walls, and the like. Such vandalism has contributed to the decay of the kilns, along with the growth of trees and bushes on them.|$|R
5000|$|The chalk <b>pits</b> {{and lime}} <b>kilns</b> were leased by the Cowdray Estate to various {{people over the}} years. In 1906, a lease was granted to Pepper and Sons from Amberley in respect of two lime kilns, [...] "one in good working order". In 1921, the site was leased to Frederick Searle; this lease was later {{assigned}} to his brother, Eli. In 1924, Eli entered into partnership with Robert Dunning, who agreed to [...] "build new flare kilns {{on the site of}} old wood flare kilns". The following year, Dunning acquired the Midhurst Brickworks which had been producing bricks made from sand and lime since 1913 from a site close to the former Midhurst (LSWR) railway station. In 1926, Benjamin Cloke became the owner of the Midhurst Brick & Lime Company, thus also acquiring the works at Cocking.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCharcoal is a {{relative}} cheap source of energy for stoves and cauldrons, having {{the advantage of being}} neutral with respect to CO 2 emissions. The conventional process to produce charcoal is through methods such as earth <b>pits</b> or brick <b>kilns,</b> in which the energy required to produce the carbonization is obtained from the combustion of a part of the wood, which leads to a considerable decrease in the net production of carbon, combined with lack of control of the temperature of the process, leading to products of lower quality and a maximum yield of 200 - 300 kg per ton of wood used. In this paper we present the design of a solar oven capable of producing charcoal out of wood, together with its construction and evaluation. The design does not require solar tracking throughout the all-day. The prototype built has a collection surface of 1. 37 m 2, and can obtains 70 g of charcoal out of 180 g of wood, in approximately five hours, in a sunny day and with a typical irradiance of 800 W/m 2, which corresponds at an efficiency of 380 kg per tonne...|$|R
50|$|Lignite mining in the {{vicinity}} of the town started in 1813, supplying fuel for lime kilns. In the course of the mining operations, a medicinal spring was discovered in 1820. One year later, the first spa opened, named Hermannsbad after its founder. In 1840 a new school with four classrooms and four teachers' quarters was built, serving 500 pupils. 1878 can be considered as the zenith of the lignite mining and lime burning industries, with 36 <b>pits</b> and 20 <b>kilns</b> in Köllsdorf alone. In 1882 the spa was acquired by the town, and textile merchant Johann Gottfried Becker established his business in the town centre. Construction of the Bügerschule (civic school) for 900 pupils started in 1886, and in 1887 the Leipzig-Geithain railway via Lausick opened. A fire in the town hall in 1890 destroyed a large inventory of documents. 25 felt-making businesses in the town in 1890 signified the heyday of this industry. At this time, there were also 11 lignite mines, five lime kilns, 30 agricultural businesses, 20 bakers, 25 shoemakers, 25 tailors, 17 weavers, 10 butchers and 43 other craftsman's establishments as well as 23 restaurants and inns. Starting around 1895, clay processing developed and gave later rise to the silicate factory. A new town hall and a post office were built in 1897, and a court of law in 1898.|$|R
5000|$|Before Christianity came to Pettistree, it is {{believed}} that people worshipped an Ancient tree which was sacred to Odin. The First churches were built with the coming of Missionaries from Rome and were dedicated to St Peter and St Paul who were Patron Saints of Rome. The churches stood near the sacred tree and so this district [...] "received the name of Peter's Tree or Pettistree. Over the years Pettistree has been spelt in various ways: Pedestree, Petestre, Petistre, Petistree, Petrestre, Petristrel, Petrystree, Pettitre, Pistre, Pistreye, Pitestrey, Pittistree". Edric the Grim and King Harold were the Lords of the Manor of Wickham and the hamlets of Pettistree, Bing, Loudham and Harpole before the Norman Conquest". Parts of Pettistree (Bing) are mentioned in the Doomsday Book, although this was the Ancient village. It is thought that the present village was a later development and was established due to a shifting population after one of the plagues attacked the Ancient village. [...] "The Old centres of population were found around Byng Hall Estate and Loudham Hall Estate. It is thought that Byng Hall is an old Roman settlement due to the brick <b>kiln,</b> <b>pit</b> and Roman tiles which were discovered in 1846 The green in front of the present Byng Hall was commonly known as Market Field; in 1253 Sir Roger de Huntingfield granted a market to be placed there.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a preliminary archaeometric study on 14 potsherds collected in three sites of Mondragone territory (Caserta, Southern Italy), where two surface surveys campaign were carried out in 2007 and 2008. More than 700 fragments of artifacts (flint, pottery, daub and bricks) were found in the 18 sites identified in the studied area, being the potsherds the most represented archaeological materials. Petrographic analysis under optical microscopy and mineralogical characterization by X-ray powder diffraction were carried out in order to identify homogenous groups, to define the provenance of the raw materials and possible importation cases by comparison with the natural resources available in the region, as well as to constrain the production technology, with particular reference to the paste preparation and the firing process. Five main petrographic groups were defined, the features of which showed strong compatibility with clayey and silty-clayey alluvial deposits of Mondragone territory, suggesting a local production of the studied pottery. Mineral assemblages constrained the firing temperature in the interval 750 - 950 °C, at variable redox conditions defined {{on the basis of the}} paste colour, suggesting the use of <b>pit</b> firing or <b>kilns</b> with firing chamber directly in contact with the firebox. The comparison with other productions of the area reveals differences in terms of superficial treatments with respect to more recent pottery and strong technological analogies with other contexts in the Campania region, even attributed to different prehistoric and historic periods...|$|R
