50|$|<b>Phenacemide</b> (INN, BAN) (brand name Phenurone), {{also known}} as phenylacetylurea, is an {{anticonvulsant}} of the ureide (acetylurea) class. It is a congener and ring-opened analogue of phenytoin (a hydantoin), and is structurally related to the barbiturates and to other hydantoins. <b>Phenacemide</b> was introduced in 1949 {{for the treatment of}} epilepsy, but was eventually withdrawn due to toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Halogenation of {{phenylacetic acid}} to phenylacetyl {{chloride}} and amidation with urea give the <b>phenacemide</b> product.|$|E
50|$|The acylurea {{functional}} group {{is also found}} in some pharmaceutical drugs such as the anticonvulsants <b>phenacemide,</b> pheneturide, chlorphenacemide, and acetylpheneturide (which are phenylureides), and the sedatives acecarbromal, bromisoval, and carbromal (which are bromoureides). Others include apronal (apronalide), capuride, and ectylurea. As the barbiturates are basically cyclic ureas, these drugs are structurally and mechanistically related to them. The phenylureides are also closely related to the hydantoins, such as phenytoin, and may be considered ring-opened analogues of them.|$|E
5000|$|Pheneturide (INN, BAN) (brand names Benuride, Deturid, Pheneturid, Septotence, Trinuride), {{also known}} as phenylethylacetylurea (or ethylphenacemide), is an {{anticonvulsant}} of the ureide class. Conceptually, it can be formed in the body as a metabolic degradation product from [...] It {{is considered to be}} obsolete, and is now seldom used. It is marketed in Europe, including in Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Pheneturide has a similar profile of anticonvulsant activity and toxicity relative to <b>phenacemide,</b> but is less toxic in comparison, despite still being a toxic drug. As such, it is only used in cases of severe epilepsy when other, less-toxic drugs have failed. Pheneturide inhibits the metabolism and thus increases the levels of other anticonvulsants, such as phenytoin.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-one {{patients}} with {{various forms of}} myoclonus are presented. <b>Phenacemide</b> was given to five {{patients with}} considerable benefit to three, but with serious toxic effects in two. Another acetylurea derivative, pheneturide, was given to 19 patients and was well tolerated. Myoclonus was completely or substantially controlled in 12 patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} molecular {{structures of}} the potent anticonvulsant agents <b>phenacemide</b> and ethylphenacemide have been determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. Although these compounds possess straight-chain acetylurea groupings, in the crystalline state both molecules adopt a pseudocyclic conformation of the acetylurea chain through amide [...] . carbonyl oxygen intramolecular hydrogen bonding. This results in spatial positioning and relative orientation of two electron-donating functional groups in these molecules {{similar to those of}} comparable atoms in diphenylhydantoin and other heterocycle-containing anticonvulsants...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple liquid-chromatographic system for simultaneously measuring bronchodilators, anticonvulsants, hypnotics, and chioramphenicol. Use in therapeutic drug monitoring includes determination of theophylline, caffeine, chioramphenicol, ethosuximide, primidone, phenobarbital, <b>phenacemide,</b> phenytoin, mephenytoin, nirvanol, and carba-mazepine and its bioactive metabolites within 13 mm. In the “toxicology mode ” theophylline, caffeine, barbital, butabar-bital, pentobarbital, amobarbital, secobarbital, primidone, phenobarbital, methyprylon, glutethtmide, methaqualone, phenytoin, mephenytoin, nirvanol, and carbamazepine and its bioactive metabolites are resolved within 17 mm. A reversed-phase C 8 column (5 -pm particles) is used, with acetonitnle/water (20 / 80 by vol) as mobile phase. The drugs are extracted from 50 pL of serum {{with use of}} a Chromosor...|$|E
