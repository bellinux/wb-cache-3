25|$|Bieber {{had several}} run-ins {{with the law}} around the world before his first arrest in 2014, {{including}} when {{he was accused of}} reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013. One of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage. On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over six month expired license, and resisting arrest without violence. Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs. He has been released from these charges on a $2,500 bond, and lack of evidence beyond reasonable doubt as dictated in the United States court of law. A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a <b>principal</b> <b>constituent</b> of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system {{at the time of his}} arrest.|$|E

R-(–)-Carvone is also the most abundant compound in the essential oil from several species of mint, particularly spearmint oil (Mentha spicata), which is composed of 50–80% R-(–)-carvone. [...] Spearmint is a major source of naturally produced R-(–)-carvone. [...] However, the majority of R-(–)-carvone used in commercial applications is synthesized from R-(+)-limonene.
