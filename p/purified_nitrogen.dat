The results showed that ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the drainage ditches of different operating periods could be purified effectively. The purification process had the characteristics of ‘fast purification, wave balance’, in which ammonia nitrogen concentration decreased faster than nitrate nitrogen and the range of ammonia nitrogen concentration in the ‘wave balance’ stage(≤ 2 mg&# 183;L - 1) was lower than nitrate nitrogen(≤ 3 mg&# 183;L - 1). The different operation periods had great influence on the purification rate of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen in the ditches at the initial stage of {{the experiment}}, in which the purification rate:The multi-years ditch > the 7 -month-old ditch > the 1 -month-old ditch. In addition to the nitrate purification rate of nitrate nitrogen in non-ecological ditches of different operation had significant difference, {{no significant difference in the}} remaining stages; There was no significant difference in the change of ammonia nitrogen concentration in the ditch at different operating periods, except for the ‘fluctuating balance’ stage of the 7 -month-old ditch(P = 0. 03 < 0. 05).

The wastewater is <b>purified</b> from <b>nitrogen</b> through nitrification and denitrification where nitrite occurs as an intermediate in several reaction steps. The report contains theory round the formation of nitrite and the results from samplings where nitrite concentration was determined. The objective was to increase nitrite conversion and thereby decrease the content of nitrite in the effluent water, by studying the increase of nitrite.   Samplings started in March and no changes in the process where made, the first samples were analyzed to determine where the nitrite accumulation occurred. The samplings were taken in the intermittently aerated basin, wish includes a aerated period and a nonaerated period.   The initial samples showed that nitrite accumulates when there is oxygen in the basin. The content of nitrite decreases when there is no oxygen in the water. The ammonium limits were changed in one basin because it was suspected that the bacteria were becoming stressed by the intermittent aerated start-stop process. This resulted in a longer aerated period for the nitrified bacteria to grow and due to the change it was expected that the bacteria would thrive. This proved insufficient for nitrite oxidation to take place, but the concentration of nitrite at this time was at least lower.  These changes did not show any reduction in the nitrite concentration.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the purifying effects and {{influences}} on nitrogen caused by natural riparian wetlands in the river course, Cao Lake and Ezhen Lake in Wangyu River were selected as the main research regions. Samplings in the transfer period with a large flow in May, 2010 were taken in the sites over the whole wetland area and along the main river course, respectively. Observations on the physicochemical indexes such as water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen(DO), turbidity, suspended solid(SS), total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen(DTN), ammonia, nitrate and nitrite were performed to analyze the concentration and chemical forms variations, regional difference of nitrogen nutrient in the river water column. Results are showed as follows: (1) As the water flowed through Cao Lake and Ezhen Lake, the TN, DTN and nitrate showed a trend of descending (descending proportion: 10. 45 %, 17. 85 %, 7. 62 % in Ehen Lake, 9. 09 %, 7. 17 %, 7. 60 % in Cao Lake). The overall removal effects of nitrogen in Ezhen Lake was better than that in Cao Lake, but the retaining effect of ammonia in Cao Lake was better than that in Ezhen Lake. (2) The nitrogen existed in the water mainly in the forms of DTN and the rates on TN were 88. 0 % and 91. 4 %, respectively, {{higher than that of}} particle nitrogen, but the rates would decrease for the sedimentation of particle nitrogen in the vertical distribution. (3) Water temperature, pH and DO were the dominant factors that affected the <b>purifying</b> effects of <b>nitrogen</b> in the riparian areas. The research showed the obvious retaining effects of nitrogen and evident influences on the nutrients forms variations in the river water column. The results could provide theoretical foundation and technical support for nitrogen purification in the river course...|$|R
30|$|CIGSSe nanocrystals were {{synthesized}} {{using the}} methods {{reported in the}} literatures [34, 36] with some modification. Reactions were performed using a Schlenk manifold under a <b>purified</b> <b>nitrogen</b> atmosphere. In a typical synthesis, 1  mmol of CuCl (0.0990  g), 0.1  mmol of InCl 3 (0.0221  g), 0.9  mmol of GaCl 3 (0.159  g), 0.2  mmol of elemental Se (0.0158  g) and 1.62  mmol of elemental sulfur (0.0518  g), 0.09  mmol of 1, 2 -ethanedithiol (7.5  μL), and 25  mL oleylamine were added in a 50 -mL three-necked flask. The flask was placed on a magnetic hot plate with continuous stirring and then attached to the Schlenk line. The temperature was monitored and controlled using a thermocouple and a PID temperature controller through the third neck of the flask. The flask was purged of oxygen and water by pulling vacuum for 1  h, followed by N 2 bubbling at 130 °C for 1 h while stirring. Next, the system was slowly heated to 240 °C and kept for 4 h under vigorous stirring. After reaction, the flask was quenched in a cold water bath to quickly bring the temperature down. The CIGSSe nanocrystal/oleylamine mixture was transferred to a 50 -mL centrifuge tube. Fifteen milliliters of ethanol {{was added to the}} mixture and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. After such a washing step, the supernatant, containing unreacted precursor and byproducts, was discarded. The CIGSSe nanocrystals were in the precipitate. The nanocrystals were then redispersed in 10 mL of chloroform and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min to remove poorly capped nanocrystals and large particulates. The well-capped nanocrystals remained dispersed in the supernatant. The precipitate was discarded, and a small amount of oleylamine (0.2 mL) was subsequently added to the supernatant to ensure complete surface passivation of the nanocrystals. To remove excess capping ligands and remaining impurities, the product was again precipitated using ∼ 5 mL of ethanol and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min, then redispersed in chloroform. This process was done three times to obtain a high-purity product. The isolated nanocrystals were redispersed in toluene for further characterization.|$|E
40|$|Vanadium oxides {{have been}} studied because of its some {{important}} properties. Vanadium pentoxide has been used widely as its fine catalytic properties. Meanwhile, Vanadium pentoxide also has fine electrochemical property. Theoretically a Vanadium atom in Vanadium pentoxide crystal can accept two Li ions. Vanadium pentoxide is an attractive cathode material in high capacity Li ions rechargeable battery. Vanadium pentoxide can be also used as ions storage layer in Electrochromic devices. Vanadium pentoxide thin films were obtained in this subject by sol-gel method. The precursors in this project are Vanadium pentoxide powder and Vanadyl acetylacetonate. First, we prepare inorganic sol and organic sol by Vanadium pentoxide powder and Vanadyl acetylacetonate respectively. Then the gel thin films were prepared by dip-coating and spin-coating. Gel films were heat treated at definite conditions and Vanadium pentoxide thin films were synthesized. The properties of Vanadyl acetylacetonate sol was analyzed by FT-IR and DG-DSC. The Crystallinity and optical property of Vanadium pentoxide thin films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectrum and UV-VIS-NIR spectrum. The DG-DSC analysis reveals that Vanadyl acetylacetonate decomposes at 250 oC and 300 oC in nitrogen ambience and air respectively. In this subject, the heat treatment temperature was choosen between 350 - 550 oC. Polycrystalline Vanadium pentoxide thin films were synthesized by heat treating Vanadyl acetylacetonate gel films in air and nitrogrn ambience. Amorphous Vanadium pentoxide thin films were synthesized by heat treating Vanadyl acetylacetonate gel films in argon and hydrogen misture ambience and <b>purified</b> <b>nitrogen</b> ambience. Polycrystalline Vanadium pentoxide thin films synthesized in this object have highly c-axis oriented nano V 2 O 5 structures with grain diameter ranging from 21 nm to 45 nm. Polycrystalline Vanadium pentoxide thin films grow perpendicularly to the substrate. The optical band gap of Vanadium pentoxide thin films is between 2. 0 - 2. 4 ev. The adhesion of Vanadium pentoxide thin films becomes stronger when the oxygen pressure increases in heat treatment atmosphere. The Vanadium pentoxide thin films obtained in air can shed after surface wetting. While the Vanadium pentoxide thin films obtained in nitrogen can bear grinding. The color of Vanadium pentoxide thin films varies from light yellow to light green as the oxygen pressure decrease in heat treatment atmosphere. 氧钒化合物因其具有重要的特性而被人们广泛的研究。其中V 2 O 5 因为其良好的催化特性，而被广泛用作各种化学反应的催化剂。同时V 2 O 5 也具有很好的电化学性能，理论上，V 2 O 5 晶体中平均一个钒原子可以接受两个金属锂原子，具有良好的嵌锂性能，这使得把V 2 O 5 用作高容量锂离子电池的阴极膜有很大的吸引力。在电致变色方面作为离子储存膜，也得到了应用。 本课题采用sol-gel方法，以二乙酰丙酮氧钒和五氧化二钒粉末为前驱物，制备得到了钒的有机溶胶和无机溶胶，通过提拉和旋涂两种涂膜方式得到湿的凝胶膜，通过不同条件下的热处理，得到了五氧化二钒薄膜。利用傅立叶变换红外吸收光谱仪和热重分析仪研究了二乙酰丙酮氧钒溶胶的性质，探讨了溶胶的粘度、热处理温度、热处理气氛和陈化时间对薄膜的影响。通过X射线衍射分析，傅立叶变换红外光谱分析及UV-VIS-NIR光谱表征了五氧化二钒薄膜的结晶性和光学特性。 热分析表明二乙酰丙酮氧钒在氮气中 300 ℃开始分解，在空气中 250 ℃开始分解，据此，本实验的热处理温度选为 350 - 550 ℃之间。二乙酰丙酮氧钒凝胶膜可以在空气，氮气中退火得到多晶五氧化二钒薄膜，在提纯的氮气以及氩氢气中得到的是非晶态的五氧化二钒薄膜。实验中得到的多晶五氧化二钒薄膜均沿着c轴生长。薄膜垂直于衬底平面生长，晶粒大小在 24 - 45 nm之间。所得薄膜的禁带宽度为 2. 0 - 2. 4 ev之间。随着热处理气氛中氧分压的减小，薄膜的附着力增大，空气中热处理获得的样品在受潮后容易脱落，而在提纯氮气中热处理得到的样品能耐受研磨；颜色由淡黄向暗绿色转变...|$|E
