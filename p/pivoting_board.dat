5000|$|A <b>pivoted</b> <b>board,</b> {{called a}} [...] "smashboard," [...] {{which could be}} {{operated}} to swing into position across the track.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, {{colors were}} the main changes for the XP Limited, as the hull deck were changed to black; the seat and hood were silver; and the cowling, handle pole cover, <b>pivot,</b> <b>boarding</b> handle, rub rail, and {{graphics}} were yellow.|$|R
5000|$|... 2001 {{saw another}} color variation, with the hull {{remaining}} black while the top deck, hood, and seat became silver. The rub rail, <b>pivots,</b> and <b>boarding</b> handling were yellow, and the instrument pod and handle pole cover were black.|$|R
50|$|The term scow {{is used in}} {{and around}} the west Solent for a {{traditional}} class of sailing dinghy. Various towns and villages claim their own variants (Lymington, Keyhaven, Yarmouth, West Wight, Chichester), they are all around 11 ft in length and share a lug sail, <b>pivoting</b> centre <b>board,</b> small foredeck and a square transom with a transom hung rudder.|$|R
5000|$|Other skill testing games {{challenge}} the physical {{abilities of the}} player. One example {{of this type of}} game is the [...] "Rope Ladder Climb". In this game, the player must keep their balance while climbing an angled rope ladder that can pivot and invert the player. The object of the game is to climb the ladder, without falling off, and ring a bell {{at the end of the}} climb. Another game that tests the physical abilities of the player is [...] "Ring the Bell". The player uses a large mallet to strike a <b>pivot</b> <b>board</b> on the game, this causes an indicator to be driven vertically up an indicator scale board. By hitting the pivot hard enough, the indicator will ring a bell mounted at the top of the indicator scale board indicating a win. Cover the spot is a game that involves covering a giant red spot with five smaller discs dropped by hand; all red (or color) must be covered to win.|$|R
5000|$|X-inch Dahlgren shell gun (light): 10 {{were cast}} at Seyfert, McManus & Co. and West Point {{foundries}} between 1855 and 1864. <b>Pivot</b> mounted on <b>board</b> ships such as , [...] and [...] (pre-CSS Virginia) {{with a crew}} of 20 and a powderman.|$|R
50|$|Rocker-roller boards add {{a degree}} of {{instability}} to the rocker board that makes them much more challenging for the rider than a rocker board is. Rather than on a fixed <b>pivot,</b> a rocker-roller's <b>board</b> is placed on a cylindrical roller; this fulcrum is a wheel that moves {{in relation to the}} ground and in relation to the <b>board.</b> The <b>board's</b> <b>pivot</b> point shifts back and forth as the cylinder rolls beneath it. In almost all models the two flat ends of the wheel/roller are about as far from each other as the width of the board. In most models the axis of the roller is perpendicular to the board's length. Thus, as the rider's weight moves over the roller, the board both tilts from side to side and also slides sideways. In models whose roller can be placed with its axis parallel to the board's length, the board slides and tilts toward the front and back (if the rider's feet are oriented accordingly).|$|R
25|$|Swing {{boarding}} is {{the activity}} where a skateboard deck is suspended from a pivot point above the rider {{which allows the}} rider to swing about that <b>pivot</b> point. The <b>board</b> swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a harness and frame allows the rider to perform turns spins all while flying though the air.|$|R
40|$|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center {{has built}} an open architecture, 24 channel space flight GPS {{receiver}}. The CompactPCI PiVoT GPS receiver card {{is based on}} the Mitel/GEC Plessey Builder- 2 <b>board.</b> <b>PiVoT</b> uses two Plessey 2021 correlators to allow tracking of up to 24 separate GPS SV's on unique channels. Its four front ends can support four independent antennas, making it a useful card for hosting GPS attitude determination algorithms. It has been built using space quality, radiation tolerant parts. The PiVoT card will track a weaker signal than the original Builder 2 board. It also hosts an improved clock oscillator. The PiVoT software {{is based on the}} original Plessey Builder 2 software ported to the Linux operating system. The software is POSIX complaint and can easily be converted to other POSIX operating systems. The software is open source to anyone with a licensing agreement with Plessey. Additional tasks can be added to the software to support GPS science experiments or attitude determination algorithms. The next generation PiVoT receiver will be a single radiation hardened CompactPCI card containing the microprocessor and the GPS receiver optimized for use above the GPS constellation. PiVoT was flown successfully on a balloon in July, 2001, for its first non-simulated flight...|$|R
50|$|Mechanical dampers {{shut the}} cross {{sectional}} area of a duct {{in the event of}} a fire either by means of <b>pivoting</b> a fire-resistant <b>board</b> (in Europe), or by means of steel shutters, similar to blinds on a window (in North America). In the European designs, the turning mechanism is fully contained, permitting the dampers (subject to type approval) to be grouted in place, which permits a heat sink effect to conduct heat from an accidental building fire, which impinges upon a duct and damper, to be conducted into surrounding structures. This also addresses the topic of smoke migration through the damper's annulus. In North American damper designs, the closing mechanism for the interior shutters resides on the outside of the damper, which is why NFPA 80 expressly prohibits the installation or presence of any materials in the damper's annulus, which are not mentioned in the manufacturer's instructions, which are governed by their certification listings. The closing mechanism must be allowed to operate, which necessitates that the annulus remain open, apart from an angle iron lip that surrounds the damper through-penetration in fire-resistance rated wall and floor assemblies. Maintenance efforts of mechanical dampers of both European and North American mechanical damper designs focus on the function of the mechanical shutting of the opening (which must be performed during inspection), as well as removal of any foreign objects that may otherwise impair this function.|$|R
