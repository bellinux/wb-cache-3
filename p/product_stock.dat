50|$|The Norinchukin Bank (also {{known as}} Nochu Bank) is a Japanese {{cooperative}} bank serving over 5,612 agricultural, fishing and forestry cooperatives from {{its headquarters in}} Tokyo. The bank is one of Japan’s largest institutional investors with an investment portfolio of more than US$400 billion and assets exceeding US$840 billion. The bank is well known as Japan’s largest hedge fund. Through overseas branches located in New York City, London, and Singapore, the bank invests in bond, securitization <b>product,</b> <b>stock,</b> private equity, and real estate. Since huge assets as much as US$840 billion are managed by only around 3,200 employees, the bank is mainly engaged in asset management and large scale corporate financing. The asset management division is constituted of more than 300 MBA holders from top-tier schools. Its members include cooperative federations such as the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) and the Japan Fishery Cooperatives (JF). Norinchukin supports political lobbies who oppose agricultural imports and the deterioration of living standards in rural areas. Norinchukin has 41 offices throughout Japan and five overseas branches.|$|E

This method eliminates the drawbacks of classical exponential smoothing and secures sufficient stock levels during order lead time period.

The questions are how to refill stocks and what level of restocking deliveries to implement in order to secure economic efficiency while still maintaining demanded service levels. One of the promising ways of solving stated problems is to apply the dynamic simulation method. The aim of this article is to introduce sporadic demand <b>product</b> <b>stock</b> management method based on dynamic simulation, which would offer simple and easily interpretable answers on basic questions connected to effective stock management.

40|$|As {{a result}} to today’s {{uncertain}} economy, companies {{are searching for}} alternative ways to stay competitive. In which, Company XYZ has been faced with an ineffective forecasting method that has lead to multiple <b>product</b> <b>stock</b> outs. The issue faced has caused sales loss as well as profit loss, which companies {{can not afford to}} lose if they want to stay competitive. This project goes through the process of analyzing the company’s current forecasting model and recommending an inventory control model to help them solve their current issue. As a result, an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and a Reorder Point was recommended along with two forecasting techniques to help them reduce their <b>product</b> <b>stock</b> outs. In addition, a cost estimate was done to compare both their current and the recommended models. As a result, Company XYZ would able to reduce their overall total cost from $ 13, 654 to $ 5, 366. This was a cost reduction of approximately 61 %, which summed to a total saving of about $ 8, 300 per quarter. It is highly recommended that Company XYZ implements the inventory control model provided in order to reduce stock out and back orders. By doing so, the company could also reduce the total cost associated with their inventory. If the methods are used effectively, the company could remain competitive among their industry...|$|E

We build the pricing models of the contracts by analyzing the form of the optimal stopping time and derive the formulas of the value functions. We present the numerical results and make an analysis of fair values of related parameters. A comparison between capped stock loans and uncapped ones is also given. We find that capped loans have their own advantages such as more flexibility and lower cost...|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been done}} in logistics and supply chain management, mostly in connection with out-bound logistics. The main concerns are the operation of delivery services, the processing of the orders, and accuracy of delivery. The activities involved are usually related to the material flows and warehouse management. However, the in-bound logistics {{is an important part of}} the supply chain management. This paper investigates the connections of the demands of orders, due dates and production schedules, with the purpose of minimising the stocking time. With the help of the proposed Stock Minimisation (SM) model, the overall <b>products</b> <b>stocking</b> cost can be reduced. This leads to the reduction of the raw material keeping cost as the material ordering time is driven more closely towards a due date. In comparison with other popular scheduling techniques, the SM model could save around 70 % of the <b>product</b> <b>stocking</b> time in simulations.

40|$|This study {{examines}} inventory management practices of flour milling manufacturing firms {{and their effects}} on operational performance. Five flour milling manufacturing firms in Lagos were used for this study. Structured questionnaire was the major instrument for the collection of relevant primary data while descriptive statistics such as {{mean and standard deviation}} was deployed to analyzing the data gathered. The results obtained showed that exception of the large manufacturing companies, most of the medium-sized flour milling firms adopts different inventory management strategies from the scientific and best practice models. Their inventory management strategies and policies were rather based on factors such as changing level of customer demand, prevailing industry practices, forecast estimates and guesses, and available production capacity. Findings also revealed significant differences between the effective management of inventory and optimal operating performance. For instance, while firms that adopt best practice inventory management approaches reported efficiency in capacity utilization, increased service level, and reduced lead time, others with different strategies had minimal utilization of material resources. There is need for flour manufacturing firms to implement scientific inventory management models to adequately handle material shortages, <b>product</b> <b>stock</b> outs situations, component pile up and their associated penalties...|$|E

Since the carbon storage effect due to harvested wood products (HWP) might {{be taken into account}} in the future framework of carbon mitigation, it is crucial to estimate the carbon fl ow and stock concerning HWP for the next commitment period. In the present study, we developed a model for estimating the fl ow and stock of wood products in Japan’s building, furniture, and paper sectors. The HWP carbon storage effect and substitution effect (carbon reduction by substituting fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials with HWP) up to 2050 were quantitatively estimated by lifetime analysis. Our model simulation revealed that (i) the carbon stock change in Japan due to HWP would be evaluated as a large emission if the atmospheric-fl ow approach is adopted, (ii) carbon removal would not significantly increase if the ratio of newly constructed wooden buildings/furniture remains stable, and (iii) the carbon storage effect together with the substitution effect would {{have a significant impact on}} climate change mitigation if the ratio of newly constructed wooden buildings/furniture is gradually improved to 70 % by 2050.|$|E
