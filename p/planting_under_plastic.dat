40|$|White rust {{caused by}} fungal {{pathogen}} Puccinia horiana P. Henn. is one devastated disease {{that could make}} significant economic loss in chrysanthemum production. The study of effects of varieties, cutting health and fungicide application on chrysanthemum white rust was established. The treatments were arranged in split-split plot completely randomized design with three replications. Three chrysanthemum varieties i. e. cv. Puma White, Reagent Purple and Town Talk served as main plot. Seedlings with 20 % intensity of white rust infection and symptomless functioned as sub plot, while fungicide application on the transplanted cutting (no fungicide) and dithiocarbamate (AntracolR 75 WP, 2 g L- 1) application served as sub-sub plot. Result showed genetic background of the cultivars significantly determined the degree of infection of white rust. Reagent Purple exhibited least disease intensities. Fungicide application was less effective in controlling white rust development, yet gave {{significant impact on the}} plant height and number of leaves of chrysanthemum plants. Cuttings selection based on the visual observation on {{the presence or absence of}} white rust pustules symptom did not gave significant differences on the further development of the disease.

40|$|Downy mildew in {{cucumber}} plants, {{caused by}} Pseudoperonospora cubensis, was reduced by foliar spraying of antitranspirants film Kaolin nu-film, bio-film, folicote and Polyacrylamide Anti-Stress 550. In greenhouse test, antitranpirants {{proved to be}} effective treatments in reducing disease incidence, severity and pathogen sporulation when applied prior or post to inoculation. Among these compounds, Kaolin and Nu-Film (1. 0 %) were more effective in reducing spores counts, germination and infection as well as downy infected area and lesions number. Scanning electron microscope examination showed that, Kaolin antitranspirant inhibited zoospores germination, growth and development as well as had become collapsed and lost its turgidity when applied either pre or post inoculation. Although, spraying of Bio-Film and Polyacrylamide Anti-Stress 550 antitranspirants, at 1 and 3 %, resulted also in better disease control. Under protected cultivation and natural infection conditions, all antitranspirants showed a remarkable effectiveness on the reduction of disease severity and pathogen density when applied twice at 45 and 75 days after sowing in cucumber leaves. Furthermore, all tested antitranspirants, significantly increased the cucumber plant height and yield. Kaolin strongly protected cucumber against downy mildew and yield increased. Conclusively, antitranspirants film {{can be used as}} effective treatments for the control of downy mildew disease in cucumber <b>plants</b> <b>under</b> <b>plastic</b> houses...|$|R
40|$|DESCRIPTION AND BIOLOGY: Squash bugs {{are one of}} {{the primary}} pests of {{cucurbits}} in the United States. Adults are typically 10 to 30 mm long, dark gray, brown or black in color with orange or brown markings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen (Fig. 1). Overwintering adults emerge from the soil, ground litter, wood piles or buildings in the spring. After feeding and mating, females deposit egg masses on the underside of leaves. Newly laid eggs are typically light pale in color, become coppery, then darker as they develop. Egg masses are commonly laid in diamond or V-shaped patterns along leaf veins (Fig 2). Nymphs are 2. 5 to 10 mm long, light green upon hatching and light to dark gray with each successive molt (Fig. 3). Nymphs have black legs and antennae. There are five nymphal instars with an average development time of 33 days. The last two instars have a more distinct thorax and wing pads. Nymphs aggregate and feed close to their parent egg mass, on the underside of leaves, until later stages of wilt set in on the leaf (Fig. 3). Squash bug nymphs and adults are cryptic, frequently hiding in the shaded parts of <b>plants,</b> <b>under</b> <b>plastic</b> mulches, in thick weed beds, or in wilted fruit and foliage. Squash bugs can complete their egg to adult life cycle in four to six weeks. Fig. 1. Adult female squash bug laying eggs on the underside of a pumpkin leaf. Fig. 2.

40|$|AbstractSome {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} changes resulting from prolonged <b>plant</b> growth <b>under</b> <b>plastic</b> screening materials (Lifelite) now being marketed {{in this country}} are reported. Lifelite filtered out all light wavelengths between 500 and 580 manometers, lowered the transmission level to 26 percent in the 380 to 500 nanometer range and transmitted up to 62 percent of the wavelengths in the 580 to 700 nanometer range. Lifelite enhanced the germination of spinach seeds, inhibited the germination of lettuce and tomato seeds and had no effect on the germination of cabbage or onion seeds. The only positive morphological change elicited by Lifelite was a considerable increase in stem elongation because of an enlargement of cells. All plants., except cabbage, grown under Lifelite showed a substantial decrease in pigmentation. Ball State UniversityMuncie, IN 47306 Thesis (M. S.) [...] Ball State University, 1971...|$|R
40|$|Strawberry {{growers in}} Australia produce about 72, 000 tonnes of fruit worth 450 million each year. The main {{production}} centers {{are located in}} Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, with production in Queensland worth 240 million. There are smaller industries in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. Production on the Sunshine Coast in south-eastern Queensland in open field conditions is severely affected by rain most seasons. The fruit can also be lost to various diseases, including grey mould and stem-end rot.

40|$|Sweet peppers are {{primarily}} produced the northern (Stark, Henry, Wood and Huron counties) and the southeastern (Washington and Meigs counties) {{parts of the}} state. Production Method (3) Peppers are a warm season crop, which produce best during a long growing season. They {{are very sensitive to}} temperature extremes, preferring an average daytime temperature of 75 ° F and an average nighttime temperature of 62 ° F. Peppers grow well in a loam or sandy loam soil, with a pH between 6. 0 and 6. 8. Acid soils can lead to calcium and magnesium deficiencies and fruit damaged with blossom end rot. Peppers are usually planted in Ohio as greenhouse grown, plug transplants. The ideal planting date for transplants is mid to late May, but is typically delayed due to spring rainfall. Transplants should be only slightly hardened before planting. Over hardened transplants are slow to develop once in the field. Transplants should be set with a starter fertilizer high in phosphorus. Transplants are placed in rows 4 feet apart with 12 - 18 inches between plants. Many growers of fresh-market peppers in Ohio, <b>plant</b> <b>under</b> black <b>plastic</b> mulch with trickle irrigation laid <b>under</b> the <b>plastic.</b> This provides uniform moisture and fertility during the growing season.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to identify the growth and production of rice varieties as responses to drought period in low land rice system. Rice <b>plants</b> were grown <b>under</b> <b>plastic</b> house in plots separated by massive walls. Drought periods were treated as main plots, i. e. water was supplied during 3, 6, and 9 weeks after rice transplanting, and control (cultivation without drought treatment). Rice varieties were used as sub plots, consisted of IR 64 and Ciherang (low land improved varieties), IPB- 3 S (new plant type), Menthik Wangi (an aromatic local low land rice), Rokan (a hybrid rice), Way Apo Buru (amphibian type), Jatiluhur and Silugonggo (up land type). Our results showed that drought periods suppressed plant height, tiller number, spikelets length, weight of 1, 000 grains, shoot dry weight and harvest index, and increased number of empty spikelets. Interaction between drought periods and rice varieties significantly affected productive tiller number, percentage of plants to flower, and grain weight per hill. Jatiluhur, Ciherang and Way Apo Buru still gave relatively high yields under drought stress indicated that those varieties were relatively tolerant to drought stress; Silugonggo and IPB- 3 S had medium tolerance to drought stress; IR 64, Menthik Wangi and Rokan were the most sensitive varieties.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to test the effect of {{propagation}} time (autumn or spring) on propagation effectivity of four woody species. Further, the use of growth stimulator {{and the use of}} black plastic cover for planting were tested during both autumn and spring terms. The experiment was performed on the experimental area of the Department of breeding and propagation of horticultural plants. The autumn part of the experiment was started on 11 th November 2009, the spring part began on 15 th March 2010. During both experimental terms, following woody species were cut and planted: Cornus alba, Deutzia gracilis Nikko, Deutzia scabra Plena a Ligustrum ovalifolium. Half of the cuttings were <b>planted</b> <b>under</b> the black <b>plastic</b> cover, half was planted without the use of the cover. In each half the use of stimulator was tested [...] the cuttings were stimulated by IBA solution for twelve hours. All experiments were performed in triplicate repetition. The propagation effectivity was evaluated {{on the basis of the}} amount of rooted cuttings and the length of adventitious roots. The results show that during the spring term propagation was more effective than during autumn. The use of stimulator or plastic cover did not significantly effect rooting. Based on the experiment results I recommend spring propagation of the woody species which enables thorough rooting of the cuttings before winter. The best rooting was observed in Deutzia scabra and Ligustrum ovalifolium. These woody species should be propagated with the use of hard wood cuttings. Rooting of some tested species Deutzia gracilis and Cornus alba was insufficient regardless of experimental conditions. In these species, another way of propagation should be considered...|$|R
40|$|In general, <b>plants</b> grown <b>under</b> {{diffuse light}} yield higher biomass than those grown under direct {{light as a}} result of a more uniform {{distribution}} of the light across the plant canopy. We compared the effects of a light-diffusing plastic film and a clear plastic film on growth of Batavia lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in two greenhouses during five growth periods. Lettuce grown under the light-diffusing film were smaller (up to 36 %) than control <b>plants</b> grown <b>under</b> the clear film, due to the fewer leaves per plant (up to 22 %) and lower mean values of individual leaf area (up to 29 %). The photosynthetically active radiations use efficiency was sometimes lower (up to 23 %) in lettuces grown under the light-diffusing film. The pigment contents tended to be lower in <b>plants</b> grown <b>under</b> the light-diffusing <b>plastic.</b> The total macroelement contents of the lettuces grown <b>under</b> the light-diffusing <b>plastic</b> were up to 10 % higher than in the lettuces grown <b>under</b> clear <b>plastic,</b> mainly {{as a result of}} higher leaf K contents (up to 19 % higher). In addition, use of the light-diffusing plastic tended to increase leaf nitrate contents (by up to 23 %). The leaf solid soluble content and acidity values were higher in the lettuces grown <b>under</b> the light-diffusing <b>plastic,</b> while leaf pH values were lower than in the control plants. The findings showed that the light-diffusing plastic was detrimental to production of compact heads of lettuce, and to some quality parameters such as nitrate and pigment contents.
