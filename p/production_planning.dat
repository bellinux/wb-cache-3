5|$|The series {{production}} of the T-26, equipped with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets {{proved to be more}} suitable for mass production. The {{production of the}} T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10mm thick instead of the planned 13mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the Bolshevik Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from mild steel. Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of armour plate as well as to mount engines of better quality. The business plan for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the Bolshevik Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of Special Machine Industry, consisting of four factories, was established {{to solve the problem of}} tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45mm gun was launched in mid-1933.|$|E
5|$|With Canada at war for {{the first}} time since its version of the Victoria Cross was created, {{preparations}} for a physical cast of the medal were initiated in 2006, when a committee called the Victoria Cross <b>Production</b> <b>Planning</b> Group was formed under the leadership of the Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall. It originally consisted of representatives from the Department of National Defence, Veterans Affairs Canada, and the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada, and the group later expanded to include individuals from the Department of Canadian Heritage, Natural Resources Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mint, with assistance provided by the Queen and the British Ministry of Defence. Following their research and deliberations, the first Victoria Cross decoration was struck in 2007, as confirmed by Deputy Herald Chancellor Emmanuelle Sajous, and the medal was officially released to the public on 16 May 2008 by Governor General Michaëlle Jean at Rideau Hall. It was one of 20 cast, each of which is composed of three groupings of metals: that of a Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol (18541855), donated by Queen Elizabeth II; a Confederation Medal, created to mark Canada's confederation in 1867; and a selection of metals from each of Canada's regions. These were cast, rather than struck, continuing the tradition started in the United Kingdom when it was found the metal alloy was too brittle for striking, and finished at the Royal Canadian Mint. The first two were sent to Buckingham Palace for addition to the British Royal Collection and other specimens were kept as part of the Crown Collection at Rideau Hall, as well as at the Department of National Defence, Library and Archives Canada, and the Canadian War Museum.|$|E

40|$|The {{strategic}} {{problem of}} selecting a <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> {{for a given}} planning horizon is usually treated as independent of the tactical problem of scheduling the <b>production</b> <b>plan.</b> This paper approaches both selecting the <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> and scheduling it as one problem. The problem is formulated as a zero-one integer program. The formulation accommodates many real-life considerations. The integer program is solved using a branch and bound procedure which provides the optimal <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> and schedule {{as well as the}} importance indices of the orders, a concept which is introduced and used in this study to rank the available orders within the planning horizon according to their importance to the firm.

25|$|Regarding <b>production</b> <b>planning,</b> {{there is}} a basic {{distinction}} between the push approach and the pull approach, with the later including the singular approach of just in time. Pull means that the production system authorizes production based on inventory level; push means that production occurs based on demand (forecasted or present, that is purchase orders). An individual production system can be both push and pull; for example activities before the CODP may work under a pull system, while activities after the CODP may work under a push system.|$|E

At this point, concerns that the aircraft was obsolete had become widespread; however, due to the difficulties associated of getting other aircraft types into production and the labour setup having already been established and running, stop-gap orders were maintained and production continued at a steady rate through to late 1940.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: - The feature model {{policy is}} an {{important}} area of mass customisation. It examines how fulfilment performance varies when different <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> distributions are exposed to different demand distributions. Methodology: - A simulation model is used to simulate the VBTO vehicle production system. Different <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> and customer demand are generated with Beta distribution and put into system to capture system performances. Findings: - With the differences grow between <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> and market demand, reconfiguration becomes less and less useful. As a result, more BTO products required. The increase of BTO products would lower system performance in terms of stock level, stock age and average customer waiting time. Practical implications: - Matching <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> and marketing demand enable vehicle manufacturers to reduce lead time and inventory cost {{at the same time}} improve customer satisfaction by reducing average customer waiting time. Under downstream reconfiguration environment, it is profitable to develop <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> distribution skew higher than marketing demand distribution.

25|$|The Mark 14 {{was central}} to the torpedo scandal of the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force during World War II. Inadequate <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> led to severe {{shortages}} of the weapon. The frugal, Depression-era, peacetime testing of both the torpedo and its exploder was woefully inadequate and had not uncovered many serious design problems. Torpedoes were so expensive that the Navy was unwilling to perform tests that would destroy a torpedo. Furthermore, the design defects tended to mask each other. Much of the blame commonly attached to the Mark14 correctly belongs to the Mark6 exploder. These defects, {{in the course of}} fully twenty months of war, were exposed, as torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{planning}} for the Pinto began {{in the summer of}} 1967; was recommended by Ford's Product Planning Committee in December 1968; and approved by Ford's Board of Directors in January 1969. Ford President Lee Iacocca wanted a 1971 model that weighed less than 2,000 pounds and that would be priced at less than $2,000. The Pinto product development, from conception through delivery, was completed in 25 months, when the automotive industry average was 43 months; the Pinto project was the shortest <b>production</b> <b>planning</b> schedule in automotive history up to that time. Some development processes usually conducted sequentially were conducted in parallel. Machine tooling overlapped with product development, which froze the basic design. Decisions which threatened the schedule were discouraged. The attitude of Ford management was to develop the Pinto as quickly as possible. Iacocca ordered a rush project to build the car, and the Pinto became known internally as [...] "Lee's car." [...] The Pinto's bodywork was styled by Robert Eidschun.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for the robust design of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) that undergo the forecasted product plan variations. The resource allocation and the operation schedule of a FMS are modeled as a colored Petri net and an associated transition firing sequence.

40|$|In open-pit mining of lignite, <b>production</b> <b>plans</b> {{have to be}} set up for {{a period}} of about twenty to thirty years. This is partly due to the close {{interaction}} of <b>production</b> <b>plans</b> and investment plans and partly due to legal requirements for open-pit mining in Germany.

The total deposit of lignite in the field as well as the stratification of the layers of waste material and lignite can he considered as stochastic variables. The <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> is formulated as a chance-constrained programming problem. The model requires maximization of a linear form subject to linear and non-linear constraints. In order to facilitate computation of the large-scale problems encountered in practical applications the original model is changed into a straightforward linear programming model. An iteration procedure is derived by which the solution to the original non-linear problem is found. The <b>production</b> <b>plan</b> is computed for different levels of acceptable risk. The results form a risk-profit-surface from which management has to pick the optimum-optimorum plan according to its risk-preference function. ...|$|R
