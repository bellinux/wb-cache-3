50|$|Amaranthus retroflexus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Amaranthaceae family with several common names, including red-root amaranth, redroot pigweed, red-rooted pigweed, common amaranth, <b>pigweed</b> <b>amaranth,</b> and common tumbleweed.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{examples}} of Amaranth species are Amaranthus albus, Amaranthus blitoides, Amaranthus hybridus, Amaranthus palmeri, Amaranthus powellii, Amaranthus retroflexus, Amaranthus spinosus, Amaranthus tuberculatus, and Amaranthus viridis. Amaranthus retroflexus, [...] "pigweed," [...] is a wild amaranth species {{native to the}} United States and is considered a weed in the Northeast, Nebraska and Great Plains, South, and West. The name derives from the plant's tendency to sprout where hogs are pasture-fed. Although both its leaves and its seeds are edible, <b>pigweed</b> <b>amaranth</b> has not been cultivated as a food crop.|$|E

40|$|Numerous weedy {{species in}} the pigweed family (Amaranthaceae) are found across Iowa, {{including}} waterhemp, redroot pigweed, smooth <b>pigweed,</b> Powell <b>amaranth</b> and others. At this time, Palmer amaranth has not been confirmed in the state, but because of its presence in surrounding states we suspect it may be here, or {{will appear in the}} near future...|$|R

50|$|Amaranthus hybridus, {{commonly}} called green amaranth, slim amaranth, smooth <b>amaranth,</b> smooth <b>pigweed,</b> or red <b>amaranth,</b> is {{a species of}} annual flowering plant. It is a weedy species found now over much of North America and introduced into Europe and Eurasia.|$|R
40|$|Several pigweed {{species are}} found in the Great Plains. Pigweeds {{commonly}} reduce crop yields and interfere with harvest. One means of controlling these weeds is through the use of herbicides. Recent research indicates that some pigweed species respond differently to various herbicides; therefore, proper identification is needed for good control. This extension contains a generalized distribution map; photographs of seeds, seedling, and mature plants; and text describing other identifying features for each pigweed species. The species are grouped with others that have similar shape and form. The pigweed species listed in this publication are: redroot pigweed, smooth <b>pigweed,</b> Powell <b>amaranth,</b> spiny <b>amaranth,</b> tumble <b>pigweed,</b> prostrate pigweed, common waterhemp, tall waterhemp, and Palmer amaranth...|$|R
30|$|AHAS in Arabidopsis {{comprises}} of 670 {{amino acids}} while in rice it is 644 amino acids long (Sathasivan et al. 1990; [URL] At least seventeen alleles of AHAS gene, harbouring mutations in amino acids at single or multiple positions such as, 121, 122, 124, 197, 199, 205, 206, 376, 574, 653 and 654 (with respect to Arabisopsis) and conferring tolerance to imidazolinone, {{have been reported}} across crops (rice, maize, canola, sunflower and wheat) and 87 weed species including prickly lettuce, <b>pigweed,</b> livid <b>amaranth</b> and weedy rice (Shaner, 1999; Duggleby and Pang, 2000; Heap, 2016 from [URL] The occurrence of multiple alleles {{and all of them}} conferring tolerance to Imidazolinone and/or sulfonylurea treatment suggests that mutations across AHAS could render them unresponsive to these groups of herbicides. In weeds, Ala 122, Pro 197, Ala 205, Asp 376, Arg 377, Trp 574, Ser 653 and Gly 654 are the eight confirmed target sites reported across genera and countries so far ([URL] accessed on 21 Nov 2016). In weedy rice alone, three mutations, G 654 E, S 653 D and A 122 T are known (Roso et al. 2010). Among them, the change S 653 D (S 627 D in rice) is common across crops and weeds (Croughan 2002) whereas the rice Clearfield events released in USA had mutation G 654 E (G 628 E in rice) as known from the patent search (US 20070028318 A 1). Thus, the HTM rice, identified in the current study with multiple amino acid substitutions (Table  4), all different from the rice Clearfield event, and is free from IPR issues.|$|R
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of pottery, its widespread use, {{and the increased}} sophistication of its forms and decoration, first believed to have occurred around 1,000 BCE, is a major demarcation of the Woodland era. Archaic pots were thick, heavy, and fragile, but Woodland pottery pots were more intricately designed, and had more uses, such as for cooking and storing surplus food. Woodland peoples also used baskets and gourds for containers too. Around 200BCE, maize production migrated to the eastern United States from Mexico. The {{introduction of}} corn is when Kentucky natives slowly changed from growing indigenous plants to a maize based agricultural economy. In addition to cultivating corn, the Woodland people also cultivated giant ragweeds, <b>amaranth</b> (<b>pigweed),</b> and maygrass. The initial four plants {{known to have been}} domesticated were goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macroscarpus), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), and squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera) (gourds). Woodland people raised tobacco in their gardens which they used for smoking. Woodland people still used ground stone tools, especially for processing nuts and seeds. They mined both Mammoth Cave and Salts Cave for gypsum and mirabilite, a salty seasoning. Shellfish was still an important part of their diets, and the most common prey was white-tailed deer. Spears also continued to be made, but late in the Woodland era, the straight bow became the typical weapon of choice in the eastern United States, which is illustrated by the reduction in size of arrowheads. In addition to bows and arrows, some southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns. Between 100 BCE and 450BC, the native Americans in Kentucky begin to build burial mounds, which indicates social change. The Woodland Indians buried their dead in conical, and then later flat, or oval-shaped, burial mounds, which were often [...] high (like Serpent Mound). This practice resulted in the Woodland people being called the Mound Builders by 19th-century observers.|$|R
