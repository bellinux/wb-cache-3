5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the <b>phylogeny</b> of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant <b>phylogeny</b> and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm <b>Phylogeny</b> Group (1998).|$|E
40|$|Recently, dated <b>phylogenies</b> {{have been}} {{increasingly}} used for ecological studies on community structure and conservation planning. There is, however, a major impediment to a systematic application of phylogenetic methods in ecology: reliable <b>phylogenies</b> with time-calibrated branch lengths are lacking {{for a large}} number of taxonomic groups and this condition is likely to continue for a long time. A solution for this problem consists in using undated <b>phylogenies</b> or taxonomic hierarchies as proxies for dated <b>phylogenies.</b> Nonetheless, little is known on the potential loss of information of these approaches compared to studies using dated <b>phylogenies</b> with time-calibrated branch lengths. The aim {{of this study is to}} ask how the use of undated <b>phylogenies</b> and taxonomic hierarchies biases a very simple measure of diversity, the mean pairwise phylogenetic distance between community species, compared to the diversity of dated <b>phylogenies</b> derived from the freely available software Phylomatic. This is illustrated with three sets of data on plant species sampled at different scales. Our results show that: (1) surprisingly, the diversity computed from dated <b>phylogenies</b> derived from Phylomatic is more strongly related to the diversity computed from taxonomic hierarchies than to the diversity computed from undated <b>phylogenies,</b> while (2) less surprisingly, the strength of this relationship increases if we consider only angiosperm specie...|$|R
50|$|According to Fahrenholz's rule, when host-{{parasite}} cospeciation has occurred, the <b>phylogenies</b> of {{the host}} and parasite come to mirror each other. In host-parasite <b>phylogenies,</b> and all species <b>phylogenies</b> for that matter, perfect mirroring is rare. Host-parasite <b>phylogenies</b> can be altered by host switching, extinction, independent speciation, and other ecological events, making cospeciation harder to detect. However, cospeciation {{is not limited to}} parasitism, but has been documented in symbiotic relationships like those of gut microbes in primates.|$|R

40|$|<b>Phylogenies</b> {{of species}} assemblages {{are vital to}} many studies of {{community}} ecology and macroecology. However, few assemblage <b>phylogenies</b> are currently available, and the approaches {{that have been used}} to construct them have had a number of important limitations. Here, we estimate a Bayesian posterior sample of <b>phylogenies</b> for all 275 known extinct and extant native birds of New Zealand. To do this, we use an approach that uses freely-available data and software, can incorporate both extinct and extant taxa, does not rely on having DNA sequence data available for all species in the assemblage, and explicitly accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty. This approach produces a set of <b>phylogenies</b> that describes our knowledge and uncertainty about the relationships among the NZ birds. We also present a python script, GeneFinder, which can be used to efficiently gather publicly available sequence data in order to construct a supermatrix of DNA sequences for constructing assemblage <b>phylogenies.</b> The approach we describe paves the way for estimating assemblage <b>phylogenies</b> for any species assemblage. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between body size and metabolic rate {{is a crucial}} issue in organismal biology and evolution. There has been considerable debate over whether the scaling exponent of the relationship is 0. 75 (Kleiber’s Law) or 0. 67. Here we show that determination of this exponent for mammals depends on both the evolutionary tree and the regression model used in the comparative analysis. For example, more recent molecular-based <b>phylogenies</b> tend to support a 0. 67 exponent, whereas older <b>phylogenies,</b> mostly based on morphological data, suggest a 0. 75 exponent. However, molecular <b>phylogenies</b> yield more variable results than morphological <b>phylogenies</b> and thus are not currently helping to resolve the issue. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of diversification rates using phylogenetic data {{has attracted a}} lot of attention in the past decade. In this context, the analysis of incomplete <b>phylogenies</b> (e. g. <b>phylogenies</b> resolved at the family level but unresolved at the species level) has remained difficult. I present here a likelihood-based method to combine partly resolved <b>phylogenies</b> with taxonomic (species-richness) data to estimate speciation and extinction rates. This method is based on fitting a birth-and-death model to both phylogenetic and taxonomic data. Some examples of the method are presented with data on birds and on mammals. The method is compared with existing approaches that deal with incomplete <b>phylogenies.</b> Some applications and generalizations of the approach introduced in this paper are further discussed...|$|R
5|$|From 1988 onwards {{analyses}} {{based on}} molecular <b>phylogeny,</b> which compares biochemical {{features such as}} similarities in DNA, have placed brachiopods among the Lophotrochozoa, a protostome super-phylum that includes molluscs, annelids and flatworms but excludes the other protostome super-phylum Ecdysozoa, whose members include arthropods.

5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm <b>Phylogeny</b> Group to publish in 1998 a <b>phylogeny</b> of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E
