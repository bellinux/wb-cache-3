5|$|Phosphorylation is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which a}} small phosphate group is added to another molecule to change that molecule's activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation {{to carry out the}} two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing AMPA receptors to increase their activity. Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of protein synthesis. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> under the influence of protein kinases. As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.|$|E
5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane,</b> the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{opposite}} is {{a region of}} the postsynaptic cell containing neurotransmitter receptors; for synapses between two neurons the postsynaptic region may {{be found on the}} dendrites or cell body.

30|$|The {{maintenance}} of the background set of inter-postsynaptic membrane functional LINKs {{is essential for the}} specific conformation of the C-semblance for consciousness (Fig.  4). Any alteration in the conformation of the C-semblance can lead to loss of consciousness. The abutted <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> are anchored to the ECM through structural proteins. Extra-synaptic locations on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> extending at least 25  nm beyond the synaptic specialization where GluA 1 AMPA receptor subunits concentrate (77) are regions of continuous exocytosis and endocytosis. Since this process involves the addition and removal of lipid membrane segments, lateral aspects of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> immediately outside the synapse is an area of dynamic membrane reorganization. Membranes at the resting state have a specific conformational energy. Different forces that keep the membranes separate include hydration, electrostatic and steric forces, whereas van der Waal’s forces bring two membranes together (Cevc 1987).|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} mGluRs are {{distributed}} differently in cells.

25|$|CNKSR2 is a multidomain {{protein that}} {{functions}} as a scaffold protein to mediate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways downstream from Ras. This gene product is induced by vitamin D and inhibits apoptosis in certain cancer cells.

25|$|Due to {{the strong}} depolarization, the {{permeability}} of the membrane for potassium ions increases fast, resulting in a potassium reflux to release the positive charge out of the cell. Not only the permeability for potassium ions but also the permeability for calcium ions increases {{as a result of}} the depolarization of the membrane. A calcium influx takes place. The increase of the calcium concentration in the cell stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors at the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> to open the sodium-channels there, generating a new action potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} ion {{channels}} on the post-synaptic membrane affects {{the strength of}} the synapse. Research suggests that the density of receptors on post-synaptic membranes changes, affecting the neuron’s excitability in response to stimuli. In a dynamic process that is maintained in equilibrium, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor) and AMPA receptors are added to the membrane by exocytosis and removed by endocytosis. These processes, and by extension the number of receptors on the membrane, can be altered by synaptic activity. Experiments have shown that AMPA receptors are delivered to the synapse through vesicular membrane fusion with the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> via the protein kinase CaMKII, which is activated by the influx of calcium through NMDA receptors. CaMKII also improves AMPA ionic conductance through phosphorylation.|$|E

40|$|While many {{theories}} of general anesthesia postulate a lipid site of action, {{there has been}} no adequate explanation for the lack of anesthetic potency of the highly hydrophobic primary alkanols with more than 12 carbons (the cut-off). Some work suggests that these nonanesthetic alcohols do not dissolve in membranes. Other work contradicts this and suggests that an anesthetic site on a protein provides a better explanation. Here we show that both the anesthetic dodecanol and the nonanesthetic tetradecanol are taken up equally well into the tissues of animals and into isolated <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes.</b> When a group of Rana pipiens tadpoles were treated with dodecanol, half were anesthetized by 4. 7 microM (free aqueos concentration), and the corresponding concentration in the tissues was found to be 0. 4 mmol per kg wet weight. Prolonged exposure (92 hr) to tetradecanol produced even higher tissue concentrations (0. 7 mmol per kg wet weight), yet no anesthetic effects were observed. Furthermore, general anesthetics are thought to act on <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> but both alkanols partitioned into <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> from Torpedo electroplaques. The spin label, 12 -doxyl stearate, was incorporated into these membranes. The lipid order parameter it reported was decreased by the anesthetic alcohols (octanol, decanol, and dodecanol), whereas the nonanesthetic alcohols either did not change it significantly (tetradecanol) or actually increased it (hexadecanol and octadecanol). Thus, although lipid solubility is unable to account for the pharmacology of the cut-off in potency of the long-chain alcohols, lipid perturbations provide an accurate description...|$|R

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{neuromuscular junction}} (NMJ), a peripheral synapse formed between motoneuron and skeletal muscle, {{is characterized by}} a protracted postnatal period of maturation and life-long maintenance. In neuromuscular disorders such as congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs), disruptions of NMJ maturation and/or maintenance are frequently observed. In particular, defective neuromuscular transmission associated with structural and molecular abnormalities at the pre- and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes,</b> {{as well as at the}} synaptic cleft, has been reported in these patients.

50|$|Silent synapses release {{glutamate}} as do prototypical glutamatergic synapses, {{but their}} <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> contain only NMDA—and possibly mGlu—receptors able to bind glutamate. Though AMPA receptors are not {{expressed in the}} <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> of silent synapses, they are stored in vesicles inside the postsynaptic cells, where they cannot detect extracellular glutamate, but can be quickly inserted into the <b>postsynaptic</b> cell <b>membrane</b> {{in response to a}} tetanizing stimulus. The NMDAR is functionally similar to AMPAR except for two major differences: NMDARs carry ion currents composed of Na+, K+, but also (unlike most AMPAR) Ca2+; NMDARs also have a site inside their ion channel that binds magnesium ions (Mg2+). This magnesium binding site is located in the pore of the channel, at a place within the electrical field generated by the membrane potential. Normally, current will not flow through the NMDAR channel, even when it has bound glutamate. This is because the ion channel associated with this receptor is plugged by magnesium, acting like a cork in a bottle. However, since the Mg2+ is charged and is bound within the membrane's electric field, depolarization of the membrane potential above threshold can dislodge the magnesium, allowing current flow through the NMDAR channel. This gives the NMDAR the property of being voltage-dependent, in that it requires strong postsynaptic depolarization to allow ion flux.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of chemical synapses is that they are the site of action for the majority of psychoactive drugs. [...] Synapses are affected by drugs such as curare, strychnine, cocaine, morphine, alcohol, LSD, and countless others. These drugs have different effects on synaptic function, and often are restricted to synapses that use a specific neurotransmitter. For example, curare is a poison that stops acetylcholine from depolarizing the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane,</b> causing paralysis. Strychnine blocks the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter glycine, which causes the body to pick up and react to weaker and previously ignored stimuli, resulting in uncontrollable muscle spasms. Morphine acts on synapses that use endorphin neurotransmitters, and alcohol increases the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. LSD interferes with synapses that use the neurotransmitter serotonin. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine and therefore increases its effects.|$|E
2500|$|Synapses may be {{electrical}} or chemical. [...] Electrical synapses make direct {{electrical connections}} between neurons, but chemical synapses {{are much more}} common, and much more diverse in function. [...] At a chemical synapse, the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is called postsynaptic. [...] Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process. [...] The presynaptic area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles, packed with neurotransmitter chemicals. [...] When the presynaptic terminal is electrically stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are activated, and cause {{the contents of the}} vesicles to be released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, called the synaptic cleft. [...] The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane,</b> causing them to enter an activated state. [...] Depending on the type of receptor, the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more complex ways. For example, release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a motor neuron and a muscle cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell. [...] The entire synaptic transmission process takes only a fraction of a millisecond, although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer (even indefinitely, in cases where the synaptic signal leads to the formation of a memory trace).|$|E
2500|$|The AMPA {{receptor}} (AMPAR) is {{the engine}} that drives excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). [...] While {{some forms of}} the AMPAR can conduct calcium, most AMPARs found in the neocortex do not. [...] The AMPAR, upon binding two glutamate molecules, undergoes a conformational change that resembles {{the opening of a}} clam shell. [...] This conformational change opens an ion channel within the AMPAR protein structure that allows sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out (i.e. it is a mixed cation-conducting channel). [...] The Na+ and K+ permeabilities of the AMPAR channel are roughly equal, so when this channel is open the resulting change in membrane potential tends towards zero (a bit more than halfway between the equilibrium potentials EK and ENa). [...] This balance point is reached at around 0 mV (i.e. the reversal potential of the EPSP current is roughly 0 mV). [...] However, the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> potential will not change by more than a few millivolts from resting potential with a single presynaptic release of glutamate, because not many AMPAR channels open. [...] The lifetime of the glutamate in the synaptic cleft is too short to allow more than a brief opening of the AMPAR channel, thus causing only a small depolarization. The open AMPAR channel is often considered to be non-calcium permeable, but this is only an approximation as AMPARs with certain subunit compositions will allow calcium through, albeit at different levels and frequency to NMDARs.|$|E
40|$|At the synapse, {{presynaptic}} membranes specialized for vesicular traffic {{are linked}} to <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> specialized for signal transduction. The mechanisms that connect pre- and <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> into synaptic junctions are unknown. Neuroligins and β-neurexins are neuronal cell-surface proteins that bind {{to each other and}} form asymmetric intercellular junctions. To test whether the neuroligin/β-neurexin junction is related to synapses, we generated and characterized monoclonal antibodies to neuroligin 1. With these antibodies, we show that neuroligin 1 is synaptic. The neuronal localization, subcellular distribution, and developmental expression of neuroligin 1 {{are similar to those of}} the postsynaptic marker proteins PSD- 95 and NMDA-R 1 receptor. Quantitative immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated that neuroligin 1 is clustered in synaptic clefts and postsynaptic densities. Double immunofluorescence labeling revealed that neuroligin 1 colocalizes with glutamatergic but not γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic synapses. Thus neuroligin 1 is a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule that is enriched in postsynaptic densities where it may recruit receptors, channels, and signal-transduction molecules to synaptic sites of cell adhesion. In addition, the neuroligin/β-neurexin junction may be involved in the specification of excitatory synapses...|$|R

However, antibodies against muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), which constitute a major subclass of antibodies found in MG patients, do not activate the complement pathway. To investigate the pathophysiology of MuSK-MG and establish an experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) model, we injected MuSK protein into mice deficient in complement component five (C 5).

In addition, we observed morphological and functional defects in the NMJs of EAMG mice, demonstrating that complement activation is not necessary for the onset of MuSK-MG.

50|$|Normal {{transmission}} {{across a}} glutamatergic synapse {{relies on the}} neurotransmitter glutamate, the glutamate-specific AMPA receptor (AMPAR), and calcium ions. Calcium ion entry into the presynaptic terminal causes the presynaptic release of glutamate, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft, binding to glutamate receptors on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> There are four subtypes of glutamate receptors: AMPA receptors (AMPARs) (formerly known as quisqualate receptors), NMDA receptors (NMDARs), kainate receptors, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Most research {{has been focused on}} the AMPARs and the NMDARs. When glutamate binds to AMPARs located on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane,</b> they permit a mixed flow of Na+ and K+ to cross the cells membrane, causing a depolarization of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> This localized depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).|$|E

30|$|The {{cellular}} {{changes of}} the anesthetic-induced inter-postsynaptic membrane functional LINK are a spectrum of changes, ranging from direct membrane contact to reversible, inter-postsynaptic membrane hemifusion restricted to very small areas of approximately 10  nm 2.

Development of high-resolution imaging techniques that can resolve real-time changes at nanometer scales (Chen et al. 2014) will help with understanding reorganization, close contact, hemifusion and reversal of hemifusion at nanoscale domains of <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes.</b>|$|R
30|$|Associative {{learning}} produces {{changes at}} locations of convergence of stimulus inputs through {{enlargement of the}} postsynapses (dendritic spines) of synapses that abut each other. This change in spine geometry {{is found to be}} critical in AMPA receptor expression (Matsuzaki et al. 2001) and are expected to occur on the abutted <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> of those synapses that move close to each other. The finding that GluA 1 AMPA receptor subunits concentrate at the extra-synaptic locations, extending nearly 25  nm beyond the synaptic specialization (Jacob and Weinberg 2014), matches with the locations where <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membranes</b> are expected to interact. A very large amount of pressure, nearly 109  N/m 2, is required to merge the outer leaflets of artificial membranes that are in contact (Markin et al. 1984). To minimize the work, the membrane hemifusion is expected to take place at a very small point of contact involving a minimum number of lipid molecules, making it a site-restricted process that is limited to areas as small as 10  nm 2 (Leikin et al. 1987). In this respect, the localized area of membrane reorganization, 25  nm beyond the synaptic specialization where AMPA receptor subunit exocytosis takes place (Jacob and Weinberg 2014), is an ideal candidate location for inter-postsynaptic membrane interaction.|$|R

5000|$|An {{inhibitory}} postsynaptic potential (IPSP) {{is a kind of}} synaptic {{potential that}} makes a postsynaptic neuron less likely to generate an action potential. The opposite of an {{inhibitory postsynaptic potential}} is an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which is a synaptic potential that makes a postsynaptic neuron more likely to generate an action potential. IPSPs can take place at all chemical synapses, which use the secretion of neurotransmitters to create cell to cell signalling. Inhibitory presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that then bind to the postsynaptic receptors; this induces a change in the permeability of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane to particular ions. An electric current that changes the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> potential to create a more negative postsynaptic potential is generated, i.e. the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> potential becomes more negative than the resting membrane potential, and this is called hyperpolarisation. In order for an action potential to be generated, depolarisation of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> needs to occur, where the membrane potential becomes more positive than resting membrane potential. Therefore, hyperpolarisation of the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> makes it less likely for depolarisation to sufficiently occur to generate an action potential in the postsynaptic neurone.|$|E
5000|$|End plate {{potentials}} (EPPs) are the depolarizations of {{skeletal muscle}} fibers caused by neurotransmitters binding to the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> in the neuromuscular junction. They are called [...] "end plates" [...] because the postsynaptic terminals of muscle fibers have a large, saucer-like appearance. When an action potential reaches the axon terminal of a motor neuron, vesicles carrying neurotransmitters (mostly acetylcholine) are exocytosed and the contents are {{released into the}} neuromuscular junction. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane</b> and lead to its depolarization. In {{the absence of an}} action potential, acetylcholine vesicles spontaneously leak into the neuromuscular junction and cause very small depolarizations in the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>membrane.</b> This small response (~0.4mV) is called a miniature end plate potential (MEPP) and is generated by one acetylcholine-containing vesicle.

This relatively rare disease serves as a model not only for study of the pathogenesis and treatment of all autoimmune disorders but also for understanding the basic mechanisms of neuromuscular transmission at the NMJ. About 80 to 85 % of patients with MG have autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChR).

The observation that artificial stimulation of an intermediate order of neurons of a normal nervous system induces hallucinations indicates that the lateral entry of activity (not resulting from canonical synaptic transmission) at intermediate neuronal orders may provide a mechanism for hallucinations. Meaningful hallucinations can be de-constructed into an organized temporal sequence of internal sensations of associatively learned items that occur {{in the absence of any}} external stimuli.
