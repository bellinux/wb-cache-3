40|$|The {{incidence}} of back injuries {{has been shown}} to be greater in occupations as heavy manual work than light manual work. To plan a programme aimed at reducing the {{incidence of}} back injuries in industry those workers at high risk of incurring handling accidents and back injuries need to be identified and a knowledge of the specific occupational factors causing such injuries sought. This has been achieved for telecommunications engineers using epidemiological and radio <b>pressure</b> <b>pill</b> methodologies. The results verify the correlation between the back injury rates and physical work stresses of different occupational groups. The magnitude and relative frequency of trunk stresses in hazardous tasks has been determined and compared with those with lower incidences of back disorders. The study has confirmed that in examining manual handling hazards in industrial male populations a critical value of truncal stress can be applied and used to determine the safety of occupational factors in relation to their potential causing or contributing to degenerative back diseases...|$|E

50|$|Urinary {{retention}} is {{a common}} disorder in elderly males. The {{most common cause of}} urinary retention is BPH. This disorder starts around age 50 and symptoms may appear after 10-15 years. BPH is a progressive disorder and narrows the neck of the bladder leading to urinary retention. By the age of 70, almost 10 percent of males have some degree of BPH and 33% have it by the eighth decade of life. While BPH rarely causes sudden urinary retention, the condition can become acute in the presence of certain medications (blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pills,</b> anti histamines, antiparkinson medications), after spinal anaesthesia or stroke.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A radiotelemetric system using dual <b>pressure</b> <b>pills</b> {{was used}} to record the jejunal {{motility}} in man. Prolonged recordings were made under relatively physiological conditions. Six patients with functional abdominal pain and six age/sex matched normal subjects were studied. Motility patterns varied markedly both within and between subjects. No differences were detected between the two groups. In particular, the occurrence of characteristic pain in the patients bore {{no relation to the}} recorded motor activity. The wide range of jejunal motility patterns in normal subjects needs to be appreciated before conclusions can be drawn about possible abnormalities in gut diseases or disorders. Despite the development of sophisticated methods for recording electrical and pressure changes within the alimentary tract, our understanding of small bowel motility is limited. The normal pattern in dogs was defined by Szurszewskil and Code 2 and similar activity has been shown in man. 3 4 It seems probable, however, that motor activity is more variable in man 5 6 than dogs and that care should be exercised in the interpretation of supposed abnormalities such as those recently described in a patient with irritable bowel syndrome. 7 The aims of the present study were twofold. Firstly, we made prolonged recordings of jejunal motor activity in normal subjects under relatively physiological conditions to observe variations within and between subjects during fasting, feeding, and sleeping. Secondly, we made similar recordings in patients suffering from functional abdominal pain in whom a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome had been made...|$|R

50|$|QTCs come in {{different}} forms and each form is used differently {{but has a}} similar resistance change when deformed. QTC pills are {{the most commonly used}} type of QTC. <b>Pills</b> are <b>pressure</b> sensitive variable resistors.

QTC sheets are composed of three layers: a thin layer of QTC material, a conductive material and a plastic insulator. QTC sheets allow a quick switch from high to low resistance and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between contraceptive pill use, urinary sodium {{and blood pressure}} was investigated in {{a random sample of}} the premenopausal female inhabitants of 2 small Belgian towns. Systolic and diastolic pressure tended to be higher in 58 present pill users (126 +/- 11 / 75 +/- 9 mm Hg: mean +/- standard deviation) than in 110 women not currently taking the contraceptive pill (123 +/- 11 / 74 +/- 8 mm Hg). Their urinary sodium excretion averaged 149 +/- 47 and 143 +/- 57 mEq/ 24 h, respectively. Systolic pressure was positively associated with 24 -hour urinary sodium in pill users (r = + 0. 41; p less than 0. 01) and in those not on the pill (r = + 0. 19; p less than 0. 05). This association was independent of age and persisted after adjusting for body weight and pulse rate in pill users, but was no longer apparent in the others when body weight, pulse rate, and age were taken into account. Thus, pill use was associated with an elevation of arterial pressure. In subjects taking the pill a positive association was observed between the urinary sodium excretion and systolic pressure. It is therefore possible that the systolic <b>pressure</b> of <b>pill</b> users becomes responsive to their usual sodium intake. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{intra-uterine}} balloon {{is one of}} the commonest {{methods used}} in investigating uterine con-tractility. The micro-balloon measures the maximum intra-uterine pressure that is developed in a closed system as the myometrium contracts. That intra-uterine pressure measurement is a reliable reflection of myometrial contractility at a physiological level was shown by Csapo(1963) who recorded the electrical activity of the uterus simultaneously with intra-uterine pressure and found good correlation between the two in the rabbit. The micro-balloon method was adopted to study various aspects of the pharmacological control of uterine activity in late gestation in the rat by means of various anti-enzymes. Fuchs (1969) has used large intra-uterine balloons and Boer, Lincoln & Swaab (1975) have used <b>pressure</b> sensitive <b>pills</b> to record uterine activity during late pregnancy and parturition in rats without investigating the effect of these devices on the parturient process. The present study was an attempt to investigate the effect of an intra-uterine micro-balloon on the process of parturition in the rat. Timed pregnant rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain were used, Day 1 of pregnancy was indi¬ cated by spermatozoa in the vaginal smear. They were allowed free access to food and water and were housed in plastic cages in light- (07. 00 - 19. 00 h) and temperature- (22 °C) controlled rooms. They were all primiparous rats.

50|$|One day, {{a drunken}} Hart {{showed up at}} Dinah's {{doorstep}} and she {{took advantage of the}} situation by telling him later that they'd made love. Later, she then slept with Rob so that she would become pregnant. The plan worked and Dinah told Hart that she was pregnant with his child. Marcus, a friend, who figured out what Dinah had done, tried to convince her to do the right thing; she was obsessed with getting Hart back and went along with the lie. After having a slight scare, Dinah lied to Hart that she was having a troubled pregnancy. Pleased when Hart vowed to stay by Dinah during her pregnancy, ultimately Cassie wouldn't leave Hart. Wanting to put a cramp in their relationship, Dinah gave Hart an ultimatum, either her and the baby or Cassie. Cassie soon learned of Dinah and Rob's tryst. Dinah later was able to bribe the doctor to convince Hart that a test was too dangerous. Tragically, days after learning that Cassie herself was pregnant, Dinah miscarried: while sneaking around by the farm, she was accidentally hit by a door by Hart, who wanted to see who was trespassing. She then used his guilt as well as her mother's blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pills</b> to con him into staying with her. Later, when she became ill from over-medicating herself, she conned Hart into marrying her by claiming to be dying. Although the plan worked, Hart was still drawn to Cassie, who had decided to lie to Hart by claiming the child she was carrying wasn't his. Determined to keep Hart with her, Dinah set fire to the farm. The fire left Dinah with terrible scars on her face, which made Hart feel more responsible to her. However, Hart was shocked when he overheard Dinah and Vanessa talking and discovered that he was the father of Cassie's baby. Though Dinah tried to convince him that she kept the truth from him because she loved him and wanted him to stay, he didn't buy it and left her. Although Vanessa again implored Dinah to get professional help, Dinah insisted that all she needed was Hart. Thinking her sister was picking her up, Cassie got into the car only to find Dinah behind the wheel. Dinah then locked the doors and drove into a snowstorm, ranting about how Cassie’s ruined her life. Worked up Dinah, skidded into a snow bank and the car got stuck. Just then, Cassie started to go into labor but Dinah didn’t believe her. Frantic, Cassie called Hart on his cell phone and he headed into the storm to find her. Angry, Dinah moved off telling Cassie to let Hart save her. However, Dinah returned to the car, realized that Cassie was serious and the baby may not make it without her help. So, Dinah acted and delivered the baby. Just then Hart arrived, thrilled and relieved to find Cassie and see his son for the first time.|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is a {{major risk}} factor for {{coronary}} heart disease, stroke, heart failure and renal disease. The Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 7 defined hypertension as a blood pressure of more than 140 / 90 mmHg and recommended to initiate treatment with a two-drug combination for stage 2 hypertension (blood pressure of 160 - 179 / 100 - 109 mmHg). The need for drug combinations is clear from a patient and physician perspective as they provide more effective blood <b>pressure</b> lowering, reduce <b>pill</b> burden, improve compliance and decrease hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. Angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy has been proven to be well tolerated and effective {{in the management of}} hypertension, chronic heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction and the prevention and progression of diabetic renal disease. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin system are an important component of antihypertensive combination therapy. Thiazide-type diuretics are usually added to increase the blood pressure lowering efficacy. Fixed drug-drug combinations of both principles, such as candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, are highly effective in lowering blood pressure while providing improved compliance, a good tolerability and largely neutral metabolic profile.

Also, ensure that your cholesterol levels are under control. Exercise is a must for all diabetics. Walking twice a day for 30 minutes can be a fair substitute for those not engaged in intense gym activities. Losing weight is also beneficial as this has been shown to improve blood sugar control, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce blood pressure.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates why Swaziland {{remained}} authoritarian {{state in}} a context where all its neighbours democratized. The world was overwhelmed by the democratization wave that swept the global south and Africa. Scholars and students of political science, public administration and economics {{have been trying to}} understand the democratization period and the reasons behind the advent demise of military regimes and one-party rule. Democracy became a household name across the globe. Western governments championed democracy and good governance in their foreign policies. The World Bank, the IMF and other supranational bodies used democracy and good governance as indicators for governance to access loans. The extensive study on ‘Democratic experiments in Africa’ by (Bratton and Van de Walle 1997) points out that in 1989 there were 29 countries that were under one party rule and 11 ruled by military regimes. But by 1994 not even one party rule remained. Most countries had competitive multiparty elections {{in the beginning of the}} 1990 ’s. In Southern Africa, the armed struggles in Namibia and South Africa and the civil war in Mozambique came to an end in the beginning of the 1990 ’s and ushered these countries into multiparty democracies. Despite the global democratization euphoria about the democratization in the world some regimes were untouched by the wave. Swaziland is one of those. The Swazi monarchy has been able to sustain its grip on political power without giving any space to political parties. To me as a student it is a puzzle how the regime could maintain its grip onto power and not democratize when all its neighbours did so. The thesis focuses on the failure of Swaziland to democratize at the peak of the democratization wave and the subsequent years after the wave stabilized. The thesis specifically studies the role of the external actors who are all powerful enough to exert pressure on the regime. The study also outlines the nature of the Swazi regime and gathers a perspective of the internal actors who are lobbying the external actors for support and the kind of support they seek from the external actors. The theoretical framework of the thesis is founded in three theories; historical institutionalism, linkage and leverage theory and international relations theories. The study uses these theories to uncover a deeper understanding of the role of the external actors. Historical institutionalism helps to trace the roots of authoritarianism in Swaziland, which the paper shows has its roots in the advent of colonial rule. The institution of the monarchy transformed itself to cooperate with the colonial government to benefit from the exploitation the general population. A path dependency developed over the decades as the monarchy centralizes power around itself and eliminating any political threats to its rule. The unholy relationship between the monarchy and some external actors was not only political but also economic. This relationship helped transform the monarchy into a conduit for foreign investment in Swaziland. The linkage and leverage theory developed by Levistky and Way (2010) for studying democratization argues that democratization is influenced by the Western external actors who pursue democracy. Their hypothesis is that whereby there are linkages between the external actor and the target regime, the external actor has more leverage and a high chance of democratization. These ties are economic, social, technocratic, inter-governmental, transnational civil society and communication. The study uses the international relations theories; realism and liberalism, to understand the behaviour of the external actors. The establishment of a democratic political dispensation is not only limited to internal actors but the international context matters too (Whitehead 1996). Lastly, the thesis concludes that the transition to democracy in Swaziland could have best been achieved by the cooperation between the internal and external actors <b>pilling</b> <b>pressure</b> on the regime. Democracy cannot be imported from abroad, however the internal actors need solidarity from the external in pursuit of democracy. </p...|$|R
