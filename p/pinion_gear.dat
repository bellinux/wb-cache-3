25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} <b>pinion</b> <b>gear).</b> When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E
500|$|This began {{what was}} to be called the [...] "Run to the South" [...] as Beatty changed course to steer east {{south-east}} at 3:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than [...] away. The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed by the British. The British ships were {{still in the process of}} making their turn as only the two leading ships, Lion and Princess Royal, had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The two battlecruisers engaged , the leading German ship, while Derfflinger targeted Princess Royal. The German fire was accurate from the start, with two hits on Princess Royal within the first three minutes. British gunnery was less effective; the range was incorrectly estimated as the German ships blended into the haze. Princess Royals 'A' turret stopped working effectively early in the battle: the left gun was rendered inoperable when the breech <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> sheared, and the right gun misfired frequently. By 3:54, the range was down to Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 3:57.|$|E
500|$|Inertance has {{the same}} units as mass (kilograms in the SI system) and the name {{indicates}} its relationship to inertia. [...] Smith did not just define a network theoretic element, he also suggested a construction for a real mechanical component and made a small prototype. [...] Smith's inerter consists of a plunger able to slide {{in or out of}} a cylinder. [...] The plunger is connected to a rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> which drives a flywheel inside the cylinder. [...] There can be two counter-rotating flywheels in order to prevent a torque developing. [...] Energy provided in pushing the plunger in will be returned when the plunger moves in the opposite direction, hence the device stores energy rather than dissipates it just like a block of mass. [...] However, the actual mass of the inerter can be very small, an ideal inerter has no mass. [...] Two points on the inerter, the plunger and the cylinder case, can be independently connected {{to other parts of the}} mechanical system with neither of them necessarily connected to ground.|$|E

500|$|The German minesweepers {{made good}} progress, despite minor damage from shell {{splinters}} and numerous near misses by Slava, Grazhdanin, Bayan, and the Russian shore batteries. During this period Slavas front turret became inoperable when a bronze rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>gear</b> bent {{so that the}} gear wheel could not be moved. Only eleven shots had been fired between the two guns in the turret before the breakdown.

Two more shells struck her at 10:24 in the superstructure near the forward funnel. They damaged a six-inch magazine and the forward stokehold (boiler room) and started a fire which was put out after about fifteen minutes. However, the forward left six-inch magazine was flooded as a precaution. At 10:39 two more shells hit her, killing three men in the boiler room and flooding a coal bunker. Around this time Slava and her compatriots were ordered to retire to the north while Bayan trailed behind to divert fire from the battleships.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The pin-rack gearing is a {{particular}} type of cycloidal gearing which transforms a rotation motion to a linear one. Comparing with rack and <b>pinion</b> <b>gearing</b> and hydraulic swing cylinder, the pin-rack gearing has a more compact structure, less mass and lower cost. Nevertheless, designers always worry about vibration, noise and low use life as pin-rack mechanism working caused by deficiency of design theory. The present research derived the pin-rack gearing tooth profile equation and studied the geometry relationship among design parameters. The results can help to improve the pin-rack gearing design. Instruction The pin-rack gearing is {{a particular}} type of cycloidal gearing which transforms a rotation motion to a linear one, as shown in Fig. 1. Although involute gearing has replaced cycloidal gearing in many areas, the pin-rack gearing still has broad applications, such as gate devices applying pin-rack gearing to raise or lower the gate [1] and military bridges using pin-rack gearing to erect or retract bridge sections [2].
