25|$|In December, 1997, several Canadian {{police forces}} formed a {{joint task force}} to manage their {{investigation}} into sniper attacks against three Canadian doctors, Romalis of Vancouver; Hugh Short of Ancaster, Ontario; and Jack Fainman of Winnipeg, Manitoba. On the joint task force were representatives of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the police forces of Vancouver, Hamilton, and Winnipeg. The <b>police</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> sniper attacks against Canadian physicians are terrorist acts and that {{the hunt for the}} attackers deserves a coordinated national effort. In 2001, James Kopp was charged with the shooting of Dr. Hugh Short and is suspected of committing the other two shootings. Kopp is currently in prison in the USA for the 1998 sniper-style murder of Barnett Slepian, an American physician from Amherst, New York who performed abortions.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. <b>Police</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E

[...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The <b>police</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Maryland, police {{officers}} sometimes ticket drivers for flashing car headlights under a law which prohibits driving {{in a vehicle}} with flashing lights and laws prohibiting [...] "obstructing a police investigation". The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland challenges the current interpretation of the law, contending the law refers to an adjective and not a verb; that automatic flashing lights on non-emergency vehicles are illegal, but the act by a driver of manually flashing a vehicle's headlamps is not. Though ticketing was common in the 1990s, Maryland and Washington DC <b>police</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> flashing one's headlights was not against the law in either place.|$|E
