5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{targeted}} {{as a key}} area for <b>population</b> <b>development</b> since the 1960s. In 1959, the London County Council negotiated 5000 new homes {{to be built in}} Ashford as overspill from London, which created most of what is now South Ashford and Kennington. The Buchanan Report, published in 1967, identified Ashford as a major town for growth. In 2001, Ashford was identified as one of four key areas for expansion in South East England. Subsequently, the Ashford's Future Company was set up to support a mix of publicly and privately funded projects in the town.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{collapse}} of a commercial pilchard fishery in 1960, African penguin diet has shifted towards anchovies to some extent, although available pilchard biomass is still a notable determinant of penguin <b>population</b> <b>development</b> and breeding success. While a diet of anchovy appears to be generally sufficient, it is not ideal due to lower concentrations of fat and protein. Penguin diet changes throughout the year; as in many seabirds, it is believed that the interaction of diet choice and breeding success helps the penguins maintain their population size. Although parent penguins are protective of their hatchlings, they will not incur nutritional deficits themselves if prey is scarce and hunting requires greater time or energy commitment. This may lead to higher rates of brood loss under poor food conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of the}} Commission on <b>Population</b> and <b>Development</b> is the {{follow-up}} {{to the implementation of}} the Programme of Action of the International Conference on <b>Population</b> and <b>Development.</b> The Commission would monitor, review and assess the implementation of the Programme of Action at the regional, national and international levels and advise the Economic and Social Council on issues such as populations issues and trends, integrating <b>population</b> and <b>development</b> strategies, and on <b>population</b> and related <b>development</b> policies and programmes.

The objective of the organization is to strengthen the regional network of parliamentarians who are committed to implementing the <b>population</b> and <b>development</b> agenda, particularly the Programme of Action of the International Conference on <b>Population</b> and <b>Development</b> (ICPD PoA) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). AFPPD aims to achieve this through capacity building for parliamentarians and National Committees.|$|R

Although other universities in the nation offer <b>population</b> and <b>development</b> related courses and conduct research and training, there is still need for abridging the gap for incorporating grassroots-based practical activities into the University exercises. This need inspired Purbanchal University to establish CPAD.|$|R
