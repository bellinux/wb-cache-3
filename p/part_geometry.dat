50|$|In microforming, {{the ratio}} of the total surface area of grain {{boundaries}} to the material volume decreases with the decrease of specimen size and the increase of grain size. This leads to the decrease of grain boundary strengthening effect. Surface grains have lesser constraints compared to internal grains. The change of flow stress with <b>part</b> <b>geometry</b> size is partly attributed to the change of volume fraction of surface grains. In addition, the anisotropic properties of each grain become significant with the decrease of workpiece size, which results in the inhomogeneous deformation, irregular formed geometry and the variation of deformation load. There is a critical need to establish the systematic knowledge of microforming to support the design of part, process, and tooling with the consideration of size effects.|$|E
50|$|The on time setting {{determines the}} length or {{duration}} of the spark. Hence, a longer on time produces a deeper cavity for that spark and all subsequent sparks for that cycle, creating a rougher finish on the workpiece. The reverse is true for a shorter on time. Off time is {{the period of time}} between sparks. A longer off time, for example, allows the flushing of dielectric fluid through a nozzle to clean out the eroded debris, thereby avoiding a short circuit. These settings can be maintained in microseconds. The typical <b>part</b> <b>geometry</b> is a complex 3D shape, often with small or odd shaped angles.

5000|$|Reversing {{full wave}} DC demagnetizing: {{this is a}} demagnetizing method that must be built into the machine during manufacturing. It is similar to AC {{decaying}} except the DC current is stopped at intervals of half a second, during which the current is reduced by a quantity and its direction is reversed. Then current is passed through the part again. The process of stopping, reducing and reversing the current will leave the magnetic domains randomized. This process is continued until zero current is passed through the part. The normal reversing DC demag cycle on modern equipment should be 18 seconds or longer. This method of demag was developed to overcome the limitations presented by the AC demag method where <b>part</b> <b>geometry</b> and certain alloys prevented the AC demag method from working.|$|E

50|$|A sub-surface {{compressive}} {{residual stress}} profile is measured using {{techniques such as}} x-ray diffraction and hardness profile testing. The X-axis is depth in mm or inches and the Y-axis is residual stress in ksi or MPa. The maximum residual stress profile can {{be affected by the}} factors of shot peening, including: <b>part</b> <b>geometry,</b> part material, shot material, shot quality, shot intensity, and shot coverage. For example, shot peening a hardened steel part with a process and then using the same process for another unhardened part could result in overpeening; causing a sharp decrease in surface residual stresses, but not affecting sub-surface stresses. This is critical because maximum stresses are typically at the surface of the material. Mitigation of these lower surface stresses can be accomplished by a multi-stage post process with varied shot diameters and other surface treatments that remove the low residual stress layer.|$|E
50|$|With {{selective}} laser melting, thin layers of atomized fine metal powder are evenly distributed using a coating mechanism onto a substrate plate, usually metal, that is fastened to an indexing table that {{moves in the}} vertical (Z) axis. This takes place inside a chamber containing a tightly controlled atmosphere of inert gas, either argon or nitrogen at oxygen levels below 500 parts per million. Once each layer has been distributed, each 2D slice of the <b>part</b> <b>geometry</b> is fused by selectively melting the powder. This is accomplished with a high-power laser beam, usually an ytterbium fiber laser with hundreds of watts. The laser beam is directed in the X and Y directions with two high frequency scanning mirrors. The laser energy is intense enough to permit full melting (welding) of the particles to form solid metal. The process is repeated layer after layer until the part is complete.|$|E
50|$|The AutoForm {{products}} {{are divided into}} various solutions targeted at areas of application along the Sheet Metal Engineering Process Chain.

At {{the core of the}} AutoForm solutions is Finite Element Analysis solver technology applied to sheet metal forming simulation. AutoForm utilizes an Incremental Solver for its solutions for Tooling and Production, while using Inverse One-step solver for Planning and Bidding, and Product Design. The application of the different solvers is to address the differences in available input information for the different phases of the process chain. During product design and planning limited information is available for design analysis; <b>part</b> <b>geometry,</b> material thickness, and mechanical properties. Therefore, the use of an inverse one-step is appropriate and timely method to evaluate the feasibility of the part design.
