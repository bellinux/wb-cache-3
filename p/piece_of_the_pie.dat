2500|$|While often {{confused}} {{for each}} other, pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes {{are different from}} each other. They are related {{in the sense that}} both pyramid and Ponzi schemes are forms of financial fraud. However, pyramid schemes are based on network marketing, where each part of the pyramid takes a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pie</b> / benefits, forwarding the money {{to the top of the}} pyramid. They fail simply because there aren't sufficient people. Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, are based on the principle of [...] "Robbing Peter to pay Paul"—early investors are paid their returns through the proceeds of investments by later investors. In other words, one central person (or entity) in the middle taking money from one person, keeping part of it and giving the rest to others who had invested in the scheme earlier. Thus, schemes such as the Anubhav teak plantation scheme (teak plantation scam of 1998) in India can be called Ponzi schemes. Some Ponzi schemes can depend on multi-level marketing for popularizing them, thus forming a combination of the two.|$|E

40|$|Developmental/Life Course Theories of Offending, {{edited by}} David Farrington. The {{intellectual}} move we take {{in this paper}} is to elucidate <b>the</b> life-course implications <b>of</b> a general age-graded theory of crime. In doing so we depart from <b>the</b> modus operandi <b>of</b> most developmental criminological theory by looking at changes in criminal behavior through a common theoretical lens that we have built through a longstanding inquiry (Sampson and Laub, 1993; Laub and Sampson, 2003). The growing tendency in developmental criminology is for greater specificity, not generality, manifested most noticeably in moves to subdivide the offender population and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called criminal career, apportioning bits and pieces to different theoretical positions and different causal influences. Hirschi (1979) once called this the end–to-end or side-by-side strategy of theoretical integration. Considering that <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developmental criminological <b>pie</b> are large, this temptation is understandable. Farrington (2003), for example, notes key results developmental criminology ought to explain, such as <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> delinquency, versatility, escalation, cooffending, persistence, and desistance, to name a few.

On first glance {{there seems to be no}} method to the madness, no way to predict whether or on what the Fund will be utilized. This report examines key social, economic, and political variables to determine what factors significantly influence the likelihood that any bill drawing from the Fund would succeed. Future legislators wondering whether their shot at ESF dollars hinges on the amount, the issue, the bill author, or even the state's general economic outlook, should take note <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following report.
