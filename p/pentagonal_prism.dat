25|$|The Apollonian {{networks}} do {{not form}} {{a family of}} graphs that is closed under the operation of taking graph minors, as removing edges but not vertices from an Apollonian network produces a graph {{that is not an}} Apollonian network. However, the planar partial 3-trees, subgraphs of Apollonian networks, are minor-closed. Therefore, according to the Robertson–Seymour theorem, they can be characterized by a finite number of forbidden minors. The minimal forbidden minors for the planar partial 3-trees are the four minimal graphs among the forbidden minors for the planar graphs and the partial 3-trees: the complete graph , the complete bipartite graph , the graph of the octahedron, and the graph of the <b>pentagonal</b> <b>prism.</b> The Apollonian graphs are the maximal graphs that do not have any of these four graphs as a minor.|$|E
