40|$|Effect of <b>Pre{{polymerization}}</b> on polymerization rate of propene Michael Bartke, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg and Fraunhofer Polymer Pilot Plant Center In olefin polymerization with supported catalysts, catalyst {{activities and}} productivities are continuously improving. In terms of heat removal, {{the most critical}} stage during polymerization is directly after injection of the catalyst to the reactor: the active sites of the catalyst are concentrated on a relative small catalyst particle with only limited heat removal area to the continuous phase. Many authors have observed or predicted severe particle overheating up to polymer melting. One established mean to overcome this particle overheating challenge {{is to use a}} <b>prepolymerization</b> step prior to main polymerization. By applying mild conditions, the polymerization rate during <b>prepolymerization</b> is reduced in such a way, that particle overheating is avoided. Due to particle growth, heat transfer area is generated, which improves heat removal conditions in the subsequent main polymerization step significantly. In addition, catalyst fragmentation occurs in a more controlled manner and typically improved particle morphology is obtained. <b>Prepolymerization</b> is used commercially in a number or processes and is described in many patents and publications[1, 2, 3], mostly focusing on morphology development. Also increased productivities due to <b>prepolymerization</b> have been reported, but not many quantitative modelling studies to account for the role of <b>prepolymerization</b> on reaction rate are known in open literature. In lab-scale, <b>prepolymerization</b> is experimentally mostly studied as an in-situ prepolymerization: the reaction is started at mild conditions and then the reactor is heated up to main polymerization temperature. The heating-up period typically takes 10 to 15 minutes, during which the conditions do change. Hence, in-situ <b>prepolymerization</b> is a bit undefined. Another approach is to carry out <b>prepolymerization</b> as an external <b>prepolymerization</b> in a separate reactor under constant conditions and then to inject the prepolymerized catalyst to main polymerization under reaction conditions. This approach allows more defined and controlled <b>prepolymerization</b> and main polymerization conditions. However possible effects of storage-times of the prepolymerized catalyst have to be considered. In the presentation, experimental results for the impact of <b>prepolymerization</b> on reaction rate in both bulk- and gas-phase polymerization of propene for different Ziegler-Natta and also a supported metallocene catalyst applying both in-situ and external <b>prepolymerization</b> methods will be presented and discussed. In addition, a simplified modelling approach to account for the impact of <b>prepolymerization</b> on polymerization rate will be presented. The model is based on calculation the actual polymer particle temperature during course of the polymerization under consideration of a highly temperature dependent deactivation reaction...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{development}} of the Ziegler-Natta catalysts in 1953, continous improvements were done concerning to higher catalyst activity and higher stereoselectivity. Especially at the reaction start, when the pure catalyst is injected under high rate conditions, the high activity of the catalyst can cause particle overheating and/or lead to an uncontrolled catalyst fragmentation resulting in lower catalyst activity and bad particle morphology. One possibility to solve the problem is to apply a <b>prepolymerization</b> step before the main polymerization reaction. In the <b>prepolymerization,</b> the reaction starts at low rate conditions (mild reaction temperatures, low monomer concentration) in order to realize a controlled catalyst fragmentation and to improve heat removal conditions by creating a higher heat transfer area. In previous studies, the gas-phase polymerization of propylene with a high active Ziegler-Natta catalyst was carried out with and without <b>prepolymerization</b> step. For polymerizations with <b>prepolymerization</b> the reached activities were much higher compared to polymerizations without <b>prepolymerization.</b> With <b>prepolymerization</b> the produced particles were spherical and have an even surface. In contrast, polymer particles produced without <b>prepolymerization</b> show non-spherical shapes and rough particle surfaces which could be a hint of the uncontrolled catalyst break up {{at the beginning of the}} reaction. Based on experimental derived activity profiles a phenomenological kinetic model was developed describing the polymerization of propylene with the different injection conditions (<b>prepolymerization).</b> Therein heat and mass balances were implemented in order to describe the particle temperature and particle growth during the reaction. A case study on particle overheating clearly shows a significant increase of the particle temperature when no <b>prepolymerization</b> is applied. An increasing reaction temperature (gas-phase) resulted in a strongly increase in particle temperature. When using a <b>prepolymerization</b> step the particle temperature only slightly increase with increasing reaction temperature. Less thermal deactivation of the catalyst species and therefore higher activities could be the consequence. The presented study will show the derived kinetic model for the propylene polymerization with and without <b>prepolymerization.</b> Modeling and estimation of the kinetic parameters of the used Ziegler-Natta catalyst were carried out using the software gPROMS ModelBuilder (Process Systems Enterprise). Weight average molecular weights were determined using the method of moments. With the derived kinetic model it is possible to calculate the activity profiles of the polymerization reaction at different injection conditions (<b>prepolymerization)</b> over an industrially relevant temperature range and for different hydrogen concentrations...|$|E

To evaluate the possibility of these techniques for PUs, we studied the synthesis of prepolymers from isophorone diisocyanate and polypropylene glycol in mass and solution. Several optimization steps, transfer to solution polymerization, and downscaling <b>prepolymerizations</b> have been carried out in a manual way before implementing them into the Chemspeed Accelerator. As a next step, reproducibility investigations and kinetic studies were performed in an automated manner.

By using a calorimetric principle it {{was possible}} to measure full reaction rate versus time curves for obtaining data on polymerization kinetics, under industrially relevant conditions. The influence of polymerization temperature, the hydrogen and monomer concentration, and the <b>prepolymerization</b> method on reaction kinetics were investigated. A new method for <b>prepolymerization,</b> the so-called non-isothermal <b>prepolymerization,</b> is described. In this short <b>prepolymerization</b> procedure featuring an increasing polymerization temperature the thermal runaway on particle scale was avoided. It was shown that this <b>prepolymerization</b> method can relatively easily be applied to an industrial process, with the introduction of a continuous plug flow reactor, giving a narrow residence time distribution, acceptable yield-in-prepolymerization and a method for monitoring catalyst activity. Using different methods for calculating the monomer concentration at the active site of the catalyst, the influence of polymerization temperature was determined. It was shown that at high polymerization temperatures, the reaction rate is barely influenced by polymerization temperature, when no <b>prepolymerization</b> is used. This is ascribed to thermal runaway on particle scale of a fraction of the catalyst particles. When a <b>prepolymerization</b> is used, this effect disappears and thermal runaway is avoided. When systematically reducing the monomer concentration (Cm,bulk) in the bulk by replacing part of the liquid propylene by hexane, the reaction rate proved to be remarkably independent of the monomer concentration. With reducing Cm,bulk, reaction rate decreased very slowly until Cm,bulk= 150 g/l. When further decreasing Cm,bulk, reaction rate dropped rapidly. The hydrogen concentration was varied over a wide range at 60 Â°C and 70 Â°C. For both temperatures it was shown that reaction rates increased rapidly with increasing hydrogen concentration at low hydrogen concentrations. At higher hydrogen amounts, this effect disappeared and a maximum reaction rate was found. ...|$|E

The conditions to minimize the consumption of MAO have been studied for the ethylene polymerization with supported metallocene catalyst. By introducing the <b>prepolymerization</b> step, in which the supported metallocene catalyst is activated at high MAO concentration before polymerization, the MAO could be recovered after the <b>prepolymerization</b> and recycled repeatedly for the subsequent activation with marginal decrease in activity.

The crosslinking agents were observed to contribute to template complexation, {{and the results were}} contrasted with previously reported template-recognition behavior of the corresponding polymers. Differences in {{the extent to which the}} two crosslinkers interacted with the functional monomer were identified, and correlations were made to polymer-ligand recognition behavior and the results of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies studies. This study demonstrates the importance of considering the functional monomerâcrosslinker interaction when designing molecularly imprinted polymers, and highlights the often neglected general contribution of crosslinker to determining the nature of molecularly imprinted polymer-template selectivity...|$|E
40|$|Hydrophobic {{fumed silica}} dispersions in organic {{monomers}} were explored as a pore-forming system in polymer synthesis. The method developed provides {{a simple and}} effective way of controlling the pore size in highly cross-linked polymers. Fumed silica suspensions in divinylbenzene were polymerized with subsequent etching of the silica particles, therefore creating the porosity in the polymer. The resulting polymers are mesoporous materials, exhibiting an extremely narrow pore size distribution with an average pore size of about 100 angstrom, replicating {{the size of the}} nanofiller. BET surface areas were found appreciably high (similar to 350 m(2) /g). Furthermore, the rheological behavior of the <b>prepolymerization</b> mixtures was studied to elucidate the formation of the porous network and showed that a tridimensional network of particles is formed at a minimum silica fraction (Phi(v)) of 0. 08...|$|E

A novel semi-prepreg resin {{transfer}} molding (RTM) process {{was developed to}} address difficulties associated with RTM process and to improve the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. Unidirectional semi-prepregs exhibiting relatively good overlay characteristics were prepared via <b>prepolymerization</b> of bismaleimide resin followed by wet winding. The processing characteristics and mechanical properties of composites fabricated via semi-prepreg RTM technology were {{compared with those of}} composites produced using a normal-prepreg compression molding process. Experimental results showed that the laminates fabricated by the semi-prepreg RTM process were of better internal quality and had superior mechanical properties as compared with laminates fabricated by the normal-prepreg compression molding process. ?
