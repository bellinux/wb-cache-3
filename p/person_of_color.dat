25|$|In a {{response}} to Johnson's work, Philip D. Morgan notes that in the 19th century, Vesey was once described as a mulatto or free <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> by William Gilmore Simms. Trial records, however, identified him as a free black man. Some historians from 1849 to the 1990s described him as a mulatto, but lacking documentation, since the later 20th century, historians have described him as black. Although free black carpenter Thomas Brown also described Vesey as dark-skinned, Morgan suggests this transformation in ancestry represents modern sensibilities more than any evidence.|$|E

[...] Artist Christian Remick hand-colored some prints. Some copies of the print show a man with two chest wounds and a somewhat darker face, matching descriptions of Attucks; others show no victim as a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> The image was published in the Boston Gazette, circulating widely, and became an effective piece of anti-British propaganda.

The announcement received international coverage {{in the mainstream media}} and was met with mixed reactions by audiences. Chris Huntington of The New York Times lauded the creation of Morales, relating that it gave his adopted Ethiopian son Dagim a superhero who looks like him. Some fans and commentators felt the decision was an attempt by Marvel Comics to be politically correct and that the introduction of a minority Spider-Man was simply a publicity stunt to attract more readers, while others felt that a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>color</b> as Spider-Man would set a positive example for minority readers, particularly children. Many Spider-Man fans were disappointed that Peter Parker was killed, regardless of who replaced him. The wide-ranging critical reception prompted The Washington Post to run an article called, [...] "Sorry, Peter Parker. The response to the black Spider-Man shows why we need one", in which writer Alexandra Petri wrote that the character should be judged on the quality of its stories rather than on his appearance or ethnicity.|$|E

500|$|While Barbara Gordon and Cassandra Cain {{have both}} {{been the subject of}} {{academic}} analysis regarding the portrayal of women in comics, commentary on Barbara Gordon's Batgirl has focused on her character's connection to the Women's liberation movement, doctoral degree and career as a librarian, while analysis of Cassandra Cain's Batgirl has focused on the character's double minority status as a woman and a <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> Since her debut in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the Batman television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon's Batgirl has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons. Author Brian Cronin, in Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, [...] "Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly {{over the next two decades}} and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon." [...] In 2011, IGN ranked Barbara Gordon 17th in the Top 100 Comic Books Heroes. Cassandra Cain's Batgirl has become one of the most prominent Asian characters to appear in American comic books, and her understated sexuality is notable as being contrary to the common sexual objectification of female characters, especially those of Asian descent.|$|E
500|$|Titled {{after the}} [...] "drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] metaphor, [...] "Kool-Aid" [...] has a dark {{electric}} blues style, noir musical vibes, and lyrics about the politically misguided {{lower middle class}} who support Republican {{tax cuts for the}} rich. The song's narrative follows a young American who accepts the Bush administration's pro-war stance, heads off to a foreign land willing to fight any <b>person</b> <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> and returns to his home jobless. According to writer James C. McKinley, Jr., the song continues a theme Cooder established on Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down: [...] "the idea of poor whites who have been let down by the politicians they have supported." [...] It also paraphrases the lyrics to the Western swing standard [...] "Cocaine Blues", and touches on the controversial stand-your-ground law, which Cooder viewed as [...] "new Jim Crow laws – the stand-your-ground law is already responsible for about 80 shooting deaths of African Americans." [...] "The 90 and the 9" [...] repurposes the gospel hymn of the same name and the worker songs of Joe Hill with apocalyptic themes, an anti-war narrative, and a depiction of modern union workers as part of the lower 99% of income distribution in the US. Cooder was inspired to write the song by military recruitment of high schoolers in his native Los Angeles. [...] "Take Your Hands off It" [...] has a defiant tone, prominent guitar, and lyrics that rousingly defend constitutional rights.|$|E
