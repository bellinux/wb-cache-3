5|$|Archibald Ashmore ("Archie") McKellar {{was born}} in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland on the 10 April 1912, the son of John and Margaret McKellar, of Bearsden, Dunbartonshire and was then educated at Shawlands Academy in the Southside of Glasgow. Upon leaving school he joined a local stockbroker's firm. This did not suit McKellar, who {{preferred}} an open–air life style. Keen to leave, but unsure of what direction to take in life, he joined his father's general contractor and construction business as a <b>plasterer.</b> He spent five years as an apprentice <b>plasterer.</b> During {{this time he was}} given no special privileges despite being the boss' son.|$|E

5|$|The {{second of}} the {{principal}} reception rooms, the Saloon (9), opens from the Marble Hall. This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens. Originally known as the Great Parlour, {{this has always been}} the chief reception room of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a Victorian copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean <b>plasterer</b> Edward Goudge. The centrepiece of the room is a large Aubusson carpet made in 1839 for the 1st Earl Brownlow.|$|E

5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, {{that it could have been}} the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a <b>plasterer</b> who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{contributions}} from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance and Dresden Baroque). Among many renowned Baroque masters were Pöppelmann, Balthasar Neumann, Knobelsdorff and the Asam brothers. The Wessobrunner School exerted a decisive influence on, {{and at times}} even dominated, the art of stucco in southern Germany in the 18th century. The Upper Swabian Baroque Route offers a baroque-themed tourist route that highlights the contributions of such artists and craftsmen as the sculptor and <b>plasterer</b> Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, {{one of the foremost}} members of the Feuchtmayer family and the brothers Johann Baptist Zimmermann and Dominikus Zimmermann. Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} visiting the flowers of B.telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus <b>plasterer</b> bees have been recorded. Visits by nectarivorous mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their scats have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B.telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed {{in the morning and}} evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day.|$|E

5000|$|Gerard Doyle became {{secretary}} of the union in 1928, and under his leadership it was renamed as the Operative <b>Plasterers</b> Society. Leo Crawford became president in 1938, {{and brought it to}} prominence within the Irish trade union movement. Under his leadership, the union was a founder of the Congress of Irish Unions. In the 1950s, its main rival, the British-based National Association of Operative <b>Plasterers,</b> decided to withdraw from Ireland, and its Irish members transferred to the Dublin-based union, which took the name [...] "Operative <b>Plasterers</b> and Allied Trades Society of Ireland" [...] to reflect its broader remit.|$|R

George Pollard of Huddersfield was the mason, Joah Swallow of Hepworth was joiner, and the plumber was Lockwood of Honley. The slaters were Goodwin & Sons of Huddersfield, the <b>plasterer</b> was Alfred Jessop of Shepley, and the painter was Brighouse of Huddersfield.

25|$|During the Glorious Revolution of 1688, William III of Orange {{stayed in}} the house during his march from Torbay to London, and {{received}} a loyal declaration from peers and an address from the Corporation of London. Interior finishing was ongoing however as the plasterwork of the saloon ceiling bears the date 1690; bearing the arms of Freeman and of Baxter, William's spouse. Its confident bold relief tempted Geoffrey Beard to ascribe it to London <b>plasterer</b> William Parker, whose comparable work at Denham Place is documented.|$|E
25|$|Vinea and Tzara met a {{final time}} when the latter came to Romania on an {{official}} visit, in 1947. That year, having resumed friendly contacts with the PNȚ, his work hosted by Nicolae Carandino at Dreptatea, Vinea narrowly escaped arrest during the Tămădău Affair clampdown. The full proclamation of a Romanian communist regime in 1948 drove Vinea into the cultural underground. For a while, he earned a meager living as a ghostwriter, {{but also as a}} warehouseman and porter. In 1949, sculptor Oscar Han briefly employed him as his <b>plasterer.</b> While working for the candlemaker Aliciu, alongside other disgraced wartime journalists, Vinea was periodically harassed by agents of the Securitate, who were reexamining his Evenimentul Zilei material.|$|E

He was sent back to Camp Lejeune for training until January 1951, when he arrived in Korea to join Company F, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced). He participated in the South and Central Korean campaign, receiving a promotion to corporal on June 15, 1951. On June 9, 1951, he earned his first Purple Heart when was wounded near Yanggu, and after leaving the field hospital, was assigned a position as a property sergeant. After a week at the new job, he asked to rejoin his buddies in his old infantry platoon, and was allowed to do so.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} popular athletes from the games was British ski jumper Eddie [...] "The Eagle" [...] Edwards, who gained infamy by placing last in both the 70 and 90metre events {{finishing}} 70 and 53 points behind his next closest competitor, respectively. Edwards' [...] "heroic failure" [...] made him an instant celebrity; he went from earning £6,000 per year as a <b>plasterer</b> before the Games to making £10,000 per hour per appearance afterward. Left embarrassed by the spectacle he created, the International Ski Federation altered the rules following Calgary to eliminate each nation's right to send at least one athlete and set minimum competition standards for future events. Regardless, the President of the Organizing Committee, Frank King, playfully saluted Edwards' unorthodox sporting legacy, which would also be commemorated with a 2016 feature film, Eddie the Eagle.|$|E
500|$|Friday lasted {{two months}} as a <b>plasterer</b> {{before moving on}} to become first a van driver for a grocery firm, then a window cleaner. His laid-back {{attitude}} and indifference was already clear: in his father's words, [...] "he didn't care". Friday regularly stole by this time, but despite numerous convictions, did not go to a detention centre until he was 16. Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be [...] "a car radio or something", he was released almost immediately because he suffered from asthma. However, after he re-offended three months later he was sent to Feltham Borstal where he served 14 months. During his time there, Friday became stronger and fitter and also starred for the Borstal football team. He was selected for the prison league's all-star men's team, still aged 16, and allowed out of Borstal to train and play with Reading's youth team, for which he appeared three times in the South East Counties League during the 1968–69 season.|$|E

500|$|The {{principal}} room is {{the large}} Marble Hall (1) at {{the centre of the}} south front; this hall {{is the beginning of a}} grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or Saloon (9) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (11, now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (2), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (8, 10). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (3, etc.) that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London <b>plasterer</b> Edward Goudge, [...] "now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession," [...] William Winde reported in 1690.|$|E
500|$|Friday was scouted by {{numerous}} London sides during his teenage years, joining Crystal Palace's school of excellence at 12 or 13, then {{moving on to}} Queens Park Rangers aged 13 and then to Chelsea, with whom he attended the 1967 FA Cup Final; {{as one of the}} club's youth players, {{he was part of the}} team's official party. However, Friday's individual style of play and refusal to change his game resulted in each of these clubs losing patience with him. The twin brothers joined a men's team, the Acton British Legion Reserves, aged 14, and in some matches would play alongside their father. Tony played in midfield, and Robin up front, but according to Tony his brother was better as a goalkeeper than a forward: [...] "He was a brilliant goalkeeper. He had no fear ... But he obviously preferred banging them in at the other end". Around this time Robin became interested in music, dancing and attending concerts; he also had a talent for drawing, but suddenly abandoned this interest at 15. Robin became more outgoing than his brother and started taking drugs in his mid-teens. He left school at 15, a year before Tony, and began training as a <b>plasterer.</b>|$|E

[...] One of his {{employees}} improperly mixed the plaster {{and even though it}} was not visible by looking at it, Gould insisted that it be removed and reapplied correctly. [...] Gould helped to build the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepard in Oakdale Square, though as a parishioner and not as a contractor. [...] It may have been the Episcopal church he attended in Wilmington as a slave that taught him to read and write, and thus {{to be able to keep}} his diary.|$|E
