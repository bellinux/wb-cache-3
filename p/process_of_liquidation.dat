40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{sequential}} model of security trading which, compared to existing models, is extended along the notions of Simon (1955), Rubinstein (1998), and Odean (1999) by adding boundedly rational traders. Our results indicate that both momentum and mean-reversion in asset prices {{can be attributed to the}} presence of agents who are subject to systematic errors in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> forecasting the <b>liquidation</b> value <b>of</b> a risky security. The length of the momentum period is inversely related to both the amount of information-based trading in the market and the rate at which asset specific information is learned by boundedly rational agents. Furthermore, the model allows explicitly to establish a link between the component of the bid-ask spread that can be explained by bounded rationality and both momentum and reversal...|$|R

50|$|During this time, the consul Sulla {{managed to}} lose his {{authority}} and to be exiled, however this was merely a small interruption in his rise to power. Following the siege of Athens in 87 BC, he again prepared {{to take control of}} Rome and in 82 BC he successfully became dictator. He immediately set out to ensure that his power would not slip from his grasp again. Beginning with a large-scale execution of his enemies, Sulla soon adopted a more systematic approach with the adoption of the proscriptions, in which Sulla made those who had displeased him “enemies of the state.” The consequences of being proscribed were a death sentence and the seizure of all property that had belonged to those who had been proscribed. According to Plutarch, in order to expedite this <b>process</b> <b>of</b> asset <b>liquidation,</b> Sulla made it known that “…to him who should slay any one proscribed person, he ordained two talents reward, even were it slave who had killed his master, or a son his father.” Furthermore, Sulla made it known that the penalty for aiding any person who had been proscribed, was proscription itself. In this way that Sulla dealt with all current and potential threats to his power and neither the nobility nor the commoners were immune.|$|R
40|$|On the {{evidence}} of general knowledge about exploiting deposits of antimony ores {{in the field of}} West Carpathian Mountains but also of a brief evaluation of the commodity´s world production and the analysis of its prices, a recent view of fast, often rash, <b>process</b> <b>of</b> damping and <b>liquidation</b> <b>of</b> this mineral raw material in Slovakia is outlined in the paper. Restructuring our national economy in newly-created conditions of the so-called market economy at the beginning of nineties, exploitation and processing of inland antimony ores were re-evaluated under the influence of short-term evaluation of the antimony´s external-price development, just coming to a crisis. Consequently, due to the continuously reducting appropriation, the ores were considered unexploitable. In such a way, they were liquidated and the next verification of their reserves by geological prospecting stopped. Just the period of the interruption of exploiting and prospecting Sb-deposits should be used for a theoretical treatment of documents that could elucidate the problem of the role of Sb-deposits in the metallogenesis of West Carpathians but also of their further perspective and possible utilization in future...|$|R
