5000|$|The M.9A Master I {{was based}} on the M.9 Kestrel trainer that was first {{demonstrated}} at the Hendon Air show in July 1937, although it never entered production. The M.9 Kestrel, powered by the 745 hp (555 kW) Rolls-Royce Kestrel XVI V-12 engine, could reach 296 mph (477 km/h). The Air Ministry had selected the de Havilland Don as its advanced trainer, but this proved to be a failure, and the RAF placed a £2 million order for 500 examples of {{a modified version of the}} Kestrel, the M.9A Master. Miles rebuilt the prototype M.9 to form a prototype for the Master, fitting a lower-powered (715 hp (535 kW)) Rolls-Royce Kestrel XXX engine, of which there were large surplus stocks available, with extensive revisions to the airframe, which included a new cockpit canopy, a modified rear fuselage and tail, also moving the radiator from under the nose to under the centre-section of the wing. These modifications significantly reduced the aircraft's speed, but it remained one of the fastest and most maneuverable trainers of its day. The first true <b>production</b> <b>Master</b> I made its maiden flight on 31 March 1939. [...] The Master entered service just before the start of the war, and eventually 900 Mk. I and Mk. IA Masters were built. This total included 26 built as the M.24 Master Fighter which were modified to a single-seat configuration, and armed with six [...]303 in machine guns for use as an emergency fighter, but did not see combat.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} extend {{existing}} methods for decision making implementation {{in design and}} operation of global manufacturing networks, creating products in value added chains distributed over several manufacturing sites. The configuration of products, processes and resources in the network are subject of design decisions and is represented by <b>production</b> <b>master</b> data. Rapidly changing global market opportunities and competition force companies to continuously adapt their manufacturing network which causes increasing dependencies and complexity. Currently, design and decisions are carried out on a limited section of the production, which {{makes it impossible to}} consider dependencies in the network. This leads to risks in outcomes of decisions and to a suboptimal design for the manufacturing network as a whole. A solution to this problem can be found, when design and decisions are based on the overall manufacturing network. <b>Production</b> <b>master</b> data for a global manufacturing network is a challenge in terms of quantity and processing performance required. In this paper, an approach for applying Big Data techniques is described, highlighting the aspects of decision tasks, data access patterns, necessary data structures and handling of design scenarios. In case of manufacturing network design, Big Data enables overall system design, increasing validity of decisions, high performance and new analysis options for unexploited potential in the network. This approach is applicable to various decision processes within manufacturing concerning query, analysis and interaction with an overall manufacturing system...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Flame {{treatment}} of polypropylene is a polarization process which improves the adhesion {{qualities of the}} substrate (Kostyk, 2000). Flame treatment {{is known as a}} "Pre-Treatment" process and is widely used in industry to promote adhesion before the application {{of a wide range of}} processes. Processes such as gluing, painting, lamination and printing are all preceded by a flame treatment process (Eckert, 2004). The flame treatment process is achieved using a gas burner, normally burning liquid propane gas, which is fired directly onto the surface to be treated (Sabreen, 2005). The flame is passed over the surface at a distance and speed so as to treat the entire surface and not burn the substrate. Chemical changes occur in the substrate however these changes do not penetrate very deep into the substrate (Cain, 2000). It is important to remember this is a scientific process and the variables speed, distance and temperature of the flame must be controlled with a certain amount of accuracy. The purpose of this research is to determine the ideal conditions which result in the optimum adhesion between the substrate and the proceeding processes. Once the ideal conditions have been determined the research will continue to find the lower limits to gain adequate adhesion thereby tailoring the process for high volume <b>production.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} {{considered}} a key technology for providing sustainable energy due to their high energetic efficiency and low environmental impact. Proton Exhange Fuel Cells (PEMFC) usually use as electrolyte a solid polymer called Nafion, which is mechanically, thermally and chemically stable and shows very high values of proton conductivity. However, to ensure proton exchange the membrane needs to be hydrated. This situation may involve a limitation creating the necessity to develop alternative electrolytes to Nafion. One of the newest ways {{to do this is}} to study the use of ionic liquids as electrolytes in fuel cells because of their high ionic conductivity even under anhydrous conditions. The formation of a solid electrolyte by polymerization of ionic liquids represents an attractive alternative to traditional Nafion membranes due to high ionic conductivities expected even under anhydrous conditions. In this work a polymerization of ionic liquid trifluoromethanesulfonate 3 -vinyl- 1 -(4 -sulfobutyl) imidazolium has been done by ultraviolet light for their use as electrolyte in PEMFC under various operating conditions. The influence of three variables was analyzed: cell temperature, gas humidification and contact between the membrane and GDES (Gas Diffusion Electrodes) through the process of pressing. Also, employing the technique of impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was determined the resistance exerted by the electrolyte at the operating conditions studied, providing a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in energy <b>production.</b> <b>Máster</b> en Ingeniería Química “Producción y consumo sostenible...|$|E
