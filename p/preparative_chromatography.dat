5000|$|... 1. Pumps: Majority {{of systems}} utilize two {{two-cylinder}} piston pumps, {{one for each}} buffer, combining the output of both in a mixing chamber. Some simpler systems use a single peristaltic pump which draws both buffers from separate reservoirs through a proportioning valve and mixing chamber. In either case the system allows the fraction of each buffer entering the column to be continuously varied. The flow rate can go from a few milliliters per minute in bench-top systems to liters per minute for industrial scale purifications.

50|$|The {{simulated}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) technique is {{a variant of}} high performance liquid chromatography; {{it is used to}} separate particles and/or chemical compounds that would be difficult or impossible to resolve otherwise. This increased separation is brought about by a valve-and-column arrangement that is used to lengthen the stationary phase indefinitely.In the moving bed technique of <b>preparative</b> <b>chromatography</b> the feed entry and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous, but because of practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed, simulated moving bed technique was proposed. In the simulated moving bed technique instead of moving the bed, the sample inlet and the analyte exit positions are moved continuously, giving the impression of a moving bed.True moving bed chromatography (TMBC) is only a theoretical concept. Its simulation, SMBC is achieved by the use of a multiplicity of columns in series and a complex valve arrangement, which provides for sample and solvent feed, and also analyte and waste takeoff at appropriate locations of any column, whereby it allows switching at regular intervals the sample entry in one direction, the solvent entry in the opposite direction, whilst changing the analyte and waste takeoff positions appropriately as well.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 <b>Preparative</b> <b>chromatography</b> is {{the most}} widely used {{purification}} method in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. Here, one theoretical and one practical problem of <b>preparative</b> <b>chromatography</b> are investigated. The theoretical problem deals with the effect of experimental error on the precision of adsorption isotherm parameters estimated by numerical method. Numerical method has becoming popular in recent years as a quick alternative to the classical dynamic methods for adsorption isotherm determination. However, the fundamental problem of the numerical back-propagation of error has not been addressed in the literature. In this study, the variance in the final estimated parameters as a function of experimental error is quantified. The results indicate that it is theoretically possible to obtain sufficiently accurate parameters from multiple experimental replicates.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{the paper is the}} {{application}} of a theoretical concept to scale up <b>preparative</b> <b>chromatography.</b> As an experimental example, the separation of the α- and β-isomers of a steroid compound using silica as the stationary phase is discussed. The applied concept is mainly based on measuring the adsorption isotherms in preliminary investigations using an analytical column. With these thermodynamic parameters it is attempted to simulate the separation behaviour in larger columns using the equilibrium dispersive model. To check the accuracy of the approach, experimental studies have been carried out using three other columns with increasing diameters (0. 8, 5 and 30 cm). On the basis of the determined adsorption isotherms and a phase ratio adjustment, the main features of the separation process can be predicted for the larger columns. Thus, the presented concept can be effectively used in the process of optimizing <b>preparative</b> <b>chromatography...</b>|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} coal tar pitch, a very cheap organic material made from coal during the iron-making process, {{as a source}} from which could be obtained emissive molecules for organic light-emitting diodes. Coal tar pitch was separated by simple dissolution in organic solvent, and subsequent separation by <b>preparative</b> thin-layer <b>chromatography</b> was used to obtain emissive organic molecules. The retardation factor of <b>preparative</b> thin-layer <b>chromatography</b> {{played a major role}} in deciding the emission characteristics of the solution as photoluminescence spectra and emission-excitation matrix spectra could be controlled by modifying the solution preparation method. In addition, the device characteristics could be improved by modifying the solution preparation method. Two rounds of <b>preparative</b> thin-layer <b>chromatography</b> separation could improve the luminance of organic light-emitting diodes with coal tar pitch, indicating that less polar components are favorable for enhancing the luminance and device performance. By appropriate choice of the solvent, the photoluminescence peak wavelength of separated coal tar pitch could be shifted from 429 nm (cyclohexane) to 550 nm (chloroform), and consequently, the optical properties of the coal tar pitch solution could be easily tuned. Hence, the use of such multicomponent materials is advantageous for fine-tuning the net properties at a low cost. Furthermore, an indium tin oxide/poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) /coal tar pitch/LiF/Al system, in which the emissive layer was formed by spin-coating a tetrahydrofuran solution of coal tar pitch on the substrate, showed a luminance of 176 cd/m 2.
