40|$|ABSTRACT: Critical illness can {{be viewed}} as {{consisting}} of 4 distinct stages: (1) acute critical illness (ACI), (2) prolonged acute critical illness, (3) chronic critical illness, and (4) recovery.

As critical illness progresses, there is no evolutionary precedent, and man owes his life to modern critical care medicine.

50|$|The {{caterpillars}} tend {{to wander}} before settling down to eat. The first instar generally lasts {{only a few}} days. At {{the end of each}} instar, a small amount of silk is spun on the major vein of a leaf. The caterpillar then latches onto the silk with its anal claspers and prolegs and begins to molt. It first becomes dormant and undergoes apolysis, then after an additional day or so, undergoes ecdysis. The caterpillar emerges from its old exoskeleton, puffs up, and hardens as it enters the next instar. This species will sometimes eat the old exoskeleton for <b>protein</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Similar to many other Saturniidae caterpillars, the imperial moth has five instars. By the third instar, variation between caterpillars can be observed. This species is known to have two basic color forms, a black-orange form and a green-yellow form.

At the end of the fifth instar, the caterpillar will leave the tree and travel along the ground in search of a soft soil patch in which to pupate.|$|E

40|$|Whilst it {{has long}} been known that {{improved}} <b>protein</b> <b>nutrition</b> can increase resilience, i. e. reduce the consequences of subclinical gastrointestinal nematode parasitism on sheep performance, improved <b>protein</b> <b>nutrition</b> can also increase resistance, i. e. immunity to parasites. This would be the case because expression of acquired immunity to parasites is often penalized at times of nutrient scarcity. A recently developed nutrient-partitioning framework postulates that this penalty arises from prioritized scarce nutrient allocation to growth and/or reproductive functions. A large body of evidence shows that at times of protein scarcity, an increased supply of protein, {{from a wide range of}} protein sources, can indeed reduce gastrointestinal nematode parasitism in both growing and periparturient sheep. As such, immunonutrition can play a vital role in sustainable, parasite control strategies, either on its own but more likely integrated with other non-chemical strategies, including genetic selection for increased resistance, vaccination and biological control.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} {{of the immune system}} can be costly, and a lack of dietary protein can increase the susceptibility of organisms to disease. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between <b>protein</b> <b>nutrition</b> and immunity in insects. Here, we tested in honeybees (Apis mellifera) whether dietary protein quantity (monofloral pollen) and diet diversity (polyfloral pollen) can shape baseline immunocompetence (IC) by measuring parameters of individual immunity (haemocyte concentration, fat body content and phenoloxidase activity) and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity, which enables bees to sterilize colony and brood food, as a parameter of social immunity. Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets. These results suggest a link between <b>protein</b> <b>nutrition</b> and immunity in honeybees and underscore the critical role of resource availability on pollinator healt...|$|E
