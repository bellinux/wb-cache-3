5|$|Many {{governments and}} {{research}} institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions, such as research into sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include {{the topics of}} pre-exposure prophylaxis, <b>post-exposure</b> prophylaxis, circumcision and HIV, and accelerated aging effects.|$|E
5|$|A {{course of}} antiretrovirals {{administered}} within 48 to 72hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions {{is referred to}} as <b>post-exposure</b> prophylaxis (PEP). The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury. As of 2013, the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV <b>post-exposure</b> vaccine.|$|E

25|$|Fluoroquinolones are not {{licensed}} by the FDA for use in children due {{to the risk of}} fatalities as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. Ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of Complicated Urinary Tract Infections and Pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli and Inhalational Anthrax (<b>post-exposure)</b> and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of Inhalational Anthrax (<b>post-exposure).</b> However, the Fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Proof of concept {{trials have}} {{indicated}} that Ebola-targeted siRNAs may be effective as <b>post-exposure</b> prophylaxis in humans, with 100% of non-human primates surviving a lethal dose of Zaire Ebolavirus, the most lethal strain.|$|E
25|$|AZT {{has been}} used for <b>post-exposure</b> {{prophylaxis}} (PEP) in combination with another antiretroviral drug called lamivudine. Together they work to substantially reduce the risk of HIV infection following the first single exposure to the virus. More recently, AZT has been replaced by other antiretrovirals such as tenofovir to provide PEP.|$|E
25|$|Because Niépce's camera {{photographs}} {{required an}} extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), {{he sought to}} greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out <b>post-exposure</b> processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Disease Control and Prevention {{has warned}} about the rabies risk {{associated}} with feral cats. With 16% of people infected with rabies from exposure to rabid cats, cats have been the primary animals responsible for transmission of the virus to humans in the United States since the efforts to control rabies in dogs in the 1970s. In 2010, there were 303 rabid cats reported within the United States. Although some colony management programs involve administering rabies vaccines, the need to revaccinate every few years makes this challenging to maintain. Furthermore, lack of documentation can mean that contact with vaccinated feral cats may still require <b>post-exposure</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|AZT {{is now a}} {{principal}} part of the clinical pathway for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and <b>post-exposure</b> treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and has been proven to be integral to uninfected siblings' perinatal and neonatal development. Without AZT, as many as 10 to 15% of fetuses with HIV-infected mothers will themselves become infected. AZT {{has been shown to}} reduce this risk to as little as 8% when given in a three-part regimen post-conception, delivery, and six weeks post-delivery. Consistent and proactive precautionary measures, such as the rigorous use of antiretroviral medications, cesarean section, face masks, heavy-duty rubber gloves, clinically segregated disposable diapers, and avoidance of mouth contact will further reduce child-attendant transmission of HIV to as little as 1–2%.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{electron}} penetration through a resist {{is essentially a}} stochastic process; there is a finite probability that resist exposure by released electrons can occur quite far {{from the point of}} photon absorption. Increasing the dose increases the number of far-reaching electrons, resulting in more extended resist loss. A leading EUV chemically amplified resist exposed to 80 eV electrons at a dose up to 80 uc/cm2 showed up to 7.5 nm resist thickness loss. For an open-source resist exposed near 200 uC/cm2 by 80 eV electrons, the resist thickness lost after <b>post-exposure</b> bake and development was around 13nm, while doubling the dose resulted in increasing the loss to 15nm. On the other hand, for doses >500 uc/cm2, the resist begins to thicken due to crosslinking.|$|E
25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{determine}} exposure to benzene. Benzene {{itself can be}} measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours <b>post-exposure</b> due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid, phenylmercapturic acid, phenol, catechol, hydroquinone and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and duration of exposure, and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 μg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 μg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide is {{considered}} a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In animal models, exposure to acrylamide causes tumors in the adrenal glands, thyroid, lungs, and testes. Acrylamide is easily absorbed by the skin and distributed throughout the organism; {{the highest levels of}} acrylamide <b>post-exposure</b> are found in the blood, non-exposed skin, kidneys, liver, testes, and spleen. Acrylamide can metabolically-activated by cytochrome P450 to a genotoxic metabolite, glycidamide, which {{is considered}} to be a critical mode of action to the carcinogenesis of acrylamide. On the other hand, acrylamide and glycidamide can be detoxified via conjugation with glutathione to form acrylamide- and isomeric glycidamide-glutathione conjugates, subsequently metabolized to mercapturic acids and excreted in urine. Acrylamide has also been found to have neurotoxic effects in humans who have been exposed. Animal studies show neurotoxic effects as well as mutations in sperm.|$|E
2500|$|Amoxicillin is {{recommended}} as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) {{or in combination}} with a macrolide. The World Health Organization recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not [...] "severe". Amoxicillin is used in <b>post-exposure</b> inhalation of anthrax to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{studies show}} that use of {{antibiotics}} effective against anthrax plus administration of AVA is the most beneficial approach for purposes of <b>post-exposure</b> prophylaxis. This practice has been endorsed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Johns Hopkins Working Group on Civilian Biodefense, and the 2002 Institute of Medicine report on the vaccine. However, AVA is not licensed for <b>post-exposure</b> prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax or {{for use in a}} 3-dose regimen. Any such use, therefore, would be on an off-label or IND (officially experimental) basis.

50|$|The {{botulinum toxin}} is {{denatured}} and thus deactivated at temperatures greater than 80 C. As a zinc metalloprotease (see below), the toxin's activity is also susceptible, <b>post-exposure,</b> to inhibition by protease inhibitors, e.g., zinc-coordinating hydroxamates.|$|E
50|$|To be most effective, {{treatment}} {{should begin}} {{within an hour}} of exposure. After 72 hours <b>post-exposure</b> PEP is much less effective, and may not be effective at all. Prophylactic treatment for HIV typically lasts four weeks.|$|E
50|$|A 1998 {{retrospective}} {{survey found that}} numerous side effects have been recorded {{in reference to the}} unapproved use of norfloxacin in the pediatric population.Fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the FDA for use in children due to the risk of fatalities as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions.

50|$|Immunoglobulin and antivirals are not {{recommended}} for hepatitis C PEP. There is no vaccine for HCV; therefore, <b>post-exposure</b> treatment consists of monitoring for seroconversion. There is limited evidence {{for the use of}} antivirals in acute hepatitis C infection.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} {{clinical}} trials involving tecovirimat supports its use against smallpox {{and other related}} orthopoxviruses.

50|$|Efavirenz is {{also used}} in {{combination}} with other antiretroviral agents as part of an expanded <b>post-exposure</b> prophylaxis regimen {{to reduce the risk of}} HIV infection in people exposed to a significant risk (e.g. needlestick injuries, certain types of unprotected sex, etc.).|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} {{compelling}} data {{to suggest that}} PEP after HIV exposure is effective, there have been cases where it has failed. Failure has often been attributed to the delay in receiving treatment (greater than 72 hours <b>post-exposure),</b> the level of exposure, duration of treatment (lack of adherence to the 28-day regimen), or all three. However, given that - for non-occupational exposures - the time and level of exposure are based on patient-supplied information, absolute data is unavailable. The standard antibody window period begins after {{the last day of}} PEP treatment. People who received PEP are typically advised to get an antibody test at 6 months <b>post-exposure</b> as well as the standard 3 month test.|$|E
50|$|The soft-bake allows {{that high}} {{residual}} solvent content minimizes intrinsic stress and improves cross-linking.
