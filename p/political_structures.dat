With the large influx of Armenian refugees in the Levant, the ARF established a strong political structure in Lebanon {{and to a lesser}} extent, Syria. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established <b>political</b> <b>structures</b> in more than 200 states including the USA, where another large influx of Armenians settled.|$|E

Drafted by John Adams, the Massachusetts Constitution is currently the oldest functioning written constitution in continuous effect in the world. It has been amended 120 times, most recently in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time.

40|$|It {{was aimed}} to {{investigate}} the <b>political</b> <b>structure</b> of Mersin and {{its place in the}} general <b>political</b> <b>structure</b> of Turkey by using methods and techniques of political sociology. Structural-functionalist was used as the theoretical base. To achieve this goal, the results of the Turkish local elections in last 50 years (were examined. First of all, the formation of political power in Turkey and the overall operation and changing regularities at the bases of the local elections were evaluated. Secondly, It was looked to the formation of the <b>political</b> <b>structure</b> and the distribution of political power in Mersin since 1963 up to 2012. Finally, the meaning of Mersin findings within Turkish society was elaborated. Findings show that the <b>political</b> <b>structure</b> of Mersin city is rather different than overall Turkey. Rightist politics predominates the <b>political</b> <b>structure</b> of Mersin province. However, left politics plays a determining role in the <b>political</b> <b>structure</b> of the city of Mersin. Nevertheless, it has been experiencing significant changes in the city of Mersin in recent years: While left-wing parties have been experiencing a significant decrease, the trend has been upward for the right-wing parties...|$|R
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the <b>political</b> <b>structures</b> and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E
5|$|The unique <b>political</b> <b>structures</b> of late Middle Ages Italy {{have led}} some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the {{emergence}} of a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
