40|$|An {{overview}} of the two FEBUKO aerosol–cloud interaction field experiments in the Thüringer Wald (Germany) in October 2001 and 2002 and the corresponding modelling project MODMEP is given. Experimentally, a variety of measurement methods were deployed to probe the gas phase, particles and cloud droplets at three sites upwind, downwind and within an orographic cloud with special emphasis on the budgets and interconversions of organic gas and particle phase constituents. Out {{of a total of}} 14 sampling periods within 30 cloud events three events (EI, EII and EIII) are selected for detailed analysis. At various occasions an impact of the cloud process on particle chemical composition such as on the organic compounds content, sulphate and nitrate and also on particle size distributions and particle mass is observed. Moreover, direct phase transfer of <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> from the gas phase is found to be very important for the understanding of cloudwater composition. For the modelling side, a main result of the MODMEP project is the development of a cloud model, which combines a complex multiphase chemistry with detailed microphysics. Both components are described in a fine-resolved particle/drop spectrum. New numerical methods are developed for an efficient solution of the entire complex model. A further development of the CAPRAM mechanism has lead to a more detailed description of tropospheric aqueous phase organic chemistry. In parallel, effective tools for the reduction of highly complex reaction schemes are provided.

40|$|International audienceThe {{contamination}} of aquatic systems by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) {{is now a}} widely established fact. Nevertheless, {{there is still a}} scarcity of knowledge concerning the source, transport, fate and bioavailability of such active compounds. In the present study we assessed the distribution of estrogenic, (anti-) androgenic, pregnane X receptor-like (PXR) and dioxin-like activities between sediment and water compartments using a <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> integrative sampler (POCIS) and a semi-permeable membrane device (SPMD) passive sampler in a river where sediment has been previously described as highly and multi-contaminated. We first confirmed the contamination pattern of this river sediment between 2004, 2009 and 2010 samples, suggesting that this river is subject to a constant high contamination level. However, we showed a different distribution pattern of these activities between compartments: estrogenic activity was mainly detected in POCIS extracts {{and to a lesser extent}} in sediment and SPMD extracts; anti-androgenic activities were mainly detected in SPMD and sediment extracts while no activity was detected in POCIS extracts; PXR-like activity was detected in all three investigated compartments, with POCIS > SPMD > sediment; dioxin-like activity was mainly found in the sediment and the SPMD extracts. Overall, partitioning of the biological activities was in accordance with physicochemical properties (e. g., log K ow) of typical known active chemicals in each bioassay. Furthermore, in order to establish whether the chemicals involved in these activities were similar between the compartments, we fractionated sediment, POCIS and SPMD extracts using a multi-step fractionation procedure. This highlighted differences in the nature of active chemicals between compartments. Altogether, our results support the need to consider different compartments in order to enhance exposure assessment...|$|E
40|$|More than 3000 {{types of}} active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients (APIs) are applied in Human and veterinary medicine practice. These compounds are considered an emergent class of environmental contaminants {{with the ability}} to cause damage and unexpected effects to aquatic organisms, namely in species of high commercial value. APIs are ubiquitous in the environment being frequently detected in influents and effluents of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), surface waters and more distressingly in the public tap water in concentrations ranging from ng to μg. L- 1. Considering these premises, the present thesis focused on APIs detection in the Arade river water, the impact of summer period in APIs’ concentration alterations applying the passive sampler device, POCIS (<b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> integrative sampler), as well as, the assessment of the effects caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) ibuprofen (IBU) and diclofenac (DCF) and antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine as single and mixture exposures along with a classical contaminant copper (Cu) on a non-target species, mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. For this purpose, a multibiomarker approach was applied namely including biomarkers of oxidative stress (antioxidant enzymes activities of superoxide dismutase – SOD, catalase – CAT, glutathione reductase – GR and Phase II glutathione-S-transferase), damage - lipid peroxidation (LPO), neurotoxic effects (through the activity of acetylcholinesterase enzyme - AChE) and endocrine disruption (through vitellogenin-like proteins measurement applying the indirect method of alkali-labile phosphate - ALP) after exposure of mussel species’ to selected APIs at environmental relevant concentrations. The main results highlighted the occurrence of 19 APIs in the river Arade from several distinct therapeutic classes. Stimulant caffeine, antiasthmatic theophylline, NSAID ibuprofen and analgesic paracetamol presented the highest concentrations. Summer impact was inconclusive due to each API transient concentration in each month. The multibiomarker results revealed distinct responses towards each selected API (as single exposure or as mixtures) that were tissue and time dependent. Several multistressor interactions were proposed for each biomarker. The results also revealed APIs potential to induce oxidative stress, LPO, neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption even at extremely low concentrations on a species extremely vulnerable to APIs presence highlighting the urgency on the development of methodologies able to prevent its entrance in the aquatic environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} {{occurrence of}} emerging pollutants able to disrupt endocrine signalling pathways {{other than those}} mediated by estrogen receptors (e. g. corticosteroids, androgens or progestagens) is of recent concern. Recent evidences have suggested that effluents from pharmaceutical industry release drugs into rivers and trigger adverse effect on wildlife. By using in vitro bioassays combined to passive sampling (i. e. <b>Polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> integrative sampler, POCIS), we previously reported the occurrence of estrogenic, glucorticoidic, anti-mineralocorticoidic, progestative compounds and pregnane X receptor (PXR) ligands downstream a pharmaceutical industry release where strong reproductive alteration {{have been reported in}} fish. In this study, we report the use of effect directed approach to identify the compounds responsible for these activities. We first assessed mass balance calculation through chemical analyses directed by toxicity profile. Chemical analyses in POCIS crude extract showed the occurrence of high concentrations of dexamethasone, spironolactone, 6 -methyl-prednisolone (up to 100 micro g/g of sorbent) that well explained GR and anti-MR activities (up to 100 %). Conversely, other biological activities (i. e. estrogenic, PXR-like) were poorly explained by the detected chemicals. Then, sample RP-HPLC fractionation was carried out to unravel the different activities. It allowed the isolation of estrogenic and PXR-like activities from GR, PR and anti-MR. It also revealed the occurrence of MR agonists that were masked by the strong anti-MR activity in the crude extract. In addition, HPLC calibration showed a good fitting between retention times of detected chemicals and several active fractions (e. g. 6 -methyl-prednisolone in F 11, dexamethasone in F 12). Nevertheless, some active fractions were left unexplained by calibration standards suggesting that many active chemicals remain to be identified. Chemical analyses in these fractions are under investigations using LC-HRMS system and results will be presented. Our study demonstrates (1) the usefulness of MBA approach using pre-directed chemical analyses based on toxicity profile (2) the strength of the fractionation to unravel complex mixture effect and to finely isolate active chemicals. Overall, our results underscore the need to increase knowledge on the effects of corticosteroids and progestogens on aquatic organisms for better risk assessment...|$|E

30|$|Mixed {{wettability}} {{is defined}} as condition where larger pores are oil-wet and a continuous filament of oil exists throughout the core in larger pores, whereas the small pores are occupied by water (Anderson 1986; Salathiel 1973; Willhite 1986). Residual oil saturation of mixed wettability is low because oil {{is located in the}} large pores of the rock in continuous path that makes the oil displaced from the cores even at very low oil saturation. Mixed wettability can occur when oil containing interfacial active <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> invades a water-wet rock saturated with brine. After displacing brine from the larger pores, the interfacial active compounds react with the rock’s surface, displacing the remaining aqueous film and, thus, producing an oil-wet lining in the large pores. The water film between the rock and the oil in the pore is stabilized by a double layer of electrostatic forces. As the thickness of the film is diminished by the invading oil, the electrostatic force balance is destroyed and the film ruptures, allowing the <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> to displace the remaining water and react directly with the rock surface.|$|R

40|$|The end {{products}} of atmospheric degradation {{are not only}} CO 2 and H 2 O but also sulfate and nitrate depending on the chemical composition of the substances which are subject to degradation processes. Atmospheric degradation has thus a direct influence on the radiative balance of the earth not only due to formation of greenhouse gases but also of aerosols. Aerosols of a diameter of 0. 1 to 2 micrometer, reflect short wave sunlight very efficiently leading to a radiative forcing which {{is estimated to be}} about - 0. 8 watt per m 2 by IPCC. Aerosols also influence the radiative balance by way of cloud formation. If more aerosols are present, clouds are formed with more and smaller droplets and these clouds have a higher albedo and are more stable compared to clouds with larger droplets. Not only sulfate, but also nitrate and <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> formed as intermediates in degradation processes, contribute to this direct and indirect aerosol effect. Estimates for the Netherlands indicate a direct effect of - 4 watt m- 2 and an indirect effect of as large as - 5 watt m- 2.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{have been performed}} on organic–water mixtures near mineral surfaces.

Furthermore, additional simulations involving demixing of an organic–water mixture near a surfactant-covered mineral surface demonstrate that even low concentrations of adsorbed polar compounds can induce major changes in mineral surface wettability, allowing sorption of apolar molecules. This strongly supports a two-stage adsorption mechanism for organic solutes, involving initial migration of small <b>polar</b> <b>organic</b> molecules to the mineral surface followed by water film displacement due to co-adsorption of the more apolar <b>organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> thus converting an initial water-wet mineral system to an organic-covered surface.

A series of normal primary alkanols, dominated by even carbon-numbered homologues from C_(26) to C_(32), the secondary alcohol 10 -nonacosanol, and some phytosterols are prominent polar compounds in the vegetative detritus source sample.
