The town of Aix en Provence required of him to carry out an earthenware work and high relief in likings with the workshops [...] "Décoramic" [...] and P. Architta, to mark the year Cézanne 2006. It is intended to be installed on a <b>pinion</b> <b>wall</b> of the city in June 2007.|$|E
50|$|Minutes before, {{one group}} of attackers had cut through the loia cane that {{fastened}} the tax house, {{and were able to}} pull down the <b>walls,</b> <b>pinioning</b> eight policemen inside against their rifles. Only one constable was able to escape the tax house, and sprinted to the jetty and was able to swim to safety. The others fought the best they could, but the first to shoot, Constable Kabini, had his rifle misfire, and thus Basiana was not killed as he sprang into the house. In all, 15 officials, including Bell and Lillies, were killed. One of the attacking party, shot by Makasi, was killed, plus about half a dozen wounded.|$|R
