Other improvements were made in war pensions during Attlee’s tenure as prime minister. A Constant Attendance Allowance was tripled, an Unemployability Allowance was tripled from 10s to 30s a week, and a special hardship allowance of up to £1 a week was introduced. In addition, the 1951 Budget made further improvements in the supplementary allowances for many war pensioners. From 1945 onwards, three out of every four pension claims had been successful, whilst after the First World War only one <b>pension</b> <b>claim</b> in three was allowed. Under the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1948, employees of a body representative of local authorities or of the officers of local authorities could be admitted “on suitable terms to the superannuation fund of a local authority.” In 1951, a comforts allowance was introduced that was automatically paid to war pensioners “receiving unemployability supplement and constant attendance allowance.” ...|$|E

30|$|Using new linked employer-employee {{data from}} Germany, this article {{provides}} the first evidence {{on the effect of}} employer provided occupational pensions on work engagement. Famous efficiency wage theories predict that pensions enhance effort if a risk of forfeiture of <b>pension</b> <b>claims</b> is present. Exploiting the German non-forfeiture clause for employer-provided pensions, the results are consistent with the theoretical prediction and show that pensions in combination with the risk of forfeiture exert a positive effect on work engagement. Since occupational <b>pension</b> <b>claims</b> are selectively distributed across establishments, I control for establishment heterogeneity, but point estimates remain of the same size. Conditional quantile regression estimates indicate that especially {{the lower end of the}} engagement distribution is affected, which suggests that pensions combined with the risk of forfeiture are effective to reduce incentives for shirking.|$|R

40|$|The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} the system of retirement pension insurance within {{the territory of the}} Czech Republic. In the opening chapters it explains rudimentary terms and other important notions whose - at least sketchy - characterization is necessary for further full comprehension of the complex system of retirement pension benefits. The fifth chapter focusses on elementary terms which make clear the general calculation of retirement pension income. In the thesis different pension incomes (old age pension, disability pension and surviving dependant's pension) are defined by a general introduction into the topic of the respective types of pensions and their caracterization. In some cases there is a brief note about the historical context of the pension, in particular in case of surviving dependants' pensions. The thesis refers to the roots of such an adjustment. Then it is made clear what the legal conditions for the <b>pension</b> <b>claim</b> are, what entitles the benefit duration and when - according to the law - the respective benefit of pension insurance system expires, including the amount and payment of different pension incomes. The thesis includes important judicial verdicts of Czech law courts, principally on the retirement age interpretation, and a significant sentence of the European Court of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In most countries, {{the largest}} {{proportion}} of the pension benefits that are paid out to the elderly are brought together by {{the contributions of the}} active population. This type of financing is known as a Pay-As-You-Go-scheme. In this scheme, an important ‘chain of solidarity' covers for the pension of the preceding generation. So, there is a pattern of winners and losers that is caused by the rates of ageing of the populations, in combination with PAYG-pension schemes. In pension schemes based on the Capital Funding (CF) type, individuals of every generation build up a certain future <b>pension</b> <b>claim.</b> So, every generation builds up its own future pension benefit in this type of scheme. Hence, CF pension schemes are believed not to rely on income flows between generations, since every generation finances its own future pension. The advantage then is that there are no winners or losers, from the generational point of view at least, so that demographic developments cannot jeopardize the system. But, this only holds for Defined-Contribution (DC) pension systems. In practice, we also observe Defined-Benefit (DB) pension systems. In fact, the larger part of the occupational pensions schemes in the Netherlands are DB ones. For this type of schemes it holds that absence of intergenerational income flows is a too optimistic view, though the redistribution is not that strongly {{as in the case of}} PAYG schemes. The central question in this contribution is whether intergenerational redistribution of income occurs via Capital Funding in case of DB pension schemes in the Netherlands. To that end we analyse the Dutch civil servants' pension fund in the Dutch dynamic microsimulation model NEDYMAS. ...|$|E
40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{essential}} alterations {{in the field of}} the retirement pension insurance which occurred in the framework of the first stage of the pension reform since 1 January 2010 and which concerns conditions regulating pension claims and decides on the amount of pensions. The main purpose of the alterations is to contribute to the long-term financial sustainability of the Czech pension system. The theoretical part describes the basic principals of the retirement pension insurance, the financing of the pension insurance system, conditions of the <b>pension</b> <b>claim</b> to the particular types of pensions and the most important legal regulation alterations of the retirement pension insurance effective since 1 January 2010 in comparison to the legal regulation effective till 31 December 2009. The aim of my work was to find out the main problems occurring in the process of practical application of the parametric changes in the retirement pension insurance effective since 1 January 2010 and to find out possible impact of the changes on citizens. For the practical part of my work I chose the qualitative research, the questioning method and the technique of the semi-controlled dialogue. In total there were interviewed ten employees working at the pension departments of the regional social security authorities. The research shows that the main problems in the practical application of the retirement pension insurance arise in particular from the complicated legal regulation which is difficult to understand. Insufficient knowledge of the legal regulation reduces clients possibility to make the right decision on their pension claims. Parametric changes in the sphere of old-age pensions and alternative insurance periods will manifest gradually and will affect pension claims which will occur in the future. Gradual prolongation of the retirement age may result in the growth of disability and the increase of unemployment in case of the older citizens. In case of the early retirement the impact of the higher reduction of the percentage assessment, supposing the person retired more than 720 days before he was entitled, resulted in the higher reduction of the percentage assessment as early as at the benefits awarded after 31 December 2009. The thesis results can contribute to better awareness and knowledge of the issue and it can also serve as a topic for further discussion about the pension system reform...|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} in section 2, occupational pensions {{are associated with}} an average monthly contribution of about € 100, which is paid {{on top of the}} monthly wage. This additional wage component has a present value and is therefore interpreted as a wage premium. However, the theory also requires that this premium is at risk if an employee shirks. The non-forfeiture clause for employer provided pension suggests a clear distinction between vested <b>pension</b> <b>claims</b> and employees facing the risk of forfeiture, within {{the first five years of}} contributions. Within this five-year period, individuals face a severe punishment in the case of job loss, and therefore the employer provided pension reduces incentives for shirking. However, if the <b>pension</b> <b>claims</b> are vested, employees retain their claims. For this latter group, the theory is uncertain about a direct effect of pensions on work effort.|$|R
