5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also <b>pneumatically</b> operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft <b>pneumatically</b> controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|The film also {{features}} extensive miniature effect shots provided by 32TEN Studios, {{under the supervision}} of ILM VFX Producer Susan Greenhow and ILM VFX Supervisors John Knoll and Lindy DeQuattro. Shot using RED Epic cameras on 3D rigs, the scenes produced by 32TEN involved the creation of a quarter-scale office building interior which was destroyed by the fist of a Jaeger robot which was on a separate <b>pneumatically</b> controlled rig, as well as a sequence which depicted several rows of seats in a soccer stadium being blown apart as a Jaeger lands in the stadium, which was created by using quarter-scale seats blown apart by air cannons. Additionally 32TEN provided several practical elements for ILM’s compositing team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.|$|E

25|$|The {{pneumatic}} thermostat {{was invented}} by Warren Johnson in 1895 soon after he invented the electric thermostat. In 2009, Harry Sim was awarded a patent for a pneumatic-to-digital interface that allows <b>pneumatically</b> controlled buildings to be integrated with building automation systems to provide similar benefits as DDC.|$|E
25|$|The units {{had many}} {{features}} which made them {{state of the}} art {{at the time of their}} introduction. This included the use of <b>pneumatically</b> operated sliding passenger doors (the only Mark 1 based EMU to use this feature), with passenger-operated door opening buttons. In practice, the doors were usually operated by the train guard (later driver, after modification for driver-only operation).|$|E
25|$|Little {{detail about}} the {{stabilization}} system is recorded. It is known that the horizontal tail surfaces were hinged to allow the dihedral to change and that such motions were coupled to lift-changing flaps. Together, these stabilized pitch. The wing tips could rotate to control roll. The system was <b>pneumatically</b> powered and could be turned on and off in flight to test its efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash is {{captured}} and {{removed from the}} flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or fabric bag filters (or sometimes both) located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan. The fly ash is periodically removed from the collection hoppers below the precipitators or bag filters. Generally, the fly ash is <b>pneumatically</b> transported to storage silos for subsequent transport by trucks or railroad cars.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is usually}} made of cast iron, but may {{in some cases}} be made of {{composites}} such as reinforced carbon–carbon or ceramic matrix composites. This {{is connected to the}} wheel and/or the axle. To retard the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads, mounted on the brake caliper, is forced mechanically, hydraulically, <b>pneumatically,</b> or electromagnetically against both sides of the rotor. Friction causes the rotor and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|E
25|$|Real musical instruments, not {{previously}} {{associated with the}} pipe organ, were installed in the pipe chambers to be <b>pneumatically</b> operated at will by the organist. Such instruments as piano, drums, cymbals, xylophone, marimba, orchestra bells, chimes, castanets, wood blocks, and even tuned sleigh bells could be played from the organ keyboards. Sound effects such as train and boat whistles, car horns, sirens, bird whistles, and an imitation of ocean surf {{could be used to}} great effect at appropriate times during a silent film.|$|E
25|$|Condit dam was {{required}} to discharge at least 15ft³/s (0.4 m³/s) to keep the river channel viable. Surplus water {{was used by the}} turbines for electrical power generation and returned to the river about a mile downstream. Additional flow beyond what the turbines could use was discharged through five tainter gates and two sluice gates. The dam crest had a <b>pneumatically</b> actuated hinged crestgate which was designed to fail catastrophically as a safety relief when flow exceeds 18000ft³/s (510 m³/s). The river averages 1125ft³/s (32 m³/s), with flows up to 3500ft³/s (99 m³/s) fairly common.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} of liposuction (lipoplasty) was conceived and {{developed by the}} Italian plastic surgeons Arpat Fischer and Giorgio Fischer in 1974, and was put into medico-clinical practice in 1975. Access to the woman's autologous adipocyte fat was by means of 5-mm incisions, and was harvested with an electrically and <b>pneumatically</b> –powered instrument, which rotated and alternated in its aspiration of the fat through a cannula. Meanwhile, through a separate incision to the fat-tissue harvest site, saline solution was injected to dilute the body fat, and so facilitate its aspiration.|$|E
25|$|From the {{expression}} above, {{it is seen}} that the van der Waals force decreases with decreasing size of bodies (R). Nevertheless, the strength of inertial forces, such as gravity and drag/lift, decrease to a greater extent. Consequently, the van der Waals forces become dominant for collections of very small particles such as very fine-grained dry powders (where there are no capillary forces present) even though the force of attraction is smaller in magnitude {{than it is for}} larger particles of the same substance. Such powders are said to be cohesive, meaning they are not as easily fluidized or <b>pneumatically</b> conveyed as their more coarse-grained counterparts. Generally, free-flow occurs with particles greater than about 250 μm.|$|E
25|$|In 1962 the IBM350 RAMAC {{disk storage}} unit was {{superseded}} by the IBM1301 {{disk storage unit}}, which consisted of 50 platters, each about 1/8-inch thick and 24 inches in diameter. Whereas the IBM350 used only two read/write heads which were <b>pneumatically</b> actuated and moved in two dimensions, the 1301 {{was one of the}} first disk storage units to use an array of heads, one per platter, moving as a single unit. Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, and the heads flew about 250 micro-inches (about 6µm) above the platter surface. Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning. The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes. Access time was about a quarter of a second.|$|E
500|$|Three {{full-size}} <b>pneumatically</b> powered prop sharks—which {{the film}} crew nicknamed [...] "Bruce" [...] after Spielberg's lawyer, Bruce Ramer—were {{made for the}} production: a [...] "sea-sled shark", a full-body prop with its belly missing that was towed with a [...] line, and two [...] "platform sharks", one that moved from camera-left to -right (with its hidden left side exposing an array of pneumatic hoses), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered. The sharks were designed by art director Joe Alves during {{the third quarter of}} 1973. Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper's Motion Picture & Equipment Rental in Sun Valley, California. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location. In early July, the platform used to tow the two side-view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it. The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts.|$|E
500|$|The I-185, {{designed}} in early 1940, {{was based on}} the I-180, which was itself a development of the I-16, but was virtually a new design. The monocoque fuselage was similarly built of 'shpon', molded birch plywood, and also had an integral fin, but it was considerably longer than that of the I-180. The two-spar, all-metal wing was smaller and thinner than the I-180's wing, nearly as thin as that of the Supermarine Spitfire's wing at 13% at the root and tapered to 8% at the wing tip. The wing had a NACA-230 profile and was skinned in duralumin. <b>Pneumatically</b> powered split flaps and leading edge slats were fitted. The outer wing panels had 3° of dihedral. The fabric-covered control surfaces were framed in duralumin. The protected [...] fuel tanks were mounted between the wing center section spars. The I-185 used a conventional undercarriage with a retractable tailwheel. The unproven 1,492kW (2,000hp) 18-cylinder, two-row Tumansky M-90 radial engine was carried on welded steel tubes. It was fitted with a ducted spinner to improve cooling with the air expelled through gills as in the I-180 to provide additional thrust. The synchronized armament was mounted in the fuselage, two [...] ShKAS machine guns and two [...] Berezin UBS machine guns. A [...] bomb could be carried under overload conditions. The first prototype was completed in May 1940, but the only available example of the M-90 did not provide enough power for take-off. The prototype was modified to use another experimental engine, the [...] Shvetsov M-81 radial, but this was not nearly powerful enough for flight tests. The I-185 (M-81) finally took to the air on January 11, 1941, but it was decided not to waste further development and await a more powerful engine which was fortunate as the M-81 was cancelled in May 1941.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanically, the Mk III C's {{transmission}} {{was a major}} improvement {{from the}} older car. [...] A new 6-speed gearbox built by X-Trac {{was part of the}} package, replacing the previous 5-speed. [...] This gearbox was further enhanced by the option of a <b>pneumatically</b> actuated gear change system developed by Megaline which was activated by paddles behind the steering wheel, rather than by a traditional gear stick.|$|E
2500|$|By May 1930 {{the fleet}} totalled 130 buses and coaches, {{the most recent}} arrivals being 14 AEC Reliance 95hp 32 seater single decker buses of the [...] "most modern" [...] design. Dual-doored, the front was Simplex <b>pneumatically</b> controlled. The {{interior}} featured oak panelling throughout, Induroleum floor covering, chrome fittings, a Holt patent heater, and the bucket type leather upholstered seats. There was still a rear smoker's compartment, now just seating 10.|$|E
2500|$|The post-1958 Pirinçlik {{system had}} eight {{separate}} radar sets or channels, {{each with its}} own , transmitter, duplexer, receiver, and data display unit. These eight channels fed electromagnetic energy into sixteen fixed beams formed by the two antennas, each channel, or transmitter-receiver combination, being time-shared between two beams. <b>Pneumatically</b> driven switches operated on a three-second cycle to power each beam alternately for 1.5 seconds. There were antenna feeds for two additional beams which could be made to function with some patchwork in the wiring.|$|E
2500|$|A common player piano {{operates}} <b>pneumatically.</b> The Violano-Virtuoso was all {{electric and}} all the moving parts were {{set in motion by}} electric motors or electromagnets. A company catalogue states that they ran on [...] "any electric lighting current" [...] and [...] used [...] "no more than one 16-candle power light." [...] They were designed to operate on 110 volts direct current. In locations that had 110 volts alternating current (or other types of power supply) the instruments were used with a unique converter unit.|$|E
2500|$|Ionization {{takes place}} by {{directing}} an electrically charged mist to the sample surface {{that is a}} few millimeters away. The electrospray mist is <b>pneumatically</b> directed at the sample where subsequent splashed droplets carry desorbed, ionized analytes. After ionization, the ions travel through air into the atmospheric pressure interface which {{is connected to the}} mass spectrometer. [...] DESI is a technique that allows for ambient ionization of a trace sample at atmospheric pressure, with little sample preparation. DESI can be used to investigate in situ, secondary metabolites specifically looking at both spatial and temporal distributions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} SpaceShipOne can be <b>pneumatically</b> tilted {{forwards}} into an aerodynamically stable high-drag [...] "feathered" [...] shape. This removes {{most of the}} need to actively control attitude during the early part of reentry: Scaled Composites refer to this as [...] "care-free reentry". One of the early test flights actually performed re-entry inverted, demonstrating the flexibility and inherent stability of Burt Rutan's [...] "shuttlecock" [...] design. This feathered reentry mode is claimed to be inherently safer than the behavior at similar speeds of the Space Shuttle. The Shuttle undergoes enormous aerodynamic stresses and must be precisely steered in order to remain in a stable glide. (Although this is an interesting comparison of behavior, it is not an entirely fair comparison of design concepts: the Shuttle starts reentry at much higher speed than SpaceShipOne, and so has some very different requirements. SpaceShipOne is more similar to the X-15 vehicle.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} took it {{upon themselves}} to serve as crash test dummies. Colonel John Paul Stapp USAF propelled himself over 1000km/h on a rocket sled and stopped in 1.4 seconds. Lawrence Patrick, then a professor at Wayne State University, endured some 400 rides on a rocket sled in order to test the effects of rapid deceleration on the human body. He and his students allowed themselves to be smashed in the chest with heavy metal pendulums, impacted in the face by <b>pneumatically</b> driven rotary hammers, and sprayed with shattered glass to simulate window implosion. While admitting that it made him [...] "a little sore", Patrick has said that the research he and his students conducted was seminal in developing mathematical models against which further research could be compared. But while data from live testing was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests which went past a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of subject.|$|E
2500|$|Stock with air-doors {{first entered}} {{service on the}} London Underground in 1921, and from 1923 Standard Stock {{operated}} on the Hampstead line, and these allowed staff to be reduced to front and rear guards and a driver. A Central London car was experimentally rebuilt with air-doors in 1925, and by 1928 all cars had been converted, the work being carried out at the Union Construction Company at Feltham. The end platforms were enclosed and trailer cars were equipped with two [...] openings with a single leaf sliding doors on each side. Motor cars had a single larger opening with a double-leaf sliding door and a guard's compartment with a hinged door. The sliding doors were <b>pneumatically</b> operated, later assisted with electrically controlled exhaust valves to speed up opening. In 1926/27, whilst the conversion was in progress, two six-car trains of 1906 Stock and 1920 Stock were borrowed from the Piccadilly line, the trailers fitted with smaller wheels {{to allow them to}} run in the smaller Central London tunnels. Fitting the air-doors reduced the number of seats, from 48 to 40 in the trailers and 42 to 30 in the motor cars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed of}} the cars rolling down from the hump into the {{classification}} bowl must be regulated according to whether they are full or empty, heavy or light freight, varying number of axles, whether there are few or many cars on the classification tracks, and varying weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed and direction. As concerns speed regulation, {{there are two types}} of hump yards—without or with mechanisation by retarders. In the old non-retarder yards braking was usually done in Europe by railroaders who laid skates onto the tracks. The skate or wheel chock was manually (or, in rare cases, mechanically) placed on one or both of the rails so that the treadles or rims of the wheel or wheels caused frictional retardation and resulted in the halting of the railway car. In the United States this braking was done by riders on the cars. In the modern retarder yards this work is done by mechanized [...] "rail brakes" [...] called retarders, which brake the cars by gripping the wheels. They are operated either <b>pneumatically</b> or hydraulically. [...] Pneumatic systems are prevalent in the United States, France, Belgium, Russia and China, while hydraulic systems are used in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E
2500|$|When it {{had been}} decided to {{transfer}} the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, the cars' braking was modernized further. In AMRE schedule braking, the electric brake must be activated at all times by use of the electric brake key to synchronize the train's braking effort electrically. If it was not [...] "cut in" [...] or failed en route, the system could still be manipulated to apply the brakes <b>pneumatically.</b> This would still allow the train to stop, but deceleration would take longer such as on the older AM(P) schedule braking. However, in AMRE, the notches in the brake stand to cause this pneumatic application are completely separate from the notches to cause an electric application. Therefore, if a motorman with a defective or inactive electric AMRE brake were to electrically apply the brakes, nothing would happen! Valuable seconds would be lost while he realized his electric brake was inactive, before he could move to the pneumatic apply notch to begin slowing his train down (which would still take longer than usual without electric synchronization of the brakes). In a serious scenario, this could cause him to overshoot a station or an important stopping point, or overspeed. In a new braking schedule known as AMUE, however, the electric and pneumatic notches are joined together on the motorman's brake stand. Therefore, even if the electric brake is defective or inactive, his moving the brake handle to the apply position would still begin setting up a pneumatic application of the brakes, creating a much quicker response to the condition than possible under any other previous system. As part of the modifications for elevated service, the Composites were equipped with AMUE schedule braking from 1916 until their retirement.|$|E
2500|$|In DESI, {{there is}} a {{high-velocity}} <b>pneumatically</b> assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample {{where it can be}} desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing secondary ion droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, one way consists of a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate surface potential. The surface potential that can be applied is the same at which the sprayer can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300°C with newer stages having built in CCD’s and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI [...] is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.|$|E
