25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single frequency signal that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random <b>phase</b> <b>modulation.</b> Either of these impurities spreads {{some of the}} signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the aim {{to make a very}} narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care needs to be taken to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.|$|E

25|$|The {{semiconductor}} {{optical amplifier}} is of small size and electrically pumped. It can be potentially {{less expensive than}} the EDFA and can be integrated with semiconductor lasers, modulators, etc. However, the performance is still not comparable with the EDFA. The SOA has higher noise, lower gain, moderate polarization dependence and high nonlinearity with fast transient time. The main advantage of SOA is that all four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross <b>phase</b> <b>modulation,</b> wavelength conversion and four wave mixing) can be conducted. Furthermore, SOA can be run with a low power laser.|$|E
25|$|At the President's insistence, Ellie {{agrees to}} meet with two {{religious}} leaders, Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss. A lifelong religious skeptic, Ellie tries to convince Joss of her faith in science by standing near a heavy Foucault pendulum and trusting that its amplitude will not increase. Although dismissing Rankin's outbursts, Ellie is intrigued by Joss' worldview. Shortly after, Ellie travels to Paris to discuss the machine with a newly formed consortium. The participants reach a consensus that the machine is a dodecahedron shaped vehicle with five seats. At the conference, Ellie meets Devi Sukhavati, a doctor who left India to marry the man she loved, only to lose him to illness a year later. The final piece of the message is discovered when S. R. Hadden, a billionaire in multiple high-tech industries with an obsessive personal interest {{in the concept of}} immortality, suggests that Ellie check for <b>phase</b> <b>modulation.</b> This reveals the primer, thus allowing construction of the machine to begin.|$|E

The main store initially {{consisted of two}} double-density Williams tubes, each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit words– known as pages– backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages. [...] The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four Williams tubes and 128 magnetic drum pages of backing store. The [...] diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, {{each with its own}} read/write head. Each track held 2,560bits, corresponding to twopages (2×32×40bits). One revolution of the drum took 30milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added.

2500|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} (AM) is a {{modulation technique}} used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting information via a radio carrier wave. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied {{in proportion to}} the waveform being transmitted. [...] That waveform may, for instance, correspond to the sounds to be reproduced by a loudspeaker, or the light intensity of television pixels. [...] This technique contrasts with frequency modulation, in which the frequency of the carrier signal is varied, and <b>phase</b> <b>modulation,</b> in which its phase is varied.|$|E

Above-threshold ionization spectra are calculated by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the Kramers-Henneberger frame by the split-operator method. Effects of amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>modulations</b> {{of the laser}} field are examined by comparing the energy spectra of harmonic and anharmonic laser fields at the same cycle-averaged laser intensity.

40|$|We model a thalamo-cortical system {{using the}} {{following}} two assumptions: 1.) Each cortical column is an autonomous oscillator. 2.) Connections between cortical columns and the thalamus are weak. Our goal is to deduce from these assumptions general principles of thalamocortical interactions that are independent of the equations describing the system. We find {{that the existence of}} synaptic connections between any two cortical columns does not guarantee that the columns interact: They interact only when there is a certain nearly resonant relation between their frequencies, which implies that the interactions are frequency modulated (FM). When the resonant relation holds, the cortical columns interact through <b>phase</b> <b>modulations.</b> Thus, communications between weakly connected cortical oscillators employ an FM radio principle: the frequency of oscillation encodes the channel of communication, while the information is transmitted via <b>phase</b> <b>modulations.</b> If the thalamic input has an appropriate fr [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Others {{causes of}} signal {{impairment}} include amplitude ripple and slope across the passband, phase ripple across the passband, large band-edge phase shifts caused by band-limiting filters, [...] <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> due to poorly regulated power supplies, {{all of which}} lead to higher sidelobe levels. [...] Tolerances for these various parameters can be derived {{with the aid of}} paired echo theory.

[...] Generation of soliton pulse in fibre is an obvious conclusion as self <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> due to high energy of pulse offset GVD, whereas the evolution length is 2000nbsp&km. (the laser wavelength chosen greater than 1.3 micrometers). Moreover, peak soliton pulse is of period 1–3nbsp&ps so that it [...] is safely accommodated in the optical bandwidth. Once soliton pulse is generated it is least dispersed over thousands of kilometres length of fibre limiting the number of repeater stations.|$|E
2500|$|A second, {{and perhaps}} more correct, {{definition}} of [...] "compatible single sideband" [...] (CSSB) refers {{to a form of}} amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> in which the carrier is transmitted along with a series of sidebands that are predominantly above or below the carrier term. [...] Since <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> is present in the generation of the signal, energy is removed from the carrier term and redistributed into the sideband structure similar to that which occurs in analog frequency modulation. [...] The signals feeding the phase modulator and the envelope modulator are further phase-shifted by 90° with respect to each other. [...] This places the information terms in quadrature with each other; the Hilbert transform of information to be transmitted is utilized to cause constructive addition of one sideband and cancellation of the opposite primary sideband. [...] Since <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> is employed, higher-order terms are also generated. [...] Several methods have been employed to reduce the impact (amplitude) of most of these higher-order terms. [...] In one system, the phase-modulated term is actually the log {{of the value of the}} carrier level plus the phase-shifted audio/information term. [...] This produces an ideal CSSB signal, where at low modulation levels only a first-order term on one side of the carrier is predominant. [...] As the modulation level is increased, the carrier level is reduced while a second-order term increases substantially in amplitude. [...] At the point of 100% envelope modulation, 6dB of power is removed from the carrier term, and the second-order term is identical in amplitude to carrier term. [...] The first-order sideband has increased in level until it is now at the same level as the formerly unmodulated carrier. [...] At the point of 100% modulation, the spectrum appears identical to a normal double-sideband AM transmission, with the center term (now the primary audio term) at a 0dB reference level, and both terms on either side of the primary sideband at −6dB. [...] The difference is that what appears to be the carrier has shifted by the audio-frequency term towards the [...] "sideband in use". [...] At levels below 100% modulation, the sideband structure appears quite asymmetric. [...] When voice is conveyed by a CSSB source of this type, low-frequency components are dominant, while higher-frequency terms are lower by as much as 20dB at 3kHz. [...] The result is that the signal occupies approximately 1/2 the normal bandwidth of a full-carrier, DSB signal. [...] There is one catch: the audio term utilized to phase-modulate the carrier is generated based on a log function that is biased by the carrier level. [...] At negative 100% modulation, the term is driven to zero (0), and the modulator becomes undefined. [...] Strict modulation control must be employed to maintain stability of the system and avoid splatter. [...] This system is of Russian origin and was described in the late 1950s. [...] It is uncertain whether it was ever deployed.|$|E

For three different distribution functions (Gaussian, Lorentzian, and exponential) we consider here, the transition probability under frequent modulations is suppressed most if the pulse delay is short and the evolution time is larger than a critical value. Furthermore, decoherence freezing (with a transition rate equals to zero) occurs when there are frequent <b>phase</b> <b>modulations,</b> while the transition rate only decreases when there are frequent measurements and a mix of them, as the pulse delay approaches zero.
