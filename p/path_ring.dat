It is proved that the following rings are then also Iwanaga-Gorenstein: the polynomial ring R[x], the group ring R[G] when G is polycyclic-by-finite and the <b>path</b> <b>ring</b> RÃn for the cyclic quiver Ãn on n+ 1 vertices. It is also shown that when R is left noetherian of finite global dimension, then so is RÃn. We call a ring R (associative, with identity) Iwanaga-Gorenstein if it is {{left and right}} noetherian and both of the regular representations RR andRR have finite injective dimension. The main point {{of this paper is}} to prove Theorem 3. 5 which says that for a polycyclic-by-finite group the group ring R[G] is Iwanaga-Gorenstein in case that R is. Our proof actually shows that if R is left noetherian and the injective dimension dimRR is finite, then dimR[G]R[G] ≤ dimRR + h where h = h(G) is the Hirsch number of G. When h = 0, that is, when G is finite, this result was proved by Eilenberg and Nakayama [1]. The second section of the paper is devoted to proving results needed in the induction step of the proof. In particular, Corollary 3. 1 and Corollary 3. 2 were needed along the way but which may prove of interest in their own right. In the last section, we consider the <b>path</b> <b>ring</b> RÃn of the cyclic quiver Ãn on n + 1 vertices and we prove a result similar to the above, e. g., Corollary 4. 6. Finally, Theorem 4. 11 establishes for a left noetherian ring R a bound on the global dimension of RÃn in terms of gl dimR. Key words and phrases.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} of designing an optimal virtual topology for Wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) based Toroid Optical Networks that support unicast traffic, with a static traffic pattern. A virtual topology is created by setting up a collection of light paths that maybe embedded in a given physical topology. Traffic is routed over the light paths in an optimal manner such that the delay of transmitting data from a single source to destination is reduced. Previous work deals with designing optimal virtual topologies over <b>path,</b> <b>ring</b> or bus topologies. This paper, however, deals with designing an optimal virtual topology {{to reduce the number}} of hops while routing over a toroidal topology by introducing a “Super node ” concept. This concept helps limit the number of hops, under any situation, to a maximum of three and also causes aggregation of traffic. The design problem is studied taking into consideration the wavelength continuity constraint and sub-wavelength routing...|$|E
40|$|The {{advances}} in fiber optics and {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) technology are viewed {{as the key to}} satisfying the data-driven bandwidth demand of today’s Internet. The mismatch of bandwidths between user needs and wavelength capacity makes it clear that some multiplexing should be done to use the wavelength capacity efficiently, which will result in reduction on the cost of line terminating equipment (LTE). The technique is referred to as traffic grooming. Previous studies have concentrated on different objectives, or on some special network topologies such as rings. In our study, we aim at minimizing the LTE cost to directly target on minimizing the network cost. We look into the grooming problem in elemental topologies as a starting point. First, we conduct proofs to show that traffic grooming in <b>path,</b> <b>ring</b> and star topology networks with the cost function we consider is NP-Complete. We also show the same complexity results for a Min-Max objective that has not been considered before, on the two elementary topologies. We then design polynomialtime heuristic algorithms for the grooming problem in rings (thus implicitly paths) and stars for networks of larger size.

In this paper, {{the design and}} development of an IoT {{platform with}} multiple Mobile Sensor Nodes (MSN) for the spatiotemporal quality evaluation of surface water is presented. A survey planner is proposed to distribute the Sampling Locations of Interest (SLoIs) over the study area and generate paths for MSNs to visit the SLoIs, given the limited energy and time budgets. The SLoIs are chosen based on a cellular decomposition that is composed of uniform hexagonal cells.

The selected reference clusters are the Morse clusters with 13 or less atoms and the 13 atom clusters {{found in an}} FCC and an HCP crystal phase, consisting of an atom and its 12 nearest neighbours. The first step in using the method requires the bond network of the bulk phase to be identified. The bonds may be identified {{in terms of the}} distance between the atom pairs or by using a modified Voronoi decomposition, introduced here. We then search for all the 3, 4 and 5 membered shortest <b>path</b> <b>rings</b> and use these to identify some basic clusters. These basic clusters are then combined to identify the above mentioned Morse and crystal clusters. The larger Morse clusters (N> 13) may be identified in terms of the basic clusters and the smaller Morse clusters.

40|$|We study a {{combinatorial}} {{model of}} the spread of influence in networks that generalizes existing schemata recently proposed in the literature. In our model agents change behaviors/opinions {{on the basis of}} information collected from their neighbors in a time interval of bounded size whereas agents are assumed to have unbounded memory in previously studied scenarios. In our mathematical framework, one is given a network G[*]=[*](V,E), an integer value t(v) for each node v[*]∈[*]V, and a time window size λ. The goal is to determine a small set of nodes (target set) that influences the whole graph. The spread of influence proceeds in rounds as follows: initially all nodes in the target set are influenced; subsequently, in each round, any uninfluenced node v becomes influenced if the number of its neighbors that have been influenced in the previous λ rounds is {{greater than or equal to}} t(v). We prove that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality target set that influences the whole network G is hard to approximate within a polylogarithmic factor.

40|$|In {{the social}} network era, every {{decision}} an individual makes, whether it is watching a movie or purchasing a book, is influenced {{by his or her}} personal network to a certain degree. This thesis investigates the power of the “word-of-mouth” effect within social networks. Given a network G = (V, E, t) where t(v) denotes the threshold of node v, we model the spread of influence as follows. Influence propagates deterministically in discrete steps. An influenced node u exerts a fixed amount of influence bu,w on any neighbor w. For any uninfluenced node v, if the total amount of influence it receives from all its already influenced neighbors at time step t− 1 is at least t(v), node v will be influenced in step t. Given a social network G, we study the problem of introducing an already activated external influencer v into the network, and choosing links from v to nodes in G that can maximize the spread of influence in G. We study two problems: the Minimum Links problem, which is to choose the minimum number of links that can activate the entire network, and the Maximum Influence problem, which is to choose k neighbors that will maximize the size of the influenced set. We prove that the Maximum Influence problem is NP-hard, even for bipartite graphs in which thresholds of all nodes are either one or two. We also study both problems in <b>paths,</b> <b>rings,</b> trees and cliques, and we give polynomial time algorithms that find optimal solutions to both problems for all these topologies...|$|R

For concreteness, we use the average hop distance as the metric of optimality. WDM networks supporting multicast communication typically employ multicast-capable switches which permit a path entering a switch on an incoming wavelength to be replicated or “split ” optically {{to one or more}} output links. This splitting incurs a power loss which is frequently neglected in existing heuristics and algorithms. In this paper we show that the problem of finding optimal virtual topologies with splitting loss constraints can be solved in polynomial time in directed <b>paths</b> and <b>rings,</b> although the problem is NP-complete for general topologies.

40|$|Problem statement: This {{study is}} {{highlighted}} on a restoration scheme proposed against failure in working {{line at the}} drop region for Fiber-To-The Home (FTTH) with a Passive Optical Network (PON). Whereas PON {{is a system that}} brings optical fiber cable and signals all or most of {{the way to the end}} user. In this study we highlighted the issue on survivability scheme against failure which is focused scattered residence architectures. Approach: Two types of restoration scheme are proposed by means of linear protection (tree) and migrate protection (ring). Our proposed scheme is inexpensive and applicable to any residence architecture (ordered placement and scattered placement). The advantage of this scheme is the failure at fiber line can be recovered until two levels to make sure the optic signals flow continuously. FTTH based network design is simulated by using OptiSystem 7. 0 in order to investigate the power output and BER performance at each node in the tree and ring protection scheme in scattered placement to prove the system feasibility. Results: The simulation analysis for output power in a linear protection path produced almost the same output power for all optical nodes regardless of the position and situation of the node. In linear protection, signal is split by optical splitter and did not having loss of power at each node. Thus the percentage adjustment on the coupling is obtained where; the average output power measured at the receiver is at - 28. 4206 dBm. While the signal for <b>ring</b> <b>path</b> is optimized by adjusting the loss ratio (n%) and transmit it (1 -n%) in the optical coupler. Also found that; an average output power is - 23 dBm only. A simulation of distance accessibility is increased with the increasing of sensitivity that used for the linear <b>path</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>path.</b> Conclusion: This study suggests the migration of tree to ring topology to enable the signal flow continuously in the case of failure occurs specifically in random or scattered placement topology.
