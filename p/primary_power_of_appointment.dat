25|$|Appointments {{of judges}} and Judicial Commissioners (JCs) of the Supreme Court {{are made by}} the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. The Prime Minister thus {{possesses}} the <b>primary</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> of judges of the Supreme Court. Although the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs, and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments, these are relatively small roles played in the final say as to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, {{it is said that}} the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges who believe in the same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers. On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles are inevitably intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.|$|E

50|$|A <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> {{is a term}} most {{frequently}} used in the law of wills to describe {{the ability of the}} testator (the person writing the will) to select a person who will be given the authority to dispose of certain property under the will. Although any person can exercise this power at any time during their life, its use is rare outside of a will. The power is divided into two broad categories: general <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> and special <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> The holder <b>of</b> a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> differs from the trustee of a trust in that the former has no obligation to manage the property for the generation of income, but need only distribute it.|$|R

50|$|A general <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> {{is defined}} for federal estate tax {{purposes}} in the Internal Revenue Code §2041. A general <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> is one {{which allows the}} holder <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> to appoint to himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors {{of his or her}} estate the right to have the beneficial use and enjoyment of certain property covered by the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> The holder <b>of</b> a general <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> is treated for estate tax purposes as {{if he or she is}} the owner of the property subject to the power, whether or not the power is exercised. Thus, the property which is subject to the power is includable in the power holder's estate for estate tax purposes.|$|R
50|$|In United States trust law, a SPA Trust is an {{irrevocable}} {{trust that}} includes a special <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> Unlike general <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment,</b> a special <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> {{is limited to a}} certain class of persons or entities that may receive the benefit <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> (appointee) from the person in whom the power is vested (donee). Generally, SPA trusts are used to hold property for asset protection purposes, because of the benefits and control a SPA trust offers over the assets protected within the trust.|$|R

For example, a testator might grant his brother the special power to distribute property among the testator's three children. The brother would then {{have the authority to}} choose which of the testator's children gets which property. Unlike a general <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment,</b> the refusal <b>of</b> the appointed party to exercise a specific <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> causes the designated property to revert as a gift to the members of a group or a class.|$|R

40|$|The Government’s <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} instrument for governing the state administration and it {{can be traced back to}} the Middle Ages in Swedish his­tory. Although the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> has been criticized several times, it still looks essen­tially the same now as it did then. In 2006 the new centre-right coalition (Alliansen) decided to re­form the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> policy, to change the traditionally closed procedures. Histori­cal institutional­ism states that institutions are seen as old and difficult to change. Thus, the long his­tory <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> could have a part in the explanation of why the institution has not come to any significant change. The purpose of this study is to describe and examine the re­form, and the effects which may have derived from it, by using policy analysis with parts of interven­tion theory. This study has also sought to give an explanation, based on mechanisms of path depend­ence, to why the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> has managed to stay stable through­out his­tory which may have affected the opportunities and obstacles faced by the reform. The re­sults have shown that the reformation <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> policy has changed the proce­dure, since the entire recruitment process now, to a greater extent, is documented and saved in files relating to employment matters. But since there have been recruitments of agency heads that at first sight appear to have followed the reform but when analysed closer has shown that this has not been the case, the question still remains whether the reformation of the proce­dure in some cases actu­ally has affected the final appointments at all. The conclusion is that the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> appoint­ment to some extent is change resistant, which largely can be related to the fact that the institu­tion is old and stable. The recruitment procedure has a long tradition of closed appoint­ments which could be the reason why it has been so difficult to change. ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> {{the trustee}} of a {{discretionary}} trust {{is held by}} the Appointor. In some trust deeds, the person holding the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the trustee is called the Custodian or the Principal of the trust. The Appointor is usually a natural person but {{can also be a}} company. Generally, upon the death of the Appointor, in the absence <b>of</b> an alternate <b>appointment</b> in the trust deed, the personal legal representative (executor) of the Appointor becomes the Appointor. The real power in relation to the control of the trust rests with the Appointor because of the ability to terminate the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the trustee and appoint a different trustee. This must be kept in mind when considering succession and estate planning involving assets held in a discretionary trust.|$|R

While Dion had stated several times that he would use his <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> to ensure more female candidates, many felt the appointment was a snub to his erstwhile supporter and media reports suggested that Ralph Goodale, a prominent Saskatchewan MP, opposed Orchard's candidacy.|$|R

5000|$|In United States trust law, an Ultra Trust is a {{registered}} trademark whose intellectual property is owned by Estate Street Partners LLC that describes {{a specific type of}} intentionally defective grantor-type irrevocable trust that includes an independent trustee as well as a special limited <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment.</b> Unlike general <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment,</b> a special limited <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> within the Ultra Trust is limited to a specific person(s) who retains the benefit <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> (grantor) from the person in whom the power is vested (trustee). Generally, Ultra Trust's are used to reposition all types of assets for purposes of asset protection, as an Ultra Trust offers the ability to have an independent third party own assets previously owned by the grantor. An Ultra Trust is a legal entity with special provisions, benefits, and limitations created and drafted by an attorney who has expertise with debtor—creditor law, income tax law, gift tax law, and estate tax law, as well as trust law. The purpose of an Ultra Trust is to reposition assets from a person's legal ownership in order to limit one's exposure to potential future liabilities. [...] The Ultra Trust legal entity is created with these legal principles: 1. With respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor of the grantor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the grantor's benefit. [...] 2. A grantor can retain special limited <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>appointment</b> without subjecting the assets owned by the Ultra Trust to creditors claims.|$|R
