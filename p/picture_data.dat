CVT also specifies a mode ("CVT-R") which significantly reduces these blanking intervals (to a period insufficient for CRT displays to work correctly) in the interests of saving video signal bandwidth when modern displays such as LCD monitors are being used, since such displays typically do not require these pauses in the <b>picture</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

50|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in maintaining a user-accessible operating system is establishing connections between data types and the applications or processes that can effectively use such data. For example, a file that contains <b>picture</b> <b>data</b> in a particular compression format can only be opened and processed in applications {{that are capable of}} handling <b>picture</b> <b>data,</b> and those applications must be able to identify which compression type was used in order to extract and work with that data. In early computer systems - particularly DOS, its variants, and some versions of Windows - file associations are maintained by file extensions. The three to four character code following a file name instructs the system to open the file in particular applications.|$|E

It also allows authentication to be performed based on NTLM and Active Directory user accounts. However, use of such encryption plugins make it incompatible with other VNC programs. RealVNC offers high-strength AES encryption as part of its commercial package, along with integration with Active Directory. Workspot released AES encryption patches for VNC. According to TightVNC, TightVNC is not secure as <b>picture</b> <b>data</b> is transmitted without encryption. To circumvent this, it should be tunneled through a SSH connection (see below).|$|E
50|$|By the {{introduction}} of a common operational <b>picture,</b> <b>data</b> are put into context, which leads to information instead of data. The next step, which is enabled by service-oriented web-based infrastructures (but not yet operationally used), is the use of models and simulations for decision support. Simulation systems are the prototype for procedural knowledge, which is the basis for knowledge quality. Finally, using intelligent software agents to continually observe the battle sphere, apply models and simulations to analyse what is going on, to monitor the execution of a plan, and to do all the tasks necessary to make the decision maker aware of what is going on, command and control systems could even support situational awareness, the level in the value chain traditionally limited to pure cognitive methods.|$|E

SGI computers started the high-end CGI-Computer-generated imagery animation stystems, but with faster computers {{and the growth of}} Linux-based systems, many others are on the market now. Toy Story, and Tarzan are two samples of movies which were made in CGI and then film-out. The most CGI work is done in 2K Display resolution files (about the size of QXGA), but 4K Display resolution is on the rise. A 2K movie requires a Storage Area Network storage several terabytes in size to be properly stored and played out.|$|E

50|$|KVM over IP devices can be {{implemented}} in different ways. With regards to video, PCI KVM over IP cards use a form of screen scraping where the PCI bus master KVM over IP card would access and copy out the screen directly from the graphics memory buffer, {{and as a result}} it must know which graphics chip it is working with, and what graphics mode this chip is currently in so that the contents of the buffer can be interpreted correctly as <b>picture</b> <b>data.</b> Newer techniques in OPMA management subsystem cards and other implementations get the video data directly using the DVI bus. Implementations can emulate either PS/2 or USB based keyboards and mice. An embedded VNC server is typically used for the video protocol in IPMI and Intel AMT implementations.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{available}} {{were some}} special commands for memory allocation and handling, like MEMORY and a parametric LOAD command, allowing, for example, to load a file containing [...] "raw" [...] <b>picture</b> <b>data</b> into video memory, {{causing it to}} be displayed, {{with a couple of}} BASIC instructions. Adding the right memory address(es) as parameter to the commands LOAD or SAVE would allow easy loading of raw uncompressed 16 KB screen pictures. CALLing another address gave a forced system reset (call 0), the famous [...] "Press Any Key" [...] (call &bb18) or for eliminating flicker in animation by allowing you to synchronize with the monitor's raster scan via [...] "sync frame-flyback" [...] (call &bd19); this was given its own dedicated command in Basic 1.1 - FRAME. With PEEK and POKE, CALL provided an interface to assembly language programming from BASIC.|$|E

With {{the implementation of}} the reform of the quality of higher education at the University of Oslo (UiO) in 2003, one of the aims was {{to take advantage of the}} information technology and give students at UiO a wider choice in teaching materials. As a result, funds were given to make web sites to cover parts of the curriculum. On this background, the ophthalmologic <b>picture</b> <b>data</b> base was created. The web site currently consists of 60 cases, and the intention is to keep expanding with the help of practitioners who report interesting cases. The web site has a wide range of cases, with differential diagnosis ranging from simple glaucoma to complex immunological diseases. All cases have pictures and texts comprising history, findings and diagnosis. Most of the cases are written from a General Practitioners perspective for the students to identify with the diagnostic process, but some of the more difficult cases are seen from an ophthalmologists point of view. All the case histories and pictures are taken from the internal data base of UllevÃ¥l Universitetssykehus. The ophthalmologic <b>picture</b> <b>data</b> base is currently being translated in to English.

However, this approach cannot benefit from usual tools to tackle problems such as image navigation within a large flow of very high resolution <b>pictures,</b> <b>data</b> completion and image mosaicing of small patches of the overflown area. This article presents the tools suite our laboratory has developed. In our case, we have developed home-made quad-rotor for low altitude imagery, equipped with up to three compact cameras on a stabilized platform.
