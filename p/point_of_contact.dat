5|$|Between 13 January and 3 April 1943, an {{estimated}} 500,000 Red Army soldiers {{took part in}} what {{was known as the}} Voronezh–Kharkov Offensive. In all, {{an estimated}} 6,100,000 Soviet soldiers were committed to the area, with another 659,000 out of action with wounds. In comparison, the Germans could account for 2,200,000 personnel on the Eastern Front, with another 100,000 deployed in Norway. As a result, the Red Army deployed around twice as many personnel as the Wehrmacht in early February. However, {{as a result of their}} over-extension and the casualties they had taken during their offensive, at the beginning of Manstein's counterattack the Germans could achieve a tactical superiority in numbers, including the number of tanks present—for example, Manstein's 350 tanks outnumbered Soviet armor almost seven to one at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact,</b> and were far better supplied with fuel.|$|E

The two primary roles for CFMI were to manage the program between GE and SNECMA, and to market, sell and service the engine at a single <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> for the customer.

5|$|An {{important}} role of EFS as a CAS-family member function is transmission of integrin-initiated signals from the extracellular matrix to downstream effectors, leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in motility and invasion. The SH3 domain is a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> with polyproline sequences on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). or the related kinase PTK2B, also known as RAFTK/Pyk2/CAKβ. Typically, phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of CAS proteins by FAK or PTK2B creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of a SRC-family protein, which then hyper-phosphorylates the substrate domain, allowing the CAS protein {{to function as a}} scaffold for other proteins including CRK proteins and C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAP1. PTP-PEST, a soluble protein tyrosine phosphatase that is ubiquitously expressed in mice both during embryonic development and in adult tissues, opposes FAK and PTK2B activity, as it dephosphorylates PTK2B, FAK and CAS family members, among other proteins. The PTP-PEST proline-rich sequence 332PPKPPR337 has been shown to interact directly with the SH3 domain of members of EFS and another CAS protein, NEDD9.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of the 3rd Air Division and later the Third Air Force, he was subordinate to United States Air Forces in Europe, but also {{had to deal with}} USAF headquarters and the Strategic Air Command. He was also designated the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>contact</b> for dealing with the British government. Despite his lowly rank of major general, he was able to hold his own in dealings with more senior British officers, and with senior British officials, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee. His command was understaffed, lacked a clear mission, and there was no agreement with the British government regarding base rights or financial responsibilities. Nor was it easy dealing with his Strategic Air Command colleagues like Archie J. Old, Jr., who were not renowned for diplomatic skill. Johnson's deft touch was perhaps exemplified by his order that the Royal Air Force Ensign be flown over US bases in the UK alongside the flag of the United States.|$|E
