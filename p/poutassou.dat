40|$|The Micromesistius genus {{consists}} of two commercially important species, M. <b>poutassou</b> found in the Northern Hemisphere and M. australis in the Southern Hemisphere. Genetic variation between and within the species was studied. A 579 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial COX Igene was analysed in 279 individuals of M. <b>poutassou</b> and 163 of M. australis. M. <b>poutassou</b> was sampled throughout most of its range, while M. australis was sampled from the New Zealand population. Reciprocal monophyly was achieved and there were four fixed differences between the species. The taxonomic status could not be confirmed or rejected by the genealogical species concept. The time since divergence was estimated to approximately 2 million years (My) with an externally derived clock rate by Bayesian methods and {{with the use of}} genetic distances. Congruent estimates were obtained with an additional data set consisting of cyt b sequences from GenBank with a different clock rate. The divergence time of 2 My was in disagreement with previous hypotheses regarding the historical biogeography based on fossil findings, which suggested the divergence to be much older. This would imply a very slow rate of evolution in Micromesistius. An alternative hypothesis that appeared more likely was that Micromesistius has penetrated into the southern hemisphere at least two times. Paleoceanographic and paleoclimaticrecords indicated that conditions that would increase the likelihood for transequatorialdispersals were evident ˜ 2 – 1. 6 million years ago. The COX I lineages of both species werefound to coalesce in the Pleistocene. Glacial cycles appears to have been an important factorin shaping the genealogies, based on evidence from neutrality tests for population growth andfrom signatures in the genetic diversity. The findings of private haplotypes and clear haplotypefrequency differences were, along with pairwise Fst values, indicating that M. <b>poutassou</b> from the Mediterranean Sea are genetically isolated from M. <b>poutassou</b> in the Barents Sea and west of the British Isles.

As {{a result of a}} hierarchical classification analysis four assemblages were detected: (1) the outer shelf group (50 - 150 m), characterised by Octopus vulgaris and Cepola macrophthalma; (2) the upper slope group (151 - 350 m), characterised by Micromesistius <b>poutassou,</b> with Plesionika heterocarpus and Parapenaeus longirostris as secondary species; (3) the middle slope group (351 - 640 m), characterised by M. <b>poutassou,</b> Nephrops norvegicus and Caelorhincus caelorhincus, and (4) the small seamount Seco de los Olivos (310 - 360 m), characterised by M. <b>poutassou,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus and Gadiculus argenteus, together with Chlorophthalmus agassizi, Stichopus regalis and Palinurus mauritanicus. The results also revealed significantly higher abundances in the Seco de los Olivos seamount, probably related to a higher food availability caused by strong localised currents and upwellings that enhanced primary production. Although depth proved to be the main structuring factor, others such as sediment type and food availability also appeared to be important.

An echosounder operating with 18, 38, 70, 120 and 200 kHz split-beam, hull-mounted transducers was employed. We analyzed the acoustic records in order to describe vertical and horizontal distribution patterns of fish larvae aggregations (mainly of the gadoid species blue whiting Micromesisitius <b>poutassou</b> and European hake Merluccius merluccius). Net sampling revealed that acoustic back-scattered energy at 38 and 70 kHz was roughly proportional to the density of Micromesistius <b>poutassou</b> larvae of 3. 5 mm and larger, while scattering due to zooplankton appear to be negligible at those frequencies. The results described herein suggest that echo-sounding data may provide a viable methodology for the study of spatial and temporal changes and trends in abundance of gadoid larvae, in particular blue whiting.

A total of 369 specimens of 24 different species of teleosts and 5 species of cephalopods were collected from different fishing areas of Sardinia. Larvae were detected and isolated by both visual inspection and enzymatic digestion. These methods allowed Anisakis type I and type II third-stage larvae and Hysterothylacium third-and fourth-stage larvae to be detected. The prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance were calculated. The results obtained showed the highest prevalence of Anisakidae in Zeus faber (100 %) and of Anisakis in Micromesistius <b>poutassou</b> (87. 5 %). The highest prevalence of Anisakis type I larvae was in M. <b>poutassou</b> (81. 2 %), and that of Anisakis type II larvae was in Todarodes sagittatus (20 %). The highest values for prevalence, mean intensity, and mean abundance for Hysterothylacium were found in Z. faber. These prevalences and the mean intensity and abundance were higher than those reported by different authors in other Mediterranean areas. This may be because the enzymatic digestive method used in this research resulted in higher recovery levels.

40|$|The {{abundance}} and behaviour of fish on and around coral reefs at Twin Mounds and Giant Mounds, carbonate mounds {{located on the}} continental shelf off Ireland (600 - 1100. m), were studied using two Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) dives. We recorded 30 fish taxa on the dives, together with three species of Scleractinia (Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum cristagalli) and a diverse range of other corals (Antipatharia, Alcyonacea, and Stylasteridae). Stands of live coral provided the only habitat in which Guttigadus latifrons was observed whereas Neocyttus helgae was found predominantly on structural habitats provided by dead coral. Significantly more fish were found on structurally complex coral rubble habitats than on flatter areas where coral rubble was clogged with sand. The most common species recorded was Lepidion eques (2136 individuals), which always occurred a few cm above bottom and was significantly more active on the reefs than on sedimentary habitats. Synaphobranchus kaupii (1157 indiv.)., N. helgae (198 indiv.) and Micromesistius <b>poutassou</b> (116 indiv.) were also common; S. kaupii did not exhibit habitat-related differences in behaviour, whilst N. helgae was more active over the reefs and other structured habitats whereas M. <b>poutassou</b> was more active with decreasing habitat complexity.

Likewise, the study of the gelling temperature showed values for the first temperature (“setting”) lower than the cod and pollock surimi setting temperature, and so it is recommended that the second heating temperature for Blue Whiting paste be lower...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{upwelling}} {{conditions on the}} trophic level of four planktofagous fish (Gadiculus argenteus, Capros aper and juveniles of Micromesistius <b>poutassou</b> and Merluccius merluccius) on the continental shelf off Northwestern Spain was assessed by coupling stomach content analyses and isotopic data. The study was performed during two consecutive years characterized by contrasting oceanographic conditions during the summer season; the first year (2012) had an intense and extended upwelling period, while the second (2013) had an intermittent and weak upwelling season. Sampling {{was carried out in}} autumn, after the summer upwelling, along a transect parallel to the coast on the continental shelf (130 - 180 m depth), following the main upwelling gradient towards the Northeast. In addition to stomach content sampling and isotopic analyses of fish muscle, the isotopic signature of benthic detritus and sub- superficial phytoplankton were also indentified to characterize the basal isotopic level. We hypothesize that differences in isotopic ratios under these contrasting upwelling intensities possibly originate from both changes in the isotopic ratios of basal levels and shifts in the feeding habits of planktofagous species. Basal ratios of carbon and nitrogen in benthic detritus showed neither interannual variability nor relation with the upwelling gradient. However, particulate organic matter (POM) had significantly higher δ 15 N and δ 13 C during the first year. Isotopic signature of the four species was significantly different among years but followed different patterns, only related to POM basal levels in the case of C. aper. The ratio of 15 N indicated that the four fish species considered had a trophic level of two, standing approximately 6 points over the basal levels and probably predating on consumer species. Stomach sampling evidenced that euphausiids constituted the majority of diet in G. gadiculus and juvenile M. merluccius and M. <b>poutassou</b> in both years. Euphausiid species would act then rather as consumers than predators, as a preliminary analysis of their isotopic signature confirmed (for the species Nyctiphanes couchii and Meganyctiphanes norvergica). While basal differences in isotopic ratios exist, our analyses suggest that shifts in feeding habits may have a major role in determining species isotopic positio...|$|E
40|$|Heat- and high-pressure-induced gels were {{prepared}} from blue whiting muscle (Micromesistius <b>poutassou</b> R.). Minced muscle was homogenized with salt (1 % NaCl), and response surface methodology {{was used to}} determine the influence of pressure, time, and temperature on the work of penetration. Two combinations of pressure-time-temperature were chosen to give the highest work of penetration, and samples were compared with a heat-induced gel. The following lots were subjected to chemical and rheological analysis: 200 MPa, 3 °C, 10 min (lot L); 375 MPa, 38 °C, 20 min (lot H); and atmospheric pressure, 37 °C, 30 min/ 90 °C 50 min (lot T). Breaking force, deformation, and cohesiveness were greater in gels of lot L. Hardness and water holding capacity were greatest in gels of lot T. Elasticity was greater in high-pressure-induced gels. The percentage of hydrophobic interactions, essentially linking actin molecules, was greater in gels of lot H than in gels of lots T and L. There were more cross-linkages in the heat-induced gels (lot T). Peer Reviewe...|$|E
