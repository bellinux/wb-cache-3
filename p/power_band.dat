5|$|For 1966 the Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit was increased to 3.0 litres from the 1.5 litres {{of the previous}} five seasons. McLaren considered and discounted British Racing Motors (BRM), Maserati, Coventry Climax and Oldsmobile engines before opting for a Ford V8 engine. This engine was originally designed for the Indianapolis 500, the premier single-seater oval track race in the United States, {{and had to be}} reduced in capacity from 4.2 litres to the 3.0 litre limit. This choice was partly motivated by the belief that it might bring financial support from Ford, although this never materialised. Ex BMW and Daimler-Benz engineer Klaus von Rucker was initially appointed to carry out the conversion of the engine in England. However, progress was slow so the project was transferred to Traco Engineering in California, United States, where extensive modifications were made to the internals under the oversight of McLaren's Gary Knutson. In its 4.2 litre form the Ford engine produced 470bhp and McLaren expected the reduced capacity version to produce about 335bhp. In fact, it produced 300bhp in a narrow <b>power</b> <b>band</b> and was further handicapped by its large size and weight; combined with the gearbox it weighed nearly as much as rival team Brabham's entire car. In order to allow time to further develop the Ford, McLaren also used a Serenissima M166 3.0 litre V8 engine for some of the races. This engine produced about 260bhp and required modifications to be made to the monocoque but was at least relatively light and compact. Four- and five-speed ZF transaxle gearboxes and a Borg & Beck clutch were employed.|$|E
25|$|The car's 3-phase AC {{induction}} {{electric motor}} produced 137 brake horsepower (102kW) at 7000 rpm. Like electric trains and all vehicles {{with an electric}} motor (and unlike a car powered by an internal combustion engine), the EV1 could deliver its full torque capacity throughout its <b>power</b> <b>band,</b> producing 110 pound-feet (149 newton-meters) of torque anywhere between 0 and 7000 rpm, allowing the omission of a manual or automatic gearbox. Power was delivered to the front wheels through a single-speed reduction integrated transmission.|$|E
25|$|Having had {{previous}} {{success with}} turbocharging Fiat Spiders, DeLorean {{entered into a}} contract with Legend Industries, based in Hauppauge, New York. DMC wanted to increase power without sacrificing fuel economy. DMC wanted a wide <b>power</b> <b>band</b> {{and did not want}} a surge of power similar to the Porsche 930 Turbo. Legend used twin IHI RHB52 turbos along with twin intercoolers. The results were an engine capable of accelerating smoothly in fifth gear from 1,500rpm to full turbo boost at 2,500rpm reaching 150mph at 6,500rpm.|$|E

25|$|Gear sets may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the <b>power</b> <b>band,</b> or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{aspects of}} the Storm were more popular with {{magazine}} test drivers. Many praised the wide <b>power</b> <b>band</b> of the engine. AutoWeek said, [...] "It revs quickly and easily.

[...] Automobile Magazine liked the handling, saying, [...] "It's a delight to negotiate twisty...roads with its firm yet compliant suspension." ...|$|E

Band 265–570MW (band II) at this pressure is not recommended and output over 640MW (band IV) is forbidden. On {{the day of the}} accident, turbine2 worked as the plant's power output regulator and due to this, its output power changed constantly. The turbine often operated in the band II regime, which is accompanied by pulsation and strokes in the water flow.|$|E

2500|$|For the C5 RS6 {{powertrain}} detail, {{the internal}} combustion engine is an all-aluminium alloy [...] twin-turbocharged ('biturbo'), double overhead camshaft, 5 valve per cylinder version of Audi's 4.2-litre 90° V8 petrol engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: BCY), developed and manufactured in Germany and the UK by quattro GmbH and Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). [...] With the addition of the two turbochargers (one per cylinder bank), the motive power output of the V8 engine was increased to [...] at 5,700 to 6,400rpm, and generated [...] of torque. [...] The combination of the 4.2-litre V8, variable inlet valve timing, and twin turbochargers gave the RS6 an exceptionally wide <b>power</b> <b>band,</b> with peak torque available from 1,950 to 5,600rpm.|$|E
2500|$|During 1986, General Motors {{acquired}} Group Lotus, the UK based engineering {{consulting and}} performance car manufacturing firm. The Corvette division approached Lotus {{with the idea}} of developing the world's fastest production car, {{to be based on the}} C4 generation Corvette. With input from GM, Lotus designed a new engine to fit in place of the L98 V8 that was powering the standard C4. The result was what GM dubbed the LT5, an aluminum-block V-8 with the same bore centers as the L98, but with four overhead camshafts, 32 valves. Lotus also designed a unique air management system for the engine to provide a wider <b>power</b> <b>band</b> by shutting off 8 of the 16 intake runners and fuel injectors when the engine was at part-throttle, while still giving the ZR-1 [...] when at wide open throttle.|$|E
2500|$|... saw {{the end of}} {{turbo-charging}} in Formula One. From this date, {{the formula}} was for 3.5-litre normally aspirated engines of no greater than 12 cylinders, which was {{a direct consequence of}} lobbying by Ferrari for the previous few years. The team {{went so far as to}} construct an Indycar, the Ferrari 637, as a threat to the FIA that if they did not get what they wanted, namely the allowance of V12 engines under the revised formula, they could take part in another series. Due to the expected extreme high revs and consequent narrow <b>power</b> <b>band</b> expected of the new engines, technical director John Barnard insisted upon the development of a revolutionary new gear-shifting arrangement– the paddle-operated, semi-automatic gearbox. In pre season testing, the experimental system proved extremely troublesome, with newly arrived driver Nigel Mansell being unable to compete more than a handful of laps, but nonetheless they managed a debut win at the opening round in Brazil. Horrendous reliability led to Berger being unable to score a point until a run of podiums at Monza, Estoril and Jerez including a win at Estoril. Mansell scored a memorable win at Budapest where he overtook world champion Ayrton Senna for the win after qualifying far down the field in twelfth. He then dedicated the race to the memory of Enzo Ferrari as the win came a year after the latter's death.|$|E

50|$|A narrow <b>power</b> <b>band</b> {{is often}} {{compensated}} {{for by a}} power-splitting device such as a clutch or torque converter to efficiently achieve {{a wide range of}} speeds.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether {{the interdependency between}} heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra is linear or non-linear. METHODS: Heart rate and sleep EEG signals were recorded in 8 healthy young men. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and EEG sleep recordings. Synchronization likelihood was computed over the first 3 non-rapid eye movement-rapid eye movement sleep cycles between normalized high frequency of RR intervals (RRI) and all electroencephalographic frequency bands. Comparison to surrogate data of different types was used to attest statistical significance of the coupling between RRI and EEG <b>power</b> <b>bands</b> and its linear or non-linear character. RESULTS: Synchronization likelihood values were statistically greater than univariate surrogate synchronization for all sleep bands both at {{the individual and the}} group levels. With reference to multivariate surrogates, synchronization values were statistically greater at the group level and, in a majority of cases, for individual comparison except for sigma and beta bands. CONCLUSIONS: While all electroencephalographic <b>power</b> <b>bands</b> are linked to normalized high frequency RRI band, this interdependency is non-linear for delta, theta and alpha bands. SIGNIFICANCE: Non-linear description is required to capture the full interdependent dynamics of HRV and sleep EEG <b>power</b> <b>bands.</b> Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.
