5|$|<b>Preload</b> {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the <b>preload</b> will be less. <b>Preload</b> can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle is proportional to the <b>preload,</b> described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The average cardiac output, {{using an}} average stroke volume of about 70mL, is 5.25 L/min, {{with a normal}} range of 4.0–8.0 L/min.

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension <b>preload</b> develops in the bolt and an equal compressive <b>preload</b> develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the <b>preload</b> in the clamped components, hence the <b>preload</b> acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|E

40|$|Vacuum <b>preloading</b> is {{a ground}} {{improvement}} technique in which effective stress in soil is increased by reducing pore-water pressure. To understand the pore-water pressure, effective stress changes and deformation mechanism of soft soil subjected to underwater vacuum <b>preloading,</b> theoretical analysis, centrifuge modelling and numerical modelling were carried out. Analytical solutions of average degree of radial consolidation of soft clay subjected to vacuum <b>preloading</b> were developed. Well resistance, smear effect, vacuum loss, large lateral deformation and variation of soil stiffness and permeability are considered. Centrifuge tests of clay {{with a single}} vertical sand drain and a vertical sand drain group at a spacing of 8 D (D is drain diameter) were carried out. Subsurface displacement was measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and photogrammetry. Coupled axis-symmetric and coupled three-dimensional finite-element analyses were carried out to model consolidation behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum <b>preloading</b> with a vertical drain group. Numerical experiments were carried out to investigate the behaviour of soft clay subjected to underwater vacuum <b>preloading,</b> on-land vacuum <b>preloading</b> and underwater surcharge <b>preloading</b> under idealized boundary conditions. Both measured and computed rates of consolidation with a vertical drain group were greater than those with a single vertical drain. Measured surface settlement near a vertical drain was 80 % of that away from the vertical drain. Measured maximum inward lateral displacement between vertical drains in centrifuge tests was about 5 % surface settlement. At the centre of a vertical drain group, final lateral earth pressure coefficient {{at the end of}} underwater and on-land vacuum <b>preloading</b> is greater than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest, while that in underwater surcharge <b>preloading</b> is less than lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest. Computed inward lateral displacement {{at the edge of a}} treated zone is about 27 % of surface settlement by underwater and on-land vacuum <b>preloading.</b> The magnitude of computed lateral displacement by underwater or on-land vacuum <b>preloading</b> is 16 % of that by underwater surcharge <b>preloading.</b> At a distance of 18. 5 m from the treated zone, the magnitude of computed lateral displacement by underwater and on-land vacuum <b>preloading</b> is 22 % of maximum surface settlement, while that by underwater surcharge <b>preloading</b> is 1 % of maximum surface settlement...|$|R

25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A <b>preload</b> is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a <b>preload</b> on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{document}} is to verify the behaviour of injection bolts and in the final stage, to determine the bearing strength of injection resin. A two component resin Araldit SW 404 was used {{in combination with the}} hardener HY 2404. The used bolt/nut assemblies were in accordance with a group of standards EN 14399. Specimens, alteration of bolts and washers are all in accordance with EN 1090 - 2. The testing was carried out in accordance with EN 1090 - 2 and recommendations of ECCS N° 79. The following 21 types of connections were tested: shear, injection shear, <b>preloaded</b> and <b>preloaded</b> injection connections. We carried out the tension loading tests, cyclic tests and creep tests on these types of connections. At tension loading tests the slip loads were determined. The bearing strength of resin from these results was calculated to be 200 MPa. Cyclic tests were carried out at various deformation amplitudes and at various frequencies. Outstanding behaviour of shear injection connections at cyclic loading was observed. The research also showed very rigid behaviour of shear injection connection and <b>preloaded</b> injection connections in comparison with shear connections and <b>preloaded</b> connections, respectively. Consequently, this research is in excellent agreement with already known findings. We showed that characteristic resistance of <b>preloaded</b> injection connection according to SIST EN 1993 - 1 - 8 is reached at slip of 0, 2 mm.
