40|$|A {{phagocytosis}} assay {{was used}} to measure the prevalence of cytophilic antibodies directed against Plasmodium falciparum merozoites in three groups of subjects from Africa: preimmune (individuals aged 2 to 15 years), immune (adults), and postimmune (African adults residing out of the endemic area). Results show that levels of antibodies promoting merozoite phagocytosis (APMP) increase slowly and gradually with age. The production of high levels of APMP requires about 15 years of continuous exposure to malaria and concurs with the ability of exposed individuals to control a high parasitemia and its pathological consequences, such as spleen enlargement. In the absence of antigenic restimulation for more than 1 year (postimmune subjects), APMP titers decrease abruptly. No correlation was found between APMP levels and levels of antimalarial antibodies detected by fluorescence and precipitation assays. Low levels of APMP in subjects susceptible to clinical manifestations of the disease and high levels in subjects in a state of <b>premunition</b> suggest that the results of the merozoite phagocytosis assay more closely reflect clinical immunity than do other markers of antimalarial humoral immunity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Madagascar {{has been}} known for having bio-geo-ecological {{diversity}} which is reflected by a complex malaria epidemiology ranging from hyperendemic to malaria-free areas. Malaria-related attacks and infection are frequently recorded both in children and adults living in areas of low malaria transmission. To integrate this variability in the national malaria control policy, extensive epidemiological studies are required to up-date previous records and adjust strategies. Methods A longitudinal malaria survey was conducted from July 1996 to June 2005 among an average cohort of 214 villagers in Saharevo, located at 900 m above the sea. Saharevo is a typical eastern foothill site at the junction between a costal wet tropical area (equatorial malaria pattern) and a drier high-altitude area (low malaria transmission). Results Passive and active malaria detection revealed that malaria transmission in Saharevo follows an abrupt seasonal variation. Interestingly, malaria was confirmed in 45 % (1, 271 / 2, 794) of malaria-presumed fevers seen at the health centre. All four Plasmodia that infect humans were also found: Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale. Half of the malaria-presumed fevers could be confirmed over the season with the highest malaria transmission level, although less than a quarter in lower transmission time, highlighting the importance of diagnosis prior to treatment intake. P. falciparum malaria has been predominant (98 %). The high prevalence of P. falciparum malaria affects more particularly under 10 years old children in both symptomatic and asymptomatic contexts. Children between two and four years of age experienced an average of 2. 6 malaria attacks with P. falciparum per annum. Moreover, estimated incidence of P. falciparum malaria tends to show that half of the attacks (15 attacks) risk to occur during the first 10 years of life for a 60 -year-old adult who would have experienced 32 malaria attacks. Conclusion The incidence of malaria decreased slightly with age but remained important among children and adults in Saharevo. These results support that a <b>premunition</b> against malaria is slowly acquired until adolescence. However, this claims for a weak <b>premunition</b> among villagers in Saharevo and by extension in the whole eastern foothill area of Madagascar. While the Malagasy government turns towards malaria elimination plans nowadays, choices and expectations to up-date and adapt malaria control strategies in the foothill areas are discussed in this paper. </p...|$|E
40|$|Paired {{blood samples}} from 99 Tanzanian infants were {{analysed}} {{to examine the}} infection dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum {{during the first year}} of life. Infecting parasites were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the polymorphic gene for the merozoite surface protein 2 and subsequent analysis according to the resulting restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern. The same samples served as controls in a parallel case-control study for which an additional blood sample was taken from each child during a fever episode. The relationship of the number of concurrent infections (multiplicity) with age and morbidity was analysed and results were compared to those of a similar study on older children between 2 and 7 years of age, carried out in the same village at the same time. The mean of 2 infecting genotypes per positive blood sample from community surveys was low compared to that in older children, and there was no significant age-dependency of multiplicity within the first year of life. Multiplicity of infection in fever cases was also independent of age. In infants, multiplicity was positively associated with parasite density and risk of clinical malaria, in contrast to the situation in older children (> 2 years).

Mice were vaccinated via intramuscular injection of multimodal vaccine or uninfected irradiated tumor cells at seven and 14 days after tumor establishment. While there was no survival difference between groups vaccinated with cell-based vaccine applied following tumor injection, a <b>premunition</b> prime/boost vaccination strategy produced a significant survival advantage in both groups and sustained immune response to an intracranial rechallenge of the same tumor. The syngeneic but unrelated H 6 hepatocellular tumor cell line grew unrestricted in vaccinated mice, indicative of vaccine-mediated specific immunity to Neuro 2 a tumors. Longitudinal analyses of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed a primary adaptive T cell response involving both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell subsets. Spleen cell mononuclear preparations from vaccinated mice were significantly more cytotoxic to Neuro 2 a tumor cells than spleen cells from control mice as demonstrated in a four-hour in vitro cytotoxicity assay.

40|$|Abstract. Thirty adult {{patients}} with cerebral malaria (CM) were recruited for this study. Two clinical groups {{were used as}} controls: those with mild malaria (n 20) and asymptomatic volunteers (n 20). Thick and thin blood smears were examined for detection of Plasmodium falciparum and estimating infection intensity. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using allele-specific primers for merozoite surface protein gene {{was used to determine}} the parasite diversity of Plasmodium falciparum causing CM. Plasmodium falciparum was detected in blood smears of all malaria patients. No significant difference in parasite count was found between the groups. Thirteen (65 %) of the asymptomatic volunteers had a positive PCR for P. falciparum. Multiple alleles were found in 17 (58. 6 %) {{patients with}} CM, but only in 7 (35. 6 %) with uncomplicated malaria. Multiple alleles were also found in 6 (46. 2 %) of the 13 PCR-positive asymp-tomatic individuals. We could not identify a specific strain or strains of P. falciparum that showed a significant association with disease severity. Therefore, we assume that the development of CM in adults residing in endemic areas is more dependent on strain multiplicity rather than on a specific strain or strains of P. falciparum, and that the parasite intensity has no relationship with disease severity. Asymptomatic adults may repeatedly be exposed to low levels {{of a wide range of}} different strains during low transmission season and acquire sub-patent parasitemia. This may also confer <b>premunition</b> that renders them relatively resistant to CM...|$|E
40|$|Antimalarial {{interventions}} in infancy may impair {{the development of}} immunity to malaria and of <b>premunition</b> in particular and thereby may increase the morbidity after extended prophylaxis. <b>Premunition</b> as reflected by a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) with *Plasmodium falciparum *(*P. falciparum*) conferring by at least partially cross-reactive and relatively short-lived immune mechanisms protects from subsequent malaria attacks and is considered to correlate with the degree of immunity in an individual. However, there is concern that antimalarial {{interventions in}} infants may reduce the MOI and delay the risk of malaria to older children. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine if IPTi with Sulfadoxin-Pyrimethamin (SP) affects MOI in children at this age and whether this influence differs with prospective endemicity. The study was based on two related, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled IPTi trials conducted in Tamale and in Afigya Sekyere district, Ghana, in the years 2003 to 2005, reducing malaria morbidity by 20 % to 33 % in the first year of life. 2270 children were recruited at three months of age and followed up actively in three-monthly (Tamale) or monthly (Afigya Sekyere) intervals, and passively, until 24 months of age. IPTi-SP or placebo was administered at ages 3, 9, and 15 months. MOI was assessed at 15 months of age, i. e., six months after they had received the second dose of IPTi- 2. Known factors influencing MOI and potential confounders were tested in a cross-sectional survey. Furthermore in a longitudinal study MOI and the prospective risk (month 15 - 24) of malaria and anemia were assessed. At 15 months of age MOI was very similar for children who had received IPTi or placebo (means, 2. 25 vs. 2. 33; P = 0. 55) as was the proportion of polyclonal infections (69. 6 % vs. 69. 7 %; P = 0. 99). Adjusting for study site, current and prior malaria, parasite density, and season did not change this finding. The prospective risk of malaria was significantly increased for cases of *P. falciparum* infections at 15 months of age both in Tamale (IDR = 1, 48; 95 % KI: 1, 3 � 1, 7) and in Afigya Sekyere (IDR = 1, 87; 95 % KI: 1, 6 � 2, 3). However the extend of the increase of risk depended on MOI. In Tamale the prospective risk for malaria was 33 % lower for children being infected polyclonaly than for children being infected monoclonaly (IDR = 0, 67; 95 % KI: 0, 5 � 0, 9). In Afigya Sekyere the results were antipodal: a polyclonal infection increased the risk for prospective malaria for 77 % (IDR = 1, 77; 95 % KI: 1, 3 � 2, 5). The present study showed that IPTi-SP in holoendemic areas appears to have no impact on the MOI of up to the age of 15 months. At the same time the study showed that in succession of a polyclonal infection morbidity caused by malaria is reduced. Contrariousobservations in Afigya Sekyere might be explained by the reduction of actually occurred exposition to *P. falciparum* infections caused by a slightly different study protocol. Thus IPTi as an antimalarial intervention in infancy has to be recommended also under consideration of the development of immunity to malaria. Regarding the findings it is proposed furthermore to use MOI as a parameter to evaluate modified IPTi concepts or other antimalarial intervention in infancy and their long-term effects...|$|E
40|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have evolved}} {{the ability to}} co-exist {{for long periods of}} time within other species in the absence of overt pathology. Evolutionary biologists have proposed benefits to the microbe from 'asymptomatic persistent infections', most commonly invoking increased likelihood of transmission by longer-lived hosts. Typically asymptomatic persistent infections arise from strong containment by the immune system, accompanied by protective immunity; such 'vaccination' from overt disease in the presence of a non-sterilizing immune response is termed <b>premunition</b> or concomitant immunity. Here we consider another potential benefit of persistence and concomitant immunity to the parasite: the 'exclusion' of competing super-infecting strains, which would favor transmission of the original infecting organism. To investigate this in the protozoan parasite Leishmania major, a superb model for the study of asymptomatic persistence, we used isogenic lines of comparable virulence bearing independent selectable markers. One was then used to infect genetically resistant mice, yielding infections which healed and progressed to asymptomatic persistent infection; these mice were then super-infected with the second marked line. As anticipated, super-infection yielded minimal pathology, showing that protective immunity against disease pathology had been established. The relative abundance of the primary and super-infecting secondary parasites was then assessed by plating on selective media. The data show clearly that super-infecting parasites were able to colonize the immune host effectively, achieving numbers comparable to and sometimes greater than that of the primary parasite. We conclude that induction of protective immunity does not guarantee the Leishmania parasite exclusive occupation of the infected host. This finding has important consequences to the maintenance and generation of parasite diversity in the natural Leishmania infectious cycle alternating between mammalian and sand fly hosts...|$|E
40|$|Consumption of {{chloroquine}} (CQ) and subtherapeutic drug {{levels in}} blood {{are considered to}} be widespread in areas where malaria is endemic. A cross-sectional study was performed with 405 Nigerian children to assess factors associated with the presence of CQ in blood and to examine correlations of drug levels with malaria parasite species and densities. Infections with Plasmodium species and parasite densities were determined by microscopy and PCR assays. Whole-blood CQ concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, and P. ovale were observed in 80, 16, and 9 % of the children, respectively, and CQ was detected in 52 % of the children. CQ concentrations were > 17 and < 100 nmol/liter in 25 % of the children, 100 to 499 nmol/liter in 14 % of the children, and ≥ 500 nmol/liter in 13 % of the children. Young age, attendance at health posts, and absence of parasitemia were factors independently associated with CQ in blood. With increasing concentrations of CQ, the prevalence of P. falciparum infection and parasite densities decreased. However, at concentrations corresponding to those usually attained during regular prophylaxis (≥ 500 nmol/liter), 62 % of children were still harboring P. falciparum parasites. In contrast, no infection with P. malariae and only one infection with P. ovale were observed in children with CQ concentrations of ≥ 100 nmol/liter. These data show the high prevalence of subcurative CQ concentrations in Nigerian children and confirm the considerable degree of CQ resistance in that country. Subtherapeutic drug levels are likely to further promote CQ resistance and may impair the development and maintenance of <b>premunition</b> in areas where malaria is endemic...|$|E
40|$|Since 1985, {{chloroquine}} resistance (CR) {{became evident}} in Cameroon, and rapidly {{spread out over}} the country. Despite such a situation, chloroquine is still the first antimalarial drug. CR follow up was mostly carried out by in vivo tests among schoolchildren. In this population, of a mean 9 yrs of age, a CR rate of 30 to 45 % was reported. However, this may not show the true level of CR, because of the interaction of immunity in controlling parasite growth. Therefore, in southern Cameroon, we studied the activity of 25 mg/kg over 3 days of chloroquine and amodiaquine in treating asymptomatic children ranging from 1 to 15 yrs, with parasite density > 1000 /microl. Following chloroquine treatment, children with treatment failure by D 7 in the 0 - 2, 3 - 4, 5 - 9 and 10 - 15 yrs age groups were : 26 - 37 (71 %), 9 / 21 (43 %), 24 / 43 (56 %) and 12 / 30 (40 %). Four infections were RIII, all in the 0 - 2 yrs group. 41 of the 60 children with a D 7 negative blood smear were seen again at D 14 : 19 of these (46 %) were positive. Following amodiaquine, children with treatment failure by D 7 were : 3 / 28 (11 %), 2 / 20 (10 %), 1 / 17 (6 %) and 0 / 6.

40|$|Abstract Background Development and {{deployment}} {{of an effective}} malaria vaccine would complement existing malaria control measures. A blood stage malaria vaccine candidate, Merozoite Surface Protein- 3 (MSP 3), produced as a long synthetic peptide, {{has been shown to}} be safe in non-immune and semi-immune adults. A phase Ib dose-escalating study was conducted to assess the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity in children aged 12 to 24 months in Korogwe, Tanzania (ClinicalTrials. gov number: NCT 00469651). Methods This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose escalation phase Ib trial, in which children were given one of two different doses of the MSP 3 antigen (15 μg or 30 μg) or a control vaccine (Engerix B). Children were randomly allocated either to the MSP 3 candidate malaria vaccine or the control vaccine administered at a schedule of 0, 1, and 2 months. Immunization with lower and higher doses was staggered for safety reasons starting with the lower dose. The primary endpoint was safety and reactogenicity within 28 days post-vaccination. Blood samples were obtained at different time points to measure immunological responses. Results are presented up to 84 days post-vaccination. Results A total of 45 children were enrolled, 15 in each of the two MSP 3 dose groups and 15 in the Engerix B group. There were no important differences in reactogenicity between the two MSP 3 groups and Engerix B. Grade 3 adverse events were infrequent; only five were detected throughout the study, all of which were transient and resolved without sequelae. No serious adverse event reported was considered to be related to MSP 3 vaccine. Both MSP 3 dose regimens elicited strong cytophilic IgG responses (subclasses IgG 1 and IgG 3), the isotypes involved in the monocyte-dependant mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum parasite-killing. The titers reached are similar to those from African adults having reached a state of <b>premunition.</b> Furthermore, vaccination induced seroconversion in all vaccinees. Conclusion The MSP 3 malaria vaccine candidate was safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in children aged 12 – 24 months living in a malaria endemic community. Given the vaccine's safety and its induction of cytophilic IgG responses, its efficacy against P. falciparum infection and disease needs to be evaluated in Phase 2 studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of illness and death in Papua New Guinea (PNG), mainly {{affecting}} children under 5 years of age. The current first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria is a combination therapy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and chloroquine (CQ) or amodiaquine, however, frequent treatment failures have been reported shortly after its implementation. Drug resistance has mainly been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in five different genes. Different studies have indicated that mutations associated with drug resistance incur fitness costs to the parasite in absence of drug pressure. Among these are reports from different countries where a decreasing prevalence of mutations associated with CQ resistance was observed after CQ has been suspended as first line treatment. As it is experimentally difficult to estimate the fitness of Plasmodium parasites, a surrogate marker is needed to quantify fitness costs associated with drug resistance mutations. We hypothesised that the parasites’ survival within the human host can be used as surrogate marker for parasite fitness. In a pilot study we determined the drug resistance-associated haplotypes of parasite clones at 25 loci on 4 marker genes, and compared their prevalence between newly acquired and chronic infections. A reduced frequency of a 7 -fold mutated haplotype and increased frequency of a 5 -fold mutated haplotype in long term persistent infections indicated an impaired survival of highly mutated parasites and suggested that the duration of infections is a promising marker for parasite fitness that deserved further investigation. A further approach to define duration of infections more precisely was undertaken with samples from a longitudinal field survey in PNG. A cohort of 269 1 - 4. 5 years old children was followed over a period of 16 months. This provided consecutive blood samples collected in 2 -monthly follow-up visits plus a blood sample from each morbid episode. All samples were genotyped for the polymorphic marker gene merozoite surface protein 2 (msp 2) in order to distinguish individual parasite clones within a host. The persistence of genotypes in consecutive blood samples of each child was determined. Unexpected high numbers of antimalarial treatments given in the course of this study led to a high turn-over rate of parasite clones and prevented the establishment of asymptomatic long-term infections. The shortage of long untreated periods in our study participants hampered the determination of a novel molecular parameter termed “duration of infection” for each individual parasite clone. This parameter could have been useful for modelling the transmission success and fitness of drug resistant versus drug sensitive parasite clones. We concluded that this approach requires a cohort of semi-immune individuals where treatment is given rarely, e. g. older children or adults, where P. falciparum infections less frequently cause morbid episodes. The high incidence of morbidity in our study cohort allowed us to investigate molecular parameters that have an impact on the development of a subsequent clinical episode. We found that in children > 3 years, a higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) at baseline reduced the risk of a P. falciparum episode. These results are in agreement with previous reports and support the concept of <b>premunition.</b> Furthermore, we studied the impact of co-infecting Plasmodium species on MOI and found an increased MOI in the presence of a heterologous species. This can be explained by the observation of reduced parasite densities in mixed-species infections, leading to a decreased need for treatment and thus facilitating the accumulation of multiple clones. Our results provide further evidence for interactions among co-infecting P. falciparum clones as well as among co-infecting Plasmodium species. During the 16 months field survey all morbid episodes were treated with Coartem®. Analysis of msp 2 genotyping results revealed an unexpected high number of Coartem® treatment failures. After confirmation of recrudescent parasites with 2 additional marker genes and exclusion of host genetic factors to be responsible for treatment failures, the most likely explanation for the frequently observed Coartem® failures was a combination of poor adherence to the treatment regimen and a lack of fat supplementation which is required for absorption of the drug. Our results disagree with findings from a clinical trial reporting Coartem® to be highly effective in PNG. In contrast, our observations from a non-trial setting highlight potential problems of Coartem® usage in routine clinical practice. In the course of this thesis, genotyping techniques for merozoite surface proteins (msp) 1 and 2 were optimized and applied. Using these high resolution typing techniques based on capillary electrophoresis, we investigated the effect of transmission intensity on diversity and complexity of msp 1 and msp 2 in samples from PNG and Tanzania. We observed a greater MOI and a greater number of distinct alleles in samples from Tanzania. Genetic diversity was greater for msp 2 than for msp 1. In both these areas of different malaria endemicity msp 2 was found to be superior for distinguishing individual parasite clones. The probability of two infections carrying by chance the same msp 2 allele was lower than this probability calculated for msp 1. Based on the frequency distribution of msp 2 alleles and on the distribution of observed numbers of infections, we estimated the true MOI adjusted for the probability of multiple infections sharing the same allele. For our high resolution typing technique this adjustment made little difference to the estimated mean MOI compared to the observed mean MOI. A central aim of this thesis was to measure molecular parameters of infection dynamics. These can be determined from genotyping longitudinal sets of samples. Some of these parameters were successfully determined: MOI, force of infection (FOI), and detectability. Other parameters such as natural elimination rates and persistence of infections could not be determined due to frequent treatments. We estimated detectability of parasite clones based on samples collected 24 hours apart and investigated its impact on the MOI and FOI. Imperfect detection of parasites occurs as a consequence of sequestration or when parasite densities fluctuate around the detection limit. We found that in our study participants detectability was high. This was likely an effect of high parasite densities in children of this age. The benefit of short-term sampling on measures of MOI and FOI was marginal. We concluded that in future studies carried out in this age group, taking repeated samples 24 hours apart has limited benefit and does not justify the additional costs, work load and discomfort for the study participants. This project contributed to our understanding of the infections dynamics of P. falciparum and the interactions between parasites clones and Plasmodium species. We provided further insights into determinants of malaria episodes and highlighted the potential usefulness of the parameter “duration of infection” as surrogate marker to estimate fitness costs of drug resistance. This thesis provided findings that are relevant for malaria control strategies and treatment guidelines. ...|$|E
