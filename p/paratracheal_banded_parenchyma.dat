40|$|AbstractAjisamat, an herb {{commonly}} {{used as an}} aphrodisiac in the Malaysian traditional medicine, corresponds to two different species from different families - Salacia macrophylla Blume, Celastraceae, and Prismatomeris glabra (Korth.) Valeton, Rubiaceae. Macromorphological inspection of the vegetative parts both plants reveals only a slight difference in {{the arrangement of the}} petioles. Microscopic investigation of the plants roots used as crude drugs revealed however distinctive anatomical features. Prismatic calcium oxalate crystals and <b>banded</b> <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> are characteristics of S. macrophylla while P. glabra displays an abundance as crystals. Other features such as vessels diameters and arrangements are also of diagnostic importance. Some of these characters were also identified in the powder of thes e plant materials and proposed for diagnostic purpose. The values for extraction of ethanol and water as well as total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-soluble ash and sulfated ash were determined for both plants. Phytochemical studies were carried out on hexane and chloroform extracts of S. macrophylla and methanolic extract of P. glabra. S. macrophylla was shown to contain highly oxidized pentacyclic triterpenes while P. glabra contains anthraquinones. The pharmacognostical and phytochemical information can be utilised as the identification tools for Salacia macrophylla and Prismatomeris glabr...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practices}} of collection and processing of herbal materials by traditional practitioners (mostly Malays) in Perak, Malaysia, were reviewed {{in order to}} evaluate how these practices could possibly {{have an impact on}} the quality of the final products. The documentation was done through a structured interview survey conducted on 56 practitioners selected from each district of Perak. A majority of the selected practitioners were of the older generation. The method of gathering the plant materials combines collection from the wild, small scale cultivation as well as purchasing from grocery shops or other practitioners. The most commonly used plant parts are roots and leaves. The initial processing practices generally involve slicing of the raw materials into smaller pieces, drying under direct sunlight and grinding. The materials are commonly stored loosely packed, unprotected from light or pest. In total these practitioners use 184 types of plant according to their vernacular names. An analysis of the data showed that the plant known as Ajisamat corresponds to two different species from different families - Salacia macrophylla Blume (Celastraceae) and Prismatomeris glabra (Rubiaceae). Therefore pharmacognostical studies were undertaken to determine identity and quality criteria for these plants. Macromorphological inspection of the vegetative parts of the two plants reveals only a slight difference in the arrangement of the petioles. However, a microscopic investigation of the plants roots revealed distinctive anatomical features. Prismatic calcium oxalate crystals and <b>banded</b> <b>paratracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> seen in the root section were characteristics of S. macrophylla while P. glabra is characterised by an abundance of raphide crystals in the root. Other features like the differences of vessels diameters and arrangements were also of diagnostic importance for identification of the plants. Some of these characters were also identified in the powder of these plants and proposed for diagnostic purpose...|$|R

Among the neogean genera of the Sapindaceae Talisia is readily recognized by the combination of moderately few vessels, uniseriate or bi-seriate homocellular rays, aliformconfluent to <b>banded</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> the cells often containing rhombic crystals, and thick-walled fibres with a narrow lumen. The wood structure of the species is much alike, {{and it is not}} possible to identify a wood specimen to species on wood structure alone.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the wood of the genera Castilla, Helicostylis, Maquira, Naucleopsis, Olmedia, Perebea and Pseudolmedia, considered to belong in the Olmedieae (cf. Berg 1972) is described. The diversity in anatomical structure between the genera is small, {{and it is hard}} to distinguish Maquira, Perebea and Pseudolmedia from each other. Castilla can be recognized by its thinwalled and wide-lumined fibres, Helicostylis by its parenchyma distribution, Naucleopsis (usually) by its more numerous vessels with a smaller diameter. A more marked difference is shown by the monotypic genus Olmedia with apotracheal <b>banded</b> <b>parenchyma</b> instead of the paratracheal aliform to confluent-banded parenchyma of the other genera. Septate fibres, which are characteristic for the other genera – some species of Helicostylis excepted – are nearly completely absent in Olmedia. This structural difference is considered as an argument in favour of the exclusion of Olmedia from the tribe Olmedieae (Berg 1977) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{anatomy of}} the African monospecific genus Colletoecema E. Petit (Rubiaceae) is documented and illustrated (including wood anatomy, pollen morphology, gynoecial and exotestal structure). Morphological and anatomical comparison shows that Colletoecema differs in many aspects from the Psychotrieae (e. g., wood anatomy, seed structure). Consequently, the genus' provisional position in the Psychotrieae cannot be maintained. Morindeae, the second tribe Colletoecema has been associated with, has a different gynoecial structure. The oily endosperm and large embryo of Colletoecema is found in several genera that often were or still {{are included in the}} Psychotrieae or Morindeae (Trichostachys, Saldinia, Ronabea, and Lasianthus). However, they differ in several other aspects, which makes a close relationship doubtful. Colletoecema exhibits a unique combination of characters including axillary inflorescences, <b>banded</b> <b>parenchyma</b> in the wood, ovules attached around the middle of the septum, bilocular pyrenes, seeds with oily endosperm and large embryo, and verrucate exotestal thickenings, not encountered elsewhere in the Rubioideae. A cladistic analysis based on nucleotide sequence variation in the rps 16 intron (chloroplast DNA) confirms that Colletoecema is related neither to Psychotrieae nor to Morindeae. Colletoecema appears as a sister genus of Ophiorrhiza in a weakly supported clade among the basalmost clades of the subfamily Rubioideae, but there is very little morphological support for this relationship. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 13 collections of 8 species of Ascarina. Wood anatomy is maximally primitive in most respects; moderate exception {{occurs in the}} imperforate tracheary elements, which range from tracheidlike (A. solmsiana) to fiber-tracheids (septate in two species). Perforation plates are scalariform, average more than 100 bars per plate, and have bordered bars. Even more significantly, portions of the primary walls in perforations characteristically fail to dissolve; these pit membrane portions range from nearly intact (much like the pit membranes in pits on end walls of tracheids of vesselless dicotyledons) to remnant strands or flakes. Dissolution of pit membranes in perforations is apparently inhibited by deposition of resinlike substances in some species; the rugose surfaces formed by these deposits may account for a report of vesturing on vessel walls of Ascarina. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with only very small expressions of diversification; apotracheal <b>banded</b> <b>parenchyma</b> is, however, present in A. swamyana. Wood of Ascarina is highly mesomorphic. With age of plant, vessels increase in diameter, vessel elements and fiber-tracheids increase in length, and rays become wider and have {{a higher proportion of}} procumbent cells; uniseriate rays decrease in abundance. The implications of wood anatomy data on generic distinctions within the family and on the systematic position of Chloranthaceae will be examined when monographs on woods of the other genera have been completed...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the anatomical structure of phloem and xylem growth rings {{as well as}} the dormant cambium in relation to vitality in 81 adult silver fir trees (Abies alba Mill.).

40|$|AbstractWood {{anatomical}} data {{is presented}} for 29 southern African shrubby species representing eight genera (Aspalathus, Calobota, Crotalaria, Leobordea, Lotononis, Rafnia, Wiborgia, Wiborgiella) of the predominantly African tribe Crotalarieae (Fabaceae). The taxa examined share short vessel elements, exclusively simple perforation plates and vestured intervessel pits, i. e. the wood traits that are typical {{for many other}} genera of Papilionoideae. The loss of helical thickenings may {{be considered as a}} synapomorphy for Crotalarieae, with a reversal to this character state within Lotononis. Generally, the pattern of wood structure diversity within the Crotalarieae is related more to the growth habits of the plants and probably to environmental factors than to their taxonomy or phylogenetic relationships. All genera (except Crotalaria) and practically all species studied showed diagonal to dendritic arrangement of vessel groups, up to their fusion into large dendritic aggregations in Calobota species from arid (non-fynbos) regions. Some species from karroid scrubs (Calobota angustifolia, Calobota cytisoides) and fynbos (Aspalathus excelsa, Aspalathus linearis, Aspalathus nigra) show no dendritic vessel pattern, however. The <b>banded</b> axial <b>parenchyma</b> appears independently in three lineages of Crotalarieae, i. e. in Aspalathus+Wiborgia+Wiborgiella, Rafnia, and in crown species of Calobota. Lotononis s. str. and Leobordea show unbranched or weakly branched coarse vestures in their intervessel pits, whereas other taxa examined share the presence of vestures, appearing as strongly branched fine protuberances. Micromorphological characters of vestured intervessel pits are likely to be useful for the systematics of Crotalarieae...|$|R
40|$|Fifty-one Brazilian {{species and}} {{varieties}} of Swartzia Schreber and eight other genera from the tribe Swartzieae were examined. Features {{with the greatest}} diagnostic value for the tribe are intervascular pit size, ray width and frequency, storied structure, axial parenchyma strand length, <b>parenchyma</b> <b>band</b> width, and vessel diameter. We analyzed the wood anatomical data using average linkage cluster analysis and canonical discriminant analysis. With weighted features, cluster analysis grouped the species and varieties of Swartzia into four distinct groups and tribe Swartzieae into seven groups. With unweighted features for both Swartzia and Swartzieae, the canonical discriminant analysis showed that linear combinations of the variables storied structure, number of tiers per millimetre, axial parenchyma strand length, ray height, intervas-cular pit size, and exclusively uniseriate rays were good discriminators among the groups.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{alliance between}} Gaertnera and Pagamea (Rubiaceae-Rubioideae), two genera from the Old and New World, respectively, is investigated {{on the basis}} of wood anatomy and pollen morphology. Nowadays, the main point of discussion about the taxonomic position of these genera is whether they belong to the Psychotrieae or constitute a tribe Gaertnereae characterised by their secondarily superior ovary and sheathing stipules. Both the wood and pollen of the genus pair are found to show specific features absent in other genera of the Psychotrieae, e. g. <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands</b> in the xylem and endexine thickenings on the polar sites of the pollen apertures, Nevertheless Gaertnera and Pagamea share many other characters with the Psychotrieae. Wood and pollen convincingly demonstrate the very close affinity of the two genera. The sister pair differs in so many features from other Psychotrieae, that Gaertnera and Pagamea should constitute at least a subtribe Gaertnerinae, formally recognized here. The general lack of profound studies on the affinities within the very large tribe Psychotrieae makes further comments on the taxonomic relationships of the Gaertnerinae difficult. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Velvet {{mesquite}} (Prosopis velutina Woot.) is {{a common}} tree in semi-arid, southwestern U. S. savanna ecosystems. While there are studies that examine some of the physiological and ecological aspects of this tree (response to fire, net ecosystem exchange, encroachment into grasslands, yearly growth through dendrometer bands, among others), the wood anatomical features of a growth ring, suitability for dendrochronological research, life history, and above-ground biomass through time are knowledge gaps that can be filled. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine these gaps in order to better understand the role of velvet mesquite in these ecosystems. Wood anatomical analysis showed that velvet mesquite has a semi-ring porous structure and termination of the growth ring is indicated by a small <b>band</b> of <b>parenchyma.</b> Visual crossdating of velvet mesquite was successful but a complex growth habit, with both eccentric and lobate growth, combined with ecological pressures hampered statistical validation of the chronology. Seasonal climate-growth analysis of dated rings showed a strong positive correlation to previous year September and October precipitation and a strong positive partial correlation to previous year September and August mean temperature. Life history through growth curve analysis showed no age related growth trend (either s-shaped or log normal) indicating the maximum age of velvet mesquite stems sampled (130 years old) can become much older with many releases and few suppressions. Above-ground biomass of these trees are low compared to higher elevation forest biomass, but similar to other savanna ecosystems of the southwest. The use of velvet mesquite in dendrochronological research would greatly benefit from a complete analysis of wood anatomy, and addition of more samples from various locations to verify dates and begin building more reliable chronologies for this species across its range. These additions would allow for a greater understanding of stand and tree level responses through suppressions and releases, and understand the biomass accumulated above-ground through time...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are reported for one species of Martynia (Martyniaceae) and for seven species of six genera of Pedaliaceae. The inclusion of woody annuals {{as well as}} of shrubs provides a broader picture ofPedaliaceae than hitherto available. The wood features of Martyniaceae and Pedaliaceae (listed in the Systematic Conclusions) are compatible with placement of these families in Scrophulariales (Bignoniales). Ifindividual features of the two families are compared with those of other families of the order, however, no one family can be cited as more closely related to Martyniaceae and Pedaliaceae than any other. Martyniaceae is not necessarily the family closest to Pedaliaceae, but its wood is like that of herbaceous Pedaliaceae and may reflect not merely scrophularialean affinity but the similarity of its herbaceousness to that of Pedaliaceae as well. Wide vessels in Martyniaceae and Pedaliaceae very likely relate to high transpiration rates in the summer-wet areas where many of them grow. Low vessel density and apotracheal <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands</b> that may store water and be related to semisucculence in Sesamothamnus.

This new species of Sassafrasoxylon Brezinová et Süss resembles the species of extant Sassafras in being distinctly ring-porous, having vessel elements with simple perforation plates and very occasional scalariform plates with relatively few bars in the narrowest latewood vessels, alternate intervascular pitting, marginal (initial) <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands</b> and <b>paratracheal</b> vasicentric <b>parenchyma</b> in the latewood, multiseriate rays and oil and /or mucilage cells.

40|$|Growth ring {{occurrence}} {{was investigated}} in 48 representative species of cerrado {{in the state of}} São Paulo, Brazil. We characterized growth ring markers and described the growth layer structure of the basal portion of the most developed stem branches in woody plants. Growth rings were poorly defined in 33 %, well defined in 61 % and not discernable in 6 % of the species studied. Various anatomical features were used as growth markers, such as: thick-walled latewood fibres; radially flattened latewood fibres; fibre zones; distended rays; marginal bands of axial parenchyma; marginal lines of parenchyma; and closeness of the narrow <b>bands</b> of scalariform <b>parenchyma.</b> In a single species, different growth ring markers often occurred together.

The {{use of these}} cups is {{strictly}} medicinal {{and it seems to}} be restricted to Suriname, as they are not found in neighbouring countries (Guyana, French Guiana). The aim of this study was to identify the botanical origin of Bitter-cups still in use in the Saramaka traditional medicine (as information from field people was controversial), and document the ethnopharmacology of this original galenical artefact. Microscopic and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were carried out on Bitter-cup, and anatomical criteria (marginal <b>parenchyma</b> <b>band,</b> size of intervessel and vessel-ray pits, rays width and rays composition, vessels clustering, frequency and size of parenchyma pits) together with HPLC profiles of the macerates showed that the wood cup was similar to Quassia amara L.

Genera {{that were previously}} placed in the Morindeae or Psychotrieae such as Damnacanthus, Lasianthus, Saldinia, and Trichosfachys are also included. Wood anatomical characters are compared with recent phylogenetic insights into the study group {{on the basis of}} molecular data. The observations demonstrate that the delimitation and separation of several taxa from the former Coussareeae/Morindeae/Prismatomerideae/Psychotrieae aggregate is supported by wood anatomical data. The Coussareeae can be distinguished from the other Rubioideae by their scanty parenchyma, septate libriform fibres, and the combination of uniseriate and very high multiseriate rays with sheath cells. Axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands</b> and fibre-tracheids characterise Gynochtodes and some species of Morinda (Morindeae sstr.), but the latter genus is variable with respect to several features (e. g. vessel groupings and axial parenchyma distribution). Wood data support separation of Rennelia and Prismatomeris from Morindeae s. str.; vessels in both genera are exclusively solitary and axial parenchyma is always diffuse to diffuse-in-aggregates. Damnacanthus differs from the Morindeae alliance by the occurrence of septate fibres, absence of axial parenchyma, and the occasional presence of fibre wall thickenings. There are interesting similarities between members of the Lasianfhus clade and the Pauridiantheae/Urophyleae group such as the sporadic occurrence of spiral thickenings in axial parenchyma cells...|$|R
40|$|Severe {{suppression}} of 4 -coumarate-coenzyme A ligase (4 CL) in the coniferous gymnosperm Pinus radiata substantially affected plant phenotype {{and resulted in}} dwarfed plants with a “bonsai tree-like” appearance.

This included the formation of weakly lignified tracheids that displayed signs of collapse {{and the development of}} circumferential <b>bands</b> of axial <b>parenchyma.</b> Acetyl bromide-soluble lignin assays and proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed lignin reductions of 36 % to 50 % in the most severely affected transgenic plants. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry studies indicated that lignin reductions were mainly due to depletion of guaiacyl but not p-hydroxyphenyl lignin. 4 CL silencing also caused modifications in the lignin interunit linkage distribution, including elevated β-aryl ether (β-O- 4 unit) and spirodienone (β- 1) levels, accompanied by lower phenylcoumaran (β- 5), resinol (β-β), and dibenzodioxocin (5 - 5 /β-O- 4) levels. A sharp depletion in the level of saturated (dihydroconiferyl alcohol) end groups was also observed. Severe {{suppression of}} 4 CL also affected carbohydrate metabolism. Most obvious was an up to approximately 2 -fold increase in galactose content in wood from transgenic plants due to increased compression wood formation. The molecular, anatomical, and analytical data verified that the isolated 4 CL clone is associated with lignin biosynthesis and illustrated that 4 CL silencing leads to complex, often surprising, physiological and morphological changes in P. radiata...|$|R

The polysaccharides, corresponding to approximately 47 %, are predominantly glucose (60. 3 % of total neutral monosaccharides) and xylose (20. 3 %). The content of rhamnose was also comparatively high (5. 1 %). Extractives were higher in the fines, about 30 % more than in the coarse fraction. Lignin content and monosaccharide composition were similar in the different bark fractions. A difference between fractions was found for suberin content which was lower in the fines: 0. 6 % and 3. 5 % in the fine and medium fractions, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|Gross and {{anatomical}} {{features of}} Aromadendron elegans and seven lesser known wood species were observed and described for identification purposes and {{for evaluation of}} their suitable uses. Fiber dimension were also measured to evaluate their possible uses for pulp and paper. Several important features for identification were detected: 1) oil cells and closely spaced <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands</b> in Aromadendron elegans; 2) wood semi-ring porous in Melia dubia; 3) radial intercellular canal and septate fibers in Lannea coromandelica; 4) ray storied and druses crystals in Hibiscus tiliaceus; 5) ray very high and contain sheath cells in Baccaurea sp.; 6) ray homocellular uniseriate and included phloem in Dolichandrone spathacea; 7) parenchyma aliform and confluent, prismatic crystals in chambered axial parenchyma of Acrocarpus fraxinifolius; 8) wood white, fibers with distinctly bordered pit, and prismatic crystals in chambered axial parenchyma of Flindersia australis. All wood species studied have density and considerable strength {{to be used for}} construction purposes. Aromadendron elegans, Melia dubia, and Flindersia australis have decorative appearance so they are suitable for furniture. Flindersia australis is white and has moderately fine texture so it could be usedfor "ram in" substitute. Fibers quality of all species studied belongs to quality class II. The total of fibers dimension derived values, of Aromadendron elegans, Melia dubia, Flindersia australis and Dolichandrone spathacea are the highest among eight wood species studied; further studies on pulping characteristics are therefore recommended for these wood species...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{enormous}} {{significance in}} coastal protection, biodiversity conservation and livelihood {{support to the}} local communities, mangrove ecosystems have been continuously degrading mainly due to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. Time series based on dated tree ring is an option to identify the causes of forest dilapidation. In this study, we investigated the structure and periodicity of the growth ring in Heritiera fomes, the flagship tree species of the Bangladesh Sundarbans, combining cambial marking experiment and cambial activity analysis. Distinct growth rings were found which are delineated by a <b>band</b> of marginal <b>parenchyma,</b> predominantly one cell wide but up to three and occasionally interrupted with fiber. Of the 13 trees with cambium marking experiment, one growth ring was found in each tree during a year. The dormant cambium was characterized by the abrupt boundary between xylem and cambial zone, absence of enlarging or differentiating cambial derivatives, lower number of cambial cells and thicker radial walls in cambial cells. Growth ring anomalies, i. e., wedging and partially missing rings were also found. In most of the cases, {{the lower part of}} the eccentric discs had low radial increment (< 0. 75 mm) and therefore the growth ring in that area merged with previous one and produced wedging or partially missing ring. However, the existence of annual rings suggests its great potential for future dendrochronological applications to reveal the dynamics of vegetation and climate in Sundarbans...|$|R
40|$|The study uses {{a rather}} unusual method, dendrochronology, to {{investigate}} the growth and survival of Atriplex portulacoides L. and Artemisia maritima L. on salt marshes at two field sites on the Dutch North Sea barrier islands of Terschelling and Ameland. By providing information on longevity of these typical salt-marsh shrubs, dendrochronology offers an indirect way {{to investigate the}} influence of management regime – grazing in this case – on marsh quality and areal extent. Diminishment of salt marshes is a continuing concern in the northern Netherlands. The two shrub species studied here, A. portulacoides and A. maritima, are common to salt marshes. With their extensive roots and branches, they facilitate sedimentation and stabilize salt marshes. Using dendrochronology, this study found that annual growth rings could be identified to determine shrub age and growth. In A. portulacoides these rings {{took the form of}} a narrow <b>band</b> of terminal <b>parenchyma.</b> In A. maritima they were made up of unlignified marginal parenchyma together with higher vessel density {{at the beginning of the}} growing season. Growth rings indicated that intense grazing was clearly detrimental to the survival of A. portulacoides at the Terschelling site. However, grazing facilitated survival of A. maritima at the Ameland site by reducing light and nutrient competition from grasses. No growth trends could be found, however, as the lifespan for both species is short and many other influences on shrub growth could be identified...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePhloem is the {{principal}} food-conducting tissue, involved in the active transport of photosynthates, hormones, and various metabolites through the body of vascular plants. In {{the case of the}} lignophytes (i. e., seed plants and their putative progymnosperm ancestors), the presence of a bifacial vascular cambium allows the formation of new phloem layers of secondary origin through the life of the plant. This production of both secondary xylem and secondary phloem by the vascular cambium {{is considered one of the}} key-innovations that occurred among vascular plants during the Devonian. Unlike secondary xylem, secondary phloem is rarely well-preserved in the fossil record. This is due either to the decay of the unlignified cells that constitute most of the phloem or to the loss of bark tissues (decortication) before fossilization. As a result, while some detailed anatomical studies of fossil secondary phloem exist, our knowledge of the evolution of this tissue remains incomplete. In this talk, we will review the secondary phloem anatomy of 11 lignophyte taxa of Devonian and Mississippian age, based on both previously published and novel specimens kept in the collections of Montpellier 2 University. In Tetraxylopteris and Triloboxylon, two genera belonging to the oldest group of lignophytes, the aneurophytalean progymnosperms, the secondary phloem is a complex tissue containing rays, different types of thin-walled cells, and fibers arranged in radial files. Study of large roots and a trunk of Callixylon from the Late Devonian of Morocco show that a comparable organization is found in the inner secondary phloem of archaeoperidalean progymnosperms. Among Mississippian lignophytes assigned to the seed plants, the genus Calamopitys has a secondary phloem composed of alternating <b>bands</b> of <b>parenchyma</b> and sieve cells, with no sclerenchyma. Phloem fibers are present in all the other Mississippian genera studied: Bilignea,Eristophyton, Faironia, Lyginopitys, Stanwoodia, and two new taxa from the Early Mississippian of Australia and Algeria respectively. In both archaeopteridalean progymnosperms and seed plants, different types of phloem cells tend to be produced rhythmically in tangential bands. Changes between the inner and outer phloem include an increase in diameter of axial parenchyma cells, proliferation of axial parenchyma cells, and/or enlargement of rays. This study of secondary phloem anatomy supports a close relationship between Aneurophytales, Archaeopteridales, and seed plants. At the same time, the variability between taxa of characters such as the presence/absence and distribution of secretory cells or the distribution of fibers is noteworthy...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for wood of all species of Fouquieriaceae, the samples selected {{so as to}} cover important variables with respect to organography and age. Wood contains fibertracheids (plus a few vasicentric tracheids). Diffuse axial parenchyma is mostly grouped as diffuse-in-aggregates or diffuse clusters (new term), with transitions to pervasive axial parenchyma in some species. Rays are Heterogeneous Type II. These wood features are relatively unspecialized and are consistent with placement {{of the family in}} Ericales s. 1. as defined in recent DNA-based cladograms. Xeromorphic wood in nonsucculent species occurs only in Fouquieria shrevei; the lateral branches of F. columnaris also have xeromorphic wood. If the preceding two instances and proliferated parenchyma of the three succulent species (F. columnaris, F. fasciculata, and F. purpusii) are excluded from quantitative studies, wood of Fouquieriaceae is rather mesomorphic, despite the habitats occupied by the family. This paradox is explained by the very sensitive drought deciduousness. Also, the succulent species produce water-storage parenchyma by means of expansion of rays and axial <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands.</b> Details of these two types of meristems, as well as three other types of meristems within wood (not including vascular cambium) and four bark meristems (other than phellogen) are described; five of these meristems are newly reported for the family. Wood data permit recognition of both the three succulent and eight nonsucculent species within a single genus, in agreement with Henrickson (1972), but few wood features offer species characters. Most wood features, including the abundant reaction wood, are closely related to habit, organography, and ecology...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented for 44 collections representing 42 species in 27 genera. Lamiaceae basically have: vessels with simple perforation plates; vessel-to-vessel pitting alternate; imperforate tracheary elements all libriform fibers, fibers commonly septate; axial parenchyma scanty vasicentric; rays Heterogeneous Type IIB. These features ally Lamiaceae closely with Verbenaceae. In {{addition to the}} Mesomorphy ratio (based on vessel element dimensions), features that indicate wood xeromorphy in Lamiaceae, in probable increasing order of importance are: presence of indistinct to marked growth rings; presence of helical thickenings in vessels; presence of vasicentric or vascular tracheids; presence of vessel groups averaging three or more vessels per group. More mesomorphic woods in Lamiaceae occur in species that are arborescent to shrubby, and that occur in areas that have no prolonged drought. Helical sculpture in vessels is expressed not only as thickenings, but also as grooves interconnecting pit apertures (coalesced pit apertures), and inconspicuous thickenings in pairs along the grooves. Vascular tracheids (at ends of growth rings) occur in several genera. Where growth rings are very narrow (Salvia, Trichostema), vessels and tracheids are intermixed, thereby justifying description as vasicentric tracheids of what may have originated phylogenetically as vascular tracheids. This may represent one pathway for origin of vasicentric tracheids. Wide <b>bands</b> of axial <b>parenchyma</b> in Cuminia and Leptosceptrum have originated {{as a result of}} fiber dimorphism. Abundance of upright cells in numerous Lamiaceae is indicative ofpaedomorphosis, and may point to secondary woodiness in some instances; the family as a whole appears ancestrally moderately woody. The ratio between libriform fiber length and vessel element length marks Lamiaceae as specialized. Crystal presence and cambial variants are newly reported for the family...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands</b> (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s. s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae. Variation in quantitative characters (vessel member length, vessel diameter and frequency) can partly be explained from the ecological preference of the species concerned. Wood anatomical differences between lianas and erect relatives are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Jelutung wood (Dyera spp ­ Apocynaceae) {{has been}} {{the main source of}} pencil slat in Indonesia for more than 30 years. It can easily be peeled with pencil {{sharpener}} specially designed for children USAge. However the supply of jelutung wood is no longer sufficient to meet the rising demand for pencil slat. It is therefore necessary to search for substitute. Previous study with jelutung and other wood species indicated that the peelability of wood depend not only on wood density but also on anatomical structure. The occurrence of closely spaced parenchyma lines in jelutung enhances the ease of wood to be peeled. The closely spaced parenchyma lines acted as if they were chopped lines inside the wood tissue that made the wood peelable. So the prospective substitute should have similar parenchyma pattern with jelutung 2 ̆ 7 s. Nyatoh (Palaquium spp. ­ Sapotaceae) is known to have closely spaced <b>parenchyma</b> <b>bands</b> similar to that of jelutung 2 ̆ 7 s. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to find out whether or not nyatoh wood could be used for pencil slat, as a substitute for jelutung wood in pencil production. Sample of nyatoh wood (Palaquium obtusifolium Burck.) used in this experiment was obtained from Sulawesi. The sample was processed into pencil at PT Staedtler Indonesian factory in Serang, using 28 grade graphite lead. The peelability test were assisted by primary school student class II, llI, and IV, using simple rotary pencil sharpener. Pencils made of jelutung were used as controls. An independent test was used to analyze whether or not nyatoh wood is easy to be peeled, and whether or not the pee/ability depend on the age of the student and on the wood species used. The anatomical structure and the density of the wood sample were also observed. The result of experiment indicated that nyatoh wood with sample density ranges from 0. 40 ­ 0. 57 gr/cm 3 was easily peeled with pencil sharpener, either by primary school student class IV, and by class II as well. Further test also indicated that nyatoh had the same peelability with jelutung wood. So it is possible to use nyatoh wood as jelutung substitute in pencil production. Moreover, the colour of nyatoh is already reddish brown so it does not need staining with colour substance as usually being done to jelutung...|$|R
