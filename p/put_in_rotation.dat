These lines have a vacuum core with a diameter of about 1 Å (which is smaller than the average particle distance). The superfluid helium rotates around the core with very high speeds. Just outside the core (r = 1 Å), the velocity is as large as 160 m/s. The cores of the vortex lines and the container rotate as a solid body around the rotation axes with the same angular velocity. The number of vortex lines increases with the angular velocity (as shown in {{the upper half of}} the figure).

Prior to the album's release, the songs [...] "Love at First Sight" [...] and [...] "Second Boys Will Be First Choice" [...] appeared on X96's Top Ten daily songs list, with [...] "Second Boys" [...] reaching number one on the station and staying there for several weeks.

5000|$|The whole {{race was}} planned in advance, in several {{iterations}} of storyboards and animated previsualization videos. In order {{to re-create the}} sequence, producers and horse race track experts built a 1,000-foot-long arena, with a 250 metre long and 50 metre wide track, stands, and gates, called Circus Tiberius, at Cinecittà World, a film-themed amusement park about 45 minutes south of Rome. It was built partly on the back lot of producer Dino De Laurentiis's former studio complex. According to production designer Naomi Shohan, arena designs were compiled from archaeological records of circuses in Roman territories. One-sixth of the arena was physically built and the rest {{was added to the}} film by computer graphics. Unique chariots were also built based on original references. A total of 86 horses were supplied by horse master Steve Dent, with back-up animals, and were trained for several months, to be able to race at 40 miles per hour. Dent has assembled larger stables for films like Ridley Scott's Robin Hood (2010), but said that [...] "this was more of a worry job." [...] There were 60 handlers for the horses, and 12 horses were <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotation</b> for every four horse-drawn carriage, so the animals would have a chance to rest. Unlike the chariots in the 1959 version, made by Italian craftsmen and weighed 900lb, this time the team wanted to use the equivalent of Ferraris - small and fast. Multiple chariots were made for each character - some with brakes (though the horses are strong enough to overpower the brakes), some with room for a second [...] "blind driver" [...] or 'bonnet-fitted' camera, some with different-sized wheels for filming on the turns instead of the straights, and some to flip over or crash. Massimo Pauletto, an art director on the film who built the chariots, said that his team had to reinvent a forgotten skill, [...] "from the sketches, nobody was understanding how they could become real," [...] and the toughest part was to fit together practical needs and special-effects needs. Problems cropped up day-by-day as the bolts that held the chariots together kept being broken by the horses due to their immense strength, and the bar that attached the horses was bent. As a result, the crew {{had to learn how to}} build a new one week after week.|$|E

40|$|Usually, {{transportation}} of laminated products is done through rolls, <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotation</b> by electric motors. The acting moving force depends {{solely on the}} adherence of the laminated product to the moving rolls, which reduces {{the speed of the}} latter. The drawback of this speed limitation is most noticeable on the portions of the steel mill where, according to the work conditions, each metal sheet is to be rapidly stopped or pushed away (cutting zone, etc…). Since a large acceleration is not possible due to the resulting high inertial forces, a sliding of the bars on the rolls will occur. A solution to this problem may be obtained by using a linear asynchronous motor whose moving body would be the laminated produc...|$|E

Each transducer is designed to work at the natural frequency of the radial nonaxisymmetrical mode 0 - 5 (23. 6 kHz).

50|$|A {{centrifuge}} is a {{piece of}} equipment that <b>puts</b> an object <b>in</b> <b>rotation</b> around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle), applying a potentially strong force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward). The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction. At the same time, objects that are less dense are displaced and move to the center. In a laboratory centrifuge that uses sample tubes, the radial acceleration causes denser particles to settle {{to the bottom of the}} tube, while low-density substances rise to the top.|$|R

40|$|This work {{shows that}} the CMB {{polarization}} E and B modes {{can be measured in}} a clean manner in the real space by adopting a specific observing strategy: the detectors are configured to lie around a ring to observe an annulus of sky, where the antenna axis in each detector is oriented in the local radial direction. In particular, for the measurement of the weak B mode, the detector ring can be <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotation</b> about its axis. This additional degree of freedom allows each detector to directly measure the B-mode signal through long-term exposure to the sky without further data manipulation for removal of the E mode. We present the variances of the expected measured E and B-mode surface brightness fluctuations as functions of the radius of the sky annulus. Both E and B modes have distinct features that can serve as the indicators for claiming detection. The temperature anisotropy-E mode correlation can also be constructed by the present method, though it is probably not optimaized...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the use of the of a cyclostationary blind source {{separation}} algorithm (namely RRCR) in order to extract angle deterministic signals from mechanical rotating machines in presence of instantaneous stationary speed fluctuations when angular resampling fails. The capability of the proposed approach is verified by means of simulated and actual vibration signals captured on a pneumatic screwdriver handle. Experimental investigations are carried out on a screwdriver tool driven by a 4 -blade pneumatic motor <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>rotation</b> by air in pressure. The objective is to extract the contribution of the pneumatic motor to the excitation of the handle. The originality of the research mainly concerns the proof that an angle deterministic signal in presence of speed fluctuations is cyclostationary at first and second-orders in the time domain. Taking advantage of this property a Blind Source Separation algorithm, namely RRCR, has been applied in order to extract that signal when Time Synchronous Averaging fails...|$|E
