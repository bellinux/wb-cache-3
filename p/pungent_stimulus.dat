40|$|Males {{and females}} judged the {{intensity}} of the typical <b>pungent</b> <b>stimulus</b> CO 2, presented by nose and by mouth, employing two scaling procedures: magnitude estimation and magnitude matching. The two groups differed in their perception of CO 2 pungency only when it was judged in the nose. Perceived nasal pungency grew as a power function of CO 2 concentration, with an exponent of 2. 2 for females and 1. 6 for males, and the magnitude matching test showed that, relative to their perception of sucrose sweetness, females perceived pungency more intense throughout the range studied. Perceived buccal pungency grew for both groups as the 1. 1 power of CO 2 concentration, and the magnitude matching test, employing again sweetness as the reference modality, revealed no intensity differences in the perception of buccal pungency between the genders. It is suggested that the susceptibility of the nasal environment to hormonal and neural influences may account for the differences in perceived pungency between males and females...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{are reported in}} which the perceptual interactions between oral pungency, evoked by CO 2, and the taste of each of four tastants—sucrose (sweet), quinine sulfate (bitter), sodium chloride (salty), and tartaric acid (sour) —were explored. In experiment 1 the effect of three concentrations of each tastant on the stimulus-response function for perceived oral pungency, {{in terms of both}} rate of change (slope) and relative position along the perceived pungency axis, was determined. In experiment 2 the effect of three concentrations of CO 2 on the stimulus-response function for the perceived taste intensity of each tastant was examined. Results show that the characteristics of the mutual effects of tastant and <b>pungent</b> <b>stimulus</b> depend on the particular tastant employed. Sucrose sweetness and CO 2 oral pungency have no mutual effect; sodium chloride saltiness or tartaric acid sourness and CO 2 oral pungency show mutual enhancement; and quinine sulfate bitterness abates CO 2 oral pungency, whereas CO 2 has a double and opposite effect on quinine sulfate bitterness—at low concentrations of bitter tastant CO 2 enhances bitterness, and at high concentrations of bitter tastant CO 2 abates bitterness. It is suggested that the perceptual attributes of saltiness and sourness are closer, from a qualitative point of view, to oral pungency than are the attributes of bitterness and sweetness...|$|E
40|$|Four {{experiments}} explored possible temporal summation in olfaction and {{the common}} chemical sense. In one experiment, participants judged the perceived magnitude of various concentrations and durations (1. 25 - 3. 75 s) of the pungent odorant ammonia and the nonpungent odorant isoamyl butyrate. The perceived magnitude of ammonia increased during an inhalation whereas the magnitude of isoamyl butyrate did not. Time-intensity trading relations for ammonia indicated nearly perfect temporal summation. In another experiment, modulation of the concentration of ammonia during an inhalation led to assessments of perceived magnitude that confirmed {{the high degree of}} temporal summation seen in the first experiment. That is, approximately equal time-integrated mass of inhaled ammonia led to approximately equal perceived intensity. A third experiment indicated that temporal summation for ammonia arose from its pungency rather than from its odor, a fourth that trigeminally-mediated reflex apnea in response to ammonia also exhibits temporal summation. The degree of temporal summation measured with the reflex came very close to that assessed psychophysically. When stimulated with ammonia, the common chemical sense behaves more like a total mass detector than a concentration detector. The investigation raises the possibility that the short-term sensory reaction to most <b>pungent</b> <b>stimuli</b> may follow this simple rule...|$|R
