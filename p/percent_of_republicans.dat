Lieberman won the general election with approximately 50 {{percent of the vote}}; exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of independents, and 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E

The poll also found that 35 percent of voters (including 25 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of independents) had doubts about Obama because of his relationship with Rev. Wright. The racial division was especially noteworthy, with 40 percent of whites expressing doubts in comparison to only 2 percent of African Americans.|$|E

500|$|Throughout 1963, {{the media}} speculated about a {{potential}} presidential run by Goldwater. Grassroots efforts heightened as well, climaxing with a July 4 rally in Washington D.C. attended by 8,000 supporters. [...] Shortly thereafter, Goldwater hinted at a possible presidential candidacy and {{explained to the}} [...] "Draft Goldwater Committee" [...] {{that he planned to}} use his own staff if he decided to run. In late October, he speculated that he could open his candidacy in January 1964 and campaign extensively in New Hampshire ahead of the state's first-in-the-nation primary. To lay the groundwork, he named former Eisenhower aide Edward A. McCabe as Research Director to lead a team of economists and political scientists to formulate policy positions and speeches. McCabe worked under longtime Goldwater adviser Denison Kitchel, who officially worked as the campaign manager of Goldwater's Senate re-election, and would eventually be named as the campaign manager of the presidential run. Around this time, an AP poll showed that 85.1 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> believed Goldwater was the [...] "strongest candidate" [...] for the party, cementing his place as front-runner. Meanwhile, a Gallup poll showed that former Vice President Richard Nixon, who had not shown an interest in the Republican nomination after losing the 1960 presidential election and the 1962 gubernatorial race in California, led Goldwater, 52 percent to 48 percent among Republicans in a two-way race. With all potential candidates included, Goldwater led with 37 percent support.|$|E

2500|$|A December 2011 Gallup {{poll found}} {{a decline in}} the number of Americans who felt {{reducing}} the gap in income and wealth between the rich and the poor was extremely or very important (21 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans,</b> 43 percent of independents, and 72 percent of Democrats). In 2012, several surveys of voters attitudes toward growing income inequality found the issue ranked less important than other economic issues such as growth and equality of opportunity, and relatively low in affecting voters [...] "personally". In 1998 a Gallup poll had found 52% of Americans agreeing that the gap between rich and the poor was a problem that needed to be fixed, while 45% regarded it as [...] "an acceptable part of the economic system". In 2011, those numbers are reversed: Only 45% see the gap as in need of fixing, while 52% do not. However, there was a large difference between Democrats and Republicans, with 71% of Democrats calling for a fix.|$|E
5000|$|Nominating {{procedures}} {{are determined by}} states, and there are three basic types of primary. The two simplest primary forms are what {{are referred to as}} [...] "open" [...] and [...] "closed" [...] primaries. In the open primary, any registered voter may participate regardless of partisan affiliation. This category also includes states that allow same-day party registration. Conversely, in the closed primary, only same-party registered partisans may participate. Modified-open primaries encompass a broad category of voting rules that are neither fully closed nor fully open for all to participate and include primaries where same-party registrants may participate with [...] "independents," [...] "unenrolled," [...] "unaffiliated," [...] or [...] "undeclared" [...] voters. In the 2000 election, 35 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Democratic primaries and 31 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> primaries are closed to registered party members: 41 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Democratic and <b>Republican</b> primaries are open to all registered voters, and the remaining 24 percent and 28 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Democratic and <b>Republican</b> primaries, respectively, are characterized by modified-open procedures.|$|R
25|$|The American Council on Science and Health {{said that}} denialism {{of the facts}} of climate science and of climate change, means to {{misrepresent}} verifiable data and information as political opinion. In that vein, anti-intellectualism puts scientists in the public view and so forces them to align with either a liberal or a conservative political stance. One third of Americans believe that climate scientists know about climate change, while fewer than one third believe that scientists know how to end global climate change. Moreover, 53 per cent <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives and 74 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> senators deny the scientific facts and the occurrence of climate change.|$|R
50|$|Alarm at Trump's rise {{prompted}} {{an increase}} in the number of eligible Latino immigrants who have chosen to naturalize to vote against him. Despite his poor national standing with Hispanic and Latino Americans, he had constantly garnered higher numbers from them than each <b>of</b> his <b>Republican</b> rivals, along with other minority groups. At the same time, Trump received pockets of Hispanic support, winning around 45 percent (plus or minus 10 percentage points) <b>of</b> the Hispanic <b>Republican</b> vote in the Nevada Republican caucuses (where about 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republican</b> caucus-goers were Hispanic), and receiving some support among Cuban Americans in Florida. Despite expectations of low Latino support, Trump received about 29% of the Hispanic vote, slightly more than Romney received in 2012.|$|R
2500|$|After {{a decade}} of neutrality, Roosevelt knew that the change to Allied support must be gradual, {{especially}} since German Americans were the largest ethnicity in America at the time. Originally, the American position was to help the British but not enter the war. In early February 1941, a Gallup poll revealed that 54 percent of Americans {{were in favor of}} giving aid to the British without qualifications of Lend-Lease. A further 15 percent were in favor with qualifications such as: [...] "If it doesn't get us into war," [...] or [...] "If the British can give us some security for what we give them." [...] Only 22 percent were unequivocally against the President's proposal. When poll participants were asked their party affiliation, the poll revealed a sharp political divide: 69 percent of Democrats were unequivocally in favor of Lend-Lease, whereas only 38 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> favored the bill without qualification. At least one poll spokesperson also noted that, [...] "approximately twice as many Republicans" [...] gave [...] "qualified answers as ... Democrats." ...|$|E
2500|$|A June 2017 NBC News/Wall Street Journal {{poll found}} that {{respondents}} {{were more likely to}} believe James Comey over Trump when it came to their differing accounts behind the reasons for Comey's dismissal.

[...] The poll also found that the number of respondents disapproving of Trump's decision to fire Comey- 46%- was higher than when the same question was asked in May of the same year. 53% of respondents said that they believed that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, however the number changes by party affiliation. 78% of Democrats said that they believed there was interference, versus 26% of Republicans who agreed. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll conducted in late June 2017 found that 54% of respondents believed that Trump either did [...] "something illegal" [...] or [...] "something unethical, but not illegal" [...] in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The poll reported that [...] "seventy-three <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Republicans</b> say Trump himself has done nothing wrong" [...] while 41% of Democrats believed that Trump did something that was illegal. In addition, 47% said that they thought Russia was a major threat to future U.S. elections. 13% of respondents said that Russia posed no threat at all.|$|E
