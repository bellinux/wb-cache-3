40|$|Prior {{authors have}} {{concluded}} that case-specific determinants, such {{as the number of}} professionals involved in a given case or the lead attorney's hourly rate, are the principal determinants of variance in <b>professional</b> fees and <b>expenses</b> in US corporate restructurings. The implication has been that less proximate variables, such as the availability of credit, the cost of capital or coincident economic conditions, are not relevant to predictive models. While we do not question the relevance of case-specific factors we question the practicality of models that rely exclusively on such factors in order to predict future fees and expenses. Our hypothesis is that both case-specific and less proximate variables are relevant to the determination of professional costs in bankruptcy, since we believe that variables belonging to each of these categories can act as frictions to the refinancing process or otherwise inform the court's determination as to the efficacy of refinancing, thereby impacting the complexity and duration of the restructuring process. Our results are less than conclusive, since our data is limited. However, the data that we have gives us {{reason to believe that the}} addition of non-case predictors may improve the accuracy of case-specific models; in some instances, these non-case-specific predictors even displace case specific predictors (via a screen for statistical significance). Our analysis indicates that this improvement is more pronounced when the data is sorted for Section 364 financing. Our goal is to complement the on-going analysis of <b>professional</b> fees and <b>expenses</b> so that it might better account for the potential impact of non-case factors and thereby yield a more accurate and practical predictive model. by John P.

Empirical taxonomy with Ward's hierarchical clustering technique based on the variables acquired from financial statements of all 6, 130 sports NGOs in Slovenia was used to cluster organisations into three financial design types: grassroots sports organisations, semi-professional sports NGOs, and professional sports NGOs. Clusters varied in magnitude and structure of Financial items. The findings suggest that the business of grassroots sports organisations is very simple, while with semi-professional and professional sports NGOs it is more complex, and consequently such organisations are confronted with cash flow and even solvency problems. Total average revenues of grassroots sports organisations (€ 6, 304) are approximately one tenth the size of the semi-professional sports NGOs and 192 times smaller than professional sports NGOs. As for the structure of revenues, professional sports NGOs have a larger proportion of sales revenues and much lower membership fees, donations, and other revenues. Semiprofessional sports NGOs differ from grassroots sport in a slightly higher proportion of sales revenues and donations. As regards the structure of <b>expenses,</b> <b>professional</b> sports NGOs had a 5. 6 times higher proportion of labour costs in comparison with grassroots sports and 1. 4 times higher compared to semi-professional sports NGOs.

40|$|Spaceflight is difficult, {{dangerous}} and expensive; human spaceflight even more so. In order to mitigate {{some of the}} danger and <b>expense,</b> <b>professionals</b> in the space domain have relied, and continue to rely, on computer simulation. Simulation is used at every level including concept, design, analysis, construction, testing, training and ultimately flight. As space systems have grown more complex, new simulation technologies have been developed, adopted and applied. Distributed simulation is one those technologies. Distributed simulation provides a base technology for segmenting these complex space systems into smaller, and usually simpler, component systems or subsystems. This segmentation also supports the separation of responsibilities between participating organizations. This segmentation is particularly useful for complex space systems like the International Space Station (ISS), which is composed of many elements from many nations along with visiting vehicles from many nations. This {{is likely to be}} the case for future human space exploration activities. Over the years, a number of distributed simulations have been built within the space domain. While many use the High Level Architecture (HLA) to provide the infrastructure for interoperability, HLA without a Federation Object Model (FOM) is insufficient by itself to insure interoperability. As a result, the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) is developing a Space Reference FOM. The Space Reference FOM Product Development Group is composed of members from several countries.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of market-based mechanisms to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} presents a challenge for accountants who are now required to reflect the new economic given to carbon credits and related assets in the company accounts. Given the absence of formal accounting guidelines, carbon market participants (liable entities and carbon credit providers) {{around the world are}} able to select accounting practices and reporting methods based on individual judgment. The main aim of this thesis is to explore current accounting practices (asset classification, sequent measurement and impairment testing) of Australian carbon credit providers. In addition to exploring the underlying reasons for specific accounting practices, this study also aims to uncover emerging normative views drawing on expert opinions. The study was conducted using case-study methodology and in-depth interviews, supported by archival data and secondary data. The study used institutional theory to interpret research interviews. In general, it was found that disclosures of related accounting information are incomparable {{due to the lack of}} formal benchmark guidelines. While the research results show accounting practices for carbon credits and related assets are in accordance with existing general accounting standards and conceptual frameworks, the preferred asset classification of carbon credits varies among the case site participants, according to specific market requirements and economic uncertainty. Applicable values and valuation methods differ from case site to case site due to the nature of each company’s business, internal operations and economic factors. Impairment testing conducted by each organisation requires reference price indices from various sources, but basically they are determined by the nature of assets and <b>professionals.</b> Revenue and <b>expense</b> recognition greatly relies on accounting estimation made by in-house, on-hand and external forestry professionals from government agencies and private bodies. When trying to elicit an emerging normative viewpoint, the expert views indicate asset classification, valuation, impairment; revenue and expense recognition should be prepared conservatively, based on a true and fair view. In conclusion, accounting policy makers and professional accountants in Australia need to address these issues to improve the quality of the accounting information in this area. Further research should focus on the implications and other developments of the carbon credit accounting practices...|$|R
40|$|The South African Constitution {{provides}} that a child’s best interests are {{of paramount importance}} in every matter concerning the child. This principle emanates from the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC). Accordingly the State and its various departments have adopted and are enforcing legislation and policies in defence of the child’s best interest. The principle of {{the best interest of}} the child is seldom observed in most of our schools. Incidents of child abuse are on the increase, especially by educators. This unfortunate situation prevails against the backdrop of legislation which condemns these atrocities. Section 17 of the Employment of Educators Act 1 {{provides that}} educators must be discharged if they are found guilty of, inter alia, sexual abuse, intimate relationship with a learner and assault with grievous bodily harm. These measures have been taken to combat the vicious cycle of child abuse in schools and to advance children’s-rights agenda and the universal principle of the child’s best interests. For the department to successfully prosecute educator cases against child abuse, the testimony of a child witness is crucial. However, it is shocking to discover that the interests of the child witness are not always served in these disciplinary hearings. Officials are prone to be biased towards their fellow <b>professionals</b> at the <b>expense</b> of the interest of the child witness. This situation normally arises probably as a result of a lack of professional capacity because most of these officials tasked with disciplining educators have a teaching, human-resource or legal qualification. Others may have been recruited from the ranks of the trade-union movement without any formal qualification. Secondly, they may be specialists in the field of labour law which is essentially concerned with the regulating the employer and employee relationship. Thirdly, the disciplinary code and procedures that are used during educator-disciplinary processes are premised on the principles and values of the Labour 1 Act 76 of 1998. Relations Act Code of Good Practice: Dismissal 2 and Schedule 2 of the Employment of Educators Act 3 which addresses the interest of the child witness to a very limited extend. Finally, the policies regulating workplace discipline are generally biased towards employee rights as espoused in the Labour Relations Act 4 and CCMA guidelines on misconduct arbitrations. 5 This study has identified a number of challenges confronting the child witness and also areas of capacity improvement on the side of officials officiating over the disciplinary cases of educators. These challenges form the basis for a comprehensive and consolidated list of aspects in which officials need to be trained to effectively promote and defend the interest of the child witness in a professional manner. The role of the departmental representative in becoming the champions of the democratic Constitution and the vanguard of the child’s best interest cannot be over-emphasised.
