50|$|Silver was {{discovered}} in 1919 in the eastern Rand district, near Randsburg and Johannesburg, in San Bernardino County. The Rand district had already been an established gold district. The Kelly Rand mine produced silver from miargyrite and <b>pyrargyrite</b> ores from 1919 to 1928.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} mineral deposits are the ores blue lead (galena), zincblende (sphalerite), fools gold (pyrite), arsenical iron (arsenopyrite), argentiferous {{grey copper ore}} (freibergite), dark-red silver ores (<b>Pyrargyrite),</b> and silver glance. The {{most important}} non-metallic materials are: quartz, calcareous spar (calcite), heavy spar (baryte) and fluorspar (fluorite).|$|E
5000|$|The {{color of}} <b>pyrargyrite</b> is usually greyish-black and the lustre metallic-adamantine; large {{crystals}} are opaque, but small ones and thin splinters are deep ruby-red by transmitted light, hence the name, from the Greek pyr and argyros, [...] "fire-silver" [...] in allusion to color and silver content, given by E. F. Glocker in 1831. The streak is purplish-red, thus differing markedly from the scarlet streak of proustite and affording a ready means of distinguishing the two minerals. The Mohs hardness is 2.75, {{and the specific}} gravity 5.85. The refractive indices (nω=3.084 nε=2.881) and birefringence (δ=0.203) are very high. There is no very distinct cleavage and the fracture is conchoidal. The mineral occurs in metalliferous veins with calcite, argentiferous galena, native silver, native arsenic, &c. The best crystallized specimens are from Sankt Andreasberg in the Harz, Freiberg in Saxony, and Guanajuato in Mexico. It is not uncommon in many silver mines in the United States, but rarely as distinct crystals; {{and it has been}} found in some Cornish mines.Although the red silver ores afford a good example of isomorphism, they rarely form mixtures; <b>pyrargyrite</b> rarely contains as much as 3% of arsenic replacing antimony, and {{the same is true of}} antimony in proustite. Dimorphous with <b>pyrargyrite</b> and proustite respectively are the rare monoclinic species pyrostilpnite or fireblende (Ag3SbS3) and xanthoconite (Ag3AsS3): these four minerals thus form an isodimorphous group.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1892 for an occurrence in the Baia Sprie mine, Baia Sprie, Maramures County, Romania, and named for Hungarian amateur mineralogist Andor von Semsey (1833-1923).

It occurs associated with stibnite, sphalerite, baryte, fluorite, siderite, cassiterite, arsenopyrite, stannite, zinkenite, tetrahedrite, pyrite, alunite, quartz, <b>pyrargyrite,</b> stephanite and rhodochrosite.|$|E
50|$|Proustite is a sulfosalt mineral {{consisting}} of; silver sulfarsenide, Ag3AsS3, known also {{as light}} red silver or ruby silver ore, {{and an important}} source of the metal.

50|$|Silver was {{discovered}} at Phillipsburg in 1864, {{and the district}} {{was one of the}} most prolific silver producers in Montana. Major mines included the Granite Mountain mine, the Bi-Metallic mine, and the Hope mine. In 1887, the district produced 2.2 million troy ounces (68 metric tons) of silver, making it the largest silver producer in the US for that year. The district suffered greatly from the fall in the price of silver in 1893, and remained moribund until World War I, when the manganese deposits of the district became valuable, and Philipsburg became one of the top US producers of that metal. Silver occurs in veins filling fracture zones through Paleozoic limestone. Minerals in the silver-ore veins include polybasite, <b>pyrargyrite,</b> proustite, sphalerite, galena, and tennantite. Manganese occurs as replacement bodies of pyrolusite and rhodochrosite in limestone adjacent to the fracture zones. No mines are presently active in the district.|$|E
50|$|Over 30 veins {{have been}} named and mined at the Sunshine Mine. While the initial work {{suggested}} distinct veins, some of these veins are actually offsets across post-ore structures and others represent parallel footwall or hanging wall veins. Principle vein systems in the mine include the Sunshine, Chester, Copper, Yankee girl and West Chance. The Sunshine and Chester veins have each produced over 100 million ounces of silver. Major veins strike east-west and dip about 65° to the south. Locally, dips range from 45° to 90°. Strike lengths exceed 2000 feet and dip lengths are {{two to three times}} greater than the strike length. Major veins are located between the faults at an angle of about 25° to the bounding faults. Veins vary in width from a few inches to over 30 feet, but are generally 1 to 5 feet thick. Ore minerals include tetrahedrite and galena with siderite and quartz as the principal gangue minerals. The silver content of the tetrahedrite varies and the silver to copper ratio in the ore ranges from 40:1 (opt Ag:%Cu) to over 100:1. Tetrahedrite occurs as blebs, fracture fillings, or in veinlets. Samples exceeding 200 oz/ton silver have been collected in the mine. Other minerals include pyrite and arsenopyrite with minor to trace amounts of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, boulangerite, bourmonite, <b>pyrargyrite,</b> and magnetite.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Tyndrum Pb-Zn {{mineralization}} ccurs as {{veins and}} vein breccias in NE SW trending fractures {{associated with the}} Tyndrum-Glen-Fyne fault. The major minerals are quartz, galena, and sphalerite with minor chalcopyrite and baryte. Tetrahedrite (sometimes silver-and cadmium-rich), <b>pyrargyrite,</b> marcasite, and pyrite occur as small inclusions (< 100 #m) in the galena-rich veins. Sphalerite formed early in the depositional sequence, mainly in breccias, with increasing amounts of galena nd chalcopyrite d posited inthe later vein stages of mineralization. Uraniferous veins post-date the main Pb Zn mineralization and contain uraninite, calcite, baryte, galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, argentite, chalco-cite, tetrabedrite, and safltorite. Fluid inclusion studies reveal that the mineralizing solutions contained c. 20 wt. ~o equivalent NaCI + KC 1, had an Na/K ratio of 3 : 1 and were boiling during mineral precipitation. The Tyndrum fault controlled the upward flow of the hydrothermal solutions and its intersection with fractures in quartzites favoured the siting of the veins.

40|$|Sphalerite {{from the}} Kokanee Range, British Columbia, {{displays}} color banding ranging from light to dark brown. Sphalerite forms massive layers {{with a dark}} base enriched in Fe and Cu. Layers have sharp boundaries that can be planar or undulating. The base of the sphalerite layers commonly contains acicular crystals of sphalerite oriented perpendicular to the layer boundary. Acicular sphalerite is enriched in Sb, Ag and Cu, which substitute for Zn in the structure. The base of the layers is commonly marked by chains of complex inclusions of chalcopyrite, galena, <b>pyrargyrite</b> and freibergite, which mimic color banding.

The acicular sphalerite probably inverted from rapidly precipitated wurtzite formed from a solution enriched in Cu, Fe, Ag and Sb, an inference that is supported by chains of sulfides and sulfosalts at the base of ferroan sphalerite layers. The precipitation of acicular wurtzite would have depleted the solution in Cu, Ag, Sb, the acicular crystals becoming embedded in Zn-rich sphalerite.

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} composition of native gold and electrum from auriferous vein and gold-silver vein de-posits in Japan has been analyzed and summarized. The Ag/Au ratios of native gold and electrum {{from these two}} types of deposits are distinct, i. e., 10 - 20 Ag at % (auri-ferous vein) and 30 - 70 Ag at % (gold-silver vein). Thermo-chemical calculations uggest hat the Ag/Au ratio of native gold and electrum should decrease with increasing chloride concentration and temperature. This is consistent with analytical results of native gold and electrum and fluid inclusion studies. Based on the Ag content of native gold and electrum, the Fe content of sphalerite, and the estimated temperatures, it is deduced that the sulfur activity for auriferous vein-type systems was lower than that of gold-silver vein-type systems. The two types of gold vein deposits occurring in Japan are "auriferous veins in sedimentary terrain " and "gold-silver veins in volcanic terrain " according to the classification by Boyle (1979, 1984). In this paper these deposits are called auriferous vein and gold-silver vein deposits, respectively. There are distinct differences in the characteristics of these two deposit ypes. For instance, the gold-silver vein de-posits occur mainly in Tertiary/Quaternary volcanic re-gions while the auriferous vein deposits occur in sedimen-tary terrain associated with Cretaceous felsic plutonic activity or in regionally metamorphosed rocks (Fig. 1).

The isomer shift for this mineral is the most negative of any Sb(V) reported in the literature. The opposite was noted for the oxides, i. e. in all cases the antimony is Sb(V). Isomer shifts were often found to be dependent on the metal ligand which is not bonded directly to the antimony, but through an oxygen or sulfur bridge. Linewidth data often indicate whether one or more than one antimony site exist in the crystal.
