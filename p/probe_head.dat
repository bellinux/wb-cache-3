40|$|AbstractM icro spherical stylus tip {{plays an}} {{important}} role in micro coordinate measuring machine (CMM) metrology. A micro CM M needs a tiny spherical stylus tip with diameter less than 0. 125 mm to measure micro components such as micro slots, micro holes, and micro gears. With combination WEDG technology and one pulse electro discharge (OPED) process, micro spherical stylus tips with 60 μm in diameter has been fabricated successfully. However the time consuming of a long micro electrode tool fabrication is still a critical problem by WEDG technology. In order to fabricate micro ball-ended stylus tips more efficiency, this study presents a new hybrid process with combination micro ECM and OPED to produce micro spherical sty lus tips for micro CMM's <b>probing</b> <b>heads.</b> To fabricate high quality spherical stylus tips, the parameters of micro ECM and OPED such as feeding speed, concentration of electrolyte, and pulse duration will be also investigated in this study. It is expected that micro spherical stylus for CMM's <b>probing</b> <b>heads</b> could be fabricated more efficiency by this hybrid machining process...|$|R

50|$|The <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> {{located in}} the CSM was {{self-centering}} and gimbal-mounted to the probe piston. As the <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> engaged in {{the opening of the}} drogue socket, three spring-loaded latches depressed and engaged. These latches allowed a so-called 'soft dock' state and enabled the pitch and yaw movements in the two vehicles to subside. Excess movement in the vehicles during the 'hard dock' process could cause damage to the docking ring and put stress on the upper tunnel. A depressed locking trigger link at each latch allowed a spring-loaded spool to move forward, maintaining the toggle linkage in an over-center locked position. In {{the upper end of the}} Lunar Module tunnel, the drogue, which was constructed of 1-inch-thick aluminum honeycomb core, bonded front and back to aluminum face sheets, was the receiving end of the <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> capture latches.|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{this was}} done by {{designing}} passive probes with two signal paths, requiring a differential amplifier stage {{at or near the}} oscilloscope. (A very few early probes fitted the differential amplifier into a rather-bulky <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> using vacuum tubes.) With advances in solid-state electronics, it has become practical to put the differential amplifier directly within the <b>probe</b> <b>head,</b> greatly easing the requirements {{on the rest of the}} signal path (since it now becomes single-ended rather than differential and the need to match parameters on the signal path is removed). A modern differential probe usually has two metal extensions which can be adjusted by the operator to simultaneously touch the appropriate two points on the DUT.

50|$|All scope probes {{contain some}} {{facility}} for grounding (earthing) the probe to the circuit's reference voltage. This is usually accomplished by connecting {{a very short}} pigtail wire from the <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> to ground. Inductance in the ground wire can lead to distortion in the observed signal, so this wire is kept as short as possible. Some probes use a small ground foot instead of any wire, allowing the ground link to be as short as 10 mm.|$|E

In a standard configuration, the sampling volume is about a cylinder of water with a diameter of 6 mm and a height of 9 mm, although newer laboratory ADVs may have smaller sampling volume (e.g. Sontek microADV, Nortek Vectrino+).|$|E

40|$|International audienceICRF-induced SOL {{modifications}} are mapped for {{the first}} time in 2 -D around Tore Supra ICRF antennas using reciprocating Langmuir <b>probes.</b> When <b>probe</b> <b>heads</b> are magnetically connected to powered antennas, radical modifications of floating potentials Vfloat, effective temperatures Teff and ion saturation currents are observed. Vfloat perturbations are located radially near antenna limiters, with a typical extension 2 cm. Poloidally they are locally minimal near the equatorial plane, and maximal near antenna box corners. Two possible interpretations for increased Teff are proposed: localised electron heating and RF loop voltage induced along probe circuit. Both interpretations rely on the generation of parallel RF fields by parallel RF currents on the antenna structure. The topology of such currents could explain the 2 -D structure of Teff maps. Both interpretations also imply a positive DC biasing of the antenna environment. Differential biasing of nearby flux tubes drives DC E × B 0 convection that could explain 2 -D density patterns...|$|R
50|$|Active scope probes use a {{high-impedance}} high-frequency amplifier {{mounted in}} the <b>probe</b> <b>head,</b> and a screened lead. The purpose of the amplifier is not gain, but isolation (buffering) between the circuit under test and the oscilloscope and cable, loading the circuit with only a low capacitance and high DC resistance, and matching the oscilloscope input. Active probes are commonly seen by the circuit under test as a capacitance of 1 picofarad or less in parallel with 1 megohm resistance. Probes {{are connected to the}} oscilloscope with a cable matching the characteristic impedance of the oscilloscope input. Tube based active probes were used before the advent of high-frequency solid-state electronics, using a small vacuum tube as cathode follower amplifier.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the {{ball-pen}} probe {{is shown in the}} schematic picture.

It is necessary to find the sufficient retraction of the ball-pen probe collector in order to reach , which strongly depends on the magnetic field's value.

5000|$|The {{most common}} design inserts a 9 megohm {{resistor}} {{in series with}} the probe tip. The signal is then transmitted from the <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> to the oscilloscope over a special lossy coaxial cable {{that is designed to}} minimize capacitance and ringing. The invention of this cable has been traced to John Kobbe, an engineer working for Tektronix. The resistor serves to minimize the loading that the cable capacitance would impose on the DUT. In series with the normal 1 megohm input impedance of the oscilloscope, the 9 megohm resistor creates a 10× voltage divider so such probes are normally known as either low cap(acitance) probes or 10× probes, often printed with the letter X or x instead of the multiplication sign, and usually spoken of as [...] "a times-ten probe".|$|E

50|$|In the past, {{the bypass}} {{capacitor}} in the <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> was adjustable (to achieve this 10× attenuation). More modern probe designs use a laser-trimmed thick-film electronic circuit {{in the head}} that combines the 9 megohm resistor with a fixed-value bypass capacitor; they then place a small adjustable capacitor in parallel with the oscilloscope's input capacitance. Either way, the probe must be adjusted so that it provides uniform attenuation at all frequencies. This {{is referred to as}} compensating the probe. Compensation is usually accomplished by probing a 1 kHz square wave and adjusting the compensating capacitor until the oscilloscope displays the most square waveshape. Most oscilloscopes have a 1 kHz calibration source on their front panels since probe compensation must be done every time a 10:1 probe is attached to an oscilloscope input. Newer, faster probes have more complex compensation arrangements and may occasionally require further adjustments.|$|E

50|$|Buoyant Force Transducer: the {{buoyancy}} force {{produced by}} a float in a homogeneous liquid {{is equal to the}} weight of the liquid that is displaced by the float. Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of ± 0.005 RD units. The submersible <b>probe</b> <b>head</b> contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors. The output signals of the sensors are mixed in a dedicated electronics module that provides a single output voltage whose magnitude is a direct linear measure of the quantity to be measured.|$|E
