40|$|Lecture component: Survey {{of organic}} {{chemistry}} as they occur {{in an aqueous}} environment, highlighting reactions important for understanding the properties and reactivity of biomolecules in the cell, particularly proteins, ribonucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. Topics of emphasis: properties and reactivity of functional groups, acids and bases, chirality, <b>prochirality,</b> energetics, reaction mechanisms, including electrophilic additions, nucleophilic substitutions, carbonyl additions, acyl substitutions, carbonyl condensations, eliminations, oxidations, reductions, isomerizations and rearrangements. All types of reactions {{will be discussed in}} the context of key biological transformations, along with types of enzyme inhibitors employed in mechanistic studies and in drug development. Lab component: How are biomolecules (peptides and proteins, DNA and RNA, lipids, carbohydrates, other) characterized and studied? A variety of analytical approaches will be investigated, including UV-vis, IR, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. Other topics may include, but are not limited to: preparation of solutions for the biochemistry lab, buffers, determination of pKa, simple synthetic transformations (with purification and analysis), synthetic transformations using enzymes, and the use of enzyme inhibitors in mechanistic studies and drug design...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{statistical}} and other considerations which determine {{the validity and}} reproducibility of stereospecific hydrogen NMR assignments obtained by the floating <b>prochirality</b> method. In this method, the assignment of a prochiral configuration of hydrogens at selected centers is allowed to ‘float’ during the structure refinement, {{and the distribution of}} prochiral orientations in highly refined structures is subjected to statistical analysis. The underlying statistical basis for this approach is examined and potential limitations of current approaches are identified. As an example, approximately 1300 distance constraints obtained from NOESY spectra of oxidized horse cytochrome c have been used to examine several computational strategies. Repeated calculations were done by several different methods on both the whole molecule (104 residues plus heme) and on a 23 -residue fragment containing two helices, a turn, and flanking residues. The results show that, even with NOE constraints alone, one third of the centers may be reproducibly assigned, provided appropriate precautions are taken. These precautions include adjustments for multiple statistical comparisons and characterization of statistical interactions between prochiral centers. The analysis demonstrates that inadequately constrained systems, such as fragments from a larger molecule, may produce misleading results, raising concerns about methods which rely solely on intraresidue and sequential interresidue contraints. A mathematical model describing interactions among prochiral centers is described and validated, and protocols for assignment and statistical validation are presented...|$|E
