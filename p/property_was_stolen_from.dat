50|$|Theft is {{a felony}} if {{the value of}} the {{property}} exceeds $300 or the <b>property</b> <b>is</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> the person of another. Thresholds at $10,000, $100,000, and $500,000 determine how severe the punishment can be. The location <b>from</b> which <b>property</b> <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>is</b> also a factor in sentencing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of patterns of income genera-tion among 202 active heroin users in South West Sydney. We explore both sources of income and the relative contribution of different types of income generating activities, including drug sales and related activities, property crime, prostitution, legitimate income and avoided expenditures. Despite claims that heroin use leads inevitably to property crime, drug market activities accounted for a greater proportion of drug user income in this sample. Results indicate that law enforcement crack-downs that reduce opportunities for generating income from the drug market may increase property crime by heroin users. Acquisitive property crime has significant social and economic costs. A recent estimate suggests that between two and three billion dollars worth of <b>property</b> <b>is</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> homes, shops, cars, factories and warehouses in Australia each year (Freiberg, 1997, p. 237). Very little of this <b>property</b> <b>is</b> recovered and a large amount presumably finds its way onto the stolen property market in various ways (Allen, 2000). Four groups of offenders can be identified as major contributors to the property crime market: burglars (Jochelson, 1995) : large-scale shoplifter...|$|R

60|$|Then the {{newspapers}} reached them. When {{it became clear}} to him that there existed in Carmarthenshire so strong a doubt as to the validity of the will under which the <b>property</b> <b>was</b> at present held, then Mr Owen's visits to the house became rarer and different in their nature. Then he was willing to be simply the friend of the family, and as such he sought no especial interviews with Isabel. Between him and Isabel no word was spoken as to the contents of the newspaper. But between Mr Brodrick and the clergyman many words were spoken. Mr Brodrick declared at once to his intended son-in-law his belief in the accusations which were implied,--which were implied at first, but afterwards made in terms so frightfully clear. When such words as those were said and printed there could, he urged, be no doubt as to what was believed in Carmarthen. And why should it be believed without ground that any man had done so hideous a deed as to destroy a will? The lawyer's hair stood almost on end as he spoke of the atrocity; but yet he believed it. Would a respectable newspaper such as the Carmarthen Herald commit itself to such a course without the strongest assurance? What was it to the Carmarthen Herald? Did not the very continuance of the articles make it clear that the readers of the paper were in accordance with the writer? Would the public of Carmarthen sympathise in such an attack without the strongest ground? He, the attorney, fully believed in Cousin Henry's guilt; but he was not on that account sanguine as to the proof. If, during his sojourn at Llanfeare, either immediately before the old squire's death or after it, but before the funeral, he had been enabled to lay his hand upon the will and destroy it, what hope would there be of evidence of such guilt? As to that idea of forcing the man to tell such a tale against himself by the torment of cross-examination, he did not believe it at all. A man who had been strong enough to destroy a will would be too strong for that. Perhaps he thought that any man would be too strong, not having known Cousin Henry. Among all the possible chances which occurred to his mind,--and his mind at this time was greatly filled with such considerations,--nothing like the truth suggested itself to him. His heart was tormented by the idea that the <b>property</b> had <b>been</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> his child, that the glory of being father-in-law to Llanfeare had been filched from himself, and that no hope for redress remained. He sympathised altogether with the newspaper. He felt grateful to the newspaper. He declared the editor to be a man specially noble and brave in his calling. But he did not believe that the newspaper would do any good either to him or to Isabel.|$|R

40|$|Combating {{internet}} piracy is {{a global}} challenge. Fundamentally, piracy lingers because {{it has become a}} culturally acceptable behaviour that is under-enforced. The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is the latest enforcement measure aimed at sinking the pirate ship. The first part of this paper will explore piracy as a cultural phenomenon and how it interacts with Australian civil and criminal law. Pirates, who have awareness that their plundering is wrong, convince themselves that: there are moral grounds for their escapades; there is a government conspiracy to reduce internet freedom; they are fighting globalisation by attacking the corporations who reap disproportionate booty, often at the expense of artists and creators; there are no negative moral dilemmas to consider as the victims <b>are</b> faceless; <b>property</b> <b>is</b> not being <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> a physical store, and with the potential for endless downloads, there are no vendors who will suffer from having less stock to sell. But most importantly, pirates {{know that there is a}} slim chance of being caught when they are downloading or uploading for personal use, and non-commercial gain. Primarily, piracy is tempting because it is easy, convenient and free. The second part of this paper will look at the legislative response to piracy under Australian law. Australia already has a draconian set of intellectual property (IP) laws which expanded in 2006 to meet the requirements of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA). The scope of copyright infringement offences were broadened to target individuals, and penalties were increased. However, there is a difference between creating stringent laws and enforcing them. As Australia has not tested its new IP laws in relation to individuals on a grand scale, international comparison becomes valuable. From 2003 - 2008 the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) underwent mass waves of individual suits against music pirates in America. All but two of the 18, 000 targets settled out of court. Thirdly, this paper will provide an analysis of how the ACTA might impact on piracy in Australia. The ACTA is a plurilateral agreement currently being negotiated by ten counties and the European Union (EU). Its alleged purpose is to establish international standards for enforcing IP rights. Its negotiators (which include Australian representatives) provided a public draft (“the Public Draft”) of the proposed text in April 2010. It was criticised for going beyond enforcement measures and into creating substantive law. This paper will address the specific concerns expressed by leading analysts of the ACTA that implementation of these measures would mean further targeting of individuals and greater criminalisation of offences to the detriment of civil liberties and internet freedom...|$|R
