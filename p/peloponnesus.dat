5|$|Prior to the battle, the Hellenes {{remembered the}} Dorians, an ethnic {{distinction}} which {{applied to the}} Spartans, as the conquerors and displacers of the Ionians in the <b>Peloponnesus.</b> After the battle, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation, a phenomenon known as Laconophilia.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the <b>Peloponnesus)</b> {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the <b>Peloponnesus</b> again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to show them that the Athenians were willing to do everything necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} year the Persian invasion force, {{led by the}} Persian king in person, had scored victories at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium and conquered Thessaly, Boeotia, Euboea and Attica. However, at the ensuing Battle of Salamis, the Allied Greek navy had won an unlikely but decisive victory, preventing the conquest of the <b>Peloponnesus.</b> Xerxes then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general Mardonius to finish off the Greeks the following year.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the <b>Peloponnesus)</b> {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica {{fell to the}} Persian army, which {{captured}} and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the <b>Peloponnesus</b> from Persian conquest. Both sides thus sought a naval victory that might decisively alter {{the course of the}} war. The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into the narrow Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 479BC the Greeks {{assembled}} a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the <b>Peloponnesus.</b> The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused {{to be drawn into}} the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. Thinking the Greeks in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but the Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles {{therefore}} {{suggested a}} second strategy to the allies. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the <b>Peloponnesus)</b> {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. The pass could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual strategy {{was adopted by the}} congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should all else fail, whilst the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles, therefore, {{suggested}} a second strategy to the Greeks: {{the route to}} southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica, and the <b>Peloponnesus)</b> would require Xerxes' army to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae, which could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians from bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. Congress adopted this dual-pronged strategy. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, should it come to that, whilst {{the women and children}} of Athens had been evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|Thus it {{was that}} the Allied fleet {{remained}} off the coast of Salamis into September, despite the imminent arrival of the Persians. Even after Athens fell to the advancing Persian army, the Allied fleet still remained off the coast of Salamis, trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle. Partly as a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the navies finally engaged in the cramped Straits of Salamis. There, the large Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to manoeuvre and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet attacked, and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships, and thus ensuring the <b>Peloponnesus</b> would not be outflanked.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 209 BC, Philip {{received}} requests for help from his ally the Achaean League in the <b>Peloponnesus</b> who were being attacked by Sparta and the Aetolians. He also heard that Attalus had been elected {{one of the two}} supreme commanders of the Aetolian League, and rumors that he intended to crossover the Aegean from Asia Minor. Philip marched south into Greece. At Lamia he was met by an Aetolian force, supported by Roman and Pergamene auxiliaries, under the command of Attalus' colleague as strategos, the Aetolian Pyrrhias. Philip won two battles at Lamia, inflicting heavy casualties on Pyrrhias' troops. The Aetolians and their allies were forced to retreat inside the city walls, where they remained, unwilling to give battle.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the <b>Peloponnesus,</b> felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
5|$|However, Sparta {{was then}} thrown into disarray by {{internal}} machinations. The citizens of Aegina had {{submitted to the}} Persian ambassadors, and the Athenians, troubled {{by the possibility of}} Persia using Aegina as a naval base, asked Sparta to intervene. Cleomenes travelled to Aegina to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to Cleomenes's fellow king Demaratus, who supported their stance. Cleomenes responded by having Demaratus declared illegitimate, {{with the help of the}} priests at Delphi (whom he bribed); Demaratus was replaced by his cousin Leotychides. Now faced with two Spartan kings, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour. However, in Sparta news emerged of the bribes Cleomenes had given at Delphi, and he was expelled from the city. He then sought to rally the northern <b>Peloponnesus</b> to his cause, at which the Spartans relented, and invited him back to the city. By 491 BC though, Cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day. Cleomenes was succeeded by his half-brother Leonidas I.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, {{including}} some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, Thrace, Macedon and the Aegean islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed. However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes then led the second invasion personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated in the twin battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium on land and at sea respectively. All of Greece except the <b>Peloponnesus</b> thus fell into Persian hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the Allied navy, the Persians suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the Battle of Plataea, ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there was}} some tension among the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the Isthmus, but whose fleet {{was the key to}} the security of the <b>Peloponnesus,</b> felt that they had been treated unfairly, and so they refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus. Mardonius moved to break the stalemate, by offering peace to the Athenians, using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediate. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the Athenians reject the Persians' offer. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if they were not aided. In response, the Spartans summoned a large army from the Peloponnese cities and marched to meet the Persians.|$|E
5|$|This {{time the}} mere {{presence}} of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided {{that he would have to}} break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 508510 Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the <b>Peloponnesus</b> would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E
5|$|The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies {{changed the}} nature of the war. The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land, {{realising}} they probably could not breach it. This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one. Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis. However, as successful as this was, {{there was no need for}} the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign. Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder. After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance. In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the <b>Peloponnesus.</b> Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this. He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously. The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win. It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms. Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee. The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake.|$|E
25|$|Most of the dialect sub-groups {{listed above}} had further subdivisions, {{generally}} {{equivalent to a}} city-state and its surrounding territory, or to an island. Doric notably had several intermediate divisions as well, into Island Doric (including Cretan Doric), Southern <b>Peloponnesus</b> Doric (including Laconian, the dialect of Sparta), and Northern <b>Peloponnesus</b> Doric (including Corinthian).|$|E
25|$|After the Greek Dark Ages, {{much of the}} {{population}} of the <b>Peloponnesus</b> spoke Dorian, while the evidence of Linear B and literary traditions, such as the works of Homer, suggests that {{the population}} spoke Achaean – Mycenaean Greek – before. In addition, society in the <b>Peloponnesus</b> had undergone a total change from states ruled by kings presiding over a Palace economy to a caste system ruled by a Dorian master ethnos at Sparta.|$|E
25|$|Laconophilia (also {{known as}} Laconism) is love or admiration of Sparta {{and of the}} Spartan culture or constitution. The term derives from Laconia, {{the part of the}} <b>Peloponnesus</b> where the Spartans lived.|$|E
25|$|The legendary {{period of}} Spartan history is {{believed}} {{to fall into the}} Dark Age. It treats the mythic heroes such as the Heraclids and the Perseids, offering a view of the occupation of the <b>Peloponnesus</b> that contains both fantastic and possibly historical elements. The subsequent proto-historic period, combining both legend and historical fragments, offers the first credible history.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{episode in}} the history of the region took place in 1716–18, when the territories ranging from Dalmatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina to Belgrade and the Danube basin became the battleground for a new Austria-Ottoman war launched by Prince Eugene of Savoy. Some Serbs sided once again with Austria. After a peace treaty was signed in Požarevac, the Ottomans lost all its possessions in the Danube basin, as well as today's northern Serbia and northern Bosnia, parts of Dalmatia and the <b>Peloponnesus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sparta's initial {{strategy}} was to invade Attica, but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused many deaths, including that of Pericles. At {{the same time the}} Athenian fleet landed troops in the <b>Peloponnesus,</b> winning battles at Naupactus (429) and Pylos (425). However, these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421).|$|E
25|$|Various ancient peoples {{enjoyed a}} {{reputation}} for skill with the sling. Thucydides mentions the Acarnanians and Livy refers to the inhabitants of three Greek cities on the northern coast of the <b>Peloponnesus</b> as expert slingers. Livy also mentions {{the most famous of}} ancient skillful slingers: the people of the Balearic Islands. Of these people Strabo writes: And their training in the use of slings used to be such, from childhood up, that they would not so much as give bread to their children unless they first hit it with the sling.|$|E
25|$|The first fleet {{action of}} the war in the Mediterranean was the Battle of Cape Matapan. It was a decisive Allied victory, fought off the <b>Peloponnesus</b> coast of Greece from 27 March to 29 March 1941 in which Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy forces, under the command of the British Admiral Cunningham, intercepted those of the Italian Regia Marina, under Admiral Angelo Iachino. The Allies sank the heavy cruisers Fiume, Zara and Pola and the destroyers Vittorio Alfieri and Giosue Carducci, and damaged the {{battleship}} Vittorio Veneto. The British lost one torpedo plane and suffered light damage to some ships.|$|E
25|$|A {{dark age}} of poverty, low {{population}} and metals starvation is not {{compatible with the}} idea of great population movements of successful warriors wielding the latest military equipment sweeping into the <b>Peloponnesus</b> and taking it over to rebuild civilization their way. This dark age consists of three periods of art and archaeology: sub-Mycenaean, Proto-geometric and Geometric. The most successful, the Geometric, seems to fit the Dorians better, but there is a gap, and this period is not localized to and did not begin in Dorian territory. It is more to be associated with Athens, an Ionian state.|$|E
25|$|Ionia {{was part}} of a group of {{settlements}} on the central Aegean coast bounded by Lydia to the east, and Caria to the south, known as the Ionian league. Ionians had been expelled from the <b>Peloponnesus</b> by the Dorians, and were resettled on the Aegean coastline of Anatolia by the Athenians to whose land they had fled. By the time of the last Lydian king, Croesus (560–545 BC, Ionia fell under Lydian, and then Persian rule. With the defeat of Persia by the Greeks, Ionia again became independent until absorbed into the Roman province of Asia.|$|E
25|$|The first fibulae design, violin bow fibulae (drahtbugel in German), {{appeared}} in the late Bronze Age. This simple design, with a unilateral spring, looks remarkably like a modern safety pin. The violin bow fibula has a low flat arch; the body runs parallel to the pin so it resembles a violin bow. The bow could be round, square, or flat and ribbon-like in cross-section. Some had simple punched or incised decoration on the bow. Violin bow fibula, such as the Peschiera type and the Unter-Radl type, {{was introduced in the}} 14th century BC (Late Mycenean III era) by the Myceneans on the Greek <b>Peloponnesus.</b> The fibula soon spread to Crete, Cyprus and Mycenean trading posts in Sicily.|$|E
25|$|Aegina, {{according}} to Herodotus, was {{a colony of}} Epidaurus, to which state it was originally subject. Its placement between Attica and the <b>Peloponnesus</b> made it a site of trade even earlier, and its earliest inhabitants allegedly came from Asia Minor. Minoan ceramics {{have been found in}} contexts of ca. 2000 BC. The famous Aegina Treasure, now in the British Museum is estimated to date between 1700 and 1500 BC. The discovery on the island of a number of gold ornaments belonging to the last period of Mycenaean art suggests that Mycenaean culture existed in Aegina for some generations after the Dorian conquest of Argos and Lacedaemon. It is probable that the island was not doricised before the 9th century BC.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Messenian War, Sparta {{established}} {{itself as}} a local power in <b>Peloponnesus</b> {{and the rest of}} Greece. During the following centuries, Sparta's reputation as a land-fighting force was unequalled. In 480 BC a small force of Spartans, Thespians, and Thebans led by King Leonidas (approximately 300 were full Spartiates, 700 were Thespians, and 400 were Thebans although these numbers do not reflect casualties incurred prior to the final battle), made a legendary last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae against the massive Persian army, inflicting very high casualties on the Persian forces before finally being encircled. The superior weaponry, strategy, and bronze armour of the Greek hoplites and their phalanx again proved their worth one year later when Sparta assembled at full strength and led a Greek alliance against the Persians at the battle of Plataea.|$|E
25|$|Before the Hellenic era, {{two major}} {{cultures}} had dominated the region: the Minoan (c. 2800–1100 BC), and the Mycenaean (c. 1500–1100 BC). Minoan {{is the name}} given by modern historians {{to the culture of}} the people of ancient Crete, known for its elaborate and richly decorated palaces, and for its pottery painted with floral and marine motifs. The Mycenaean culture, which flourished on the <b>Peloponnesus,</b> was quite different in character. Its people built citadels, fortifications and tombs rather than palaces, and decorated their pottery with bands of marching soldiers rather than octopus and seaweed. Both these civilizations came to an end around 1100 BC, that of Crete possibly because of volcanic devastation, and that of Mycenae because of an invasion by the Dorian people who lived on the Greek mainland. Following these events, there was a period from which few signs of culture remain. This period is thus often referred to as a Dark Age.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of Ottoman territorial retreat; some territories were lost by the treaty: Austria received all of Hungary and Transylvania except the Banat; Venice obtained most of Dalmatia along with the Morea (the <b>Peloponnesus</b> peninsula in southern Greece); Poland recovered Podolia. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Ottoman Empire continued losing its territories, including Greece, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and the Balkans in the 1912–1913 Balkan Wars. Anatolia remained multi-ethnic until the early 20th century (see Rise of Nationalism under the Ottoman Empire). Its inhabitants were of varied ethnicities, including Turks, Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Greeks, Frenchs, and Italians (particularly from Genoa and Venice). Faced with territorial losses on all sides the Ottoman Empire under the rule of the Three Pashas forged an alliance with Germany who supported it with troops and equipment. The Ottoman Empire entered World War I (1914–1918) {{on the side of the}} Central Powers and was ultimately defeated. During the war, major atrocities such as mass murder and death marches intentionally denying food and water to the deportees were committed by the Ottoman government against the Armenians, Assyrians and Pontic Greeks causing millions of deaths. Following World War I, the huge conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states.|$|E

25|$|The Second Crusade (1147–1148) offered Roger an {{opportunity}} to revive attacks on the Byzantine Empire, the traditional Norman enemy to the East. It also afforded him {{an opportunity}}, {{through the agency of}} Theodwin, a cardinal ever-vigilant for Crusade supporters, to strike up a correspondence with Conrad III of Germany in an effort to break his alliance with Manuel I Comnenus. Roger himself never went on an expedition against Byzantium, instead handing command to the skillful George. In 1147, George set sail from Otranto with seventy galleys to attack Corfu. According to Nicetas Choniates, the island capitulated thanks to George's bribes (and the tax burden of the imperial government), welcoming the Normans as their liberators. Leaving a garrison of 1,000 men, George sailed on to the <b>Peloponnesus.</b> He sacked Athens and quickly moved on to the Aegean Islands. He ravaged the coast all along Euboea and the Gulf of Corinth and penetrated as far as Thebes, Greece, where he pillaged the silk factories and carried off the Jewish damask, brocade, and silk weavers, taking them back to Palermo where they formed the basis for the Sicilian silk industry. George capped the expedition with a sack of Corinth, in which the relics of Saint Theodore were stolen, and then returned to Sicily. In 1149, however, Corfu was retaken. George went on a punitive expedition against Constantinople, but could not land and instead defied the Byzantine emperor by firing arrows against the palace windows. Despite this act, his expedition left no enduring effects.|$|E
500|$|Following {{up on this}} victory, Epaminondas invaded <b>Peloponnesus</b> in 370 BC {{and began}} {{dismantling}} the basis of Spartan dominance. Spartan power rested on the forced labour of the helots of Messenia, which allowed the entire male Spartan population to dedicate themselves to warfare. This focused military training system had previously enabled Sparta to exert power {{out of proportion to}} its small population. However, after their losses at Leuctra, the Spartans were unable to resist Epaminondas's invasion, and he marched into Messenia and liberated the helots, thereby permanently crippling Sparta. The Thebans then began to extend their influence over Greece, effectively replacing the Spartan hegemony with their own. The Theban generals Pelopidas and Epaminondas campaigned all over Greece for the next 9 years to further Theban power and influence. In 362 BC, Epaminondas's fourth invasion of the <b>Peloponnesus,</b> which reached its climax at the Battle of Mantinea, brought almost every state in Greece into the conflict, on one side or the other. Although the Thebans and their allies were victorious at Mantinea, Epaminondas was killed, and Theban losses were heavy. Xenophon, summing up his account of Mantinea, suggests that: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 367BC, Epaminondas again invaded the <b>Peloponnesus.</b> This time an Argive army {{captured}} part of the Isthmus on Epaminondas's request, allowing the Theban army to enter the <b>Peloponnesus</b> unhindered. On this occasion, Epaminondas marched to [...] Achaea, seeking to secure their allegiance to Thebes. [...] No army dared to challenge him in the field, and the Achaean oligarchies therefore acquiesced to the request that they be allied to Thebes. Epaminondas' acceptance of the Achaean oligarchies roused protests by both the Arcadians and his political rivals, and his settlement was thus shortly reversed: democracies were set up, and the oligarchs exiled. These democratic governments were short-lived, since the pro-Spartan aristocrats from all the cities banded together and attacked each city in turn, re-establishing the oligarchies. According to G.L. Cawkwell, [...] "the sequel perhaps showed the good sense of Epaminondas. When these exiles recovered the cities, they 'no longer took a middle course'." [...] In the light of their treatment by Thebes, they abandoned their previously neutral stance, and thereafter [...] "fought zealously {{in support of the}} Lacedaemonians".* Cawkwell, Epaminondas and Thebes, 269; Roy, [...] "Thebes in the 360s BC", 197198 ...|$|E
500|$|Finally, in mid-August, the Persian {{army was}} sighted across the Malian Gulf {{approaching}} Thermopylae. With the Persian army's arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war. Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of Corinth and blocking the passage to <b>Peloponnesus.</b> The Phocians and Locrians, whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas calmed the panic {{and agreed to}} defend Thermopylae. According to Plutarch, {{when one of the}} soldiers complained that, [...] "Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun", Leonidas replied, [...] "Won't it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?" [...] Herodotus reports a similar comment, but attributes it to Dienekes.|$|E
