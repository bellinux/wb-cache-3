5000|$|The {{permitted}} {{level of}} delay ripple (or phase ripple) introduced by a circuit {{is very much}} dependent on the application in which the network is being used. [...] In situations where waveform or pulse fidelity is important, then the permitted ripple is only small. In the case of analogue television waveforms, for example, the picture content also has a bearing on the acceptable levels of system distortion. (With TV pictures, phase ripple will give effects similar to ‘ghosting’ or multipath reception, where low level multiple images are superimposed on the main picture. Also ‘ringing’ after transient edges is another result of non-linear phase. The acceptability of the <b>picture</b> <b>impairment</b> often depends on the scene being displayed). Wheeler, using the method of [...] "paired echoes", suggested that a phase ripple of 0.1 rads, p-p (or 6 degrees, p-p) was tolerable in TV signals. [...] Other writers suggest that a group delay ripple of a few percent is permissible. [...] In making a judgement of permitted distortion, limits can be set on waveform asymmetry, the level of overshoots and pre-shoots, and rise-time degradation and this is discussed in the section on ‘Transient Testing’ later.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Prosopagnosia is {{a visual}} agnosia {{characterized}} by an inability to recognize previously known human faces and to learn new faces. The {{aim of this study}} was to present a forty-six year-old woman with congenital prosopagnosia, and to discuss the neural bases of perception and recognition of faces. The patients had a lifetime impairment in recognizing faces of family members, close friends, and even her own face in photos. She also had impairment in recognizing animals such as discriminating between cats and dogs. The patient's basic visual skills showed impairment in identifying and recognizing the animal form perception on the coding subtest of the WAIS-R, recognizing overlapping pictures (Luria), and in identifying silhouettes depicting animals and objects (VOSP). Unconventional tests using <b>pictures</b> evidenced <b>impairment</b> in her capacity to identify famous faces, facial emotions and animals. Her face perception abilities were preserved, but recognition could not take place. Therefore, it appears that the agnosia in this case best fits the group of categories termed "associative"...|$|R

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the roles of object {{contours}} and of rivalry and suppression in binocular vision are considered in a TV engineering context. Three experiments, using 3 D b/w stills, were conducted to explore subjective effects of irregular horizontal shifts at object contours (displacement errors), which {{are expected to be}} a typical <b>picture</b> <b>impairment</b> problem of future 3 D TV multi-viewpoint systems. Performance and rating tasks {{on a wide range of}} impairment magnitudes and various picture parameters served to give a quantitative estimate of the influence of displacement errors on: (1) correctness of binocular depth perception; and (2) picture quality. Two experiments (constant vs. variable location of impairments over time) with vertical grating stimuli showed binocular depth perception to withstand levels of up to 90 % misplaced contour elements in one part of the stereo pair. Quality assessments were much more critical. They depended both on the proportion of impaired pixels and on the maximum horizontal width of individual impairments. A corresponding stimulus model was found to be valid for pictures with natural content, too. Impairments were less annoying when visible by only one eye instead of both. A specific formulation is given of the influence of contrast and spatial frequency features on performance...|$|E

In this article therefore I will focus, primarily, on the psycholinguistic research that approached investigation of aphasia from a linguistic, theory-based perspective. It is my hope that the results presented below will further encourage linguists to view aphasiology as an important source for our understanding of the human linguistic capacity, and that aphasiologists will be further inspired to view theoretical linguistics as an important, if not necessary, tool for obtaining a better <b>picture</b> of language <b>impairment...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dysphagia is a {{frequent}} finding in neurological patients and is a symptom related to {{the severity of the}} clinical <b>picture.</b> The swallowing <b>impairments,</b> in these patients, increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia, that leads to death, in at least 6 % of patients, within the first year. Therefore, evaluation of the swallowing status is essential in patients with dysphagia and videofluoroscopic study of swallowing (VFSS) is the method of choice. It cannot be performed in all patients on account of the complexity of the procedure and since they must be brought to the Radiology Unit. In the 1980, a new bedside method was introduced, namely: fiber-optic endoscopic study of swallow (FESS) which is easy, low-cost, well-tolerated and repeatable. We use this bedside technique to assess swallowing function in patients with dysphagia admitted to acute care units, neurological and internal medicine units. The evaluation aims to indicate the safer nutritional method (oral intake, feeding tube or percutaneous gastrostomy) and, consequently, reducing the risk of aspiration pneumonia during hospitalization. We found that more than 50 % of the dysphagic patients present cerebrovascular injuries and in 2 % of the population, the first diagnostic hypothesis of Myasthenia Gravis can be made with the FESS technique. In 60 %, we indicate a change in nutritional method: in 20 % we indicate percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). With these indications, none of those patients had aspiration pneumonia.

40|$|Face {{recognition}} {{is one of}} the most important abilities for everyday social interactions. Congenital prosopagnosia, also referred to as glqqq face blindness", describes the innate, lifelong impairment to recognize other people by their face. About 2 of the population is affected. This thesis aimed to investigate different aspects of face processing in prosopagnosia in order to gain a clearer picture and a better understanding of this heterogeneous impairment. In a first study, various aspects of face recognition and perception were investigated to allow for a better understanding of the nature of prosopagnosia. The results replicated previous findings and helped to resolve discrepancies between former studies. In addition, it was found that prosopagnosics show an irregular response behavior in tests for holistic face recognition. We propose that prosopagnosics either switch between strategies or respond randomly when performing these tests. In a second study, the general face recognition deficit observed in prosopagnosia was compared to face recognition deficits occurring when dealing with other-race faces. Most humans find it hard to recognize faces of an unfamiliar race, a phenomenon called the "other-race effect". The study served to investigate if there is a possible common mechanism underlying prosopagnosia and the other-race effect, as both are characterized by problems in recognizing faces. The results allowed to reject this hypothesis, and yielded new insights about similarities and dissimilarities between prosopagnosia and the other-race effect. In the last study, a possible treatment of prosopagnosia was investigated. This was based on a single case in which a prosopagnosic reported a sudden improvement of her face recognition abilities after she started a special diet. The different studies cover diverse aspects of prosopagnosia: the nature of prosopagnosia and measurement of its characteristics, comparison to other face recognition impairments, and treatment options. The results serve to broaden the knowledge about prosopagnosia and to gain a more detailed <b>picture</b> of this <b>impairment...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aims of {{this review}} were (1) to {{provide insight into}} the natural course of upper-extremity (UE) {{impairments}} and UE activity limitations associated with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD), and (2) to provide an overview of outcome measures used to evaluate UE function and activity in patients with FSHD and LGMD. METHODS: Scientific literature databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane) were searched for relevant publications. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) studies that included persons with a diagnosis of FSHD or LGMD; and (2) studies that reported the natural course of the UE functions and/or activity with outcome measures at these levels. RESULTS: 247 publications were screened, of which 16 fulfilled the selection criteria. Most studies used manual muscle testing (MMT) to evaluate UE function and the Brooke Scale to evaluate UE mobility activities. The clinical <b>picture</b> of UE <b>impairments</b> and limitations of UE activities in FSHD and LGMD patients was highly variable. In general, FSHD and LGMD patients experience difficulty elevating their upper extremities and the execution of tasks takes considerably longer time. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of UE impairments and activity limitations associated with FSHD and LGMD is difficult to predict due to its high variability. Although measures like MMT and the Brooke Scale are often used, {{there is a lack of}} more specific outcome measures to assess UE function and UE capacity and performance in daily life. Measures such as 3 D motion analysis and electromyography (EMG) recordings are recommended to provide additional insight in UE function. Questionnaires like the Abilhand are recommended to assess UE capacity and accelerometry to assess UE performance in daily life. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: There is a need for specific outcome measures on the level of UE activity. Both the level of capacity and performance should be assessed. Possible outcome measures include 3 D motion analysis to assess UE function, questionnaires like the Abilhand to assess UE capacity and accelerometry to assess performance of UE activities in daily life...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the mechanism of the hemostasis system response to the stressors of various nature at successively increasing duration of exposure to stress. Physical exertion, hypothermia and hyperthermia were simulated as stress influences. Wistar type of rats was used as the object of the research. The data of vascular-thrombocyte and coagulative hemostasis as well as anticoagulative and fibrinolytic system activity were investigated. One-type reaction independent of irritant nature was observed during the investigation. As a responce to a single short-term exposure to an irritant the combined activation of aggregative platelet function, contact phase of blood coagulation as well as anticoagulative and fibrinolytic system is registered. As the exposure was prolonged successive involment of all the hemostasis system components into reciprocal response was registered in the bloodstream of the experimental animals. By the end of a single peak term exposure the totality of hemostasis features characteristic of the initial stage of DIC-syndrome was markedly registeredin experimental animals. When considering physical exertion it can be concluded that latent thrombin genesis firstly appeared after four hours of exposure increased dramatically by the end of eight hours stress. Similar picture of progressing thrombinemia is observed when analyzing the effect of hypothermia on hemostasis. Thus firstly registered after 30 minutes of hypothermia exposure the markers of thrombin genesis were eliminated from the blood stream in the process of thrombi formation by the end of the experimental exposure. Furthermore the rheological properties of blood in experimental animals were impaired as a result of a marked decrease of blood plasma fibrinolytic activity. When analyzing the effect of hyperthermia on hemostasis the manifested thrombinemia (at thermal exposure for 20 minutes) was shown to change to the picture characteristic of developed DIC-syndrome after 30 minutes of hypothermal exposure. Thus, on the basis of the results obtained during the experiments and described in this article, it can be assumed that the stress factors with prolonged exposure causing successively increasing signs of distress on the part of the hemostatic system. At increased exposure the signs of distress of the hemostasis system are successively increasing. It is manifested in the appearance and then augmenting of thrombinemia signs on the background of oppression of blood plasma fibrinolytic activity and reducing the anticoagulants concentration. It is necessary to consider the obtained results in situations accompanied by stress influence. Hemostasis <b>picture</b> demonstrates the <b>impairment</b> of the rheological properties of blood up to the development of DIC-syndrome at increased duration of exposure to stress. </span...|$|R

Necropsia e histopatologia do bovino naturalmente intoxicado não revelaram alterações significativas. A administração, por via oral, de 1 g/kg da brotação da planta causou a morte do bovino dentro de 5 h e 30 minutos após o início da administração, já pela administração de 0, 5 g/kg, a morte do animal ocorreu após 76 horas e 36 minutos. A dose de 0, 25 g/kg foi capaz de causar sintomas, mas não levou a morte. A sintomatologia caracterizou-se por arritmia cardíaca, taquicardia, aumento da freqüência respiratória, relutância em se mover, pulso venoso positivo, jugulares e grandes vasos ingurgitados, queda ao solo e movimentos de pedalagem, seguindo-se o óbito. À necropsia foram verificadas alterações compatíveis com às observadas na insuficiência cardíaca aguda, e o exame histopatológico revelou a lesão renal típica (degeneração hidrópica em túbulos contornados distais) de intoxicação por plantas que causam "morte súbita". Nos coelhos, a evolução variou entre menos de um minuto a dois minutos. O exame histopatológico do rim de dois coelhos também revelou a lesão microscópica característica. Essa planta ainda não havia sido mapeada nessa área do Estado do Rio de Janeiro. Conclui-se que a planta pode ser mais tóxica do que anteriormente descrito. Natural poisoning by Pseudocalymma elegans, {{a plant that}} causes "sudden death" and only occurs in the State of Rio de Janeiro, is described in a cow.

Postmortem and histopathological examinations of the natural case in the cow did not reveal significant alterations. Oral administration of 1 g/kg of the sprouts of P. elegans caused death of the calf 5 hours and 30 minutes after beginning of the administration. The dose of 0. 5 g/kg caused death of another calf with onset of symptoms after 3 hours and 24 minutes and a course of 73 hours and 12 minutes. Animals that ingest borderline doses may show a longer course with a characteristic clinical <b>picture</b> of heart <b>impairment.</b> The dose of 0. 25 g/kg did not cause death, but only clinical signs. Heart palpitation and arrhythmia, increase of breathing frequency, reluctance in moving, positive venous pulse, ingurgitated jugular veins, falling down and peddling movements shortly before death, were observed. At postmortem examination the lesions were those of acute heart insufficiency, and histopathological examination revealed the typical kidney lesion (hydropic-vacular degeneration in the distal convoluted tubules) seen in poisoning by plants that cause "sudden death". In the experimentally poisoned rabbits the clinical course was less than 1 - 2 minutes. In the kidney of two rabbits there was also the characteristic microscopic lesion. The presence of the plant in the county of Rio Bonito had not been known by the veterinarians. It is concluded that the plant could be more toxic than described before...|$|R
40|$|Magister Artium - MAFoetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is {{a global}} problem that affects various communities. FASD denotes a pattern of {{abnormalities}} intermittently seen in children born to women who consume huge quantities of alcohol during pregnancy (Church & Kaltenbach, 1997). Church and Kaltenbach (1997) suggest that FAS {{may be one of}} the primary causes of hearing, speech and other language problems in children. The two main approaches used to determine the effects of FASD on language are standardised language test (using a statistical approach to test some or all four domains of language, namely, phonology, syntax, morphology and semantics) applied to close-ended questionnaire answers and, to some extent, narrative analysis (in the course of which researchers use wordless picture books to analyse narratives in order to determine the social-communicative characteristics of individuals with FASD). Although the use of standardized measures of language might be helpful to determine problematic areas in relation to the different language domains (Wyper & Rasmussen, 2011), they do not show the difficulty with social-communicative functions which these children might be facing (Coggins, Friet, & Morgan, 1998). On the other hand, while narrative analysis addresses an important level of language (discourse level), it does not foreground the inherently interactive nature of language use and the problems that may be associated with communicative interactions. These shortcomings, in turn, suggest possible limitations in the interventions intended to address the language needs of children with FASD. There is, therefore, a need for complementary approaches that offer a more rounded <b>picture</b> of language <b>impairment</b> in children with FASD. In this study, three approaches are used in identifying features of the speech of children with FASD against the backdrop of comparisons with features in the speech of normally developing children. Firstly, conversational analysis (applied to spontaneous, open-ended speech) is introduced as a means to determine the more social-interactive aspects of speech impairment in children with FASD. Secondly, measures of linguistic aspects of speech (the mean length of utterance, Index of Productive Syntax and the number of different word roots) designed specifically for spontaneous speech are employed (they are applied to the same spontaneous data as the conversational analysis data). Thirdly, the more traditional standardized language test measures applied to non-spontaneous speech are used (covering the four domains of syntax, phonology, semantics, and pragmatics). The study’s objectives are to (1) compare patterns in the interactive speech of FASD children and normally developing children; (2) explore the relationship between FASD children and normally developing children in relation to both spontaneous speech measures and standardized measures of language; and (3) compare the impact of the primary caregiver's level of education on testing through spontaneous measures versus standardised measures. Using data from 14 children in the Bellville suburb of Cape Town, South Africa, the study finds that, on the conversational analysis measures, children with FASD, in contrast to normally developing children, tend to obey fewer rules of turn-taking, to overlap less, to engage less in self-repair and to struggle with management and maintenance of topics. The study also finds that children whose scores on the standardized language tests (with non-spontaneous data) suggest they have no language difficulty, especially in terms of phonology, obtained scores in measures of spontaneous speech that indicated language difficulty. The study also found that the socio-economic status of caregivers was a credible explanation for certain features in the speech of children with FASD is very similar to features in the speech of normally developing children. This finding highlights the role of family setting in mitigating the effects of FASD. National Research Foundation (NRF...|$|R
40|$|The overal aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{efficacy}} of a spasticity treatment in stroke patients within the ICF framework. Particularly, the effects of BoNT A injections in spastic lower and upper limb muscles will be investigated on impairment, activity, and social participation. The main question is to know if these injections are really effective in improving function in these patients. Indeed, no study to date has showed a benefit of spasticity treatment in terms of functional improvement in activity or participation. Spastic hemiparesis is the classical clinical <b>picture</b> of neurological <b>impairment</b> that limits locomotion and manual ability in stroke patients, which are activities essential for daily life activities and social participation. The ICF defines locomotion as the individual’s ability to move about effectively in his environment, and manual ability as the capacity to manage daily life activities requiring {{the use of the}} upper limbs, whatever the strategies involved. Locomotion and manual ability are classified in the ICF activity domain. The Rasch-built questionnaires notably allow overcoming the limitations of the ordinal scales that permit only limited computation and low power non-parametric statistics (Merbitz et al., 1989; Wright and Linacre, 1989). At present, we have new Rasch-built linear and unidimensional scales assessing manual ability (ABILHAND, Penta et al., 2001) and social participation (SATIS-Stroke, Bouffioulx et al., 2008) in stroke patients with high sensitivity. But until now, none of the existing scales available to assess locomotion ability were developed following the Rasch model and locomotion activities are frequently measured by ordinal scales. Therefore, the first stage of this thesis is to develop, using the Rasch probabilistic model, a new questionnaire (ABILOCO) assessing the walking ability of adult stroke patients focusing on the ICF activity domain. The development of this Rasch-built measure of locomotion ability is presented in Chapter 2. Chapter 2 presents the development of ABILOCO, a Rasch-built measure of locomotion ability and its validation in stroke patients. ABILOCO is a self-reporting questionnaire, focusing on the activity domain of the ICF. This questionnaire originally included 43 items representing a large sample of activities corresponding to the ICF definition of locomotion and was submitted to 100 adult stroke patients. The Rasch model selected 13 activities to define a linear and unidimensional measure of walking ability. The development and the validation of ABILOCO are presented as published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. A second section of Chapter 2 demonstrates the validity and reproducibility of the ABILOCO questionnaire when administered as either a self-assessment or third-party assessment. This section is presented as published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. With ABILOCO, we have now a questionnaire assessing the walking ability of stroke patients focusing on the ICF activity domain and presenting all Rasch psychometric qualities. ABILOCO will be very usefull in Chapter 4 to investigate the efficacy of BoNT A injections in spastic lower limb muscles in stroke patients on the activity domain. Chapter 3 presents a study concerning the reliability of lower limb kinematics, mechanics and energetics in stroke patients during gait as published in the Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine. To date, no study has yet evaluated the medium-term reliability of gait variables among adult stroke patients. This work aims thus to assess the reliability of gait variables at short (1 day) and medium (1 month) intervals and provides useful norms for the study presented in chapter 4. Indeed this observational study uses among others these gait variables to assess the efficacy of BoNT A treatment in stroke patients. It is therefore important to know when a variation between measurements of these variables {{is the result of a}} gait modification induced by the treatment and when it is related to the variability of the measurement used. Chapter 4 investigates the efficacy of BoNT A injections in several muscles on stiff-knee gait in stroke patients following the ICF framework. Stiff-knee gait is a common pattern of impaired kinematics in these patients; it is characterised by a lack of knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait cycle. The physiopathology and treatment of stiff-knee gait has not been clearly established. The overactivity of the Rectus Femoris is often cited (Riley and Kerrigan, 1998; Sung and Bang, 2000; Stoquart et al. 2008) but the altered activity of other muscles (Triceps Surae or Vasti) could also take place in the physiopathology (Goldberg et al., 2004). To our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated BoNT A injections in multiple muscles for the treatment of stiff-knee gait. In addition, the effects of BoNT A injections have only been shown to improve impairments and the effects of BoNT A injection on patient activity and participation in social activities remains uncertain. The main aim of Chapter 4 is therefore to investigate the efficacy of BoNT A injections in spastic lower limb muscles on impairment, activity, and social participation in stroke patients. The secondary aim of Chapter 4 is to analyse whether simultaneous BoNT A injections into several spastic muscles are more useful in the treatment of stiff-knee gait, as opposed to one single injection into the Rectus Femoris (Stoquart et al., 2008). This work is presented in Chapter 4 as it was published in Stroke. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of BoNT A injections in several spastic upper limb muscles in chronic stroke patients. We know that many stroke patients present with hand disability secondary to spastic hemiparesis and that these injections effectively reduce neurological impairment (Simpson et al., 2008). However, the functional consequences of these reductions on activity and participation remain unclear as in the lower limb spasticity. We would logically hypothesize that a reduction in spasticity might lead to an improvement in patient activity. But very few studies (Elovic et al., 2008; Brashear et al., 2002) have examined the effects of managing poststroke upper limb spasticity on activity. Additionally, no study has specifically addressed the effect of upper limb BoNT A injections on social participation. Therefore, our aim with this stroke patient study is to investigate the effects on impairment, activity, and participation of BoNT A injections in spastic upper limb muscles. Similarly to the previous chapter, activity (manual ability) and participation are assessed with Rasch questionnaires, ABILHAND (Penta et al., 2001) and SATIS-Stroke (Bouffioulx et al., 2008), respectively. This chapter is presented as the article published in Stroke. 	 Finally, the Chapter 6 discusses the results of the different chapters and presents perspectives for future research.
