The latter nation sponsored and oversaw the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a greatly}} {{improved}} security {{situation in the}} city in 2012, many Somali expatriates began returning to Mogadishu for investment opportunities and {{to take part in}} the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process. Through both private efforts and public initiatives like the Somali Diaspora Corps, they have participated in the renovation of schools, hospitals, banks and other infrastructure, and have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in the capital's recovery.

5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland {{attempted}} {{a project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama.

He took 2/17 in the second innings as the home team fell for 161 before Craig's men sealed the series with a 10-wicket win. Meckiff ended the tour with 20 first-class wickets at 10.85, placing him top of the tour bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|The AFM <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in {{organizing}} and institutionalizing Pentecostalism in the Midwest and Southwest and from 1909–1912 absorbed smaller Pentecostal groups. It also established relationships with Pentecostal missions in the Midwest. The Midwestern Pentecostal movement {{centered around the}} Stone Church, pastored by William Piper, and the North Avenue Mission, pastored by William Howard Durham, both in Chicago, Illinois. Durham was the lead promoter of the Finished Work doctrine which, in time, the AFM would adopt {{and in doing so}} discard the Wesleyan view of sanctification as a second work of grace.|$|E
5|$|The rivers <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in the {{lifestyle}} of the Aboriginal people, acting {{as a source of}} food and a means of communication and trade. Murray cod and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes. In the summer {{it is likely that the}} Bangerang and Wiradjuri joined the Monaro groups in the Bogong moth feasts in the alpine country to the east.|$|E

From 1985 to 1994, he was legislative director for U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer, and associate staffer on the House Appropriations Committee. Berry assisted Hoyer on employment issues of the federal government, and <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in negotiations {{that led to the}} Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, which established the locality pay system. From 1994 to 1995, Berry served as Deputy Assistant Secretary and acting Assistant Secretary for Law Enforcement in the U.S. Treasury Department. From 1995 to 1997, Berry worked as director of government relations and as senior policy advisor at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|In February 1971, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of Medicaid for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. He also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role,</b> with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.|$|E
5|$|In October 1946 David Lilienthal asked Bacher {{to become}} one of the inaugural commissioners of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the {{civilian}} agency that was being formed to replace the wartime Manhattan Project. As a Republican, Bacher was easily confirmed by the Senate members of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy by an 8–0 vote. As he was the only one of the five commissioners who was a scientist—an important factor in his decision to accept the post—he <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in the selection of the Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee to which nine scientists were appointed: James Conant, Lee DuBridge, Enrico Fermi, Robert Oppenheimer, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Hartley Rowe, Glenn Seaborg, Cyril Smith and Hood Worthington.|$|E

5|$|Molotov's {{position}} {{became increasingly}} tenuous after February 1956, when Khrushchev launched an unexpected denunciation of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party. Khrushchev attacked Stalin both over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats {{of the early}} years of World War II, which he blamed on Stalin's overly trusting attitude towards Hitler and his purges of the Red Army command structure. As Molotov was the most senior of Stalin's collaborators still in government and had <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in the purges, it became evident that Khrushchev's examination of the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power, and he became the leader of an old guard faction that sought to overthrow Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|The European {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products and industrial commodities stipulated maritime activity and international trade to an unprecedented extent. The Ayyubids <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in this as they controlled sea-trade routes which passed through the ports of Yemen and Egypt via the Red Sea. The trade policy of the Ayyubids placed them {{in a position of}} great advantage; although they cooperated with the Genoans and Venetians in the Mediterranean Sea, they prevented them from having access to the Red Sea. Thus, they kept the trade of the Indian Ocean exclusively in their hands. In the Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids drew large benefits in the form of taxes and commissions which they learned from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|The United States <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in the Bretton Woods and Yalta {{conferences}} {{with the}} United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allies, which signed agreements on new {{international financial institutions}} and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war. The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II.

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> {{in advancing}} {{the cause of}} women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved {{to be only a}} temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Dudley {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1645, with Winthrop as his deputy. Endecott, as a consolation, was given {{command of the}} colonial militia, reporting to the governor. He was also once again made a governor's assistant, and was chosen to represent the colony to the confederation in 1646. The threat of Indian conflicts in neighbouring colonies prompted the colony to raise its defensive profile, in which Endecott <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role.</b> Winthrop was reelected governor in 1646; {{after his death in}} 1649, Endecott succeeded him as governor. By annual re-elections Endecott served nearly continuously until his death in 1664/5; for two periods (1650–1651 and 1654–1655) he was deputy governor.|$|E
5|$|Air Commodore Arthur William Murphy, DFC, AFC, FRAeS (17November 1891– 21April 1963) was {{a senior}} {{engineer}} and aviator in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He accompanied Captain Henry Wrigley on the first trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, a feat that earned both men the Air Force Cross. Murphy later <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>leading</b> <b>role</b> in military aircraft maintenance and production. A veteran of World WarI, he served first as a mechanic {{and then as a}} pilot with the Australian Flying Corps. Based in the Middle East, he flew with No.1 Squadron and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Murphy was the first airman on the RAAF's strength when it formed in 1921, and rose to the rank of temporary air commodore during World WarII, commanding No.1 Aircraft Depot and No.4 Maintenance Group. He was also the RAAF's first Inspector of Air Accidents. A fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society, Murphy retired from the military in 1946, and died in 1963 aged seventy-one.|$|E
