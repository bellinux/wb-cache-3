50|$|Also {{commonly}} {{available from}} {{many companies are}} small printers made specifically for calculators which tend to use cash register tape paper, ports and cables for connecting the calculators to a computer and/or another calculator, cassette recorders for recording programmes and data, overhead projector displays and connectors for auxiliary display devices. The earlier programmable calculators {{as well as the}} <b>pocket</b> <b>computers</b> mentioned above also had such things as video interfaces for televisions and composite monitors, 2½ inch mini floppy disc drives, bar-code readers, and standard RS-232 connectivity which provided for other such things as modems, external hard drives and more. The printer selection for the <b>pocket</b> <b>computers</b> was a bit wider as well, including thermal, impact, dot matrix, daisy wheel, 4-colour pen, printers of the type used in simpler printing calculator.

50|$|Warwalking, or warjogging, {{is similar}} to wardriving, but is done on foot rather than from a moving vehicle. The {{disadvantages}} of this method are slower speed of travel (resulting in fewer and more infrequently discovered networks) {{and the absence of}} a convenient computing environment. Consequently, handheld devices such as <b>pocket</b> <b>computers,</b> which can perform such tasks while users are walking or standing, have dominated this practice. Technology advances and developments in the early 2000s expanded the extent of this practice. Advances include computers with integrated Wi-Fi, rather than CompactFlash (CF) or PC Card (PCMCIA) add-in cards in computers such as Dell Axim, Compaq iPAQ and Toshiba <b>pocket</b> <b>computers</b> starting in 2002. More recently, the active Nintendo DS and Sony PSP enthusiast communities gained Wi-Fi abilities on these devices. Further, many newer smartphones integrate Wi-Fi and Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|R
