500|$|The {{exhibition}} {{stirred up}} controversy, as video games are not commonly considered art among critics and therefore {{might not have}} a place in an art gallery. However, the collection is modeled after Philip Johnson’s 1934 exhibition [...] "Machine Art," [...] in which pieces of machinery such as propeller blades were displayed in a minimalist fashion to lay focus on their mechanical design. This set-up would create a [...] "strange distance, this shock, that made <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> how gorgeous formally, and also important functionally, design pieces were," [...] which, according to the exhibit's curator Paola Antonelli, is the desired effect of the exhibition. In order to minimize factors such as nostalgia, the games are displayed in a minimalist fashion where only a screen and controlling-device are visible on an otherwise blank wall.|$|E
500|$|... "The hope, {{first and}} foremost, {{was to put}} this on people’s radar. Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists. It’s also to make <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> it’s not just about {{volunteering}} to go {{and live in the}} Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to how do you get people’s attention." ...|$|E
500|$|April 15, 2008, was the 61st {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Over 330 team members wore number 42, {{more than the}} over 240 last year. When the teams took the field, all players, {{managers}} and coaches were wearing number 42, and was repeated at all other 14 ballparks that had scheduled games that day. All players wore number 42 at games including the Washington Nationals' game at the New York Mets, Pittsburgh's game at the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Angels' game at the Texas Rangers. The Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals and Tampa Bay Rays also wore number 42, increasing the total to nine teams. [...] "The significance of Jackie Robinson Day {{is not lost on}} anyone", said Bob DuPuy.

500|$|The {{overarching}} theme of Eternal Punishment, as with Persona and Innocent Sin, was {{exploration of the}} human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves. While Innocent Sin focused on the protagonists as teenagers, Eternal Punishment looked at the protagonists as adults: for its central character theme, Eternal Punishment focused on how <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> their true selves as adults faced with reality. A theme carried over from Innocent Sin was the [...] "power of Kotodama", the Japanese belief that words can influence the physical and spiritual world, with this power manifesting through the spreading of rumors. Terms and concepts used in the games, including Persona, Shadows and the character Philemon, were drawn from Jungian psychology and archetypes. The character of Nyarlathotep, who had made a cameo appearance as a Persona in the original game, {{was inspired by the}} character of the same name from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Other antagonists and enemy creatures in the games were also drawn from the Cthulhu Mythos and {{played a key role in}} the narrative.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally {{based on}} the {{research}} of Clifford Nass and [...] at Stanford University, the theory explains that people tend to respond to media as they would either to another person (by being polite, cooperative, attributing personality characteristics such as aggressiveness, humor, expertise, and even gender) – or to places and phenomena {{in the physical world}} – depending on the cues they receive from the media. Numerous studies that have evolved from the research in psychology, social science and other fields indicate that this type of reaction is automatic, unavoidable, and happens more often than <b>people</b> <b>realize.</b> Reeves and Nass (1996) argue that, “Individuals’ interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and natural, just like interactions in real life,” (p. 5).|$|E

He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt when you listen to my music. I don't think <b>people</b> <b>realize</b> just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it , studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E
