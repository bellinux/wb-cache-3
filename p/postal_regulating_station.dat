50|$|On 1 July 1722 Charles III nationalized {{the postal}} system, and {{declared}} {{the delivery of}} messages {{and the establishment of}} post offices to be a state monopoly. He placed the imperial coat of arms on every <b>postal</b> building, <b>regulated</b> <b>postal</b> tariffs, and developed the existing postal routes, subordinating every post office to the main post office at the imperial court in Vienna. The language of administration was German, and most of the employees were Austrian. In 1784 Maria Theresa's Postal Patent further modernized the system, separating normal and mail-coach delivery. The mail-coach service started one year later throughout the empire, establishing a permanent route between Vienna and Buda in 1752.|$|R

50|$|As with supply, {{the most}} {{critical}} timing factor in troop movements was availability of the transports and sailing dates. To minimize delays and time in embarkation camps at the port the NYPOE controlled troop movements from their home stations or bases to the port where NYPOE had final responsibility for ensuring troops were properly equipped and prepared for overseas deployment. Large movement of troops toward ports were conducted in secrecy to prevent sabotage en route and in particular to avoid alerting agents of possible large troop sailings. After initial problems, including good will efforts of civic organizations to support troops and even police radio traffic, troop movements came under increasing secrecy with restrictions imposed on railroads and even the Red Cross.

40|$|International audienceOne {{major concern}} for {{operators}} {{on the gas}} network of Gaz de France is to ensure a satisfying pressure regulation. The pressure level is controlled by pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>stations.</b> In some specific configurations, the downstream pressure is not properly controlled by the pressure regulator and oscillates around the set point. The working conditions that lead to instabilities were studied. For that purpose, some experiments and numerical simulations were performed to identify the relative effect of several parameters on emergence and amplitude of oscillations. Amplitudes and frequencies of the outlet pressure were especially sensitive to inlet pressure and {{to the size of}} the downstream volume. Amplitudes and frequencies of oscillations were reduced for highest downstream volume, the frequency simulated was generally higher than the frequency measured on test bench. For large amplitudes, calculations and measurements were in good agreement, the discrepancies could be more important for configurations with small amplitudes...|$|R

The Mississinewa was occupying a berth originally meant for the Caliente. Caliente and the other oilers, to protect their volatile cargo, steamed out of the harbor. While at least three of the attackers were sunk the Mississinewa, having just loaded 107,000 barrels of fuel in her hold, exploded and sank, killing 60 of her crew.|$|R

The course was abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his fitness for promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail transport unit, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun-sur-Yèvre and an advanced depot and <b>regulating</b> <b>station</b> at Is-sur-Tille.

40|$|The years {{following}} World War II brought new broadcasting stations to a divided Germany, government <b>regulated</b> radio <b>stations</b> in the East and state <b>regulated</b> <b>stations</b> in the West. Radio broadcasts were a significant cultural {{source for the}} Germans in times of reconstruction. Broadcasting stations played much of the familiar Tanz- und Unterhaltungsmusik, reminiscent of earlier times of happiness and prosperity. However, with changes in a new generation’s musical tastes the demand for swing bands declined. Radio stations began to rework their in-house “dance bands” into “jazz bands. ” The West Deutscher Rundfunk (WDR), and other broadcast stations, employed jazz musicians full-time. This thesis investigates {{the development of the}} WDR Big Band as follows: Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the state of jazz and swing music at the end of World War II in Germany. Chapter 2 examines the decline in popularity of swing bands after World War II in Germany and its causes. It examines the transitional years from “dance bands” into “big bands” by studying the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) dance band in Cologne. These changes lay the path for the change to “big bands” during the 1960 ’s. The final chapter presents an analysis of the stylistic changes that the KTUO band made to transform into a big band during the 1960 ’s. It will touch on the collaboration between the KTUO band and the WDR broadcasting station and will then examine {{the early years of the}} new WDR Big Band. I will consider personnel choices and stylistic practices of the WDR Big Band. Further, I will study the later years of the WDR Big Band to the present, including changes in direction and collaborations with American artists. Finally, the third chapter also provides conclusions of this investigation and implications for future research. Advisor: Pamela F. Star...|$|R
