2500|$|On June 4, GSA {{reached a}} final {{agreement}} with The Trump Organization regarding redevelopment of the Old Post Office Building. The Trump Organization negotiated a 60-year lease under which it paid $250,000 in rent per month, with annual increases {{tied to the}} Consumer Price Index. Rent payments were to begin either eight months after construction started or 20 months after the lease's signing, whichever came first. The company had the option to extend the lease another 40 years. The Trump Organization agreed {{to spend at least}} $200 million redeveloping the property, with Trump using his personal funds to pay for the redevelopment. To allay concerns by critics that he too often defaulted on developments, Trump agreed to provide a $40 million <b>personal</b> <b>guaranty</b> as well as a [...] "bad acts" [...] (to cover failure to pay taxes, fraud, or other forms of misconduct). The Trump Organization agreed to pay all taxes, although the lease did not bar the company from seeking a historic preservation tax credit.|$|E
40|$|This {{creative}} and original book {{is designed for}} use in three ways. It can supplement a traditional Secured Transactions text with skills training exercises, {{be used as the}} text for a 1 -credit drafting workshop added on to a doctrinal commercial law class, and also as the text for a 2 or 3 credit contract drafting course. The ten user-friendly exercises are modular so that professors can assign one or two exercises a semester to gradually make their classes comply with ABA requirements for transition to practice credits as well as formative and summative assessments. Students work in teams to negotiate and draft core documents that memorialize a secured transaction, starting with a promissory note, and continuing on to a financing statement and security agreement. In a 2 or 3 -credit drafting course or workshop, students could also negotiate and draft a <b>personal</b> <b>guaranty,</b> perfect a security interest in a delivery truck and fixtures, balance ethical requirements of client confidentiality with truthfulness, and compile a portfolio of the documents with a cover letter to the client. Each exercise requires only fifteen to thirty minutes of class time and one to two hours on homework assignments that have students identify the anatomical parts of a contract (preamble, recitals, words of agreement, etc.), fill in a template promissory note with the parties 2 ̆ 7 names, principal amount, interest rate, and signature blocks, and edit a template security agreement to conform it to the terms of the students 2 ̆ 7 negotiated agreement. Each drafting exercise contains a template that students edit, and the text includes instructions for negotiation exercises. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the promissory note, which had security interest by both a deed of trust of Arizona real property and <b>personal</b> <b>guaranties,</b> was governed by Nevada limitations period because of the Nevada choice-of-law provision within the contract. Consequently, the Court held that the party seeking deficiency judgment was time-barred pursuant to NRS 40. 455 (1) because the judgment was not sought within {{six months of the}} foreclosure sale of the collateral property...|$|R
