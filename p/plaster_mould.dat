40|$|The <b>plaster</b> <b>moulding</b> {{process is}} {{commonly}} used for casting prototypes of aluminium components designed for subsequent production by die casting. <b>Plaster</b> <b>moulded</b> prototype castings possess dimensional tolerances and surface quality comparable to die castings, but vithout the high tooling costs and lead times. &fortunately, the mechanical properties of plaster castings are significantly inferior to their die cast counterparts. This is due pri-marily to the low thermal conductivity of plaster which extends casting solidijication time signijicantly compared to die or even sand casting processes. Long solidification times result in large grained castings demonstrating low strength and hardness. This work is an experimental investigation into the effects of various levels of silica sand and carbonfibre additions on the properties of foaming <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> and associated aluminium castings. Data and statistical analyses are presented and conclusions drawn regarding the wet and dry strength of <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> {{as a function of}} sand and carbon fibre content. Likewise, conclusions regarding the associated casting characteristics such as surface jinish, solid$cation time, hardness and tensile strength are presented. The eflec-tiveness of silica sand and carbon fibre additions with respect to improving the properties of <b>plaster</b> <b>moulded</b> prototype castings is also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the effect}} of {{alternative}} additives on the properties spred diameter, setting time, bending strength and water absorption of sanitaryware <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> was investigated. The plaster was partially replaced by the alternative additives such as perlite, diatomite and glass beads. Microstructural features of the resultant compositions were determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, represantative moulds were produced and their performance was investigated under industrial conditions. It was observed that perlite and diatomite addition deteriorated the strength of <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> {{and there was no}} noticeable effect of these additives on casting performance of the <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds.</b> Morever, the presence of glass beads in plaster decreased weight of the moulds without deterioration of moulds service life. Slip casting is a common method for producing sanitaryware, and <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> have been used for shaping sanitaryware products [1, 2]. The most suitable material is to be gypsum, that is used extensively in the ceramic industry in moulding preforms from aqueous slips. The main constituent of commercial gypsum plaster is calcium sulphate hemihydrates (CaSO 4. 1 / 2 H 2 O) [1, 2]...|$|R
50|$|The lost-wax casting {{technique}} Robinson developed is {{a modified}} version of the bronze casting technique. It involves creating a <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> which is filled with molten wax. The mould is then removed (and can be reused) and the wax is encased in a heat-resistant covering and placed in the kiln. When the wax is burnt out, this cavity is then filled with molten glass.|$|E
50|$|This {{production}} {{operation is}} well known for providing tools with dimensional stability, surface quality, density and uniformity. For instance, on the slip casting process the cast part is of high concentration of raw materials with little additive, this improves uniformity. But also, the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast.|$|E

The term is specific to the shaping of flat ware, such as plates, whilst a similar technique, jolleying, refers to the production of hollow ware, such as cups.|$|E

5000|$|Slipcasting: This {{ideally suited}} to the making of wares that cannot be formed by other methods of shaping.

25|$|As {{a commonplace}} {{construction}} and home decorating material, plaster is widely available.

50|$|There {{are many}} forming {{techniques}} to make ceramics, but {{one example is}} slipcasting. This is where slip, liquid clay, is poured into a <b>plaster</b> <b>mould.</b> The water in the slip is drawn out of the slip, leaving an inside layer of solid clay. When this is thick enough, the excess slip can {{be removed from the}} mould. When dry, the solid clay can then also be removed. The slip used in slip casting is often liquified with a substance that reduces the need for additional water to soften the slip; this prevents excessive shrinkage which occurs when a piece containing a lot of water dries.|$|E
50|$|Slip-casting methods provide {{superior}} surface quality, {{density and}} uniformity in casting high-purity ceramic raw materials over other ceramic casting techniques, such as hydraulic casting, since the cast part {{is a higher}} concentration of ceramic raw materials with little additives. A slip is a suspension of fine raw materials powder in a liquid such as water or alcohol with small amounts of secondary materials such as dispersants, surfactants and binders. Pottery slipcasting techniques employ a plaster block or flask mould. The <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast removing deleterious air gaps and minimizing shrinkage in the final sintering process.|$|E
5000|$|Jiggering and jolleying: These {{operations}} {{are carried out}} on the potter's wheel and allow the time taken to bring wares to a standardized form to be reduced. Jiggering is the operation of bringing a shaped tool {{into contact with the}} plastic clay of a piece under construction, the piece itself being set on a rotating <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> on the wheel. The jigger tool shapes one face while the mould shapes the other. Jiggering is used only in the production of flat wares, such as plates, but a similar operation, jolleying, is used in the production of hollow-wares such as cups. Jiggering and jolleying have been used in the production of pottery since at least the 18th century. In large-scale factory production, jiggering and jolleying are usually automated, which allows the operations to be carried out by semi-skilled labour.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} process for latex models is simple, and {{similar to the}} early stages of pottery production. Plaster moulds are made from a 'master' model. When the plaster is completely dry, a mix of liquid latex and an inert 'filler' is poured into the mould and left to stand until a coating of latex has developed around the inside of the mould. The remaining liquid latex is poured away for reuse, and the casting allowed to dry out until it is firm enough to be removed from the mould. This part of the process is identical to the way ceramics are cast. With the casting removed, the <b>plaster</b> <b>mould</b> is left to dry out, and cannot be reused until 100% dry once more. Each casting progressively destroys the interior of the mould, so after a relatively limited number of casts, the mould has to be discarded and new ones made from the master. This explains why each individual Julip is different even from other examples of the same breed and from the same mould.|$|E

5000|$|Pressure casting: Specially {{developed}} {{polymeric materials}} allow a mould {{to be subject}} to application external pressures of up to 4.0 MPa-so much higher than slip casting in <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> where the capillary forces correspond to a pressure of around 0.1 - 0.2 MPa. The high pressure leads to much faster casting rates and, hence, faster production cycles. Furthermore, the application of high pressure air through the polymeric moulds upon demoulding the cast means a new casting cycle can be started immediately in the same <b>mould,</b> unlike <b>plaster</b> <b>moulds</b> which require lengthy drying times. The polymeric materials have much greater durability than plaster and, therefore, it is possible to achieve shaped products with better dimensional tolerances and much longer mould life.
