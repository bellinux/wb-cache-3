50|$|PFE is {{a measure}} of {{counterparty}} risk/credit risk. It is calculated by evaluating existing trades done against the possible market prices in future during the lifetime of transactions. It can be called sensitivity of risk with respect to market prices. The calculated expected maximum exposure value is {{not to be confused with}} the maximum <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> possible. Instead, the maximum <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> indicated by the PFE analysis is an upper bound on a confidence interval for <b>future</b> <b>credit</b> <b>exposure.</b>|$|R

40|$|Collateral {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and widespread credit risk mitigation techniques used by practitioners. This paper studies the effect of mark-to-market (MTM) timing in collateral agreements on the contingent <b>credit</b> risk <b>exposure.</b> We measure contingent <b>credit</b> risk <b>exposure</b> using <b>Potential</b> <b>Future</b> Exposure (PFE), the maximum amount of exposure expected to occur at a specified confidence during the remaining duration of the underlying contract. The parameters of a collateral agreement that can affect the contingent <b>credit</b> risk <b>exposure</b> include the frequency and timing of marking-to-market, trigger level for margin calls and the level of collateralization. However, these decisions are often made in an ad-hoc manner, without reference to an analytical framework. While the frequency of mark-to-market and collateral level has been studied, very little academic research has addressed the quantitative analysis of mark-to-market timing. The goal of this research is to fill this theoretical gap and propose a framework for optimizing the timing of mark-to-market in collateral agreements to minimize <b>potential</b> <b>future</b> exposure. Our framework computes the probability of maximum risk exposure of the underlying contract above a specified level during its remaining time until maturity using one or two MTMs whose timing is decided simultaneously at the contract initiation, or in a sequential manner. This probability is expressed as a function of the parameters of the underlying contract which is assumed to follow a Brownian motion and the decision variables in collateralization, including initial margin, trigger level and variation margin. Numerical examples are investigated with different values of volatility and duration of the underlying contract. Sensitivity analysis and numerical results reveal the optimal timing of MTM that minimizes PFE. Simulations are used to test preliminary conclusions from numerical analysisMark-to-Market. <b>Potential</b> <b>Future</b> <b>Exposure,</b> Contingent <b>Credit</b> Risk...|$|R
40|$|Credit risk {{assessment}} for bank customers has {{gained increasing attention}} in recent years. Several models for credit scoring have been proposed in the literature for this purpose. The accuracy of the model is crucial for any financial institution’s profitability. This paper provided a high accuracy credit scoring model that could be utilized with small and large datasets utilizing a principal component analysis (PCA) based breakdown to {{the significance of the}} attributes commonly used in the credit scoring models. The proposed credit scoring model applied PCA to acquire the main attributes of the credit scoring data then an ANN classifier to determine the credit worthiness of an individual applicant. The performance of the proposed model was compared to other models in terms of accuracy and training time. Results, based on German dataset showed that the proposed model is superior to others and computationally cheaper.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} desire to use rotorcraft Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) to facilitate Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) approaches to achieve operating cost reductions and other benefits. This type of application must be supported by the certification process, as it {{is an example of}} a “maintenance credit”. Guidance material on the process of obtaining a credit is presented in Advisory Circular AC 29 - 2 C MG- 15. Current HUMS have achieved very few credits, and the material in the AC is largely untested. However HUMS in-service experience shows that the <b>potential</b> for <b>future</b> <b>credits</b> does exist. This paper presents work performed by Smiths Aerospace and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) on an FAA research program, with the primary goal being to research the end-to-end process for approving an example HUMS CBM credit in accordance with the requirements of the AC. The primary target CBM credit selected for the work is to extend or eliminate a current 2, 500 hour TBO on the oil cooler of the S- 92 helicopter. A key element of the work is to demonstrate and validate the ability of HUMS algorithms and methodologies to detect incipient mechanical faults and facilitate timely maintenance intervention. The work will assess the CBM credit potential of both the current mechanical diagnostic algorithms and methodologies in in-service HUM systems, and the additional capabilities gained through the application of emerging advanced HUMS analysis methodologies. The results of the FAA program will go into the public domain, and should be of value in helping to test and refine the guidance material in AC 29 - 2 C MG- 15, and to realise the maintenance credit potential of HUMS...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} analogue to the Monte Carlo techniques previously used by banking supervisors {{to assess}} the potential <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> of interest rate swaps is developed, which permits a more thorough examination of swap exposure. This is done by using the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985) one-factor model of the yield curve to generate interest rate paths from which swap <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> paths can be determined. Even with such a relatively simple interest rate process, the patterns of <b>credit</b> <b>exposure</b> {{are found to be}} more complex than the supervisors previous techniques allow: they vary with the level of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the volatility of the short rate - all factors which are ignored in the supervisors risk measurement methodology - and have a significantly non-linear relationship with swap maturity. In conclusion, market traders and regulators need to be alert to these factors in determining the appropriate level of capital to hold as protection against counterparty default. ...|$|R
