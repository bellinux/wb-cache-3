25|$|In Germany {{there are}} no longer any Zünfte (or Gilden - the terms used were rather {{different}} from town to town), nor any restriction of a craft to a privileged corporation. However, under a new name, Innungen, guilds continue to exist as <b>private</b> <b>member</b> clubs with membership limited to practitioners of particular trades or activities. These clubs are corporations under public law, albeit the membership is voluntary; the president normally comes {{from the ranks of}} master-craftsmen and is called Obermeister ("Master-in-chief").

25|$|Outside the USA a {{non-commercial}} form of {{fractional ownership}} {{has been in}} existence for several decades. In this form, otherwise unconnected individuals (rather than family or friends) form private syndicates to purchase, for example, vacation property or boats. These syndicates operate as <b>private</b> <b>member</b> groups with small numbers on a non-profit basis, generally just sharing expenses and usage. These groups can involve assets ranging from modest apartments or condominium-type properties to multimillion-euro / dollar properties, and leverage their ability to make collective purchases of additional assets such as boats or vehicles as additional facilities, while retaining control entirely within {{the membership of the}} group.|$|E

25|$|Though now a <b>private</b> <b>member,</b> Harcourt still {{continued}} to assert his independent position, and his {{attacks on the}} government were no longer restrained by any deference to Liberal Imperialism. He actively intervened in 1899 and 1900, strongly condemning the government's financial policy and their attitude towards the Transvaal. Throughout the Second Boer War he lost no opportunity of criticising the South African developments in a pessimistic vein. A great parliamentary debater, he sprinkled his speeches with humour. From 1898 to 1900 he was conspicuous, both on the platform and in letters to The Times, in demanding active measures against Ritualism in the Church of England. However, his attitude in this was reflected in his political advocacy of disestablishment. In March 1904, just after he had announced his intention not to seek election again to parliament, he succeeded, {{by the death of}} his nephew, to the family estates at Nuneham. He found that the estate was in crisis, especially after having to pay the death duties he himself had introduced, and he died suddenly there in the same year.|$|E

[...] In the 3rd session of the 40th Parliament Dosanjh continued with the Standing Committee on National Defence and the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan, but also sat with the Standing Committee on Health. In September 2010 he was reassigned to being the critic on health for the Liberal Party. Dosanjh introduced <b>private</b> <b>member</b> bill C-467 An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (children born abroad) in the 2nd session, and re-introduced it in the 3rd session where it received 2nd reading in September 2010, which would grant natural citizenship to children born to, or adopted by, Canadian citizens working for the federal government (including members of the Canadian Forces). The bill was meant to repeal portions of the April 2009 amendments to the Citizenship Act which repatriated Lost Canadians but also removed the ability of Canadians to pass their citizenship onto their children if the children are born outside of the country.|$|E

2500|$|In the 40th BC general {{election}} Trevena {{was considered the}} front runner in her riding with Simon Fraser University postgraduate student Nick Facey of the BC Liberals and retired Campbell River resident Bob Bray challenging her. However, Trevena's party lost the {{general election}} and again formed the official opposition. Party leader Adrian Dix appointed Trevena {{to the role of}} critic of transportation and BC Ferries. Following announcements of BC Ferries route cuts and fare increases and a scandal involving executive bonus payouts, Trevena initiated in a well-received comparison review of the BC Ferries system with Washington State Ferries system. Also in this critic role, she criticized fellow MLA Jordan Sturdy for not delivering a petition from his constituents on Bowen Island to the legislature regarding ferry cuts. In May 2014 Trevena introduced a <b>private</b> <b>member</b> bill (...) titled Provincial Shipbuilding Act, 2014 which would have required new public transportation vessels, like ferries, be constructed in Canada and that the procurement process give weight to bids that demonstrate direct economic benefits to B.C. and that utilize union contractors. The bill was not advanced beyond first reading and, later that year, Trevena was critical of the Premier for agreeing to build new ferries in Poland despite an election promise to create a shipbuilding industry in B.C. Trevena introduced the same bill again (...) in May 2015 but again it was not advanced beyond the first reading. Trevena endorsed Horgan to be leader of the BC NDP in the 2014 leadership election, as she had done in 2011 election. After Horgan became leader he kept Trevena as the opposition critic on transportation.|$|E

60|$|A bill {{providing}} for vote by ballot, abolishing public nominations {{and dealing with}} corrupt practices in parliamentary elections was introduced by Lord Hartington in 1870. Little progress was made with it, and it was eventually withdrawn. But the government were committed to the principle, {{and at the end}} of July Mr. Gladstone took the opportunity of explaining his change of opinion on this question, in the debate on the second reading of a Ballot bill brought in by a <b>private</b> <b>member.</b> Now that great numbers who depended for their bread upon their daily labour had acquired the vote, he said, their freedom was threatened from many quarters. The secret vote appeared to be required by the social conditions under which they lived, and therefore it had become a necessity and a duty to give effect to the principle.|$|E

On looking over my letter I think that the general intention is sufficiently clear, but there is part of one sentence which, taken by itself, might be understood as committing me beyond what I intended or wished. The words I refer to are those in which I say that it may be possible for me as a <b>private</b> <b>member</b> to prevent obstacles being placed {{in the way of a}} fair trial being given to the policy of the new government. But I think that the commencement of the sentence in which these words occur sufficiently reserves my liberty, and that the whole letter shows that what I desire is that the somewhat undefined declarations which have hitherto been made should now assume a practical shape.”(182) ...|$|E

6000|$|The respite for ministers was short. The {{long day}} of shadowy {{promises}} and delusive dreams was over; and the oracular expounder of mysteries was at last gripped by the hard realities of the taxes. Whigs and Peelites, {{men who had been}} at the exchequer and men who hoped to be, were all ready at last to stalk down their crafty quarry. Without delay Disraeli presented his budget (Dec. 3). As a <b>private</b> <b>member</b> in opposition he had brought forward many financial proposals, but it now turned out that none of them was fit for real use. With a serene audacity that accounts for some of Mr. Gladstone's repulsion, he told the House that he had greater subjects to consider 'than the triumph of obsolete opinions.' His proposals dazzled for a day, and then were seen to be a scheme of illusory compensations and dislocated expedients. He took off half of the malt-tax and half of the hop duty, and in stages reduced the tea duty from two shillings and twopence to one shilling. More important, he broke up the old frame of the income-tax by a variation of its rates, and as for the house-tax, he doubled its rate and extended its area. In one of his fragmentary notes, Mr. Gladstone says:-- ...|$|E

After which came [...] the startling announcement that Gladstone {{would no longer}} retain [...] {{the leadership of the}} liberal party, nor resume it, unless the [...] party had settled its differences. He will not expose himself to [...] the insults and outrages of 1866-8, and he has a keen sense of the [...] disloyalty of the party during the last three years. He will sit [...] as a <b>private</b> <b>member</b> and occasionally speak for himself, but he [...] will not attend the House regularly, nor assume any one of the [...] functions of leader. He does this not from anger, but because he [...] says that it is absolutely necessary to party action to learn that [...] all the duties and responsibilities do not rest on the leaders, [...] but that followers have their obligations too. As a consequence of [...] this Cardwell retires to the House of Lords. He will not take the [...] leadership, nor will he consent to serve under any one but [...] Gladstone. He is too old, he says. Lowe protests against the [...] anarchical experiment, and talks of Hartington as leader.

6000|$|Pallant {{was still}} {{standing}} up. Some one pointed at him and they laughed. Others began to point, lunging, as it were, {{in time with the}} tune. At this moment two persons came in practically abreast from behind the Speaker's chair, and halted appalled. One happened to be the Prime Minister and the other a messenger. The House, with tears running down their cheeks, transferred their attention to the paralysed couple. They pointed six hundred forefingers at them. They rocked, they waved, and they rolled while they pointed, but still they sang. When they weakened for an instant, Ireland would yell: 'Are ye with me, bhoys?' and they all renewed their strength like Antaeus. No man could say afterwards what happened in the Press or the Strangers' Gallery. It was the House, the hysterical and abandoned House of Commons that held all eyes, as it deafened all ears. I saw both Front Benches bend forward, some with their foreheads on their despatch-boxes, the rest with their faces in their hands; and their moving shoulders jolted the House out of its last rag of decency. Only the Speaker remained unmoved. The entire press of Great Britain bore witness next day that he had not even bowed his head. The Angel of the Constitution, for vain was the help of man, foretold him the exact moment at which the House would have broken into 'The Gubby.' He is reported to have said: 'I heard the Irish beginning to shuffle it. So I adjourned.' Pallant's version is that he added: 'And I was never so grateful to a <b>private</b> <b>member</b> in all my life as I was to Mr. Pallant.' ...|$|E
