5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One <b>path</b> <b>is</b> Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second <b>path</b> <b>is</b> Nivritti-karma, wherein a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma <b>path</b> <b>is</b> the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{continued}} inland, it rapidly weakened and apparently dissipated over the Sierra Madre Occidental. The storm apparently passed into Chihuahua and was predicted to continue into the southern United States, though {{the remainder of}} its <b>path</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|The <b>path</b> <b>is</b> a {{designated}} National Trail, largely funded by Natural England. It {{was created in}} stages, with its final section, Somerset and North Devon, opening in 1978. It is maintained by a dedicated South West Coast Path Team.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} variant, {{attributed}} to Jin Y. Yen, the <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> {{required to be}} loopless. (This restriction introduced another level of complexity.)Yen's algorithm is used where only simple <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> considered, whereas Eppstein's algorithm is used when non-simple <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> allowed (e.g., <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> allowed to revisit the same node multiple times) or where loops are not possible (in directed acyclic graphs).|$|R
5000|$|Two <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> vertex-independent (alternatively, {{internally}} vertex-disjoint) {{if they do}} {{not have}} any internal vertex in common. Similarly, two <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> edge-independent (or edge-disjoint) {{if they do not}} have any internal edge in common. Two internally vertex-disjoint <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> edge-disjoint, but the converse is not necessarily true.|$|R

5|$|Heine's prose {{passage in}} De l'Allemagne tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves {{in the middle}} of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their <b>path</b> <b>is</b> forced to dance to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} graphs, {{the maximum}} spanning tree solution cannot be used. Instead, several different algorithms are known; {{the choice of}} which algorithm to use depends on whether a start or destination vertex for the <b>path</b> <b>is</b> fixed, or whether paths for many start or destination vertices must be found simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} <b>path</b> <b>is</b> {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5000|$|Every adapted {{process with}} left- or right-continuous <b>paths</b> <b>is</b> {{progressively}} measurable. Consequently, every adapted process with càdlàg <b>paths</b> <b>is</b> progressively measurable.|$|R

5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ <b>path</b> <b>is</b> bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The Llanberis <b>Path</b> <b>is</b> {{the longest}} {{route to the}} summit, and has the shallowest gradient. It largely follows {{the line of the}} Snowdon Mountain Railway, and is {{considered}} the easiest and least interesting route to the summit of Snowdon. It is the route used by the annual Snowdon Race, with a record time of less than 40 minutes recorded from the start to the summit.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast <b>Path</b> <b>is</b> no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The <b>path</b> <b>is</b> covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
40|$|Tree <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> {{investigated}} using first-order logic. The following {{results are}} obtained: (i) every definable <b>path</b> can <b>be</b> {{defined by a}} firstorder formula using at most one parameter chosen from the path itself; (ii) a canonical representation of the formulas that define definable <b>paths</b> <b>is</b> obtained; and (iii) every tree that has only finitely many <b>paths</b> that <b>are</b> not definable is n-equivalent to a tree of which all <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> definable. Moreover, a certain property that {{might be expected to}} hold, involving the transfer of n-equivalence between trees, is shown not to be true. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the task of}} automatically detecting interactions between proteins in biomedical literature. We use a syntactic parser, a corpus annotated for proteins, and manual decisions as training material. After automatically parsing the GENIA corpus, which is manually annotated for proteins, all syntactic <b>paths</b> between proteins <b>are</b> extracted. These syntactic <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> manually disambiguated between meaningful paths and irrelevant <b>paths.</b> Meaningful <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> <b>paths</b> that express an interaction between the syntactically connected proteins, irrelevant <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> <b>paths</b> that do not convey any interaction. The resource created by these manual decisions is used in two ways. First, words that appear frequently inside a meaningful <b>path</b> <b>are</b> learnt using simple machine learning. Second, these resources are applied {{to the task of}} automatically detecting interactions between proteins in biomedical literature...|$|R
30|$|When new <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> generated, {{the parent}} <b>path</b> would <b>be</b> deleted. According to the {{principle}} of MIDMRA, parent <b>paths</b> should <b>be</b> included in new <b>paths</b> when it <b>is</b> deleted, unless all neighbor nodes of parent <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> not appropriate for selecting or there are no neighbor nodes. The prior scenario breaks other deleting rules, and the last one means that the path could not route to destination, both assumptions are unable to find out disjoint paths.|$|R
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{appears to}} work equally well in insects and in vertebrates. Simulations show that motion camouflage {{results in a}} more efficient pursuit path than classical pursuit (i.e. the motion camouflage <b>path</b> <b>is</b> shorter), whether the target flies {{in a straight line}} or chooses a chaotic path. Further, where classical pursuit requires the attacker to fly faster than the target, the motion camouflaged attacker can sometimes capture the target despite flying more slowly than it.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes {{tend to be}} stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, {{only a small portion}} of the <b>path</b> <b>is</b> of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.|$|E
5|$|A path, which {{contains}} data, usually organized in hierarchical form, that {{appears as a}} sequence of segments separated by slashes. Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The <b>path</b> <b>is</b> always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E

50|$|In 2016 {{the park}} was renovated and rearranged. Concrete <b>paths</b> <b>were</b> {{replaced}} with granite ones, {{and in the center}} of the park, where the <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> connecting, a small plateau with benches was created.|$|R
50|$|For {{about thirty}} years (until World War I), many <b>paths</b> <b>were</b> created, whether {{communal}} or private. The arrival {{of cars and}} asphalt most of the <b>paths</b> obsolete, which <b>are</b> forgotten and in brambles.

5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean plane. As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a <b>path</b> <b>is</b> desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main <b>path</b> <b>is</b> obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
5|$|It has two {{landscaped}} picnic areas. Facilities {{include a}} tea shop, with {{indoor and outdoor}} seating areas {{with a view of}} the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75miles (1.2km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy <b>path</b> <b>is</b> often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E

5|$|Pain {{is confronted}} by Jiraiya while infiltrating Amegakure, {{resulting}} in a fight that ends with his mentor's death. However, Pain's captured Animal Path vessel is replaced shortly afterwards for Pain's attack on Konoha. The rest of the Paths are destroyed {{in the fight against}} Naruto, while Nagato recovers his faith in their mentor and world peace when talking personally. Then, he sacrifices his life to revive the people he killed in Konoha. However, Nagato is reanimated by Kabuto and sent alongside Itachi to battle Naruto and Killer Bee. Though he regains his ability to fight at his full potential, Nagato is sealed by Itachi and sent back to the afterlife. In the Japanese anime, Nagato's voice actor is Junpei Morita and the Deva Path's being Kenyu Horiuchi; in the English dub, Nagato is voiced by Vic Mignogna and his Deva <b>Path</b> <b>is</b> voiced by Troy Baker.|$|E
