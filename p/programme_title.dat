This end board style was recreated for the, less frequently seen, static captions. This style was changed on 1 May 2004 to an orange background that would close shut over {{the end of a}} promotion to contain the <b>programme</b> <b>title.</b> The static slide was also updated, with the space for the programme image reduced to the top quarter of the screen.|$|E

50|$|Accompanying these idents {{at the end}} of the CBBC strand or Channel, {{were two}} cartoon characters. These, in the form of a dancing fox and a hairy monster, would point out {{additional}} CBBC services. This would normally consist of pointing out the CBBC website and, if currently broadcasting, the CBBC channel. Promotions consisted of the video with the CBBC logo, <b>programme</b> <b>title</b> and times appearing at the end on the green zig-zag lines that accompanied the channel. This was altered in 2010, so the video would shrink into a box contained within the white and green lines where the CBBC logo now originated {{at the end of}} the idents. The <b>programme</b> <b>title</b> would now be overlaid the white background, rather than be incorporated into the design. The DOG for the CBBC channel was also changed to the new logo, however it retained its green colour scheme, and would often animate, with the letters popping out and in at regular intervals.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} older sets were {{used and the}} episodes were shot on 35mm camera (as opposed to the digital camera used {{at the time of}} the episodes release) suggest it was filmed some time before Series 8.

50|$|Woman's Hour {{has been}} {{broadcast}} at 10am Monday to Friday since James Boyle's {{revision of the}} Radio 4 schedules in April 1998. Between September 1991 and April 1998 it was broadcast at 10.30am, having previously gone out {{for many years in}} an early afternoon slot (2.00pm). The programme's move to a morning slot was unpopular among some listeners who, for family or other reasons, work only in the morning. Michael Green, the then controller of Radio 4, made his decision the previous year and considered the elimination of the <b>programme</b> <b>title.</b> Weekend Woman's Hour is broadcast on Saturday afternoons at 4 pm, and features highlights of the previous week. Additionally, episodes are made available as a podcast following the broadcast of each programme.|$|E
