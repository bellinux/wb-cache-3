5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|In 2001 a new master <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> 2020 Vision: A Community Concept for the MSU Campus was {{developed}} to guide future campus development.

5|$|The {{invasion}} <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for two brigades of the 3rd Canadian Division {{to land on}} two beach sectors—Mike and Nan—focusing on Courseulles, Bernières and Saint-Aubin. It {{was hoped}} that the preliminary naval and air bombardments would soften up the beach defences and destroy coastal strong points. Close support on the beaches was to be provided by amphibious tanks of the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Once the landing zones were secured, the <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade to land reserve battalions and deploy inland, the Royal Marine commandos to establish contact with the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword and the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade to link up with the British 50th Infantry Division on Gold. The 3rd Canadian Division's D-Day objectives were to capture Carpiquet Airfield and reach the Caen–Bayeux railway line by nightfall.|$|E

5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 {{an editorial in the}} Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier-General Edward Morrison {{developed}} and subsequently issued a 35-page multi-phased fire support <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> Canadian Corps Artillery Instruction No.1 for the Capture of Vimy Ridge {{to support the}} efforts of the infantry. For its operations, the Canadian Corps received three times the artillery normally assigned to a corps for regular operations. To manage the logistics associated with the increased artillery, Royal Artillery staff officer Major Alan Brooke developed coordinated communication and transport plans to work in conjunction with the complex barrage plans.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in the space program, developed its own similar <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the space program was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> {{for the formation of}} two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for major cleanup {{of the lower}} river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E

5|$|In Turkey the <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for {{diplomatic}} {{pressure on}} 8 June 1944, following the Normandy Landings, {{to allow the}} Allied forces access to Turkey {{for the purposes of}} staging an invasion of Greece (in support of the story of Zeppelin). At the same time the Soviets would make a similar request of Bulgaria. However, it was agreed that this risked a pre-emptive invasion of Turkey by German forces. Instead, the Allies took advantage of German warships being permitted, in June, access to Turkish territorial waters to transit to the Aegean Sea. A complaint to the Turkish government emphasised the Allies' interest in the Balkans and that they did not wish to see the Germans reinforcing the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{a report}} to the Holy Synod that year, Bishop Tikhon {{proposed}} dramatic changes in the operation of the diocese. Recognizing the needs of the growing multi-ethnic Orthodox community, he recommended reforming the missionary diocese into a self-supporting American diocese, composed of numerous ethnic auxiliary dioceses. His <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for Russian (New York), Arab (Brooklyn), Serbian (Chicago), and Greek dioceses. Additionally, he called for the formation of a governing council, composed of clergy and laity, which would meet to discuss administrative and canonical issues. On March 5, 1907, the first All-American Sobor convened in Mayfield, Pennsylvania. Following Archbishop Tikhon's reassignment to Russia that year, however, few of his reforms were implemented.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{original}} <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for Hood and McLaws {{to attack}} in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits {{and that the}} enemy to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the en echelon attackone brigade after another in sequencethat {{would be used for}} the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard.|$|E

5|$|On 18 March, Bouvet, {{along with}} , Suffren, and Gaulois, was {{to attack the}} Dardanelles fortresses. The <b>plan</b> <b>called</b> for six British pre-dreadnoughts to {{suppress}} the Turkish fortifications, after which the French battleships would attack those same fortifications at close range. The French fleet was commanded by Admiral Émile Guépratte; the acting Allied commander was Rear Admiral John de Robeck, who stood in for Admiral Sackville Carden. The Allied battleships were arranged in line abreast, in three rows; Bouvet was stationed {{in the center of}} the second row. The force entered the straits at 11:30 and bombarded the town of Çanakkale, before turning to the Fortress Hamidieh and other nearby fortifications at 13:30.|$|E
