5|$|The 2012 Ford Focus Electric {{was planned}} to include warning sounds for pedestrians. Ford Motor Company {{developed}} four alternative sounds, and in June 2011 involved the electric car fans by {{asking them to}} <b>pick</b> <b>their</b> favorite from the four potential warning sounds through the Focus Electric Facebook page. However, ultimately Ford decided to hold off including warning sounds unless federal legislation required it, and no such system was implemented on the production vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers <b>pick</b> <b>their</b> starting order from a hat.|$|E
5|$|Brown and Erie County Democratic Party {{chairman}} Leonard Lenihan were at odds over {{various political}} positions after Lenihan {{played a major}} role in Brown's election to the office of mayor. Brown supported Andrew Cuomo for New York Attorney General in the 2006 general election, David Paterson for Lieutenant Governor of New York in the 2006 general election and Antoine Thompson for 60th District New York Senator in a special election on February 28, 2006. Lenihan disagreed with each of these choices. Thompson had run Brown's last common council campaign, and Brown was upset that he did not get to select his successor in the 60th District. Many supporters considered boycotting the special election due to a perceived racial slight against an African American who seemed to be wrongfully shutout of the process. Lenihan pointed out that neither of the previous state senators turned mayor, Anthony Masiello and James D. Griffin, was granted the right to <b>pick</b> <b>their</b> successor, and he noted that Thompson had not been timely in entering the special election process. The Erie and Niagara County Democratic committees bypassed Thompson as their nominee in favor of Marc Coppola despite Brown's backing in the February special election. Thompson subsequently decided to run for the New York Senate seat in the November general election.|$|E

This prevents one conference from stuffing the ballot with the weakest players in the other conference.|$|E

The BAE Taranis is a UCAV built by Great Britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection. Flight trials are expected to begin in 2011.|$|E
25|$|While {{campaign}} games {{can have}} many different objectives, the sole objective in multiplayer games is to destroy all the {{buildings of the}} opposition.

To make the game proceed more quickly, by default the map is covered in fog of war instead of the Black Mask. Warcraft III, like Blizzard's previous title StarCraft, allows for single and multiplayer replays to be recorded and viewed, allowing a game to be played at slower and faster speeds and viewed {{from the perspective of}} all players.|$|E

The next year Holmström caught his attention again when Holmström's coach at the time, Niklas Wikegård, described Holmström as the best player on the team. In 1994 the Red Wings {{for the first time}} gave Andersson a draft <b>pick,</b> <b>their</b> 10th round pick, meaning he had first and final say over who would be chosen by the team in that round. Andersson chose Holmström, who has since been part of four Stanley Cup winning teams in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|Shamrock IV was {{crossing}} the Atlantic with the steam yacht Erin, destined for Bermuda, when Britain {{declared war on}} Germany on 5 August 1914. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, the Commodore of the New York Yacht Club, sent his own yacht, the Vagrant, from Rhode Island to Bermuda to meet them and escort them to the US. The Vagrant arrived on the 8th. Having no radio, the crew were unaware of the declaration of war. Finding all navigational markers missing, they attempted to <b>pick</b> <b>their</b> own way in through the barrier reef. St. David's Battery fired a warning shot {{to bring them to}} a halt. Shamrock IV and Erin arrived the next day. The America's Cup was cancelled for that year.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2015 season, the Eagles had the 13th pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. They traded Byron Maxwell, Kiko Alonso, {{and their}} pick to the Miami Dolphins for the #8 pick. Later, they traded the #8 <b>pick,</b> <b>their</b> third-round <b>pick,</b> <b>their</b> fourth-round pick, a 2017 first-round pick, and a 2018 second-round pick to the Cleveland Browns for the #2 pick and a 2017 fourth-round pick. They used the #2 pick to draft North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz. On September 3, 2016, the Eagles traded {{starting}} quarterback Sam Bradford to the Minnesota Vikings, who had lost Teddy Bridgewater for the season, for a 2017 first-round pick and a 2018 fourth-round pick. Following the trade, the Eagles named Wentz the starting quarterback for Week 1 of the 2016 season. First-time head coach Pederson led the Eagles to a 3–0 start to the season. His rookie quarterback started with 5 touchdowns, no interceptions and over 255 yards per game. The week 4 bye took a toll on the Eagles, and they lost four out of the next five games, including a loss to every rival team in their division. In those four games, their average margin of loss was just under 5 points. Pederson and the Eagles won just 3 of their last 7 games. Those included grueling road losses against the Seattle Seahawks, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Baltimore Ravens. Although Wentz started off the season well, the 6-5 quarterback finished with a TD–INT ratio of 16:14. The rookie head coach and rookie quarterback tandem led the Eagles to a disappointing year, finishing with a 7–9 record and coming in last in the division.|$|E
