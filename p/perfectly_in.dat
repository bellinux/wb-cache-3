5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E
5|$|The only {{countries}} {{to have their}} entire team score <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> the IMO were the United States in 1994 (they were coached by Paul Zeitz); and Luxembourg, whose 1-member team had a perfect score in 1981. The US's success earned a mention in TIME Magazine. Hungary won IMO 1975 in an unorthodox way when none of the eight team members received a gold medal (five silver, three bronze). Second place team East Germany also {{did not have a}} single gold medal winner (four silver, four bronze).|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in their form (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E
25|$|These {{considerations}} were also, in all probability, strongly seconded by {{a desire}} {{on the part of}} the Prussian Commander, and one <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> keeping with his ardent character, to take every possible measure which was at all warranted by the actual posture of affairs, for vigorously opposing Napoleon's advance.|$|E
25|$|Brain {{was both}} a great horn player and a figure in popular culture, from his {{recordings}} of the Mozart concerti to his ridiculous playing of the hosepipe (<b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> pitch) in one of Gerard Hoffnung's surreal musical extravaganzas. His Mozart recordings inspired Flanders and Swann's Ill Wind and his classical playing inspired future generations of horn players.|$|E

25|$|An {{alphabet}} {{is a set}} of symbols, each {{of which}} represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly phonological alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} joy {{of heaven}} {{is called the}} beatific vision, which {{is derived from the}} vision of God's essence. The soul rests <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> God, and does not, or cannot desire anything else than God. After the Last Judgment, when the soul is reunited with its body, the body participates in the happiness of the soul. It becomes incorruptible, glorious and perfect. Any physical defects the body may have laboured under are erased. Heaven is also known as paradise in some cases. The Great Gulf separates heaven from hell.|$|E
25|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} cutting the members to size and then drilling {{a series of}} holes in the joint surface of each member. Holes are often drilled {{with the assistance of}} a dowelling jig which aids in accurate hole placement— accuracy is paramount in this technique to ensure members line up <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> the completed joint. The holes are drilled such that there are corresponding holes in each member into which short dowels are inserted with some glue. The joint is brought together and clamped until the glue has dried.|$|E

25|$|Independent architects had to join state projects, {{switch to}} bureaucratic jobs (Victor Vesnin) or quit (like Melnikov did). Reconstruction of Moscow project {{was set up}} as 10 state {{architectural}} workshops, roughly corresponding to the radial sectors of the city. Zholtovsky was invited to lead Workshop No.1; like other old architects (Shchusev, Vladimir Shchuko, Ivan Fomin), he fitted <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> Stalin’s system. His educational work was in high esteem: in 1935 and 1937 Politbureau appointed him to speak on education at the forthcoming Congress of Architects (this Congress was delayed twice, and each time list of speakers was approved at the very top).|$|E
25|$|The {{second class}} of cricket stroke {{comprises}} the horizontal bat shots, {{also known as}} cross bat shots: the cut, the square drive, the pull, the hook and the sweep. Typically horizontal bat shots have a greater probability of failing {{to make contact with}} the ball than vertical bat shots, and therefore are restricted to deliveries that are not threatening to hit the stumps, either by dint of being too wide or too short. The bat is swung in a horizontal arc, with the batsman's head typically not being <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> line with the ball at point of contact.|$|E
25|$|A Gomco clamp, {{otherwise}} known as a Yellen clamp, is a specialized clamp for performing circumcisions on a human male's penis. y using a Gomco clampe, the time required is less than that by any other method, sutures are never used, no bleeding is encountered, and it leaves a clean-cut incision which heals <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> 36 hours with practically no chance of infection because the mucous membrane and skin are securely clamped together. The Gomco clamp was inented in 1935 by Hiram S. Yellen and Aaron Goldstein. The Gomco clamp was then market by Goldstein through his private company, the Goldstein Manufacturing Company and later patented in 1940.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} two new {{classes of}} special subsets {{of the real}} line: the class of perfectly null sets and the class of sets which are <b>perfectly</b> null <b>in</b> the transitive sense. These classes may {{play the role of}} duals to the corresponding classes on the category side. We investigate their properties and, in particular, we prove that every strongly null set is <b>perfectly</b> null <b>in</b> the transitive sense, and that it is consistent with ZFC that there exists a universally null set which is not <b>perfectly</b> null <b>in</b> the transitive sense. Finally, we state some open questions concerning the above classes. Although the main problem of whether the classes of perfectly null sets and universally null sets are consistently different remains open, we prove some results related to this question...|$|R

25|$|Orienting {{the chapel}} this way proved {{problematic}} to engravers who took artistic licence to illustrate Abney Park Chapel {{as if it}} were aligned <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> between the main entrance pillars ! However, its purposeful 'turning away' from the commercial entrance to enable its most elegant facade to face a planned vista and walk in memory of Dr. Watts, was important to capture the spirit of the park. It symbolised the Abney Park Cemetery Company's deliberate land assembly of the Fleetwood House and Abney House grounds to conserve it for dedication to the life of Dr Watts, and in memory of his benefactor Lady Mary Abney. The cemetery company ensured that its official engraver, George Childs, issued a perspective of Abney Park Chapel ('Dr Watts' Chapel') along the axial vista of what was to be laid out as Dr Watts' Walk. This was distributed free to all shareholders.|$|E
500|$|A second Goffin–King composition, [...] "Wasn't Born to Follow", also {{displays}} {{country and}} western influences, albeit filtered through the band's psychedelic and garage rock tendencies. The song's country leanings are underscored by the criss-crossing musical dialogue between the electric guitar and pedal steel. The rural ambiance is further heightened by the striking imagery of the lyrics which outline the need for escape and independence: a subject <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> keeping with the hippie ethos of the day.|$|E
500|$|Author Peter Buckley {{attempted}} to evaluate Younger Than Yesterdays contemporary impact more than 30 {{years after the}} fact in his 1999 book, The Rough Guide to Rock: [...] "The album had room for everything from Hugh Masekela's trumpet to droning sitar-like riffs, a brew that may've been too rich for the Byrds' rapidly shrinking teen audience, but was <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> tune with a new underground following who disdained hit singles but were coming to regard albums as major artistic statements." ...|$|E

500|$|Even in {{a design}} that is {{intended}} to be synchronously tuned, some staggered tuning effect is inevitable because of the practical impossibility of keeping all tuned circuits <b>perfectly</b> <b>in</b> step and because of feedback effects. [...] This can be a problem in very narrow band applications where essentially only one spot frequency is of interest, such as a local oscillator feed or a wave trap. [...] The overall gain of a synchronously tuned amplifier will always be less than the theoretical maximum because of this.|$|E
