40|$|<b>Piritrexim,</b> a lipid-soluble antifolate, was {{evaluated}} for its activity against Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii. The concentration of <b>piritrexim</b> needed to inhibit 50 % of the catalytic activity of P. carinii dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was 19. 3 nM, {{and that for}} T. gondii DHFR was 17. 0 nM, concentrations that were 40 - to over 1, 000 -fold less than those needed for the inhibition of activity by trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, the antifolates conventionally used in treating these organisms. <b>Piritrexim</b> was able to inhibit replication of T. gondii in a mouse peritoneal macrophage model at concentrations of 0. 1 to 1. 0 microM. Leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the inhibition of DHFR by antifols in mammalian cells but not in protozoa, {{did not affect the}} ability of <b>piritrexim</b> to inhibit T. gondii replication. The addition of sulfadiazine, which alone was ineffective, to <b>piritrexim</b> allowed inhibition of T. gondii replication at lower concentrations of <b>piritrexim</b> than when <b>piritrexim</b> was used alone. These results suggest that <b>piritrexim,</b> alone or combined with a sulfonamide, may be a highly potent antitoxoplasma and antipneumocystis agent that could provide major pharmacologic and clinical advantages over available agents...|$|E
40|$|<b>Piritrexim</b> is a lipid-soluble antifolate which, like methotrexate, has {{a potent}} {{capacity}} to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase. We performed a multicentre phase 11 study with <b>piritrexim</b> {{in patients with}} locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Twenty-four patients of which sixteen had received prior chemotherapy, were initially treated with 25 mg <b>piritrexim</b> orally administered trice daily for four days, repeated weekly, with provision for dose escalation or reduction according to observed toxicity. Of twenty-one patients evaluable for tumour response, one patient achieved a partial response which lasted for 24 weeks. Three patients had stable disease during 12 weeks of treatment, seventeen had progressive disease. <b>Piritrexim</b> was generally well tolerated, in eighteen patients the dose could be escalated. Myelotoxicity was the most frequent observed toxicity of this <b>piritrexim</b> regimen. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia grade 3 / 4 occurred in 38 % of the patients sometime during treatment. Pharmacokinetic analysis of <b>piritrexim</b> in three patients during the first treatment cycle, revelaed peak levels 1 to 2 h after an oral dose, with a trend towards a higher peak plasma levels and AUCs on the fourth dosing day compared with the first dosing day.

40|$|<b>Piritrexim</b> is a lipid-soluble {{inhibitor}} of {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR) that enters tumour cells rapidly by passive diffusion, cannot be polyglutamated, and is {{as effective as}} methotrexate in inhibiting DHFR. Bioavailability after oral dosing is approximately 75 %. We performed a phase II study with oral <b>piritrexim</b> in non-chemotherapy pretreated patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Thirty-three patients were treated with 25 mg three times daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated weekly, with provision for dose escalation or reduction according to the toxicity observed. Of 29 evaluable patients, one patient achieved a complete response of 19 + weeks duration, and ten patients achieved a partial response with a median duration of 22 weeks (range 16 - 48), for a total response rate of 38 %. <b>Piritrexim</b> was generally well tolerated, with myelosuppression as the major toxicity, that frequently required dose modification.

40|$|<b>Piritrexim</b> is a lipid-soluble drug {{which is}} as {{effective}} an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase as methotrexate. Phase I and II studies have indicated activity in some tumour types. Because of its lipophilicity we have conducted a phase II study in recurrent high-grade malignant glioma (grades III and IV). Twenty-seven patients were treated with 25 mg p. o. three times daily for five consecutive days, repeated weekly, with provision for dose escalation or reduction according to toxicity. Five patients received less than 4 weeks' treatment because of disease progression or death. Twenty-two patients were evaluable for response. One complete and one partial response was seen (duration 262 + and 241 + weeks) and 13 patients had static disease for a median duration of 13 weeks (range 7 - 35). The major toxicity was myelosuppression. This response rate of 9 % of evaluable patients is much lower than that seen for some conventionally used drugs and we conclude that <b>piritrexim</b> {{is unlikely to be}} of value in the management of high-grade gliomas...|$|E

40|$|Pneumocystis carinii inoculated into 96 -well {{filtration}} plate assemblies {{was shown}} to synthesize radiolabeled folates de novo from [para- 3 H]aminobenzoic acid ([3 H]pABA). At {{the end of each}} incubation with [3 H]pABA, a vacuum manifold was used to remove the medium and wash P. carinii. The membrane at the base of each well was dried and punched out, and the level of 3 H retained was determined by direct scintillation counting. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of duplicate filters confirmed that direct counting of 3 H retained on membranes (after correction for unmetabolized [3 H]pABA) was an accurate reflection of total [3 H]pABA incorporation by P. carinii. Greater than 95 % of the 3 H recovered {{was shown to}} be present as polyglutamated species. After digestion with rat plasma folic acid gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, para-aminobenzoylglutamate, N 10 -formyltetrahydrofolate, and tetrahydrofolate were identified as the major 3 H-labeled components. para-Aminobenzoylglutamate was presumed to have arisen from folylpolyglutamates synthesized by P. carinii and was therefore included in the calculation of total [3 H]pABA incorporation. P. carinii incorporation of [3 H]pABA under optimal conditions was used as a selective measure of in vitro viability against which the inhibitory effects of some antipneumocystis agents (pentamidine, sulfamethoxazole, 566 C 80, and <b>piritrexim)</b> were quantitated. The concentrations of pentamidine, sulfamethoxazole, 566 C 80, and <b>piritrexim</b> required for 50 % inhibition in this assay were 7. 3, 0. 1, 1. 4, and approximately 100 microM, respectively.

40|$|Three {{sulfonamides}} {{and four}} dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors were tested alone and in combination {{to determine their}} in vitro effects on two strains of Toxoplasma gondii grown in MRC 5 fibroblast tissue culture. Toxoplasma growth was quantitated by an enzyme immunoassay performed directly on the fixed cultures, and linear regression models were used to quantify {{the relationship between the}} optical density values generated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the concentrations of the antimicrobial agents in the culture medium. The cytopathic effects of antimicrobial agents on T. gondii were examined in Giemsa-stained cultures. Sulfonamides and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors exhibited similar patterns of inhibition, consisting of an important increase of the inhibitory effect within a narrow range of concentrations. Sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfisoxazole were all found to have important inhibitory effects on T. gondii; the 50 % inhibitory concentrations estimated from the regression models were 2. 5 micrograms/ml for sulfadiazine, 1. 1 micrograms/ml for sulfamethoxazole, and 6. 4 micrograms/ml for sulfisoxazole. This inhibition of growth was associated with a reduction of the number of parasitized cells and intracellular parasites that were morphologically normal. With dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, including pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, trimetrexate-glycuronate, and <b>piritrexim,</b> a strong inhibition of Toxoplasma growth was observed, which was associated with striking morphological changes of the parasites. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations were 0. 04 microgram/ml for pyrimethamine, 2. 3 micrograms/ml for trimethoprim, 0. 16 ng/ml for trimetrexate-glycuronate, and 6. 9 ng/ml for <b>piritrexim.</b> When sulfonamides and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors were used in combination, a synergistic effect was observed with sulfadiazine combined with pyrimethamine, trimetrexate-glycuronate, and piritrexim; sulfisoxazole combined with pyrimethamine; and trimethoprim combined with sulfamethoxazole.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new micromethod to study the effect of drugs on microsporidia, using MRC 5 fibroblasts infected by 10 (5) spores of Encephalitozoon cuniculi. After 3 days of incubation with various concentrations of drugs, parasitic foci were counted in stained cultures. The inhibition of microsporidial growth exceeding 90 % with albendazole (0. 005 microgram/ml), fumagillin (0. 001 microgram/ml), 5 -fluorouracil (3 micrograms/ml), and sparfloxacin (30 micrograms/ml) was observed. Chloroquine, pefloxacin, azithromycin, and rifabutin were partially effective, at high concentrations. Arprinocid, metronidazole, minocycline, doxycycline, itraconazole, and difluoromethylornithine were not evaluable, since concentrations that inhibited microsporidia were also toxic for fibroblasts. Pyrimethamine, <b>piritrexim,</b> sulfonamides, paromomycin, roxithromycin, atovaquone, and flucytosine were ineffective. Our results confirm that albendazole and fumagillin have marked activity against E. cuniculi and show the antimicrosporidial activity of 5 -fluorouracil and sparfloxacin. These data may {{form the basis for}} treatment of Encephalitozoon hellem and Septata intestinalis infections and represent an attempt to identify drugs effective against Enterocytozoon bieneusi...|$|E
40|$|Molecularly {{imprinted}} microspheres were synthesised {{using the}} antitumor drug <b>piritrexim</b> (PTX) as a template molecule by aqueous microsuspension polymerisation and {{were used as}} a high-performance liquid chromatographic stationary phase. The molecularly imprinted column exhibited strong retention behaviour to the template molecule. The influences of pH of the buffer and the ratio of methanol to buffer on the retention behaviour were investigated in detail. Results indicated that the baseline separation of PTX, trimetrexate (TMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethazine (SMZ) was achieved when the pH value of the acetate buffer was above pH 3. 5 and the ratio of methanol to the buffer was 6 : 4 (v/v). A gradient elution programme was employed to enhance the separation, which led to an improvement in sensitivity {{and a reduction in}} determination errors. The method developed was used to analyse urine samples supplemented with PTX. The recoveries of 5 μg mL- 1 PTX in the urine sample were 99. 1 ± 3. 0 % and 93. 3 ± 2. 8 % at the beginning and 24 h later, respectively. © Springer-Verlag 2003. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Many new antifolate {{compounds}} {{with unique}} clinical properties {{are currently in}} clinical development. Some of these agents have been rationally designed to circumvent known mechanisms of resistance to methotrexate, the most useful and extensively studied antifolate in clinical practice. Resistance to methotrexate can result from decreased active transport into cells, decreased polyglutamation resulting in enhanced drug efflux from cells, mutations in dihydrofolate reductase which reduce drug binding affinity, and increased expression of dihydrofolate reductase due to gene amplification or increased translational efficiency. As a consequence, the newer antifolates may differ from methotrexate because of increased lipid solubility, improved cellular uptake or increased ability to undergo polyglutamation. Several of these newer agents also uniquely target specific folate-dependent enzymes such as thymidylate synthase or glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase. Antifolates currently in clinical development include trimetrexate, edatrexate, <b>piritrexim,</b> ZD 1694, lometrexol, AG 337, LY 231514 and 1843 U 89.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The fungal {{pathogen}} Pneumocystis carinii {{causes a}} pneumonia {{which is an}} opportunistic infection of AIDS patients. Current therapy includes the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor trimethoprim which is selective but only a relatively weak inhibitor of the enzyme for P. carinii. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme should {{form the basis for}} design of more potent and selective therapeutic agents for treatment of the disease. RESULTS: The structure of P. carinii DHFR in complex with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and trimethoprim has accordingly been solved by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the ternary complex has been refined at 1. 86 A resolution (R = 0. 181). A similar ternary complex with <b>piritrexim</b> (which is a tighter binding, but less selective inhibitor) has also been solved, as has the binary complex holoenzyme, both at 2. 5 A resolution. CONCLUSIONS: These structures show how two drugs interact with a fungal DHFR. A comparison of the three-dimensional structure of this relatively large DHFR with bacterial or mammalian enzyme-inhibitor complexes determined previously highlights some additional secondary structure elements in this particular enzyme species. These comparisons provide further insight into the principles governing DHFR-inhibitor interaction, in which the volume of the active site appears to determine the strength of inhibitor binding...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a rapid assay for screening of compounds with potential antipneumocystis {{activity on the}} basis of incorporation of [35 S]methionine into proteins newly synthesized by Pneumocystis carinii. Unambiguous evidence that P. carinii synthesizes proteins in vitro was provided by immunoprecipitation studies demonstrating the incorporation of [35 S]methionine into the major surface glycoprotein. Treatment with two clinically active antipneumocystis agents, atovaquone (10 (- 4) M) or pentamidine (10 (- 4) M), prevented this incorporation. Total [35 S]methionine incorporation paralleled incorporation into the major surface glycoprotein, permitting rapid assessment of anti-P. carinii activity by scintillation counting. Treatment with pentamidine (1 x 10 (- 4) M), atovaquone, trimethoprim (1 x 10 (- 4) M) -sulfamethoxazole (7. 9 x 10 (- 4) M), <b>piritrexim</b> (1 x 10 (- 7) M), RO 11 - 8958 (1 x 10 (- 4) M), and amphotericin B (1 microgram/ml) resulted in a greater than 67 % inhibition (P < 0. 05) of [35 S]methionine incorporation. No decrease in [35 S]methionine incorporation was seen with dapsone (10 (- 5) M), trimethoprim (10 (- 4) M), recombinant mouse tumor necrosis factor (500 ng/ml), or gamma interferon. This rapid in vitro assay should be a useful adjunct in the development of new antipneumocystis agents...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) is {{the first}} human virus known to encode dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme required for nucleotide and methionine biosynthesis. We have studied the purified KSHV-DHFR enzyme in vitro and analyzed its expression in cultured B-cell lines derived from primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), an AIDS-associated malignancy. The amino acid sequence of KSHV-DHFR is most similar to human DHFR (hDHFR), but the viral enzyme contains an additional 23 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminus. The viral DHFR, overexpressed and purified from E. coli, was catalytically active in vitro. The Km of KSHV-DHFR for dihydrofolate (FH 2) was 2. 4 μM, which is {{significantly higher than the}} Km of recombinant hDHFR (rhDHFR) for FH 2 (390 nM). Km values for NADPH were similar for the two enzymes, about 1 μM. KSHV-DHFR was inhibited by folate antagonists such as methotrexate (Ki: 200 pM), aminopterin (Ki: 610 pM), pyrimethamine (Ki: 29 nM), trimethoprim (Ki: 2. 3 μM), and <b>piritrexim</b> (Ki: 3. 9 nM). In all cases, Ki values for these folate antagonists were higher for KSHV-DHFR than for rhDHFR. The viral enzyme was expressed at levels two- to tenfold higher than hDHFR in PEL cell lines as an early lytic cycle gene. KSHV-DHFR mRNA and protein appeared from 6 to 24 h after chemical induction of the KSHV lytic cycle. Epitope-tagged KSHV-DHFR and rhDHFR both localized to the nucleus of transfected cells, while other KSHV nucleotide metabolism genes localized to the cytoplasm. DHFR activity was not essential for viral replication in cultured PEL cells. Since hDHFR was not detectable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), KSHV-DHFR may function to provide increased DHFR activity in vivo in infected cells that have little or none of their own enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Exogenous purines (greater than {{or equal}} to 10 (- 5) M) can {{modulate}} the cytotoxicity of methotrexate (MTX) in cultured cells, protecting cells at low MTX concentrations (less {{than or equal}} to 8 x 10 (- 8) M) and markedly potentiating its effect at higher concentrations. The ability of hypoxanthine (HX) to modulate the effects of two antifolates-ICI 198583 (an inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase) and <b>piritrexim</b> (PTX, a lipophilic inhibitor of DHFR) -was investigated using cultured mouse leukaemic cells, L 1210. HX (10 (- 4) M) was found to potentiate only the cytotoxicity of DHFR inhibitors (MTS and PTX), increasing cell kill by 20 - 70 fold to the level achieved by an equivalent concentration (10 (- 5) M) of ICI 198583 alone. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from cells exposed to antifolates for 24 h demonstrated that the chromatin was cleaved into multimers of 200 base pairs. This pattern of DNA cleavage indicates cell death via apoptosis. The degree of DNA fragmentation was found to be closely linked to cytotoxicity. DNA fragmentation increased from 50 % in cells treated with 10 (- 5) M MTX or PTX to 70 % when HX was added with the drugs, a level achieved by 10 (- 5) M ICI 198583 alone. HX potentiation of cytotoxicity was correlated with a substantial increase in dATP in conjunction with low dTTP pools. The specific potentiation of DHFR inhibitors by HX may be due to their inhibition of purine synthesis with a concurrent rise in PRPP levels. Addition of HX with MTX substantially raised intracellular purine levels via the salvage pathway as indicated by ribonucleotide pool measurements. ICI 198583, on the other hand, stimulated de novo purine synthesis with or without added HX. Treatment with MTX plus HX or ICI 198583 (with or without HX) caused a reduction of dTTP pools to 8 % of untreated control and excess dATP accumulation. The subsequent elevation (to 300 % of control) of the dATP pool may provide a signal for endonucleolytic fragmentation of DNA and subsequent cell death...|$|E

Halogen substitution at the 5 - or 6 -position of 2, 4 -diaminoquinazoline favored selective binding to the P. carinii enzyme but not the T. gondii enzyme. For example, the 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -chloroquinazoline as an inhibitor of P. carinii, T. gondii, and rat liver dihydrofolate reductase were 3. 6, 14 and 29 microM, respectively, corresponding to 12 -fold selectivity for the P. carinii enzyme but only marginal selectivity for the T. gondii enzyme. Greater than fivefold selectivity for P. carinii but not T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase was also observed for the 2, 4 -diaminoquinazolines with 5 -methyl, 5 -fluoro, 5 - and 6 -bromo, 6 -chloro, and 5 -chloro- 6 -bromo substitution. In contrast, alkyl and aralkyl substitution at the 6 - and 7 -positions of 2, 4 -diaminopteridines was found to be a favorable feature for selective inhibition of the T. gondii enzyme and, in two cases, for both enzymes. Nine of the fifty-one compounds tested against P. carinii dihydrofolate reductase and four of the thirty compounds tested against T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase displayed fivefold or greater selectivity for the microbial enzyme versus the rat liver enzyme. The most selective against both enzymes was 2, 4 -diamino- 6, 7 -bis(cyclohexylmethyl) pteridine, with a selectivity ratio 2 orders of magnitude greater than the value reported for trimetrexate and <b>piritrexim.</b> Since substitution at the 7 -position is generally considered to be detrimental to the binding of 2, 4 -diaminop-teridines and related compounds to mammalian dihydrofolate reductase, the selectivity observed in this study with the 6, 7 -bis(cyclohexylmethyl) analog may represent a useful approach to enhancing selective inhibition of the enzyme from nonmammalian species...|$|E
