Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a one-to-one correspondence between the 4-dimensional space of lines in P3 and points on a quadric in P5 (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of Grassmann coordinates (which describe k-dimensional linear subspaces, or flats, in an n-dimensional Euclidean space), <b>Plücker</b> coordinates arise naturally in geometric algebra. They have proved useful for computer graphics, and also can be extended to coordinates for the screws and wrenches {{in the theory of}} kinematics used for robot control.|$|E

25|$|Felix Klein {{was born}} on 25 April 1849 in Düsseldorf, to Prussian parents; his father, Caspar Klein (1809–1889), was a Prussian {{government}} official's secretary stationed in the Rhine Province. Klein's mother was Sophie Elise Klein (1819–1890, née Kayser). He attended the Gymnasium in Düsseldorf, then studied mathematics and physics at the University of Bonn, 1865–1866, intending to become a physicist. At that time, Julius <b>Plücker</b> held Bonn's chair of mathematics and experimental physics, {{but by the time}} Klein became his assistant, in 1866, Plücker's interest was geometry.

40|$|Managements of tea estates {{have often}} given {{preference}} to female labour over male labour, {{on the assumption}} that women were 'naturally' more suited to plucking tea. They also were thought to be cheaper and more docile than men. In this chapter the author focuses on women <b>pluckers</b> at the Tole Tea Estate, one of the estates in Cameroon owned by the Cameroon Development Corporation (CDC). The estate was constructed in 1954 and marked {{a turning point in the}} history of the CDC. It was the first estate in Cameroon to produce tea and the first estate to recruit predominantly female labour. The author first examines what categories of women tended to sell their labour power to the estate management and how this relates to customary patriarchal controls in the local communities. Then he highlights the intensification of managerial control and exploitation of women <b>pluckers</b> during the economic crisis that has affected the corporation since 1986 - 1987. Finally, he deals with the response of women <b>pluckers</b> to this severe crisis, showing that they have adopted various strategies to cope with the structural adjustment measures which have been planned and implemented by the management in close cooperation with the State-controlled trade union. What emerges from this study is that even during the economic crisis the management has failed to fully control the women <b>pluckers</b> in the labour proces...|$|R

25|$|Decomposable k-vectors in Λk'V {{correspond}} to weighted k-dimensional linear subspaces of V.

25|$|Letting (x0:x1:x2:x3) be {{the point}} coordinates, four {{possible}} points on a line each have coordinates x'i= p'ij, for j= 0…3. Some of these possible points may be inadmissible because all coordinates are zero, but since at least one <b>Plücker</b> coordinate is nonzero, at least two distinct points are guaranteed.|$|E
25|$|For example, suppose L and L are {{distinct}} lines in P3 determined by points x, y and x, y, respectively. Linear combinations of their determining points give linear combinations of their <b>Plücker</b> coordinates, generating a one-parameter family of lines containing L and L. This {{corresponds to a}} one-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.|$|E

40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between plantation labour and gender in Africa, particularly Cameroon. It demonstrates that the introduction of plantation labour during colonial rule has had significant consequences for gender roles and relations within and beyond the capitalist labour process. These effects have been quite ambivalent, being marked by both profound changes and remarkable continuities. The book focuses on two tea estates established in anglophone Cameroon in the 1950 s, the Tole Estate and the Ndu Estate, the first employing mainly female <b>pluckers,</b> the second mainly male <b>pluckers.</b> This allows for {{an examination of the}} variations in male and female workers' modes of resistance to the control and exploitation they meet in the labour process.

40|$|Predicting energy {{expenditure}} from physical activity, {{heart rate and}} anthropometry in female Indian tea <b>pluckers</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to test a methodological procedure for estimating {{energy expenditure}} for a population of Indian female tea <b>pluckers.</b> Subjects (N= 40; age 20 - 50 y) working on a tea estate in West Bengal, India participated in the study. Each subject wore an Actigraph accelerometer, Polar heart rate monitor and Cosmed K 4 b 2 indirect calorimeter during a 90 -minute period to assess minute-by-minute physical activity (PA), heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE), respectively. The testing period was meant to replicate a normal tea <b>plucker’s</b> workday which included 2 periods of rest, 3 periods of plucking while carrying weight (0, 5, and 10 kg) and 3 periods of walking while carrying weight (15, 20, 25 kg). An EE prediction equation was generated using a branched method that first distinguishes time during normal workday activities (resting, plucking, walking) using accelerometer counts. Resting EE was estimated from age and weight, while minute-by-minute non-resting EE was estimated from HR and BMI. Rather than creating individually calibrated curves for each subject, individuals can be grouped based on BMI categories ( 24. 5) to predict EE during the work day. Predicted EE will be used to evaluate the efficiency of performing work (weight of tea plucked/kcal EE) relative to iron status in an independent sample of 248 tea <b>pluckers.</b> We conclude that energy expenditure can be accurately predicted with a branched equation based on PA, HR, age, weight, and height for a specific population participating in a known set of activities...|$|R
25|$|A {{ruled surface}} {{is a family}} of lines that is not {{necessarily}} linear. It corresponds to a curve on the Klein quadric. For example, a hyperboloid of one sheet is a quadric surface in P3 ruled by two different families of lines, one line of each passing through each point of the surface; each family corresponds under the <b>Plücker</b> map to a conic section within the Klein quadric in P5.|$|E
25|$|Coordinates {{systems are}} often used to specify the {{position}} of a point, but they may also be used to specify the position of more complex figures such as lines, planes, circles or spheres. For example, <b>Plücker</b> coordinates are used to determine {{the position of a}} line in space. When there is a need, the type of figure being described is used to distinguish the type of coordinate system, for example the term line coordinates is used for any coordinate system that specifies the position of a line.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{impetus to}} {{consider}} continuous groups came from ideas of Bernhard Riemann, on {{the foundations of}} geometry, and their further development {{in the hands of}} Klein.

40|$|Context: Musculoskeletal pain {{is common}} among tea leaf <b>pluckers</b> and is {{attributed}} to the load they carry, long working hours, the terrain, and insufficient job rotations. As a result of this, their health and work capacity are affected. Aims: To assess the prevalence, patterns, and factors associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs) among <b>pluckers</b> in a tea plantation in Annamalai, Tamil Nadu, India. Settings and Design: This cross-sectional study surveyed 195 <b>pluckers</b> selected by simple random sampling aged between 18 years and 60 years. Materials and Methods: The interview schedule had four parts––sociodemographic detail, Standard Nordic Scale, numeric and facial pain rating tool, and a tool to assess factors associated with WRMDs. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. Results: Prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in the last 12 months and the last 7 days was 83. 6 % and 78. 5 %, respectively. The most common site for last 1 year was shoulder (59 %) and for last 7 days was the lower back (52. 8 %). Independent t-test revealed that {{the mean age of}} those with pain was 6. 59 year more and mean years of employment was 1. 38 years more among the workers with pain compared to workers without pain. Increasing morbidities among workers was also significantly associated with an increase in WRMDs on Chi-square test. Conclusions: The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was high among tea <b>pluckers</b> and the most common site during the last 12 months and the last 7 days was the shoulder and lower back respectively was mild in character.
