5000|$|The initial M855A1 design began {{testing in}} late 2007. Its alloy core had no toxic metals {{and could be}} cheaply produced. Materials and {{production}} methods, like a reverse-drawn jacket for a clean boat tail, led to yaw insensitivity, improved soft target performance, and consistent dispersion. The steel penetrator was retained and, through greater velocity and better composition and placement, substantially improved hard target performance. It met short-barrel optimization, ballistic similarity, and <b>producibility</b> requirements; it cost slightly more than the M855, but {{far less than the}} Mk 262. Production prove-out testing would take time, as over a million rounds had to be test-fired to ensure instances of failure would not occur at the 1 billion rounds per year scale. As information began to be made public, the original program objective to create a [...] "green round" [...] led to confusion and criticism that the Army was focusing more on environmental safety than on performance. Just as testing was being completed and the first production lots were being prepared in 2009, the rounds were found to fail at high temperatures. This caused a one-year delay to replace the bullet core, which solved the temperature problem and also improved cost and <b>producibility.</b>|$|E

5000|$|According to the ASME Y14.5-2009 [...] standard, {{the purpose}} of {{geometric}} dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) is to describe the engineering intent of parts and assemblies.

GD&T can more accurately define the dimensional requirements for a part, allowing over 50% more tolerance zone than coordinate (or linear) dimensioning in some cases. Proper application of GD&T will ensure that the part defined on the drawing has the desired form, fit (within limits) and function with the largest possible tolerances. GD&T can add quality and reduce cost {{at the same time}} through <b>producibility.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of the first level of hardware engineering requirements is not a purely analytical exercise and should also involve both the hardware architect and engineer. If any compromises are to be made—to meet constraints like cost, schedule, power, or space, the architect must ensure that the final product and overall look and feel do not stray very far from the user's intent. The engineer should focus on developing a design that optimizes the constraints but ensures a workable and reliable product. The architect is primarily concerned with the comfort and usability of the product; the engineer is primarily concerned with the <b>producibility</b> and utility of the product.|$|E
50|$|New product {{development}} (NPD) is the complete process of bringing {{a new product}} to market. Product engineering refers {{to the process of}} designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, <b>producibility,</b> quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. Project Management techniques are used to manage the design and development progress using the phase-gate model in the {{product development}} process. Design for manufacturability (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products {{in such a way that}} they are easy to manufacture.|$|E
50|$|To ensure success, desired {{operational}} outcomes must be imparted during {{design and}} development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, <b>producibility,</b> disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters {{are required to}} be considered at {{the early stages of}} design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to {{be an integral part of}} the early design phases.|$|E
50|$|Gas flaring at many {{oil and gas}} {{production}} sites protects against the dangers of over-pressuring industrial plant equipment. When petroleum crude oil is extracted and produced from onshore or offshore oil wells, raw natural gas associated with the oil is brought to the surface as well. Especially in areas of the world lacking pipelines and other gas transportation infrastructure, vast amounts of such associated gas are commonly flared as waste or unusable gas. The flaring of associated gas may occur {{at the top of a}} vertical flare stack (as in the adjacent photo) or it may occur in a ground-level flare in an earthen pit. Preferably, associated gas is reinjected into the reservoir, which saves it for future use while maintaining higher well pressure and crude oil <b>producibility.</b>|$|E
50|$|Product {{engineering}} {{refers to}} the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, <b>producibility,</b> quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. These product characteristics are generally all sought in the attempt to make the resulting product attractive to its intended market and a successful contributor to the business of the organization that intends to offer the product to that market. It includes design, development and transitioning to manufacturing of the product. The term encompasses developing the concept of the product and the design and development of its mechanical, electronics and software components. After the initial design and development is done, transitioning the product to manufacture it in volumes is considered part of product engineering.|$|E
50|$|The first algorithmically programmable, analog CNN {{processor}} {{was created}} in 1993. It was named the CNN Universal Processor because its internal controller allowed multiple templates to be performed on the same data set, thus simulating multiple layers and allowing for universal computation. Included in the design was a single layer 8x8 CCN, interfaces, analog memory, switching logic, and software. The processor was developed {{in order to determine}} CNN processor <b>producibility</b> and utility. The CNN concept proved promising and by 2000, there were at least six organizations designing algorithmically programmable, analog CNN processors. This is when AnaFocus, a mixed-signal semiconductor company that emerged from research at The University of Seville, introduced their ACE prototype CNN processor product line. Their first ACE processor contained 20x20 B/W processor units; their next ACE processor provided 48x48 grayscale processor units, and their latest ACE processor contains 128x128 grayscale processor units. Over time, not only did the number of processing elements increase, but their speed improved, the number of functions they can perform increased, and a seamless detector interface was integrated into the silicon (yielding considerably improved interface). The ability to embed the detector interface into the CNN processor allows for real-time interaction between the sensing and processing. AnaFocus has a multilayer CASE prototype CNN processors line. The latest CASE processor is a three layer 32x32 CNN processor. Their work in CNN processors is currently culminating in their soon-to-be-released, commercially available Eye-RIS product line that consists of all the processors, co-processors, software development kits, and support needed to program and integrate an analog processor into a system.|$|E
40|$|<b>Producibility</b> is an {{emergent}} {{property of}} product development and manufacturing systems that encapsulates quality, product compliance, cost, and schedule. Detailed product definition and process variation {{have traditionally been}} a focus area for understanding risk for <b>producibility</b> losses. It is proposed for this investigation that while assumptions inherent to product configuration and process selection can significantly impact <b>producibility,</b> <b>producibility</b> risk and realized <b>producibility</b> losses are primarily indicated by organizational design assumptions and associated phased implementation of programmatic governance. This premise is systematically explored through an assessment of organizational dynamics and product development performance within Aerospace Corporation X. An extension of the hazard analysis technique System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is invoked for leading indicator derivation from assumptions underlying causality of inadequate <b>producibility</b> control. Indicator integration with risk management processes is outlined, and a combination of expert-assessments and quality loss correlation are used to validate indicator significance. As {{a result of these}} investigations, it is concluded that functional isolation, phased capability and control, and differing performance incentives are central to <b>producibility</b> loss. In addition, these factors are deemed to be more important than product feature-based sources of <b>producibility</b> risk. Extension of STPA for indicator identification is validated and recommendations are provided for implementation of a leading indicator monitoring program. by Allen J. Ball. Thesis: M. B.

In this way, the structural analysis of resources leads to the political economy of resources and structural change. Both the structural and the macroeconomic approaches to scarcities and rents highlight the role of economic and technological history in making visible constraints and opportunities arising from the changing relationship between natural or technological scarcities and the <b>producibility</b> of resources and goods. Different historical contexts also had an important influence in drifting the economists’ attention from scarcity to <b>producibility,</b> or the other way round, and in shaping the economic theory of resources accordingly.

40|$|In any {{aerospace}} manufacturing operation, including Pratt & Whitney's Compression Systems Module Center, <b>producibility</b> {{problems can}} be major drivers of cost. Much of the literature focuses on design for manufacturability {{as a solution to}} <b>producibility</b> problems. While this is a valuable approach, this study focuses on manufacturing process improvement as a solution to <b>producibility</b> issues. Two methods of process improvement are discussed, process automation and process reengineering. This thesis first surveys some of the major <b>producibility</b> problems at Pratt & Whitney's Compression Systems Module Center, {{as well as some of}} the efforts underway to address them. One of the largest issues, operator data input errors, is described in detail as a case study. Wireless gauging with automatic offset adjustment is proposed as a focused technological solution to this issue. As part of this study, funding has been obtained to implement the solution and testing has been conducted. This is an example of process automation. However, a broader process reengineering effort is also proposed. The fundamental question of why <b>producibility</b> problems tend to persist is also examined. by Daniel Hoopes. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|For many products, the {{adaptation}} to customer specifications is essential and requires flexible product design and manufacture while maintaining competitive pricing. Engineering design is often concerned with striking a good balance between product properties, e. g. performance, {{and the resources}} required to manufacture and assemble the product. When different courses of action are to be evaluated, even seemingly small changes in customer requirements, product design, and manufacturing properties have to be handled with caution. Small changes can entail products with: low level of conformability with the manufacturing system, highly increased cost, and extended manufacturing lead-time. For most companies, the manufacturing system is a valuable asset that {{is more or less}} fixed and only minor adaptations are allowed. This implies that the product design has to be adapted to the manufacturing system to a large extent. Design for <b>producibility</b> (DFP) is the process in which a systematic method is used to reach the required functional properties of the product {{at the same time as}} good compliance with the manufacturing system is ensured. The DFP process usually needs to involve several persons simultaneously for the purpose of sharing information and knowledge. For many manufacturing companies, the collaboration between engineering design and production engineering is a critical issue and they have to improve their methods and tools for ensuring and enhancing <b>producibility.</b> This can be achieved by introducing computer-supported design for <b>producibility.</b> The present research is intended to contribute to the development and utilisation of different application systems that can be used as such computer support. The aim is to provide companies with support in application system development and to show how different application systems can be used in a systematic way as means to ensure and enhance <b>producibility.</b> The competitive advantages to gain from introducing computer-supported design for <b>producibility</b> are: product designs with high level of conformability with the production system, shortened manufacturing lead-time, and decreased manufacturing cost. This work contributes to the achievement of these advantages by introducing a framework with principles and models supporting application systems development. Three types of application systems are presented and their practical usefulness is examined, showing practitioners how <b>producibility</b> aspects can be assessed systematically. The main scientific and theoretical contribution of the work comprises: the descriptions concerning how to structure and describe the product and product-related information (manufacturing requirements, costs, process plans and production resources), the foundation of different information models, and the clarification of the models’ interrelationships. This is perceived as a contribution to a better understanding of the domains and how they relate to each other.

The thesis contributes to the goal of fully integrated <b>producibility</b> assessment in multi-disciplinary studies to support product development process. Completed assessment setup was used on 29 parametrically varied TRS case study models which had been generated using Design of Experiment sampling methods. All models were run through the system to extract their geometry metrics, i. e. edge length, thicknesses, curvature etc. Afterwards, extracted data was processed into <b>producibility</b> indicators defining different weld groups. Final data allowed initial production process plans’ assessment and preliminary prediction of additional design driven manufacturing time. All obtained data was integrated with multi-disciplinary study results and various response surfaces were generated. The problems encountered during the thesis execution involved systematic analysis setup to extract and verify CAD geometry data, assessment of meaningfulness of <b>producibility</b> metrics, development of semi-automated data post-processing module and relating product design to its manufacturing aspects. Commercial and in-house developed software were used extensively to demonstrate the results of the system with the help of continuous company support to mitigate indispensable bottlenecks along the way.
