5|$|Dwain Anthony Chambers (born 5 April 1978) is {{a retired}} British track sprinter. He has won {{international}} medals at World and European level {{and is one of}} the fastest European sprinters in the history of athletics. His <b>primary</b> <b>event</b> is the 100metres, in which he has the fourth fastest time by a British sprinter. He is the European record holder for the 60 metres and 4×100 metres relay events with 6.42seconds and 37.73s respectively. He received a two-year athletics ban in 2003 after testing positive for THG, a banned performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to competition, the 200 m {{remained}} Bolt's <b>primary</b> <b>event,</b> beating Justin Gatlin's meet record in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, {{despite the fact that}} bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory. However, a sub-20-second finish was soon his, as he set a new personal best of 19.88 s at the 2006 Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne, Switzerland, finishing behind Xavier Carter and Tyson Gay to earn a bronze medal. Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience. Also, he was more keen on competing over longer distances, setting his sights on running regularly in both 200 m and 400 m events within the next two years.|$|E

In flies, scute works to direct neuronal development, but this gene also acquired a role in the <b>primary</b> <b>event</b> of sex determination – X chromosome counting – by becoming an X chromosome signal element (XSE).|$|E
40|$|Titanium dioxide {{particles}} in solution {{can be used}} as photocatalysts and are of great interest because of their application in the detoxification of polluted ecosystems. Laser-induced opto-acoustic calorimetry (LIOAC) allows the investigation of thermal relaxations, thus providing thermodynamic and kinetic data of short lived species produced by the absorption of light-pulses. In this thesis LIOAC has been applied to study <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> in aqueous colloidal TiO 2 solutions for the first time. In summary one can say that laser-induced opto-acoustic calorimetry is suitable to study <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> in these colloidal systems. With LIOAC the dark side of a TiO 2 particle is monitored and it is possible to listen to <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> not visible with optical methods. Detailed abstract</A...|$|R
40|$|Summary High {{stability}} of transgene expression {{is essential for}} functional genomics studies using transfor-mation approaches and for application of genetic engi-neering to commercial forestry. We quantified expression of two reporter genes, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the herbicide bialaphos resistance gene (BAR), in 2256 transgenic poplar trees derived from 404 <b>primary</b> <b>events,</b> and in 106 in vitro-redifferentiated subevents, over 3 years in the greenhouse and in the field. No gene silencing (complete breakdown of expression) was observed for GFP or BAR expression {{in any of the}} <b>primary</b> transgenic <b>events</b> {{during the course of the}} study. Transgenic cassettes were physically eliminated in four subevents (2. 5 %) derived from three different <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> during re-organogenesis. Transgene copy numbe...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{analyses}} of the MJO tend to produce a repeating cycle, such that any particular feature cannot be unambiguously attributed to the current or previous event. We {{take advantage of the}} sporadic nature of the MJO and classify each observed Madden-Julian (MJ) <b>event</b> as either <b>primary,</b> with no immediately preceding MJ event, or successive, which does immediately follow a preceding event. 40 % of MJ <b>events</b> are <b>primary</b> <b>events.</b> Precursor features of the <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> can be unambiguously attributed to that event. A suppressed convective anomaly grows and decays in situ over the Indian Ocean, {{prior to the start of}} most <b>primary</b> MJ <b>events.</b> An associated mid-tropospheric temperature anomaly destabilises the atmosphere, leading to the generation of the active MJ <b>event.</b> Hence, <b>primary</b> MJ <b>events</b> appear to be thermodynamically triggered by a previous dry period, although stochastic forcing may also be important. Other theories predict that boundary-layer convergence, humidity, propagation of dynamical structures around the Equator, sea surface temperatures, and lateral forcing by extratropical transients may all be important in triggering an event. Although precursor signals from these mechanisms are diagnosed from reanalysis and satellite observational data in the successive MJ events, they are all absent in the <b>primary</b> MJ <b>events.</b> Hence, it appears that these apparent precursor signals are part of the MJO once it is established, but do not play a role in the spontaneous generation of the MJO. The most frequent starting location of the <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> is the Indian Ocean, but over half of them start elsewhere, from the maritime continent to the western Pacific...|$|R
25|$|Along with {{significant}} rises in popularity in mixed martial arts (MMA), {{a number of}} fight leagues such as the UFC have taken interest in Las Vegas as a <b>primary</b> <b>event</b> location due {{to the number of}} suitable host venues. The Mandalay Bay Events Center and MGM Grand Garden Arena are among some of the more popular venues for fighting events such as MMA and have hosted several UFC and other MMA title fights. The city has held the most UFC events with 86 events.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a ritual that provides one {{with the ability to}} turn into a wolf. Such a transformation may be related either to lycanthropy itself, a widespread phenomenon, but attested especially in the Balkans-Carpathian region, or a ritual imitation of the behavior and appearance of the wolf. Such a ritual was presumably a military initiation, potentially reserved to a secret brotherhood of warriors (or Männerbünde). To become formidable warriors they would assimilate behavior of the wolf, wearing wolf skins during the ritual. Traces related to wolves as a cult or as totems were found in this area since the Neolithic period, including the Vinča culture artifacts: wolf statues and fairly rudimentary figurines representing dancers with a wolf mask. The items could indicate warrior initiation rites, or ceremonies in which young people put on their seasonal wolf masks. The element of unity of beliefs about werewolves and lycanthropy exists in the magical-religious experience of mystical solidarity with the wolf by whatever means used to obtain it. But all have one original myth, a <b>primary</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
500|$|In October 1999, severe {{flooding}} affected {{portions of}} eastern Mexico and Central America. Rainfall in September preceded the <b>primary</b> <b>event</b> in Mexico, which moistened soils. On October4, Tropical Depression Eleven {{developed in the}} Gulf of Mexico, which drew humidity from the gulf and the Pacific Ocean to produce torrential rainfall in mountainous regions of eastern Mexico, reaching [...] in Jalacingo, Veracruz. This was the third-highest tropical cyclone-related rainfall total in Mexico from 1980-2006, and the event caused the highest rainfall related to tropical cyclones in Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Puebla. In some locations, the daily rainfall represented over 10% of the annual precipitation total. The heaviest rainfall occurred in mountainous regions that were the mouths of several rivers. A broad trough absorbed the depression on October6, and rainfall continued {{for the next few}} days. Additional rainfall occurred in Tabasco state on October18. The floods were estimated as a 1 in 67 year event in one location, although such floods are expected to affect eastern Mexico twice per century, the last time being 1944.|$|E

40|$|Background. Atrial {{fibrillation}} in {{the absence}} of rheumatic valvular disease is associated with a fivefold to sevenfold increased risk of ischemic stroke. Methods and Main Results. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study, a multicenter, randomized trial, compared 325 mg/day aspirin (double-blind) or warfarin with placebo for prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (<b>primary</b> <b>events),</b> and included 1, 330 inpatients and outpatients with constant or intermittent atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 1. 3 years, the rate of <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> in patients assigned to placebo was 6. 3 % per year and was reduced by 42 % in those assigned to aspirin (3. 6 % per year, p= 0. 02; 95 % confidence interval, 9 - 63 %). In the subgroup of warfarin-eligible patients (most less than 76 years old), warfarin dose-adjusted to prolong prothrombin time to 1. 3 -fold to 1. 8 -fold that of control reduced the risk of <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> by 67 % (warfarin versus placebo, 2. 3 % versus 7. 4 % per year, p= 0. 01; 95 % confidence interval, 27 - 85 %). <b>Primary</b> <b>events</b> or death were reduced 58 % (p = 0. 01) by warfarin and 32 % (p= 0. 02) by aspirin.

500|$|Misfortune awaited Bolt at {{the next}} major event, the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Bolt felt that both his work ethic and athleticism had much {{improved}} since the 2004 Olympics, {{and he saw the}} World Championships as a way to live up to expectations, stating, [...] "I really want to make up for what happened in Athens. Hopefully, everything will fall into place". Bolt qualified with runs under 21 s, but he suffered an injury in the final, finishing in last place with a time of 26.27 s. Injuries were preventing him from completing a full professional athletics season, and the eighteen-year-old Bolt still had not proven his mettle in the major world-athletics competitions. However, his appearance made him the youngest ever person to appear in a 200 m world final. Bolt was involved in a car accident in November, and although he suffered only minor facial lacerations, his training schedule was further upset. His manager, Norman Peart, made Bolt's training less intensive, and he had fully recuperated the following week. Bolt had continued to improve his performances, and he reached the world top-5 rankings in 2005 and 2006. Peart and Mills stated their intentions to push Bolt to do longer sprinting distances with the aim of making the 400 m event his <b>primary</b> <b>event</b> by 2007 or 2008. Bolt was less enthusiastic, and demanded that he feel comfortable in his sprinting. He suffered another hamstring injury in March 2006, forcing him to withdraw from the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, and he did not return to track events until May. After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold.|$|E

The <b>primary</b> <b>event</b> and its aftershocks created a zone of destruction between Ma'bar and Dhamar, where older villages were heavily damaged, with adobe or rubble masonry homes suffering the most. Homes and villages that were adjacent to steep slopes or cliffs were susceptible to rockfalls and landslides, but damage was much less pronounced away from the epicentral area, and modern city centers with properly engineered structures were only slightly affected.|$|E
2500|$|International Men's Day {{was inaugurated}} in Botswana in 2011 by {{coordinator}} Geneuvieve Twala. One of the International Men's Day themes promoted {{was to help}} foster youth to unlock their creative identities {{to allow them to}} share their gifts with peers, family and the community, and to be seen and heard for who they are and not how they are perceived. The <b>primary</b> <b>event</b> was a gala dinner titled [...] "One moment for Change" [...] to highlight men's potential and the increasing capabilities of men as innovators of society. The dinner was held to raise funds to cover six months music tuition fees for a group of 20 children from the SOS Children's Village whom IMD ambassadors have adopted as part of a mentoring programme for children. Standard Chartered Bank sponsored the dinner, which included a range of iconic speakers who shared their experience and insights with the audience. Standard Chartered Bank Acting CEO Mr Michael Wiegand opened the event by sharing best practices that Standard Chartered Bank uses to address legitimate issues faced by male employees, including the fact that Standard Chartered Bank is the first company in Botswana to offer paternity leave which, he stated, made their male employees feel valued and that they were working for a 21st-century organization. Mr Tebogo Sebego, senior partner at Sebego & Sharma Attorneys and former chairperson of the Law Society of Botswana gave a keynote speech where he emphasized how the child protection laws should be improved, how the society play a role in creating a safe environment for the future generation of men. Mrs Tjipo Mothobi, Director, GBC Health South Africa gave an address on business collective effort. The District Commissioner in his closing remarks made an announcement that by end of December he was convening a meeting with men in the City where they will engage in dialogue on how they can collectively address the issues and challenges men and boys face. The inaugural event was a success, with radio stations subsequently airing programmes that call for debate on men's issues since IMD. All the businesses and stakeholders involved gave a commitment to be {{part and parcel of the}} next IMD and we are already working on the strategy for 2012.|$|E

In this prospective study, we performed prespecified subgroup analysis according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. Blood pressure was lower in the combined therapy than in the high-dose ARB cohort in both groups with and without CKD. In patients with CKD, significantly more <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> (a composite of cardiovascular events and noncardiovascular death) occurred in the high-dose ARB group than in the combination group (30 vs. 16, respectively, hazard ratio 2. 25).

In patients without CKD, however, the incidence of <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> was similar between the two treatments. The treatment-by-subgroup interaction was significant. Allocation to the high-dose ARB was a significant independent prognostic factor for <b>primary</b> <b>events</b> in patients with CKD.
