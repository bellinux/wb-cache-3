50|$|Polymetallic nodules have {{economically}} valuable metals such as Copper, Cobalt, Nickel and Manganese in {{them and}} are viewed as potential resources {{to take care of}} the depleting land resources and increasing demand of these metals. There are 380 million tons of nodules in the retained Indian <b>Pioneer</b> <b>area.</b> However development of deep subsea technology for mining these resources is a major challenge considering the ultra high pressure environment, very soft soils and other factors. NIOT has been working on a mining concept where a crawler based mining machine collects, crushes and pumps nodules to the mother ship using a positive displacement pump through a flexible riser system. It is expected that multiple mining machines will cover the mining field during large scale commercial mining operations. With this perspective, the integrated mining system is under development for demonstration of deep-sea mining of polymetallic nodules.|$|E
50|$|A {{major issue}} was exactly {{who would be}} {{traveling}} to Florida to be the on-site manager. Rev. Hall's oldest son, Paul Lyman Hall, had epilepsy and severe mental disabilities, his youngest son, Wendell Woods Hall, was still in grade school, and Rev. Hall himself would be busy traveling the country giving speeches to possible investors and farmers. The answer was in Rev. Hall's eighteen-year-old son, G. Barton (Bart) Hall, a 1910 graduate of the University of Chicago's high school program. Bart, born in 1892, was a handsome {{young man who had}} transferred to the University high school for his senior year and played on the school baseball team {{as well as in the}} Church League basketball team for the Christian Tabernacle. Bart loaded up a Ford Model A customized as a camper and traveled about the Midwest to visit various relatives before heading down to Florida to begin the process of carving a town out of the palmetto scrub in what was certainly a <b>pioneer</b> <b>area</b> of the State.|$|E
5000|$|At mid-mountain, {{a second}} day lodge (Pioneer Lodge - 1973) sits at 6800 ft with a sizable parking lot, a cluster of condominia (1975), and the Jason Harper Training Center. From this <b>Pioneer</b> <b>area,</b> there is {{direct access to the}} gentle south-facing slopes served by a triple chairlift, Morning Star (#2) and the north-facing slopes of the Bitterroot (#5), a double chair lift (vertical: 525 ft), which runs only on {{weekends}} and holidays. In addition, there is connecting trail access {{to the base of the}} Superior Express (#3) lift. With its 1500 ft vertical rise, chair, the Superior Express serves the advanced & expert terrain on the northern face of Shafer Butte, unloading at 7480 ft. The lift replaced a Riblet double chairlift built in 1965 and cut the ride time of the original lift in half. [...] Night skiing was added to the Superior area with the installation of lights in the summer of 1986, and Morning Star was converted from a double to a triple chairlift in 1999.|$|E

Haphazard land settlement of the past has led to many subsequent problems for the countries in which the frontier has appeared. Too often migration to the fringe has resulted in marginal living for the settlers. Land settlement at the present time is changing due to the growing urban standard of living which the settlers demand. [ [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} of manganese nodules {{for the first}} time in 1981 by Indian scientists heralded an era of deepsea exploration and research in India. The exploration for polymetallic nodules in the Central Indian Ocean was formally launched in 1982. The country was also recognized as a Pioneer Investor in 1982. Massive exploration efforts encompassing over 4 million km 2 of the deep sea floor were undertaken over the last two decades. This involved systematic grid sampling, detailed chemical analysis for resource evaluation and deciphering the topography of the Central Indian Ocean. These efforts led to the allocation of a <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Area</b> in 1987 and also enabled subsequent phase wise relinquishment of the area. Having relinquished 50 % of the allocated area, a...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} of 1950 through 2000, a green-revolution-based model mostly for {{commodities}} boosted global agricultural production. From the 70 ’s, this design became consolidated in Brazil and other countries because of policies and strategies by states and private groups. However, some doubts has been raised on its environmental and socioeconomic issues, in special for family farming. This study aimed to contribute by identifying changes and resistance in agricultural structures, systems and demographic aspects of this model and its adoption by farmers. It {{was carried out in}} the state of Paraná - Brazil, within the microregion of Toledo and in the northern <b>pioneer</b> <b>area,</b> which represent the history and diversity of this state about socioeconomic and human aspects, as well as technical development. It was based on statistics of agricultural censuses (1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1996 and 2006), population censuses (1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010) and municipal agricultural production data (1980 - 2012). Data from both areas were compared to each other and analyzed in face of state changes. There has been a decrease in farming properties and rural population, with an outstanding {{decline in the number of}} young people and women. Moreover, results showed a large reduction of properties with 20 to 50 ha, and an increase in those of up to 2 ha. Such decline is due to technological standard changes throughout the period, as well as recent grants offered to rural areas, as housing and leisure spaces. Both regions showed expansion of soybean plantations, but integrating distinctively to agriculture and, finally, family farming continuity, despite the intense changes...|$|E
40|$|The Multimedia Database Management System (MDMS) {{has been}} {{developed}} in the commercial software package Toolbook. Design and implementation, which {{was carried out by}} C. Asiala, is now essentially complete. Regional location maps of southern San Joaquin Valley oil fields, structure contour maps of the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>area,</b> core photos, core data, thin-section and SEM photomicrographs of core materials, structural cross sections through Pioneer Anticline, an atlas of photomicrographs; illustrating typical diagenetic features observed in San Joaquin Valley petroleum reservoirs, elemental and spectral data collected on Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) standards, and all quarterly and annual reports submitted to DOE for this project were scanned into the MDMS. All data and information are accessible through dropdown menus and hotlinks in a Table of Contents. A tutorial is presented up front to guide users through the MDMS and instruct them on the various ways in which data can be viewed and retrieved. Version 1. 0 of the MDMS was written to CD ROM and distributed to participants in a Technology Transfer Workshop in Bakersfield, CA, in September, 1996. Version 1. 1, which contains additional information and has been reorganized for easier use, is nearing completion. All measured and computed log curves (computed curves represent parameters such as porosity, water saturation, and clay content, which were calculated from the measured log traces using specially developed algorithms) for the 45 + project wells on Pioneer Anticline are now in the MDMS in LAS (log ASCII) format, and can be exported to any commercial log evaluation program for manipulation and analysis.

40|$|International audienceThe ponerine ant Pachycondyla goeldii is a monogynous (i. e. one queen per colony) {{arboreal}} {{species that}} colonizes <b>pioneer</b> <b>areas.</b> Founding queens and first generation workers initiate their own ant garden {{by building a}} cardboard-like structure into which epiphyte seeds are integrated. Following {{the growth of the}} epiphyte, the colony establishes its nest within the root system. This particular nest-building behavior is crucial in an environment where suitable nest sites are rare. Nevertheless, the slow growing process of ant gardens does not allow this species to readily evacuate and find another refuge in the advent of an attack by a predator or worsening climatic conditions. Previous field studies of P. goeldii were performed after forest destruction and subsequent colonization by P. goeldii. As a result, the colonies studied where relatively young and monodomous (i. e. one nest per colony). Our study of nest composition, worker exchanges between ant gardens in the field, and dyadic encounters shows that mature colonies of P. goeldii are polydomous (i. e. multiple nests per colony). In ants, the association of polydomy with monogyny has infrequently been reported. To our knowledge, P. goeldii represents the first record of a Ponerinae exhibiting both these particular characteristics. Our field and laboratory experiments suggest that polydomy is adaptively advantageous in coping with the microclimatic instability of <b>pioneer</b> <b>areas</b> by providing colonies with easily accessible nests...|$|R
