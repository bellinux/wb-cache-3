5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and <b>programmatic</b> intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's <b>programmatic</b> trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5|$|Non-musical subjects, both {{religious}} and numerological, influenced Sorabji's music, too, {{and he took}} inspiration from various sources. His Fifth Piano Sonata (Opus archimagicum) is inspired by the tarot, and his Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone has seven movements titled after the bodily centres of Tantric and Shaktic yoga. The song Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi sets the text of a Catholic benediction. However, Sorabji did not intend the first two of these works to be <b>programmatic,</b> and he heaped scorn on attempts to represent stories or ideologies in music. Nevertheless, some of his works {{have been described as}} <b>programmatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, FSU moved the lab {{to its current}} {{location}} west of Turkey Point, on land donated by Edward Ball, {{the founder of the}} St. Joe Paper Company, and changed its name to The Edward Ball Marine Laboratory. In 2006, the lab became known as The Florida State University Coastal and Marine Laboratory (FSUCML), a name that better reflects the expanded <b>programmatic</b> base of its research, education, and outreach missions.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, {{does not}} rise to {{the same level of}} {{inspiration}} as his <b>programmatic</b> works; he needed fantasy to {{bring out the best in}} him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.|$|E
5|$|The Burial Council's core {{contention}} is the city's decision {{to conduct an}} archaeological survey of the rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's <b>programmatic</b> agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.|$|E
5|$|The Transitional Programme was {{the central}} <b>programmatic</b> {{statement}} of the congress, summarising its strategic and tactical conceptions for the revolutionary period that it saw opening up {{as a result of}} the war which Trotsky had been predicting for some years. It is not, however, the definitive programme of the Fourth International as is often suggested but instead contains a summation of the conjunctural understanding of the movement at that date and a series of transitional policies designed to develop the struggle for workers' power.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly <b>programmatic</b> in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is {{determined}} by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E
5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems {{were based on}} actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song broke away from this pattern of <b>programmatic</b> symphonic works, as Dvořák did not specify a specific accompanying text, and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized {{as a reason for}} its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested that the work was intended to be autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E
5|$|In vocal music, noisy {{nonsense}} syllables {{were used to}} imitate battle drums and cannon fire long before Clément Janequin made these devices famous in his <b>programmatic</b> chanson La bataille (The Battle) in 1528. Unpitched or semi-pitched performance was introduced to formal composition in 1897 by Engelbert Humperdinck, in {{the first version of}} his melodrama, Königskinder. This style of performance {{is believed to have been}} used previously by singers of lieder and popular songs. The technique is best known, however, from somewhat later compositions by Arnold Schoenberg, who introduced it for solo voices in his Gurrelieder (1900–11), Pierrot Lunaire (1913), and the opera Moses und Aron (1930–32), and for chorus in Die Glückliche Hand (1910–13). Later composers who have made prominent use of the device include Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Benjamin Britten (in Death in Venice, 1973), Mauricio Kagel, and Wolfgang Rihm (in his opera Jakob Lenz, 1977–78, amongst other works). A well-known example of this style of performance in popular music was Rex Harrison's portrayal of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady. Another form of unpitched vocal music is the speaking chorus, prominently represented by Ernst Toch's 1930 Geographical Fugue, an example of the Gebrauchsmusik fashionable in Germany at that time.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, 's cycle Aus Odysseus Fahrten (From Odysseus'Voyage, Op.6, 1903) {{was equally}} <b>programmatic</b> and {{included}} {{the visit to}} Circe's Isle (Die Insel der Circe) as its second long section. After a depiction of the sea voyage, a bass clarinet passage introduces an ensemble of flute, harp and solo violin over a lightly orchestrated accompaniment, suggesting Circe's seductive attempt to hold Odysseus back from traveling further. Alan Hovhaness' Circe Symphony (No.18, Op.204a, 1963) is a late example of such <b>programmatic</b> writing. It is, in fact, only a slightly changed version of his ballet music of that year, {{with the addition of}} more strings, a second timpanist and celesta.|$|E
25|$|As Bellows' later oils {{focused more}} on {{domestic}} life, {{with his wife and}} daughters as beloved subjects, the paintings also displayed an increasingly <b>programmatic</b> and theoretical approach to color and design, a marked departure from the fluid muscularity of the early work.|$|E

Over that year, the AOL Platforms division saw a 21% increase in revenue, but a drop in adjusted OIBDA due to increased investments in the company’s video and <b>programmatic</b> platforms.|$|E
25|$|Liszt was a {{prolific}} composer. He {{is best known}} for his piano music, but he also wrote for orchestra, and for other ensembles, virtually always including keyboard. His piano works are often marked by their difficulty. Some of his works are <b>programmatic</b> based on extra-musical inspirations such as a poetry or art. Liszt is credited with the creation of the symphonic poem.|$|E
25|$|Dussek wrote {{numerous}} solo piano works, including 34 Piano Sonatas {{as well as}} {{a number}} of <b>programmatic</b> compositions. His The Sufferings of the Queen of France (composed in 1793, C 98), for example, is an episodic account of Marie Antoinette with interpolated texts relating to the Queen's misfortunes, including her sorrow at being separated from her children and her final moments on the scaffold before the guillotine.|$|E
25|$|His two {{representative}} {{works are}} the tone poems Aphrodite and Tam O'Shanter, both for large orchestra. The compositions are both highly episodic, <b>programmatic</b> and well-orchestrated. Aphrodite evokes a majestic {{image of the}} sea, and Tam O'Shanter (based on the tale by Robert Burns) {{is a work of}} musical story-telling of similar caliber as some of Richard Strauss's pieces, such as the latter's Don Quixote.|$|E
25|$|Motives also figured {{occasionally}} in purely instrumental {{music of the}} Romantic period. The related idea of the musical idée fixe was coined by Hector Berlioz in reference to his Symphonie fantastique (1830). This purely instrumental, <b>programmatic</b> work (subtitled Episode in the Life of an Artist) features a recurring melody representing {{the object of the}} artist's obsessive affection and depicting her presence in various real and imagined situations.|$|E

25|$|The five {{movement}} Symphonie fantastique, {{partly due}} to its fame, is considered by most to be Berlioz's most outstanding work, and the work had a considerable impact when first performed in 1830, 3 years {{after the death of}} Beethoven and 2 years after that of Schubert. It is famous for its innovations {{in the form of the}} <b>programmatic</b> symphony. The story behind this work relates to Berlioz himself and can be considered somewhat autobiographical.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>programmatic</b> chansons {{for which he is}} most famous, he also wrote short and refined compositions more in the style of Claudin de Sermisy. For these he set texts by some of the prominent poets of the time, including Clément Marot. Late in his life he wrote the Psalm settings based on Genevan tunes. Since there is no documentary evidence, the question of whether he sympathized with the Protestants remains unanswered.|$|E

25|$|Isotretinoin's exact {{mechanism}} of action is unknown, but several {{studies have shown that}} isotretinoin induces apoptosis (<b>programmatic</b> cell death) in various cells in the body. Cell death may be instigated in the meibomian glands, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells and—important for treatment of acne—in sebaceous gland cells. Isotretinoin has a low affinity for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), but may be converted intracellularly to metabolites that act as agonists of RAR and RXR nuclear receptors.|$|E
25|$|Kretzer's <b>programmatic</b> focuses lie on {{the works}} of Johann Sebastian Bach, also in the orchestral {{extended}} versions of Busoni, on the sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, the sonatas and piano concertos of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven, on the oeuvres of Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Isaac Albéniz, Claude Debussy and Sergei Rachmaninoff. His involvement with contemporary music is reflected in his recording of the dodecaphonic piano works of the eastern German composer Rudolf Halaczinsky (1922-1999).|$|E
25|$|Ludwig van Beethoven {{revolutionized}} timpani {{music in}} the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond <b>programmatic</b> use. For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with four solo timpani strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) sets the timpani (tuned an octave apart) against the orchestra {{in a sort of}} call and response.|$|E
25|$|The NDU {{book ends}} by {{suggesting}} that HTS {{be turned over to}} the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). There were a number of reasons the team suggested USASOC would be a better fit for HTS: TRADOC had been a prime cause of multiple <b>programmatic</b> problems for HTS throughout its history; the US military has a history of intentionally forgetting and deinstitutionalizing cultural programs; and the future operating environment would be utilizing Special Operations forces to a greater degree than regular Army/Marines units.|$|E
25|$|With {{the aid of}} the Porto {{architect}} José Marques da Silva (1869-1947), {{the author}} of the first drafts for the Villa and the Park, Carlos Alberto Cabral gradually put together the different views and contributions. This can be seen in an annotation in a <b>programmatic</b> plan, proving his desire to keep only what was essential by integrating the structure of the existing gardens in the new plans. This plan also contains sketches of ideas that would later materialize in Gréber’s plans for the Park.|$|E
