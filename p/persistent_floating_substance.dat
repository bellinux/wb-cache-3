In the case of S. molesta, they are eggbeater shaped and topped by hydrophilic tips, which pin the air–water interface and prevent rupture of contact. It has been proposed that these trichomes can oscillate with the air–water interface, when turbulences occur and thereby stabilize the air film. The deformability of such arrays of trichomes requires a certain elasticity of the structures. In this study, we determined the stiffness of the trichome coverage of S. molesta and three other Salvinia species. Our results confirm the elasticity of the trichome coverage in all investigated Salvinia species. We did not reveal a clear relationship between the time of air retention and stiffness of the trichome coverage, {{which means that the}} air retention function is additionally dependent on different parameters, e. g., the trichome shape and surface free energy.

To assess the presence of oil near shorelines during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, we scanned the library of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery collected during the event to determine which images intersected shorelines and appeared to contain oil. In total, 715 SAR images taken during the DWH spill were analyzed and processed, with 188 of the images clearly showing oil. Of these, 156 SAR images showed oil within 10 km of the shoreline with appropriate weather conditions for the detection of oil on SAR data. We found detectable oil in SAR images within 10 km of the shoreline from west Louisiana to west Florida, including near beaches, marshes, and islands.

The following mechanism was considered: lowdensity substance is introduced from below as a result of processes in the liquid core of the Earth and then the light fraction is moving upward driven by buoyancy forces thus disturbing thermal convection flow. It was analyzed how penetration of the light fraction into bottom of the mantle and its upward moving to the outer surface of the mantle changes the thermal convection pattern. Numerical simulation demonstrates that thermal convection in the presence of light component may follow on three possible scenarios: Low-density impurity is floating up and forming a thin layer on the mantle surface.

60|$|From {{this same}} Principle also (viz. the unequal {{pressure}} of the Air against the unequal superficies of the water) proceeds {{the cause of the}} accession or incursion of any floating body against the sides of the containing Vessel; or the appropinquation of two floating bodies, as Bubbles, Corks, Sticks, Straws, &c. one towards another. As for instance, Take a Glass-jar, such as AB in the seventh Figure, and filling it pretty near the top with water, throw into it a small round piece of Cork, as C, and plunge it all over in water, that it be wet, so as that the water may rise up by the sides of it, then placing it any where upon the superficies, about an inch, or one inch and a quarter from any side, and you shall perceive it by degrees to make perpendicularly toward the nearest part of the side, and the nearer it approaches, the faster to be moved, the reason of which Phænomenon will be found no other then this, that the Air has a greater pressure against the middle of the superficies, then it has against those parts that approach nearer, and are contiguous to the sides. Now that the pressure is greater, may (as I shewed before in the explication of the third Figure) be evinced from the flatting of the water in the middle, which arises from the gravity of the under fluid: for since, as I shewed before, if there were no gravity in the under fluid, or that it were equal to that of the upper, the terminating Surface would be Spherical, and since it is the additional {{pressure of the}} gravity of water that makes it so flat, it follows, that the pressure upon the middle must be greater then towards the sides. Hence the Ball having a stronger pressure against that side of it which respects the middle of the superficies, then against that which respects the approximate side, must necessarily move towards that part, from whence it finds least resistance, and so be accelerated, as the resistance decrease. Hence the more the water is raised under that part of its way it is passing above the middle, the faster it is moved: And therefore you will find it to move faster in E then in D, and in D then in C. Neither could I find the <b>floating</b> <b>substance</b> to be moved at all, until it were placed upon some part of the Superficies that was sensibly elevated above the height of the middle part. Now that this may be the true cause, you may try with a blown Bladder, and an exactly round Ball upon a very smooth side of some pliable body, as Horn or Quicksilver. For if the Ball be placed under a part of the Bladder which is upon one side of the middle of its pressure, and you press strongly against the Bladder, you shall find the Ball moved from the middle towards the sides.|$|R

Several empirical studies have suggested that inflation has been significantly more persistent (positively serially correlated) and monetary policy more accommodative of inflation under floating exchange rates than under pegged rates (see Alogoskoufis and Smith, 1991; Alogoskoufis, 1992; Obstfeld, 1995).

40|$|Quality {{of life on}} Earth in {{the future}} will largely depend on the amount of safe water. As the most {{fundamental}} source of life, water is relentlessly consumed and polluted. To halt this trend, many countries are taking extensive measures and investing substantial resources in order to stop the contamination of water and return at least tolerably good water quality to nature. The goal of water purification is to obtain clean water with the sewage sludge as a by-product. Clean water is returned to nature, and further treatment of sludge may be subject to other procedures. The conclusion of this paper is simple. The procedure with purified water is easily achievable, purified water is discharged into rivers, lakes and seas, but the problem of further treatment of sludge remains. This paper presents the basic methods of wastewater treatment and procedures for processing the products from contaminated water. The paper can serve as a basis for further elaboration. Water Pollution In order to ensure normal life of living creatures, the water in which they live or the water they use must have a natural chemical composition and natural features. When, as a result of human activities, the chemical composition of water and the ratio of its chemical elements significantly change, we say that water is polluted. When the pollutants come from industrial plants, we are talking about industrial wastewater, and when they come from households and urban areas, we are talking about municipal wastewater. Both contain a huge amount of pollutants that eventually end up in rivers. Then, thousands of defenseless birds, fish and other animals suffer, and environmental consequences become immeasurable. In addition, the waste fed to the water often ends up in the bodies of marine animals, so they can return to us as food. Thermal water pollution also has multiple effects on the changes in the wildlife composition of aquatic ecosystems. Polluted water can be purified by mechanical, chemical and biological agents. Mechanical methods are based on the effect of physical forces. Chemical agents are based on chemical processes. Biological measures are based on natural laws and activities of living beings. Water saving and its rational use {{are some of the most}} effective ways of saving water from pollution. Water treatment Water treatment is done in two ways: by sedimentation and filtration. Dirt falling on the bottom is called deposition. The passage of clean water through the material is called filtering. Water containing dissolved substances is purified by distillation. To improve the taste of distilled water, aeration should be performed. The sun’s ultraviolet rays destroy biological pollutants. Mechanical, biological and chemical methods are used for water purification. Mechanical methods Mechanical methods are based on the removal of physical impurities from water and the action of natural forces. For this purpose we use: grids and sieves, sedimentation, flotation, filtration, centrifugation, sand sedimentation tanks, grease traps, primary sedimentation tanks and flow equalization tanks. Wastewater aeration equipment is also used within these facilities. Grids and Sieves Larger, insoluble and <b>floating</b> <b>substances</b> in wastewater are removed with grids and sieves. Sedimentation The application of grids and sieves as well as sand sedimentation tanks and grease traps can be viewed as a process of deposition using certain infrastructure facilities intended for this type of separation of impurities. Infrastructure facilities are sedimentation tanks. There are vertical, horizontal and radial flow sedimentation tanks. Flotation Particle resurfacing with bubbles of air is called flotation. The best effect is achieved by aeration of bubbles of smaller diameters in a larger area. Filtration Filtration is a process used in water conditioning to remove insoluble substances. During filtration, water passes through a layer of granular material placed on a perforated surface. Some other processes can also take place during filtration. Centrifugation Centrifugation is a method of separating particles from a suspension due to the effect of the centrifugal force that is many times greater than the force of gravity. For larger water quantities, it is not realistic to apply centrifugation as a water purification technique. Sand sedimentation tanks Substances with specific gravity higher than water, such as sand, gravel, stone, earth, slag, mineral particles, etc., accumulate in the plants called sand traps. Grease traps Substances lighter than water: oil, grease, soap flakes, bits of wood, cork, etc., are removed by means of grease traps. Flow equalization tanks They provide conditions for the slow and steady movement of water and retain wastewater long enough to provide gravity sedimentation of suspended particles. Chemical methods Chemical purification methods are the processes in which the treatment is carried out by means of certain chemical reactions, or certain physical and chemical phenomena. Basic operations of the chemical wastewater treatment are the removal of suspended and colloidal substances: by coagulation and flocculation, and the removal of some dissolved substances: by chemical deposition, ion exchange, oxidation,   gas blowing and adsorption. Chemical deposition The process of chemical deposition is based on the conversion of dissolved substances in wastewater to insoluble compounds, using suitable reagents. Ion exchange Ion exchange is much more widely used as a water preparation process to remove water hardness than as a wastewater purification process. Oxidation Oxidation can convert some organic and inorganic substances in industrial wastewater into compounds that are far less polluting. The most often used oxidant is chlorine. Gas blowing Some dissolved substances can be removed from the wastewater by means of blowing gas, ordinary air or steam. Adsorption Adsorption is a process of accumulating fluid substances on the surface of the solid phase. A substance being adsorbed is  adsorbate, and the phase upon which the adsorption is carried out is called the adsorbent. Biological methods Biological purification processes are based on the activities of a complex microflora, which is in the course of their life cycle adopted by organic and parts of inorganic materials causing wastewater pollution, using them to maintain life activities and to create new cells. During a biological treatment, stabilized sludge is precipitated,and removed from the water in secondary sedimentation tanks. Biological purification processes can be aerobic and anaerobic, with the help of aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms. Aerobic processes with suspended microflora are divided into: the processes with activated sludge in bioaeration tanks, processes in aerated lagoons (biological lagoons) and processes in aerobic (shallow) lakes (biological artificial lakes). Activated sludge process This is an aerobic process of a biological wastewater treatment, as it occurs due to aerobic microbial population. Microorganisms are found in aeration basins, where, with the help of oxygen in the metabolic process, substrate degradation is provided. Microorganisms oxidize the dissolved substrate into carbon dioxide and water. A part of the organic material is synthesized into new cells or used for the growth of existing ones and the rest consists of waste and excess sludge. A part of sludge is returned into the process (activated sludge) where it has a role of an activator of the biological process. The rest of sludge is discharged into the sludge treatment device or disposed of in a proper way. Clear purified water (effluent) is discharged into the recipient, or, if necessary, taken to additional processing. Process in aerobic lagoons Lagoons and shallow basins, as an aerobic biological wastewater treatment method, provide a sufficient amount of oxygen through photosynthesis. Process in shallow lakes Aerobic lakes are large and shallow earthen basins in which wastewater treatment takes place with minimum regulation, practically as natural self-purification. Anaerobic processes The anaerobic treatment process is based on the methane fermentation of organic wastewater pollution, where organic material is converted into a mixture of gases. The use of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen is called anaerobic digestion. Processing products from the wastewater treatment process Waste materials from the wastewater treatment process should have a high proportion of isolated components and a small proportion of the remaining moisture. Sludge treatment methods may include: thickening, stabilization, conditioning, dewatering, drying or oxidation and disposal. In accordance with the applied technology, sludge treatment processes may be biological, technical and mechanical ones. Biological sludge treatment processes are performed for compost production, to improve sludge residue for disposal, for biological stabilization of sludge residue. Composting is the simplest way of processing biodegradable sludge (humus). Compost can be used in agriculture, to revitalize the soil laid bare by fire and to improve the quality of land next to roads. Mechanical-biological treatment of sludge is based on a process of mechanical treatment of sludge, where valuable components are separated from sludge. These components are metal, paper, plastic, nonmetal or harmful substances that cannot be disposed of in landfills. The thermal treatment of sludge is carried out using the following methods: combustion, pyrolysis and gasification. </p...|$|R

Zaradi narave interakcije med laserskimi žarki in gladino vodnih teles smo v prvem delu raziskali, ali % in pod kakšnimi pogoji % je lasersko skeniranje uporabno za zajem topografije vodne gladine. S primerjavo teh meritev z referenčnimi vrednostmi drugačnih merilnih tehnik smo potrdili prvo hipotezo, da je % tako pri laboratorijskih kot tudi terenskih meritvah % mogoče z laserskim skeniranjem zelo natančno zajeti potek vodne gladine predvsem razburkanih, dvofaznih tokov z veliko vertikalno dinamiko, torej kompleksnejših hidravličnih pojavov, kjer so druge merilne metode manj uspešne oziroma neuporabne.

We used an {{experimental}} study to analyse the hydrodynamic conditions at an asymmetric right-angled confluence with incoming supercritical flow at higher Froude numbers (2 % Fr % 12), where dynamic, foamed standing waves form. For a phenomenological {{determination of the}} relations between the integral parameters of water flows and the characteristics of standing waves at the confluence area, we first measured water surface topographies for 168 combinations of two flows (i. e. scenarios at the confluence). Laser scanning was used to measure transversal water surface profiles, which, as a modern non-contact measurement method, allows for measurements of the phenomena with high dynamics as well as high spatial and temporal resolution. Despite its widespread use, laser scanning has not yet been used to acquire clean water topography, without any additional <b>substances,</b> <b>floats,</b> etc. Given the nature of interactions between laser beams and water body surfaces, we investigated, in the first part, the conditions under which laser scanning can be applied in water surface topography measurements. Comparing these measurements with the reference values of other measurement methods supported the first hypothesis that, both in laboratory and field measurements, laser scanning allows for a precise determination of water levels, particularly of turbulent, two-phase flows with high vertical fluctuations, i. e. complex hydraulic phenomena where other measurement methods are less successful or unsuited. In the second part we used the systematically measured water surfaces in the individual cross-sections in the confluence area for all the scenarios for determining the water level%s mean value, and by producing mesh models we constructed the topographies of standing waves. This provided an important basis for analysing confluence topography. The results supported the second hypothesis, i. e. {{that it is possible to}} record phenomenological relations between input, geometrical, and hydraulic flow parameters and the main characteristics of flow structures forming at confluences with incoming supercritical flows. The new, phenomenologically-derived equations modelling the formation of surfaces in the transversal and longitudinal directions and the fluctuation level describe the water surface topology to a satisfying degree, resulting in important information about the processes and their magnitude for engineering workWe used {{an experimental}} study to analyse the hydrodynamic conditions at an asymmetric right-angled confluence with incoming supercritical flow at higher Froude numbers (2 % Fr % 12), where dynamic, foamed standing waves form. For a phenomenological determination of {{the relations between the}} integral parameters of water flows and the characteristics of standing waves at the confluence area, we first measured water surface topographies for 168 combinations of two flows (i. e. scenarios at the confluence). Laser scanning was used to measure transversal water surface profiles, which, as a modern non-contact measurement method, allows for measurements of the phenomena with high dynamics as well as high spatial and temporal resolution. Despite its widespread use, laser scanning has not yet been used to acquire clean water topography, without any additional <b>substances,</b> <b>floats,</b> etc. Given the nature of interactions between laser beams and water body surfaces, we investigated, in the first part, the conditions under which laser scanning can be applied in water surface topography measurements. Comparing these measurements with the reference values of other measurement methods supported the first hypothesis that, both in laboratory and field measurements, laser scanning allows for a precise determination of water levels, particularly of turbulent, two-phase flows with high vertical fluctuations, i. e. complex hydraulic phenomena where other measurement methods are less successful or unsuited. In the second part we used the systematically measured water surfaces in the individual cross-sections in the confluence area for all the scenarios for determining the water level%s mean value, and by producing mesh models we constructed the topographies of standing waves. This provided an important basis for analysing confluence topography.
