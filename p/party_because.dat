5|$|Harper {{denied any}} {{wrongdoing}} and subsequently filed a civil libel {{suit against the}} Liberal <b>Party.</b> <b>Because</b> libel laws {{do not apply to}} statements made in the House of Commons, the basis of the lawsuit was that statements made by Liberal party members outside the House and in articles which appeared on the Liberal party web site made accusations that Harper had committed a criminal act.|$|E
5|$|Under Secretary Wu Guanzheng, the CCDI {{established}} {{its first}} central inspection teams in August 2003. These teams, led by retired ministerial-level officials and {{reporting to the}} CCDI rather than local party committees, were empowered to initiate investigations, conduct interviews and review relevant documents. The opinion of a central inspection team was {{an important factor in}} determining whether or not an official was disciplined, and the teams {{played an important role in}} the expulsion of Shanghai party chief (and Politburo member) Chen Liangyu from the <b>party</b> <b>because</b> of corruption.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's {{politicians}} became divided between the Democrats and the National Republicans. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the National Republican <b>Party.</b> <b>Because</b> of Crittenden's support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian Robert Trimble as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 presidential election, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath <b>Party</b> <b>because</b> of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in {{a majority in the}} party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Hòa Hảo {{initially}} {{engaged in}} large-scale clashes with the Việt Minh in 1945, but by mid-1946 {{the two groups}} had agreed to stop fighting each other and fight the French instead. However, in June 1946, Sổ became estranged from his military leaders and started the Dân Xã (Social Democratic <b>Party).</b> <b>Because</b> of his charisma, the Việt Minh saw Sổ as a threat and assassinated him, leaving the Hòa Hảo leaderless and causing Sổ's military leaders to go their separate ways. The split caused an increase in violence as the various Hòa Hảo factions engaged in conflicts among themselves.|$|E
5|$|The communists' {{principal}} rivals {{were the}} veterans of the Armia Krajowa movement, Mikołajczyk's Polish People's (Peasant) Party (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe; PSL), and {{the veterans of}} the Polish armies which had fought in the West. Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's <b>Party,</b> <b>because</b> it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections. Mikołajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, {{would be allowed to}} act as a bridge between the east and the west.|$|E

5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body. The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he {{did not agree with}} all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican <b>Party</b> <b>because</b> of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul {{announced}} his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said {{that each of}} them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic <b>Party)</b> <b>because</b> there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the fundamental changes in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} reduce the delay between the local and {{international}} releases, the English voice acting for XIII was done while the game was in development. Unfortunately, it lacked the infrastructure needed to support simultaneous development and localization. The lack of deadlines, poor communication and synchronization between the various departments, and continuing changes to the script and to cutscenes led to a turbulent development. One of the most notable knock-on effects was that the game's script needed to be re-translated as the various cutscenes changed, and large parts of the dialogue had to be rerecorded, <b>party</b> <b>because</b> they lacked proper emotional drive at the right moments. For XIII-2, a tool called Moomle, developed by English translator Tom Slattery and his Japanese counterpart Teruaki Sugawara from their experience with the first game, was used to make sure all parts of the localization process were synchronized. For Lightning Returns the Japanese voice actors recorded their dialogue well after their characters' scenes had been created, as opposed to the normal procedure of recording lines before cutscene creation. For the English version, the amount of dialogue translation and recording was so large that there was over two months' delay between the game's local and international releases.|$|E

5|$|Two calamities in {{the autumn}} of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to {{strengthening}} support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's accommodationism. First, President Teddy Roosevelt dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes {{as a result of the}} Brownsville Affair. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the Republican <b>Party,</b> <b>because</b> Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

Wood convinces meat packing industry tycoon Don McCoy to take over funding the film, who agrees {{as long as the}} film stars his son Tony as the leading man and the film ends with an explosion. The filming finishes with the title being changed to Bride of the Monster, but Fuller breaks up with Wood after the wrap <b>party</b> <b>because</b> of his circle of friends, his work, and transvestism. Lugosi attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed after the government cuts off his unemployment, but is talked out of it. Lugosi checks himself into rehab, and Wood meets Kathy O'Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals to her his transvestism, which she accepts.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of CND marked {{a significant change}} in the international peace movement, which from the late 1940s had been dominated by the World Peace Council (WPC), an anti-western organisation directed by the Soviet Communist <b>Party.</b> <b>Because</b> the WPC had a large budget and organised high-profile international conferences, the peace movement became identified with the Communist cause.
