40|$|Brief history This Standard {{is one of}} {{a series}} of ECMA {{standards}} defining services and signalling protocols applicable to Private Telecommunication Networks (PTNs). The series uses the ISDN concepts as developed by the ITU-T and is also within the framework of standards for open systems interconnection as defined by ISO. It has been produced under ITSTC work items M-IT- 05 4. 3. 1. 1 and 4. 4 for Bon de commande 75 D. 5. This particular Standard defines the signalling protocol for use at the S reference point in support of basic circuit mode services. It is intended to be supported by a suitable layer 2 protocol, for example Standard ECMA- 105, in the D-channel of a basic access <b>interface</b> or a <b>primary</b> <b>rate</b> access <b>interface.</b> The 1 st Edition of Standard ECMA- 106 was published by ECMA in 1985. A 2 nd Edition was published by ECMA in June 1991, to extend the scope to include the connection of all types of Terminal Equipment to Private Telecommunication Networks, instead of just the connection of Data Processing Equipment to Private Circuit-Switching Networks, and to reflect work undeway in ETSI on the corresponding standard for public ISDNs in Europe. The protocol defined in this 3 rd Edition of Standard ECMA- 106 is based upon that now specified in ETS 300 102 - 1. ETS 300 102 - 1 is applicable to interfaces to public ISDNs at the T reference point, or at coincident S and T reference points if there is no NT 2 function. This ECMA Standard references many of the clauses of ETS 300 102 - 1 to avoid reproducing large quantitie...|$|R

30|$|The {{spectral}} {{coexistence of}} heterogenous networks in terrestrial and satellite paradigms has been investigated. The coexistence of small cells and macrocells equipped with MIMO transceivers in terrestrial paradigm and the coexistence of multibeam and monobeam satellites with multicarrier transceivers in satellite paradigm have been considered. The primary only {{case has been}} compared to the coexistence scenarios with no mitigation, resource division and different IA techniques. More specifically, three types of IA have been considered depending on the level of network coordination and on whether it adapts to channel conditions. The different techniques have been compared in terms of system <b>rate,</b> <b>primary</b> to secondary <b>rate</b> ratio and <b>primary</b> <b>rate</b> protection rate. From the results, it can be deduced that the coordinated IA perfectly protects the <b>primary</b> <b>rate.</b> Although no mitigation achieves the highest sum-rate in terrestrial coexistence scenario, the <b>primary</b> protection <b>rate</b> degrades with the number of small cells. From the viewpoint of protecting <b>primary</b> <b>rate</b> as well as achieving the highest rate, the coordinated IA technique is the best among all other techniques in satellite coexistence scenario.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Primary</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Interface</b> {{channels}} are typically used by medium to large enterprises with digital {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) telephone systems to provide digital access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).

50|$|A SIP {{connection}} is a marketing term for voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services offered by many Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs). The service provides routing of telephone calls from a client's {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) telephone system to the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). Such services may simplify corporate information system infrastructure by sharing Internet access for voice and data, and removing the cost for Basic Rate Interface (BRI) or <b>Primary</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Interface</b> (PRI) telephone circuits.|$|E
50|$|A call placed {{behind a}} private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) has more options. In the typical telephony environment, a PBX connects to the local service provider through <b>Primary</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Interface</b> (PRI) trunks. Generally, although not absolutely, the service provider simply passes whatever calling line ID appears on those PRI access trunks transparently across the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This opens up the opportunity for the PBX administrator to program whatever number they choose in their external phone number fields.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, DID service used analog circuits. In {{these types}} of DID trunks the {{customer}} premises equipment provided signaling battery. The central office equipment detects {{the level of the}} line and disables service if the circuit is not operational. This is the reverse arrangement from standard plain old telephone service (POTS) lines for which the central office provides signaling and talk battery. Nowadays, it is far more common to deliver DID service on a <b>Primary</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>Interface</b> (PRI) circuit.|$|E
