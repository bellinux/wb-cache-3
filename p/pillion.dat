After crossing the Elbe, the division once again came {{under the command of}} U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, with General Ridgway informing Major General Bols that it was vital the division reach the port of Wismar before the approaching Russian Army did, to ensure that Denmark was not occupied by the Soviet Union. Although the 5th Parachute Brigade was ordered to lead the division's advance, Hill was determined to reach Wismar first; after an extremely rapid advance he succeeded, with troops from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion being the first to enter Wismar, beating an advancing Russian tank column by only a few miles. A few days later, on 7 May 1945, Germany surrendered and the war in Europe came to an end. Hill was awarded a second Bar to his DSO for his command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade during its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe, as well as the American Silver Star.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Traffic {{crashes and}} {{consequent}} injuries represent a growing public health concern in India, {{particularly in light}} of increasing motorization. Motorised two-wheeled vehicles (MTV) constitute {{a large portion of the}} vehicle fleet in India. We report the crash characteristics and injury patterns among a cohort of MTV riders and <b>pillions</b> presenting to hospital post-crash. Methods Consecutive MTV riders and <b>pillions,</b> whether alive or dead, injured in a road traffic crash presenting to the emergency departments of two government hospitals and three branches of a private hospital in urban Hyderabad, India, were recruited to this study. Results 378 MTV users were enrolled to the study of whom 333 (88. 1 %) were male, 252 (66. 7 %) were riders and median age was 31. 3 years. A total of 223 (59 %) MTV users were injured in multi-vehicle crashes while one-third had a frontal impact. The majority (77 %) were assessed as having a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 13 – 15, 12 % a GCS of 9 – 12 and 11 % a GCS of 3 – 8. No difference was seen in the severity distribution of injuries based on GCS among riders and <b>pillions.</b> Open wounds and superficial injuries to the head (69. 3 %) and upper extremity (27 %) and lower extremity (24 %) were the most common injuries. 43 (11 %) sustained an intracranial injury, including 12 (28 %) with associated fracture of the bones of the head. There were few differences in types of injuries sustained by riders and <b>pillions</b> though riders had a significantly lower risk of crush injuries of the lower extremity than <b>pillions</b> (relative risk, RR 0. 25, 95 % CI 0. 08 – 0. 81) and female <b>pillions</b> were at a significantly lower risk of sustaining fractures of the lower extremity than male <b>pillions</b> (RR 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 09 – 0. 94). Overall, 42 (11 %) MTV users died, of which 42. 8 % died before reaching the hospital. Only 74 (19. 6 %) MTV users had worn a helmet correctly and failure to wear a helmet was associated with a five times greater risk of intracranial injury (RR 4. 99, 95 % CI 1. 23 – 20. 1). Of the 19 pre-hospital deaths, 16 (84 %) had not worn a helmet. Conclusion Head injuries accounted for the major proportion of injuries sustained in MTV users. Non-helmet use was associated with increased risk of serious head injuries. The data presented on the nature and severity of injuries sustained by MTV users can assist with planning to deal with these consequences as well as prevention of these injuries given the high use of MTV in India. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{continued}} growth in popularity of motorcycling {{is an area}} of concern within the road safety domain due to the vulnerability of motorcyclists sustaining injury {{in the event of a}} crash. Currently in Australia only motorcycle helmets are mandatory for motorcyclists or <b>pillions</b> to wear and there is no legislative standard for other protective apparel. This paper reports the results obtained from a series of motorcyclists’ apparel observational studies undertaken in the Brisbane and Canberra regions. The sites selected for the research were designed to enable the observation of both recreational and commuter riders. The results highlight both similarities and differences in the type of protective apparel worn by motorcyclists and <b>pillions</b> observed across the two regions. Encouragingly, across all the sites the majority of riders were wearing protective apparel on their upper body. However, a lower proportion of riders were observed wearing protective apparel on their lower body, particularly at the commuter sites in Brisbane. Similarly, the wearing of full face helmets was very high, except at the commuter sites in Brisbane. The generally lower use of protective apparel among commuter riders in Brisbane would appear to reflect both situational factors, such as climate, and the higher proportion of scooters observed at the sites. The implications of these results are discussed and recommendations are made for future research to identify factors that influence the wearing of protective motorcycle apparel...|$|R

40|$|Involvement {{of motor}} bicycle {{accidents}} as a motor bicycle occupant {{is one of}} the most common causes of serious head injuries. Use of motorcycle safety helmets has been found to be effective in reducing injuries in accidents. The protective effect of motorcycle safety helmets has been well documented in motor bicycle safety literature. Beginning from 2011, wearing safety helmets for all types of motor bicycles are mandatory in Sri Lanka. Previously these regulations were not valid for motor bicycle with low engine capacity, such as moped motor bicycles. Even though wearing bicycle safety helmets are now required for all motorcycle occupants in Sri Lanka, many child motorcycle passengers do not wear them. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of helmet laws in Sri Lanka and the relationship between motor bicycle accidents and motorcycle helmet use. A detailed literature review on motor bicycle safety including the effectiveness of legislation and injury-prevention strategies is carried out in order to understand the current state of research on this area. Those studies indicated that children who wear helmets experienced fewer head injuries and decreased injury severity. However, there are various reasons to limited use of motorcycle helmets while some people simply do not use or reluctant to use helmets. The rate of motorcycle helmet use appeared to be varying from one geographic location to other. Community-wide helmet-promotion campaigns combined with legislation are most successful in increasing helmet use and decreasing injury. A large number of studies were based on comparisons of safety helmet use versus not use among the accidents involving motor bicycle occupants. Also, some of studies investigated characteristics and injury severity of accidents involving motor bicycle occupants. The objectives of this study are to investigate motorcycle helmet use rates and the motorcycle accidents. A representative sample of motorcycles was observed using the mobile observation method that covered all roads throughout Sri Lanka during 2011 and 2012. Roads in Sri Lanka classified as A, B, C, and D-class roads and collected data were representative samples of all these classes. In mobile observation method, while traveling inside vehicle head-on motorcycles were observed and recorded which included number of occupants in the motorcycle and the helmet usage of all the occupants. The accident severity data were obtained from the Police headquarters, Baduraliya Police Station, and Homagama Police Station while injury severity data were obtained from the, Baduraliya Hospital and Homagama Hospital. According to observational data, the average motorcycle helmet use rate was 81 %. Motorcycle operators and <b>pillions</b> in town areas travelling on A-class roads were more likely to wear safety helmets. While the safety helmet usage was low among riders and <b>pillions</b> traveling in rural areas on C & D-class roadways. The helmet usage rate among children was as low as 20 %, while adult helmet usage rate was 86 %...|$|R

40|$|In multi-vehicle {{motorcycle}} crashes, {{the motorcycle}} rider {{is less likely}} to be at-fault but more commonly severely injured than the other road user. Therefore, not surprisingly, crashes in which motorcycle riders are at-fault and particularly the injuries to the other road users in these crashes have received little research attention. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature by investigating the factors influencing the severity of injury to other road users in motorcyclist-at-fault crashes. Five years of data from Queensland, Australia, were obtained from a database of claims against the compulsory third party (CTP) injury insurance of the at-fault motorcyclists. Analysis of the data using an ordered probit model shows higher injury severity for crashes involving young (under 25) and older (60 +) at-fault motorcyclists. Among the not at-fault road users, the young, old, and males were found to be more severely injured than others. Injuries to vehicle occupants were less severe than those to <b>pillions.</b> Crashes that occurred between vehicles traveling in opposite directions resulted in more severe injuries than those involving vehicles traveling in the same direction. While most existing studies have analyzed police reported crash data, this study used CTP insurance data. Comparison of results indicates the potential of using CTP insurance data as an alternative to police reported crash data for gaining a better understanding of risk factors for motorcycle crashes and injury severity...|$|R

25|$|Rotary exhaust {{temperatures}} reach , and as such, on a motorcycle, {{required a}} specialized exhaust system. Suzuki {{dealt with the}} problem by first exhausting into a large, heavily finned manifold which split the single exhaust into two streams. They then built two twin-shelled exhaust pipes which included air cooling ducts. Each muffler contains a stainless steel inner pipe {{which is a little}} shorter than the length of the external shell. The internal pipe ends in a removable stinger drilled with numerous holes and wrapped in a fibreglass-like material. The stinger (or spark arrestor as Suzuki calls it) exits the exhaust system {{at the end of the}} external shell. At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed through the holes drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot exhaust gasses before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and <b>pillions.</b> The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the spark arrestor tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.|$|R
