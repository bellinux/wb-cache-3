An experimental procedure is proposed for the quantitative evaluation of the thermal shock resistance of <b>PTC</b> <b>thermistors.</b> This resistance is characterized by a 'fracture voltage' defined as the voltage causing an increase by more than 10 % of the room-temperature resistance after less than 25 switching cycles. The crack trajectory during the successive cycles is revealed by microscopic observation of the fracture surfaces. These experimental results are interpreted by comparison with the temperature and stress distributions computed using a newly developed three dimensional model.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the design of sensors with {{automatic}} self-control. A <b>PTC</b> <b>thermistor</b> was se-lected, which {{is used as a}} level sensor to prevent overfill of liquids in tanks.

This I-V characteristic of the sensor in thermally steady state in still air is modelled. Problems in detecting the liquid level occur for liquids with high temperature and/or high viscosity (e. g.

25|$|Low cost {{ballasts}} mostly contain only {{a simple}} oscillator and series resonant LC circuit. When turned on, the oscillator starts, and resonant current excites the LC circuit. This resonant current directly drives a switching transistor through a ring core transformer. This principle {{is called the}} current resonant inverter circuit. After a short time the voltage across the lamp reaches about 1nbsp&kV and the lamp ignites. The process is too fast to preheat the cathodes, so the lamp instant-starts in cold cathode mode. The cathode filaments are still used for protection of the ballast from overheating if the lamp does not ignite.

40|$|Thermistors are temperature-measuring devices {{based on}} the {{principle}} that the thermistor material exhibits a change in electrical resistance with a change in temperature. By measuring the resistance of the thermistor material, one can then determine the temperature. Thermistors are generally a piece of semiconductor made from metal oxides such as those of manganese, nickel, cobalt, etc. These pieces may be made into a bead, disk, wafer, etc depending on the application.

40|$|Of all the {{transition}} metal oxides which exhibit metal-insulator transitions (MIT), {{one of the}} most extensively studied in recent years is the vanadium sesquioxide (V 2 O 3), both from experimental and theoretical point of view. At a transition temperature of about 160 K at an ambient pressure of 1 atm, pure V 2 O 3 transforms from a rhombohedral paramagnetic metallic (PM) to a monoclinic antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI) phase upon cooling, with a jump in the resistivity of about seven orders of magnitude. Experimental studies have focused more on bulk V 2 O 3 and recently there have been significant interest in thin film fabrication of this material due to potential applications as thermal sensors, current limiters, Positive Temperature Coefficient (<b>PTC)</b> <b>thermistors,</b> and optical switches. ^ This study addresses the deposition, characterization, and properties of high-quality epitaxial V 2 O 3 thin films grown on a-, c-Al 2 O 3 and c-LiTaO 3 substrates by a straightforward method of pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Various characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy were used to examine the structural, crystallographic, and surface properties, while four point probe resistivity measurements were used to examine the electrical properties of the films. V 2 O 3 thin films of different thicknesses ranging from 10 - 450 nm were deposited on c-Al 2 O 3 and c-LiTaO 3 substrates by PLD to understand also the role of epitaxial strains. Resistivity measurements showed that depending on the thicknesses of films, different electrical transitions were exhibited by the samples. While some of the samples displayed the expected metal-insulator transition typical of bulk V 2 O 3, some showed insulating behavior only and others exhibited metallic characteristics only over the whole temperature range. For example, for films on c-LiTaO 3 with increasing film thickness, first an insulator-insulator, then a metal-insulator, followed by a metal-metal transition is observed.

Because of people’s demands, dielectric (essentially nonconducting) characteristics of ceramic materials are increasing rapidly. At the same time, people are attempting {{to reduce the size of}} all communication devices as small and as light as possible. Due to this trend, high dielectric constant materials such as barium titanate have nowadays become more and more important in ceramic materials. This thesis describes perovskite structure based on barium titanate composition. Oxide perovskites (ABO 3) are important electroceramics having a large area of functionalities by virtue of their unique magnetic, dielectric, semiconducting or superconducting properties. These properties are related to the crystal structure, microstructure, and nature and distribution of point defects prevailing in the ceramics, which, in turn, depend on synthesis routes and processing parameters adopted. Extensive studies are reported in literature on these aspects of ceramics. The properties are also sensitive to such factors as atomic composition (non-stoichiometry), interfacial characteristics and chemical states as well as distribution, spatial and depth-wise, of the constituents of the material. Non-stoichiometry, oxygen non-stoichiometry in particular, is prevalent in perovskites. Oxygen vacancies, apart from bringing about structural modifications, act as donors and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of ceramics. The atomic composition in interfacial regions of polycrystalline materials is often different from the nominal or bulk composition. Therefore, a detailed study on these aspects of materials is desirable for a comprehensive assessment of their properties. This thesis presents investigations on the atomic composition and microstructural features of barium titanate and other electronic ceramics, namely, barium calcium titanates, barium praseodymium titanates and barium dysprosium titanates, by surface analytical techniques.

Both types of <b>thermistors</b> (<b>PTC</b> and NTC) have definite features and advantages which make them ideal for certain sensor applications. NTC THERMISTORS The NTC thermistors which are discussed herein are composed of metal oxides. The most commonly used oxides are those of manganese, nickel, cobalt, iron, copper and titanium. The fabrication of commercial NTC thermistors uses basic ceramics technology and continues today much as it has for decades. In the basic process, a mixture of two or more metal oxide powders are combined with suitable binders, are formed to a desired geometry, dried, and sintered at an elevated temperature. By varying the types of oxides used, their relative proportions, the sintering atmosphere, and the sintering temperature, a wide range of resistivities and temperature coefficient characteristics can be obtained. Types of NTC Thermistors Commercial NTC thermistors can be classified into two major groups depending upon the method by which electrodes are attached to the ceramic body. Each group may be further subdivided into various types of thermistors where each type is characterized by differences in geometry, packaging and/or processing techniques.

The modelling of current-voltage characteristic takes into consideration the temperature dependence of the thermal resistance Rth of the medium as decision threshold (e. g., the thermal resistance of silicon oil is 35 % different to that in air) and the model enables a continuous monitoring of sensor parameters in order to identify slow changes due to contamination on the sensor surface by soil or dust or ageing. The model has been verified by fitting its response to several R-T and I-V characteristic with a typical maximum relative current error at room temperatures about 1, 2 %.
