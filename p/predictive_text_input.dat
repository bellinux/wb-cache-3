40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Predictive</b> <b>Text</b> is an <b>input</b> {{technology}} used in mobile phones. It lets words be formed {{by a single}} key press for each letter, {{as opposed to the}} multiple key press approach used in the older generation of mobile phones. It works via active reference to a dictionary of commonly used words. The predictive option works with PDAs and smart phones that have keypad recognitions. It helps by analyzing the user’s writing style and guessing the words in Tamil. The problem of optimizing keypad designs for <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> entry methods for handheld devices has received significant i nterest in recent years. The necessity of such optimization lies in the ever- increasing difficulty of <b>inputting</b> Tamil <b>text</b> into mobile devices. In contrast to past research that allowed mapping of any letters to any keys, we hypothesize that maintaining alphabetical ordering across the keys of optimized keypad designs will result in higher novice usability and ease of learning, while still providing a more immediate benefit in terms of improved performance. Results from usability testing we conducted are encouraging and support our hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|The Dare {{supports}} EMS, MMS, SMS, and Instant Messaging. For {{this and}} any other <b>text</b> <b>inputs,</b> the phone provides several options. One can bring up a standard keypad with letters and use multi-tap (T9 (<b>predictive</b> <b>text))</b> or a word-guessing system. If the phone is turned sideways, it senses the change in orientation and brings up a full keyboard. Also of note is a handwriting feature which allows the user to write numbers or letters by writing with a finger. In each of these modes, the user must manually change the setting (capital or lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols) to allow the phone to know what type of character is being input.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the impact of <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> use upon the literacy skills of primary school, secondary school and university cohorts was conducted {{over the course of}} a year. No differences in use of text abbreviations (‘textisms’) were found between <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> users and non-users. However, secondary school children who used <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> made more genuine spelling errors than non-users. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> was related to use of some specific grammatical violations in school-age children’s text messages, but was not related overall to the tendency to make grammatical errors when texting. University students, however, made significantly fewer grammatical errors in their text messages when they used <b>predictive</b> <b>text.</b> Over the course of a year, <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> use was variable for all age groups. Consistency of <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> use was unrelated to grammatical understanding, spelling or orthographic processing for primary and secondary school cohorts. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> use was negatively related to morphological awareness for adult participant...|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> <b>input</b> and {{smartphones}} featuring full QWERTY keyboards {{may contribute to}} a reduction in the use of shortenings in SMS language, although this has not yet been noted.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} which <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> {{system is the}} best to use {{involves}} matching the user's preferred interface style, the user's level of learned ability to operate <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> software, and the user's efficiency goal. There are various levels of risk in <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> systems, versus multi-tap systems, because the predicted text that is automatically written that provide the speed and mechanical efficiency benefit, could, if the user is not careful to review, result in transmitting misinformation. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> systems take time to learn to use well, and so generally, a device's system has user options {{to set up the}} choice of multi-tap or of any one of several schools of <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> methods.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Predictive</b> {{entry of}} <b>text</b> from a {{telephone}} keypad {{has been known}} {{at least since the}} 1970s (Smith and Goodwin, 1971). Aspects of <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> have been patented for instance by Kondraske (1985), while a fully functional keypad to text system for communicating with deaf people via phone was patented in 1988 by Roy Feinson (...) that included most of the features of modern <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> systems including disambiguation and local dictionary storage. <b>Predictive</b> <b>text</b> was mainly used to look up names in directories over the phone, until mobile phone text messaging came into widespread use. Sinclair's ZX80/81 also possessed a form of <b>predictive</b> <b>text.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{most widely}} used, general, <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> systems are T9, iTap, eZiText, and LetterWise/WordWise. There {{are many ways}} to build a device that predicts <b>text,</b> but all <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> systems have initial {{linguistic}} settings that offer predictions that are re-prioritized to adapt to each user. This learning adapts, by way of the device memory, to a user's disambiguating feedback that results in corrective key presses, such as pressing a [...] "next" [...] key to get to the intention. Most <b>predictive</b> <b>text</b> systems have a user database to facilitate this process.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} early evaluation of a method for validating phrase sets for <b>text</b> <b>input</b> experiments.
