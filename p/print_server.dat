25|$|In a {{networked}} {{environment with}} a <b>print</b> <b>server</b> running Windows Vista, documents will be rendered on the client machine, {{rather than on}} the server, using a feature known as Client Side Rendering. The rendered intermediate form will just be transferred to the server to be printed without additional processing, making print servers more scalable by offloading rendering computation to clients.|$|E
50|$|A <b>print</b> <b>server</b> {{may be a}} {{networked}} computer {{with one or more}} shared printers. Alternatively a <b>print</b> <b>server</b> may be a dedicated device on the network, with connections to the LAN and one or more printers. Dedicated server appliances tend to be fairly simple in both configuration and features. <b>Print</b> <b>server</b> functionality may be integrated with other devices such as a wireless router, a firewall, or both. A printer may have a built-in <b>print</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E
50|$|IPDS carries {{data and}} {{instructions}} from the <b>print</b> <b>server</b> to the printer in structured fields. The printer controller processes these IPDS commands and returns acknowledgment back to the <b>print</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E

50|$|EIO (Enhanced Input/Output) is a modular {{interface}} {{developed by}} HP for its printers {{to expand their}} capabilities. EIO does not just serve Jetdirect cards, but EIO hard drives and the EIO Connectivity card for adding communication ports to the printers as well. EIO utilizes the 3.3V signaling technology of the Conventional PCI bus and is significantly more energy-efficient than MIO technology. EIO <b>print</b> <b>servers</b> will not work in LIO slots, nor will the LIO <b>print</b> <b>servers</b> work in EIO slots.|$|R

50|$|The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an Internet {{protocol}} for communication between computers and printers (or <b>print</b> <b>server).</b> It allows programs to send {{one or more}} print jobs to the printer or <b>print</b> <b>server</b> and perform administration such as querying {{the status of a}} printer, obtaining the status of print jobs, or cancelling individual print jobs.|$|E
5000|$|Printer sharing: Allows a <b>print</b> <b>server</b> {{to handle}} print jobs for all users.|$|E

The VAXmate replaced the Rainbow, and in its standard form was the first widely marketed diskless workstation.|$|R

50|$|Some host {{systems or}} <b>print</b> <b>servers</b> may use a strobe signal with a {{relatively}} low voltage output or a fast toggle. Any of these issues might cause no or intermittent printing, missing or repeated characters or garbage printing. Some printer models may have a switch or setting to set busy by character; others may require a handshake adapter.|$|R
