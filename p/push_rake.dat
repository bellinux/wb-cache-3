40|$|Haymaking is an {{operation}} that must {{be done in a}} certain space of time that is short at best and that is always liable to be made shorter by bad weather. For this reason there is perhaps no farm operation in which system and efficiency count for more than in haymaking; yet throughout the hay-growing area more or less haphazard methods of haymaking are still very common. This bulletin is designed to point out ways in which the more successful hay growers of the country save time and labor in this important field work. It tells how the growing scarcity of farm labor may be met by rearranging crews and changing methods, and by the adoption of up-to-date implements, such as the hay loader, <b>push</b> <b>rake,</b> and stacker. In addition to outlines of methods for various sized crews and acreages the bulletin presents, briefly, a discussion of the theory of curing hay, a thorough understanding of which is a great help in planning an efficient method of haymaking.

50|$|The combat {{engineer}} section {{carriers are}} used to transport sappers (combat engineers) and can be fitted with a bulldozer's blade and other mine-breaching devices. They are often used as APCs because of their carrying ability and heavy protection. They are usually armed with machine guns and grenade launchers and usually tracked to provide enough tractive force to <b>push</b> blades and <b>rakes.</b> Some examples are the U.S. M113 APC, IDF Puma, Nagmachon, Husky, and U.S. M1132 ESV (a Stryker variant).|$|R
40|$|Abstract To date, neither {{primates}} nor {{birds have}} shown {{clear evidence of}} causal knowledge when attempting to solve the trap tube task. One factor that may have con-tributed to mask the knowledge that subjects may have about the task is that subjects were only allowed to push the reward away from them, which is a particularly difficult ac-tion for primates in certain problem solving situations. We presented five orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), two chim-panzees (Pan troglodytes), two bonobos (Pan paniscus), and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a modified trap tube that allowed subjects to <b>push</b> or <b>rake</b> the reward with the tool. In two additional follow-up tests, we inverted the tube 180 ◦ rendering the trap nonfunctional and also presented subjects with the original task {{in which they were}} required to push the reward out of the tube. Results showed that {{all but one of the}} subjects preferred to rake the reward. Two orangutans and one chimpanzee (all of whom preferred to rake the reward), consistently avoided the trap only when it was functional but failed the original task. These find-ings suggest that some great apes may have some causal knowledge about the trap-tube task. Their success, how-ever, depended on whether they were allowed to choose certain tool-using actions...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} tool using {{have shown that}} {{presenting}} subjects with certain modifications in the experimental setup can substantially improve their performance. However, procedural modifications (e. g. trap table task) may not only remove task constraints but also simplify the problem conceptually. The goal {{of this study was}} to design a variation of the trap-table that was functionally equivalent to the trap-tube task. In this new task, the subjects had to decide where to insert the tool and in which direction the reward should be pushed. We also administered a trap-tube task that allowed animals to <b>push</b> or <b>rake</b> the reward with the tool to compare the subjects’ performance on both tasks. We used a larger sample of subjects than in previous studies and from all the four species of great apes (Gorilla gorilla, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Pongo pygmaeus). The results showed that apes performed better in the trap-platform task than in the trap-tube task. Subjects solved the tube task faster than in previous studies and they also preferred to rake in rather than to push the reward out. There was no correlation in the level of performance between both tasks, and no indication of interspecies differences. These data are consistent with the idea that apes may possess some specific causal knowledge of traps but may lack the ability to establish analogical relations between functional equivalent tasks...|$|R
50|$|The third {{event is}} the forcible entry challenge. This event simulates a {{firefighter}} breaking down a door or wall {{to enter a}} burning building. The forcible entry simulator used during the Firefighter Combat Challenge is called the KEISER FORCE Machine. In this evolution, the firefighter stands over a 160 lb. beam. They must slam a nine and a half-pound sledgehammer into the beam until the beam moves five feet. The firefighter must keep both hands below a tape-marked line on the sledgehammer, and only contact the beam {{with the head of}} the sledgehammer. This tape marked line is 1 ft. down from the head of the sledgehammer. The upper edge of the beam is covered with a pressure-sensitive tape that makes contacts other than by the head of the sledgehammer visible. The firefighter receives a warning for the first handle strike. Any hit by the handle afterwords adds five seconds to the final time. <b>Pushing,</b> and <b>raking</b> of the beam is not allowed and is grounds for disqualification. At the first hit, time continues from the previous event. The event is complete once the competitor places the sledgehammer on a platform at the end of the 5 ft. distance. The entire sledgehammer must be placed on the two by 3 ft. platform before the firefighter goes to the next event.|$|R
50|$|Class 12 was {{originally}} built to work {{freight and passenger}} services between Antwerp (via Gent) and Liège (via Namur) in Belgium {{on one hand and}} Lille in France on the other. Class 12 spent most of its early years <b>pushing</b> and pulling <b>rakes</b> of M4 stock across Belgium. Sometimes they ventured onto other domestic services where their 25000 V capability wasn't needed. The introduction of the SNCB Class AM96 electric multiple units displaced them from passenger duty by 1999 but they continued to be used in freight service for 13 more years. Later on they pulled freight between the port of Zeebrugge to Lille and beyond, going via Brugge and Mouscron. They were withdrawn from service in 2012 because Class 13 locomotives had by then lost most of their passenger workings and were available for freight. Class 13 was more powerful and also had the same dual voltage capability as Class 12. All Class 12s were stored inside at the dêpot of Stokkem, near Arlon, upon withdrawal. During 2013, locomotive 1203 went to the Czech Republic for service trials. In mid-2014, loco 1203 was intensively tested at Velim in the Czech Republic under 25000 V overhead and did very well. It was then sold to open access operator XTR-System Development in the Czech Republic with an option to buy the entire class. The option was taken and the remaining Class 12 locomotives left Belgium in March 2016 en route to their new owner. The same operator also agreed to buy all 12 of the SNCB Class 11 locomotives at the same time but the deal never went through and all Class 11 locomotives have been sitting outside at Stockem ever since. Class 12 underwent asbestos removal before they departed for the Czech Republic. XTR-System Development has also expressed an interest in buying {{at least some of the}} SNCB Class 21 locomotives as they are retired.|$|R
