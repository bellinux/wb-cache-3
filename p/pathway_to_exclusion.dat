40|$|A life-course {{account of}} the <b>pathways</b> <b>to</b> adult social <b>exclusion</b> for {{children}} born in 1958 is explored. We identify the pervasive childhood factors, associated {{with a wide range}} of adult disadvantage, and specific life-course domain antecedents. Childhood disadvantage has more powerful legacies for women than for men: <b>pathways</b> <b>to</b> social <b>exclusion</b> are gendered. Experiences of disadvantage between ages 16 and 23 relate as closely to outcomes at age 33 as at age 23. The excess legacy of childhood disadvantage for women is mediated through lone motherhood. There are strong continuities and interconnections across the life-course in the legacies of earlier disadvantage. Unemployment or divorce between ages 23 and 33 promote disadvantage at age 33 and the legacies of divorce are more powerful for women. The implications for our understanding of the processes of social exclusion and the need for policy responses tailored according to lifetime patterns of disadvantage are discussed. intergenerational transmission, disadvantage, gender...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{challenging}} targets for renewable energy generation, this paper draws out social implications of moves towards low carbon energy systems. As renewable energy develops as a heterogeneous category, many potential forms of social relation between ‘publics’ and technologies are emerging. Utilising perspectives from science and technology studies, we outline five modes in which renewable energy has been implemented in the UK and how these involve different configurations of technology and social organisation. We argue that a multiplicity of roles for ‘the public’ are implicated across this increasingly complex landscape, cutting across established categories and raising questions of meaning, differentiation, interrelation and access. Policy assumptions and conceptions are questioned, highlighting that dominant characterisations of public roles {{have been part of}} a concentration on particular socio-technical <b>pathways</b> <b>to</b> the <b>exclusion</b> of others...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Overexpression of STYK 1, a {{putative}} serine/threonine and tyrosine receptor {{protein kinase}} {{has been shown}} to confer tumorigenicity and metastatic potential to normal cells injected into nude mice. Mutation of a tyrosine residue in the catalytic STYK 1 domain attenuates the tumorigenic potential of tumor cells in vivo, collectively, suggesting an oncogenic role for STYK 1. Methods To investigate the role of STYK 1 expression in ovarian cancer, a panel of normal, benign, and ovarian cancer tissues was evaluated for STYK 1 immunoreactivity using STYK 1 antibodies. In addition, mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcription PCR and real-time PCR of estrogen receptors, GPR 30 and STYK 1 following treatment of ovarian cell lines with estrogen or G 1, a GPR 30 agonist, as well as western analysis. Results Our data showed higher expression of STYK 1 in cancer tissues versus normal or benign. Only normal or benign, and one cancer tissue were STYK 1 -negative. Moreover, benign and ovarian cancer cell lines expressed STYK 1 as determined by RT-PCR. Estradiol treatment of these cells resulted in up- and down-regulation of STYK 1 despite estrogen receptor status; whereas G- 1, a GPR 30 -specific agonist, increased STYK 1 mRNA levels higher than that of estradiol. Conclusion We conclude that STYK 1 is expressed in ovarian cancer and is regulated by estrogen through a GPR 30 hormone-signaling <b>pathway,</b> <b>to</b> the <b>exclusion</b> of estrogen receptor-alpha. </p...|$|R
30|$|Whatever {{the vagaries}} of census data collection, in most countries, mobile pastoralists are more visible in censuses than in sample surveys where a number of {{different}} <b>pathways</b> contribute <b>to</b> their <b>exclusion.</b> This has serious ramifications for pastoralists’ representation in the Sustainable Development Goals, where many of the indicators will depend on survey data. This is not the only problem to be confronted. The goal of the SDGs as outlined by the DG (2014 p. 7) ‘… a data revolution is unfolding, allowing us to see more clearly than ever where we are and where we need to go, and to ensure that everyone is counted.’. In this new era, almost everything is being built on ‘measurable targets and technically rigorous indicators’ p. 28. The international community is being made more responsible for the poor, but the principal channel of information about this responsibility is through the medium of quantitative data. There is little doubt that, in the majority of countries, mobile pastoralists were excluded from the indicators measuring progress towards the MDGs. The questions then become firstly, whether ways can be found to include them and represent them in the SDGs and secondly, whether they want to be included or whether many would prefer to remain invisible.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Many studies {{indicated}} people report strong {{negative effects}} after {{few minutes of}} exclusion, such as negative mood {{and low levels of}} basic psychological need satisfaction. Literature showed belongingness to a stigmatized racial group amplified reactions <b>to</b> <b>exclusion.</b> The goals of our work are (1) to examine whether increased sensitivity <b>to</b> social <b>exclusion</b> found in racially stigmatized groups also extends to sexual orientation stigma and (2) to examine whether belongingness to a sexually stigmatized group could moderate the negative impact of exclusion on a basic executive function such as working memory capacity (WMC). Method. The sample consisted of 44 gay men and 44 heterosexual men. Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 30 (M= 23. 44, SD = 3. 21). Half of both gay and heterosexual participants were assigned or <b>to</b> the <b>exclusion</b> or <b>to</b> the inclusion condition by Cyberball task. The design was a 2 (exclusion vs. inclusion) x 2 (gay vs. heterosexual) between subjects. WMC was measured using the automated version of the operation span task (OSPAN). Results. The 2 x 2 ANOVA on WMC showed no significant main effects, but a significant two-way interaction. Under social exclusion, gay men had a lower WMC than heterosexual men. Under social inclusion, WMC of gay men and heterosexuals did not significantly differ. Conclusion. This work showed that sexual stigma could amplify detrimental consequences of social exclusion in terms of WMC. Findings point out that sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>exclusion</b> originating from sexual stigma not only affects how a person feels in response <b>to</b> <b>exclusion,</b> but how a person operates and self-regulates, because WMC is a fundamental executive function involved in basically all mental complex activities including self-regulation and self-control...|$|R
