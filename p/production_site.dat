5|$|The Lexus LS {{has been}} {{consistently}} produced on dedicated Lexus assembly lines at Toyota's flagship Tahara factory, located {{in the city of}} Tahara, in Aichi Prefecture, Chūbu region, southwest of Nagoya, since 1989. Tahara remains the sole <b>production</b> <b>site,</b> having inaugurated its new line number four specifically for assembly of the original LS 400.|$|E
5|$|Through the 2000s (decade), most Lexus {{sedan and}} SUV {{production}} {{has occurred in}} Japan at the Tahara plant in Aichi and Miyata plant in Fukuoka. In addition to the Tahara factory, Lexus vehicles have been produced at the Miyata plant (Toyota Motor Kyushu, Inc.) in Miyawaka, Fukuoka, Higashi Fuji plant (Kanto Auto Works, Ltd.) in Susono, Shizuoka, and Sanage plant (Toyota Boshoku Corp.; Araco) in Toyota City, Aichi. Front-wheel drive cars, such as the ES and HS, are produced in the Fukuoka Prefecture. The Kokura plant in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, which opened in 2008, is a dedicated hybrid <b>production</b> <b>site</b> for Lexus models such as the gasoline-electric RX. The North American–market RX 350 (since the 2004 model year) is produced at the Cambridge plant (Toyota Canada, Inc.) {{in the city of}} Cambridge, in Ontario, Canada, which is the first Lexus <b>production</b> <b>site</b> located outside Japan. In late 2015, Lexus started to assemble North American-spec ES 350 sedans at the Georgetown plant (TMMK, Inc.).|$|E
5|$|At Oak Ridge, uranium slugs were {{irradiated}} for 40 days, {{then left}} {{to cool down}} for 1 to 5 days, then dissolved. Barium then was extracted and the solution evaporated; the solid material was then shipped to Los Alamos. As of 1949, full production runs involved up to 1728 slugs (34.5 batches of 50 slugs). Until 1949 the Oak Ridge <b>production</b> <b>site</b> processed uranium slugs irradiated both on-site and at Hanford; afterward only Hanford material was processed.|$|E

30|$|Summarizing the {{computational}} experiments of the 308 single cluster instances, {{we conclude}} that the general results of Barz et al. [3] {{on the effects of}} AM on supply networks are reflected in our experiments, too. The total costs decrease, the proportion of transports costs shifts towards the second stage of transport, the costs of transport between <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> and the customer locations on average per customer drop and the number of <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> used is relatively steady. Additional conclusions are drawn from the different geographical distributions of the nodes and varying numbers of each node type. The biggest improvements by using AM production arise if the number of possible <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> to chose from is high. However, the number of <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> changes rarely. Furthermore, the effect of AM is large, if the clusters of two types of nodes are located nearby at the same geographical area. This is especially true for <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> and customer locations, which are close together. Vice versa the change to AM production in networks with only few <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> to chose, and/or clusters located at different spots, results in minor benefits. With respect to supply network effects, AM production has the highest impact if the supply network is flexible, i.e. if it is possible to change locations of the <b>production</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R
5|$|Later, {{the city}} was the <b>production</b> <b>site</b> of the 1991 Romanian drama Undeva în Est ("Somewhere in the East"), and the 1995 Hungarian {{language}} film A Részleg ("Outpost"). Moreover, the Romanian-language film Cartier ("Neighbourhood", 2001) and its sequel Înapoi în cartier ("Back to the Neighbourhood", 2006) both feature a story replete with violence and rude language, behind the blocks in the city's Mănăștur district. This district is also mentioned in the lyrics to the song Înapoi în cartier by La Familia member Puya, featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture.|$|E
5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was {{completed}} in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a <b>production</b> <b>site,</b> so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E
5|$|The first copies were {{delivered}} to bookstores on September 10. Many were wary of it, {{due to its}} technical nature, and feared that sales would be low. An exception was Scribner's Bookstores, which placed large early orders. At Oak Ridge, the Manhattan Project's major <b>production</b> <b>site,</b> 8,000 copies were sold through the employee welfare organization. Similar arrangements were made for Los Alamos and Richland, which were located in areas where bookstores were scarce.|$|E

In particular, Woods was instrumental in the construction and then utilization of geiger counters for analysis during experimentation. She was the only woman present when the reactor went critical. She worked with Fermi on the Manhattan Project, and, together with her first husband John Marshall, she subsequently helped solve the problem of xenon poisoning at the Hanford plutonium <b>production</b> <b>site,</b> and supervised the construction and operation of Hanford's plutonium production reactors.|$|E
5|$|Nowotny {{was sent}} on a {{propaganda}} tour in Germany, {{which included the}} presentation of the Knight's Cross of the War Merit Cross to the railroad engineer August Kindervater on 7December1943 – Nowotny's 23rd birthday. Shortly before Christmas, he visited the Focke-Wulf <b>production</b> <b>site</b> at Bad Eilsen, where he was met by Professor Kurt Tank. The mayor of Vienna, Dipl.-Ing. Hanns Blaschke awarded Nowotny the city's ring of honor on 11January1944, the presentation taking place a week later. It was a token that Nowotny accepted reluctantly, feeling that he did not deserve it. His next official visit was the Büromaschinenfabrik (office machinery factory) at Zella-Mehlis, before he briefly returned to Jagdgeschwader 54. Nowotny was made Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 101 (JG 101) and commander of the Jagdfliegerschule 1, a Luftwaffe fighter pilot training school at Pau in southern France, in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{became aware}} of the Wizernes site in August 1943 when the Germans began laying {{extensive}} new rail sidings which were spotted by RAF reconnaissance flights. Late 1943, a Belgian, Jacques de Duve, supported by German opponents, informed MI5 about the existence of a rocket <b>production</b> <b>site</b> in Saint-Omer. MI5 did not believe Jacques de Duve, who was interned {{for the rest of the}} war in Latchmere House. In November 1943, the Allied Central Interpretation Unit reported that the Germans had begun constructing the concrete dome and were undertaking tunnelling works in the east face of the quarry. However, it was not until the following March that the Allies added the site to the list of targets for Operation Crossbow, the ongoing bombing campaign against V-weapon sites that had already wrecked the Watten bunker and numerous V-1 launching sites. Over the next few months, the USAAF and RAF carried out 16 air raids involving 811 bombers that dropped some 4,260 tons of bombs. The bombing caused destruction across a wide area, killing 55 residents of the nearby village of Helfault.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{bacterial}} {{quality of}} honey from different <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> within Tamale metropolis, Ghana, was estimated using standard microbiological methods. Honey samples were bought from six different <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> within Tamale metropolis and labeled. Samples {{that were taken}} from location B recorded the least mean bacterial count of 6. 0 × 104 colony forming units/mL with samples taken from location D showing the highest, 1. 1 × 105 colony forming units/mL. However, samples from <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> E and F recorded no bacteria growth. Bacteria isolated included Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., Shigella spp., Streptococcus spp., and Bacillus spp. The pH values of honey samples from the various locations {{were found to be}} directly correlated to the average bacteria load. The variation in bacteria load and species at the various <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> and the absence of bacteria growth in two <b>production</b> <b>sites</b> is an indication of the differences in production practices, as well as hygienic conditions at these sites. The presence of these isolates is a cause for concern as pathogenic strains of these bacteria can cause serious health related problems...|$|R

5|$|The Kowalewko {{cemetery}} in Greater Poland {{is one of}} the largest in Poland and is distinguished by a great number of beautiful relics, made locally or imported from the Empire. The total number of burials is estimated at over 500, most of which have been excavated. 60 percent of the bodies were not cremated and typically placed in wooden coffins constructed of board or plank pieces. The burial ground was in use from the mid-1st century AD to about 220, which gives approximately 80 area inhabitants per generation. Remnants of settlements in the region have also been investigated. At Rogowo near Chełmno a Wielbark settlement, an industrial <b>production</b> <b>site</b> and a 2nd to 3rd century bi-ritual cemetery with very richly furnished graves have been discovered. In the area of Ulkowy, Gdańsk County a settlement consisting of both sunken floor and post construction dwellings, as well as a burial ground in use from the mid-1st century to the second half of the 3rd century were found. Only a part of the cemetery was excavated on the occasion of a motorway construction, but it yielded 110 inhumations (11 in hollowed-out log coffins) and 15 cremations (8 of them in urns) and a rich collection of decorative objects, mostly from the graves of women. Those include fancy jewelry and accessories made of gold, silver, bronze, amber, glass and enameled plates. Ceramics, utility items and tools including weaving equipment were recovered from the settlement site. Other significant Wielbark settlements in the area were encountered in Swarożyn and Stanisławie, both in Tczew County.|$|E
