40|$|Hierarchically-structured {{arrays of}} {{processors}} {{have been widely}} used in the low-level and the intermediate-level phases of computer vision. This is because tasks in these phases require both local and global operations, when the two-dimensional array structure of the image is considered. This paper introduces mapping (process assignment) algorithms for systems in the above class. It {{is the first time in}} parallel computer vision that both the domain and the range of the mapping functions are in a general set of hierarchicallystructured arrays of processors. More specifically, the systems being studied here are not necessarily homogeneous; the <b>processing</b> <b>powers</b> of processors at different levels and the reductions between different pairs of consecutive levels are allowed to vary. Efficient mapping is achieved by first proposing objective functions, so that each objective function measures the quality of a given mapping with respect to a particular optimization goal. Mapping algorithms, one for each objective function, that attempt to produce an optimal mapping by minimizing the corresponding objective function, are then proposed. It is proven theoretically that our mapping algorithms always yield an optimal solution for systems composed of processors with identical <b>processing</b> <b>powers.</b> In all other cases, some assignment choices in the algorithms allow to take advantage of the increased <b>processing</b> <b>powers</b> of processors. ...|$|R
40|$|HDCS(Heterogeneous Distributed Computing System) {{is a set}} of {{interconnected}} computing nodes so as to oers {{sharing of}} computational power, applications or network resources dynamically. Task scheduling is the crucial part which guides the resource allocation in distributed computing systems. The resource allocation in distributed computing system can be classied as centralized and decentralized. In this thesis decentralized dynamic resource allocation scheme in distributed computing systems has been modeled as a non-cooperative game among the computing nodes and the optimal solution of this non-cooperative game is given by the nash equilibrium. The existing schemes assigns tasks to the computing nodes which are having more processing capability but in dynamic environment its not sucient to schedule tasks based on the <b>processing</b> <b>powers.</b> Resource availability along with the <b>processing</b> <b>powers</b> of computational resources is considered to be of great signicance with regard to performance issue. In the proposed scheme resource allocation is based upon the <b>processing</b> <b>powers</b> of the computing nodes, resource availability(waiting time), communication delay and the execution times of tasks at dierent computing nodes. This scheme minimizes makespan of the tasks while improving the fairness of the HDCS. The proposed non-cooperative scheme is giving better makespans and fairness of this proposed non-cooperative scheme is 90...|$|R

5|$|From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took {{advantage}} of the computing power of PlayStation 3s.

The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl's law, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.|$|E

5|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the-then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade {{and offered to}} develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo. Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to <b>processing</b> <b>power</b> limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way optimisations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult {{than it would have been}} for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries).

Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough <b>processing</b> <b>power</b> to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display.

5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle <b>processing</b> <b>power</b> so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E
5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's <b>processing</b> <b>power.</b> In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E

The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired {{that one of}} its distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, many ideas were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E
