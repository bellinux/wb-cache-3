40|$|SUMMARY: The antigens {{of eight}} strains of {{influenza}} virus were compared {{by a simple}} and economical complement-fixation technique in which drops on <b>Perspex</b> <b>sheets</b> replaced larger volumes of reagents in racks of tubes. By this means more extensive tests were made with a limited supply of material than by standard tube techniques. The specific antisera were prepared in mice, thus avoiding the elaborate isolation precautions necessary for ferrets, and sera from large groups were pooled to minimize individual variations between animals. The antigens were standardized {{in terms of the}} amount of complement fixed in the presence of excess homologous antiserum. The comparison of the strains is presented in the form of index numbers, ranging from 0 to 1. 0; 1. 0 represents complete identity of two strains, while the smaller numbers are taken to represent the degree of antigenic relationship between strains. Of the six strains examined which were isolated in different years, all were serologically distinct though the two I 3 strains were closely similar and two of the A strains were fairly closely related.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of wind tunnel tests on rectangular building models having the same plan area and height but different side ratios of 1, 1.56, 2.25, 3.06 and 4. The models were made from <b>perspex</b> <b>sheet</b> at a geometrical scale of 1 : 300. The wind pressure coefficients on all the models were evaluated from pressure records measured in a closed circuit wind tunnel under boundary layer flow for wind directions of 0 ° to 90 ° at an interval of 15 °. The mean responses of rectangular tall buildings having different side ratios were also evaluated from the experimentally obtained wind loads. Effectiveness of side ratio of buildings in changing the surface pressure distribution and mean responses of prototype buildings is assessed for wind directions of 0 ° to 90 ° at an interval of 15 °. It is observed that the side ratio of buildings significantly affects the wind pressures on leeward and sidewalls, whereas wind pressure on windward wall is almost independent of side ratio. Further, the wind incidence angles and side ratio of the buildings significantly affect its mean displacements as well as torque.|$|R

The models are made from <b>Perspex</b> <b>sheets</b> at a geometrical scale of 1 : 500. The effectiveness of the model shape in changing the surface pressure distribution is assessed over an extended range of wind directions from 00 to 1800 at an interval of 150.

40|$|The {{design and}} degree of yield {{advantage}} of skip-row sorghum over solid-planted crops in water-limited situations could be increased if germplasm was identified that more effectively occupied the available soil volume. The aim {{of this research was}} to screen for genetic variation in structure and function of sorghum root systems during early growth, and to assess the functional implications of such variation in terms of rooting effectiveness and occupancy, which represent the rate and amount of water extraction. To achieve this, we grew plants in purpose built rhizotrons. Preliminary experiments, involving four hybrids, indicated that sorghum has only one seminal root, and that the first nodal roots appear at the five-leaf stage. Importantly, genotypic differences in the encompassing angle (relative to the vertical) of nodal roots were observed. Variation in root angle has been associated with architecture of the mature plant root system in wheat. Based on these initial results, a large-scale screening experiment was designed, in which > 70 inbred lines and hybrids, relevant to sorghum breeding in Australia, were grown in small rhizotrons with <b>perspex</b> <b>sheets</b> on both sides. Plants were harvested after the first flush of nodal roots had appeared. Root angle ranged from 15 º to 50 º and because genetically related germplasm had similar root angle, these differences appeared repeatable. A small number of lines have been selected for trials in large chambers to study if these differences in root angle affect the rooting effectiveness and occupancy...|$|E
40|$|Background: In sorghum, {{the growth}} angle of nodal roots {{is a major}} {{component}} of root system architecture. It strongly influences the spatial distribution of roots of mature plants in the soil profile, which can impact drought adaptation. However, selection for nodal root angle in sorghum breeding programs has been restricted by the absence of a suitable high throughput phenotyping platform. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a phenotyping platform for the rapid, non-destructive and digital measurement of nodal root angle of sorghum at the seedling stage. Results: The phenotyping platform comprises of 500 soil filled root chambers (50 × 45 × 0. 3 cm in size), made of transparent <b>perspex</b> <b>sheets</b> that were placed in metal tubs and covered with polycarbonate sheets. Around 3 weeks after sowing, once the first flush of nodal roots was visible, roots were imaged in situ using an imaging box that included two digital cameras that were remotely controlled by two android tablets. Free software (openGelPhoto. tcl) allowed precise measurement of nodal root angle from the digital images. The reliability and efficiency of the platform was evaluated by screening a large nested association mapping population of sorghum and a set of hybrids in six independent experimental runs that included up to 500 plants each. The platform revealed extensive genetic variation and high heritability (repeatability) for nodal root angle. High genetic correlations and consistent ranking of genotypes across experimental runs confirmed the reproducibility of the platform. Conclusion: This low cost, high throughput root phenotyping platform requires no sophisticated equipment, is adaptable to most glasshouse environments and is well suited to dissect the genetic control of nodal root angle of sorghum. The platform is suitable for use in sorghum breeding programs aiming to improve drought adaptation through root system architecture manipulation...|$|E

To achieve this aim will require sensors of various types, one of which should be capable of detecting the relative movement between {{the surface of a}} grasped object and the hand (slip).

Experimental evaluation of the sensor has been carried out using a test apparatus whereby a block of aluminium representing an object slides past the sensor. Attached to the object surface is a <b>Perspex</b> <b>sheet</b> with repeating groves cut into the surface. Two different separations of the groves have been tested.

One-dimensional swell tests were conducted on a remoulded expansive soil with and without fibres. In this study, fibre content was varied as 0. 25 and 0. 5 % and fibre length as 30, 60 and 90 mm. A twin semi-circular-shaped fabricated mould with a front <b>Perspex</b> <b>sheet</b> was developed for testing. Digital imaging technique was used to observe heave of the soil in both unreinforced and fibre-reinforced conditions. Displacement profiles obtained from image analysis were used for interpreting swell or upward movement profiles of the specimens.

Reduction in heave was the maximum at low aspect ratios at both fibre contents of 0. 25 and 0. 5 %.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental work with measurement of wall static pressure of 90 °C shaped Curved duct. The test duct is made up of transparent <b>perspex</b> <b>sheets</b> to facilitate the flow visualization study. The duct has an inlet to exit area ratio of 1. 0 with centerline distance of 750 mm. The inlet aspect ratio of the test duct has been fixed at 1. 0. The velocities for the proposed investigations are to be measured by using a Pitot tube. Wall pressures are measured {{with the help of an}} inclinedmanometer with the inclination of 35 °. The manometer had two tubes emanating from it: one left open to the atmosphere and the other connected to the steel pipes attached to the four walls of the curved duct. The difference in the readings helped us calculate the static pressure and thereby the normalized pressure. Wall pressure distribution along the curved and parallel walls of the duct at 0 °, 22. 5 °, 45 °, 67. 5 ° and 90 ° measuring sections was measured. All the experimental data has been processed by an Intel i 3 CPU, 3 GB RAM PC and analyzed to give the distribution of static pressure in the square duct. The main purpose of this investigation is to show the development of secondary flow which happens when the flow takes place through the bend in the curvature. This secondary flow arises as a result of a centrifugal force acting when the flow moves through the bend. The investigation is carried out at three different velocities 20 m/s, 40 m/s and 60 m/s. The distribution of normalized pressure which is the ratio of static pressure to the dynamic pressure is mapped and shown in the form of contours by using the software package SURFER. The trend of wall static pressure development on the walls of C shaped duct shows that as the flow proceeds towards the curvature, there exists a high pressure gradient between the outside face and inside face due the centrifugal force acting along the curvature. This shows the bulk shifting of flow towards the inside face. This is due to the generation of secondary motion in a plane perpendicular to the primary flow...|$|E

Better definition of landmarks should therefore contribute to better clinical decisions and research validity. This study primarily comprised of an ex vivo investigation on 50 extracted lower incisor teeth to determine whether radiopaque markers could be utilised to accurately assess lower incisor inclination. Fifty extracted lower incisor teeth were mounted onto a <b>Perspex</b> <b>sheet.</b> Radiopaque markers, manufactured from 1 mm wide strips of lead film from used peri-apical radiographs, were attached to the crowns of the mounted teeth. A lateral cephalometric radiograph was taken in accordance to standard radiographic procedures (radiograph A). This showed the true inclination of the teeth. A second radiograph was taken with the roots obscured (radiograph B). Three observers traced the inclinations of the teeth on radiograph B (from incisor edge through the middle of the labio-lingual crown-root junction). The determination was done on two different occasions and the assessments compared with the true inclination. Comparative statistical analysis was applied to the readings and the results indicated that this method compared favourably with other methods to determine incisor inclination. In addition, clinical application of opaque markers to the teeth of patients demonstrated the following: it indicated exactly which tooth was being assessed, provided clear definition of the anatomical crown in the sagittal plane and served as a constant reference point for clinical, study model and cephalometric measurements. decisions and research validity.

40|$|In steelmaking, metal {{droplets}} {{are generated}} {{due to the}} impact of supersonic jets onto the liquid metal bath. This phenomenon is generally referred to 'splashing' [1]. Splashing is an important phenomenon as it provides large interfacial area between reacting phases and promotes high overall reaction rates. Dogan et al. [2] estimated that 60 % of decarburization in steelmaking process takes place in the gas-metal-slag emulsion phase during the main blow. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} droplet generation if we are to optimize steelmaking processes. In literature only a few works [3, 4] discuss the formation of waves in the cavity. But there is lack of understanding how waves inside the cavity affect splashing. In the present work, a 1 / 10 th cold model of oxygen steelmaking was used to study wave phenomenon in the cavity and how its characteristics vary with the changing momentum of impact jet and thereby affecting splashing. Compressed air was passed through a top straight nozzle. Water was used to simulate liquid steel. As the first phase of the investigation, the slag phase was not included in this study. A transparent cylindrical rig, made of <b>perspex</b> <b>sheet</b> was used as the vessel. A high speed camera (MotionPro Y, model Y 4 L (1024 x 1024 - 4000 fps)) was used to take photos of the cavity and the splashing at a rate of 30 frames/ second for a time duration of 4 minutes. In addition, a video of 2 second was taken at 2000 frames/ second rate in order to observe the droplet generation process. As air jet hit the water surface, it created waves inside the cavity. These waves were pushed towards the edge of the cavity by deflected gas flow. At the edge of the cavity, these waves grew to certain critical amplitudes. These waves were like sheets structure at the edge of cavity. They were similar to 'peregrine sheet' described in the general splashing literature [5]. Figure 1 (a) and (b) shows an irregular peregrine sheet from an earlier study and a typical sheet structure observed in the cold modeling experiment respectively. From high speed video, droplet formation process was observed and three stages could be identified- amplitude of the waves (which will be called 'sheets' from now on) enlarged at the edge of the cavity, instability grew formed at the rim of the sheets and fingers were formed and finally, fingers broke up into one or number of droplets. Depending upon lance height and air flow rate, any one or two or all three stages were found. For example, at gas flow rate 40 L/min and lance height 150 mm, only sheet structures were observed. As gas flow rate increased from 40 L/min to 50 L/min, fingers as well as droplet generation began. It was observed that frequency and amplitude of the waves in the cavity, the height of the sheets increased as gas momentum on bath surface increased which ultimately, increased droplet generation. Also, the shape of the droplets changed from circular to irregular shapes as momentum of impact jet grew. It was found that the characteristics of the waves have an effect on the splashing droplet amount and shape. A variety of mathematical techniques (including Fast Fourier Analysis) were used to analyze the wave behavior and the results from this analysis will be discussed at the symposium...|$|R
