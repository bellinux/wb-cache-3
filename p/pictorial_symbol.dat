60|$|Heraldry {{properly}} {{so called}} was, of course, a wholly limited and aristocratic thing, but the remark needs {{a kind of}} qualification not commonly realized. In a sense there was a plebeian heraldry, since every shop was, like every castle, distinguished not by a name, but a sign. The whole system dates from a time when picture-writing still really ruled the world. In those days few could read or write; they signed their names with a <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbol,</b> a cross--and a cross is a great improvement on most men's names.|$|E

5000|$|The {{link between}} the term [...] "Jayhawkers" [...] and any {{specific}} kind of bird, if such an association ever existed, had been lost or at least obscured by the time KU's bird mascot was invented in 1912. The originator of the bird mascot, Henry Maloy, struggled {{for over two years}} to create a <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbol</b> for the team, until hitting upon the bird idea. As explained by Mr. Maloy, [...] "the term 'jayhawk' in the school yell was a verb and the term 'jayhawkers' was the noun." [...] KU's current Jayhawk tradition largely springs from Frank W. Blackmar, a KU professor. In his 1926 address on the origin of the Jayhawk, Blackmar specifically referenced the blue jay and sparrow hawk. Blackmar's address served to soften the link between KU's athletic team moniker and the Jayhawkers of the Kansas territorial period, and helped explain the relatively recently invented Jayhawk <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbol</b> with folklore that appears to have been of even more recent fabrication.|$|E

5000|$|The fifth, {{sixth and}} eighth {{chapters}} respectively show how {{each of the}} mindprints, such as Connectivity-Disconnectivity, Hierarchy-Randomness, Symmetry-Asymmetry, enable one to distinguish art from non-art. For example, a painting depicting a horse presents a graphical common denominator between all horses of the same type. That is, on one hand the <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbol</b> of the horse relates all horses with the same visual characteristics, but it also separates the group of these horses from any other animal or object. In other words, Symmetry-Asymmetry is the principle of connectivity of figurative painting. The more detailed the painting of a horse, the more levels of organization or layering or hierarchy are contained in the painting. On the other hand, every such painting has very many random factors. That is, in painting a hierarchy is created of symbols, sub-symbols, sub-sub-symbols etc. Therefore, the hierarchy {{is the result of}} recursive connectivity, while the randomness is the result of recursive separation. The examples here are only three of the ten mindprints and they are sufficient for the point. In Avital's view, Hierarchy-Randomness suffices to distinguish art from pseudo-art. To put it simply, the difference between a real painting and a pseudo-painting is very similar to the difference between a cow and a hamburger. A living cow is a super-system which includes hundreds or thousands of subsystems, all dynamically interrelated directly or obliquely. This fact enables the cow to function as an organism. In contrast, a hamburger is the result of total destruction of all the systems which previously were the cow, and the destruction of all connections between them. This is the meaning of the death of the cow. Similarly, Avital argue that figurative art is a super-system of symbols, sub-symbols and sub-sub-symbols etc. The more detailed the painting, the more levels of organization it contains. In contrast, a painting called [...] "Abstract Expressionist" [...] is an arbitrary or random jumble of colors and forms. It contains no hierarchies, no symmetries with relation to any subject=, and does not connect to anything other than its being smeared on canvas.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review and a questionnaire study with 62 participants {{were carried out}} to provide recommendations {{on the design of}} a set of evacuation systems for road tunnels: 1) Traffic Information Sign (TIS) - message and size of the sign (large or small), colour scheme, and use of pictograms and/or flashing lights, 2) Emergency exit portal layout - colour scheme, 3) Acoustic systems - voice message and/or warning signals. The TIS is recommended to include the use of two panels which present text (in amber) and flashing lights in one panel and the emergency exit <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbol</b> in green in the other panel. An increased size of the panels has a positive effect on capturing participants’ attention. The recommended colour scheme for the emergency exit portal is safety green for the portal and a “green darker than the safety green” for the door.

40|$|Maya {{archaeology}} {{has always}} been fascinated with the elaborate temple pyramids, palaces, and stelae plazas that formed the centers of the ancient communities from its inception to the present day. Despite the intense interest in large-scale architecture, {{we still have a}} rather limited excavated sample of Maya dynastic building programs. The scale of construction of these monuments poses immense logistical problems and other challenges for conscientious investigation, stabilization, and publication. More often than not, the version of a large-scale construction visible on the surface has one or more previous structures buried inside of it. This makes the problem of complete sampling of architectural monuments even more daunting from both a practical and an interpretive point of view. Despite these rather long odds, some remarkable progress has been made. Increased understanding of the writing system and <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbol</b> systems used to adorn the buildings and the principles of organization of Maya architecture on the level of commoners and the nobility help inform our judgments about the function and meaning of the building complexes that formed the heart of the Classic Maya towns and cities. This paper represents an attempt to understand how the ruling families organized their sacred and secular spaces and what kinds of buildings and messages they erected in those environs. It also explores the degree to which one may reliably infer the political strategies, idiosyncratic concerns, and even the personality of royal Maya patrons from the architecture they left behind. The question of the design and intent of Maya dynastic architecture is best addressed in sites where a long sequence of constructions with accompanying historical texts and pictorial imagery have been recovered.

40|$|In the 1960 s when Japan was in {{the middle}} of change toward the high level of the {{economic}} growth, newspaper was the most useful media for information. Everyone reads newspaper no matter how old he/she was in order to survive in the highly advanced society that valued one’s academic background. However, due to the spread of television, internet and cellular phone, the methods of the information gathering has dramatically changed. Especially, the young generations greatly influenced by the TV media became to read less newspaper and mainly depend on the internet and cellular phone for information gathering and communication because of the convenience. Interestingly, the communication using <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbol</b> that used to be the communication method of ancients has revived in the modern society as smiley and crying face used to be the communication used in emails through cellular phone. Although it is difficult to conclude whether the unique culture for youngsters is progression or retrogression, there is no gainsaying that the trends has negatively affect the literacy level of Japanese children.

However, it is necessary to acquire the thinking skill in order to select and effectively utilize the information. Newspaper can be the best media to improve ability to think such as thinking and judging. The trends that young people especially college students who are going out into the world do not read newspaper could result in the decline of the society’competence such as reading, writing listening thinking and telling.

60|$|Now, {{there is}} {{something}} to be said for the peculiar influence of <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbols</b> on men's minds. All letters, we learn, were originally pictorial and heraldic: thus the letter A is the portrait of an ox, but the portrait is now reproduced in so impressionist a manner that but little of the rural atmosphere can be absorbed by contemplating it. But as long as some pictorial and poetic quality remains in the symbol, the constant use of it must do something for the aesthetic education of those employing it. Public-houses are now almost the only shops that use the ancient signs, and the mysterious attraction which they exercise may be (by the optimistic) explained in this manner. There are taverns with names so dreamlike and exquisite that even Sir Wilfrid Lawson might waver on the threshold for a moment, suffering the poet to struggle with the moralist. So it was with the heraldic images. It is impossible to believe that the red lion of Scotland acted upon those employing it merely as a naked convenience like a number or a letter; it is impossible to believe that the Kings of Scotland would have cheerfully accepted the substitute of a pig or a frog. There are, as we say, certain real advantages in <b>pictorial</b> <b>symbols,</b> and one of them is that everything that is pictorial suggests, without naming or defining. There is a road from the eye to the heart that does not go through the intellect. Men do not quarrel about the meaning of sunsets; they never dispute that the hawthorn says the best and wittiest thing about the spring.|$|R
