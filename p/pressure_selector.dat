40|$|This {{high data}} rate {{pressure}} sensor module helps reduce energy consumption in wind tunnel facilities without loss of measurement accuracy. The sensor module allows for nearly a two order of magnitude increase in data rates over conventional electromechanically scanned pressure sampling techniques. The module consists of 16 solid state pressure sensor chips and signal multiplexing electronics integrally mounted to a four position <b>pressure</b> <b>selector</b> switch. One of the four positions of the <b>pressure</b> <b>selector</b> switch allows the in situ calibration of the 16 pressure sensors; the three other positions allow 48 channels (three sets of 16) pressure inputs to be measured by the sensors. The small size of the sensor module will allow mounting within many wind tunnel models, thus eliminating long tube lengths and their corresponding slow pressure response...|$|E

40|$|To {{solve this}} problem the authors have {{developed}} a digital automated air pressure control system (ACS) based on automatic frequency <b>pressure</b> <b>selector,</b> which is different from air-operated ones {{due to the fact}} that it is a nonlinear system of automatic stabilization with the relay servo mechanism and adaptive control with high levels of accuracy, reliability and high-speed performance. An optimization of digital ACS of barometric pressure measuring equipment has been conducted, including aircraft barometric altimeters (BA), with its optimal accuracy and speed, with the desired transition process of providing one-way transition process without sacrificing the accuracy. The results can be used for the synthesis of high-speed automated control system, calibration and verification. Optimization of relay digital automated control system of measuring air pressure, optimal according to the criteria of accuracy and speed, with the desired one-way transition process has been carried out in order to remove BA variations indications. Optimization of the accuracy, speed and one-way transition process of the system (multi-criteria optimization problem) allowed choosing the relay servo mechanism as a result. Scientific novelty is that developed algorithm of ACS is of optimal performance, and operates in medium and low vacuum, which establishes a one-way approach to a given level of pressure without sacrificing accuracy. For a complete analysis of dynamic processes in the frequency ACS, including analog (pneumatic, mechanical, electrical) and digital conversions, a comprehensive mathematical model of dynamic processes in ACS has been developed. ????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ??????????????????? ????????, ??????? ????? ???? ???????????? ??? ??????? ?????????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????????? ? ???????, ??????????? ?? ????????, ?????????? ? ??????????????, ? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ???????...|$|E
25|$|Langer then {{suffered}} {{a number of}} injuries, increasing the <b>pressure</b> on <b>selectors</b> to drop Langer for rising star Phil Jaques. However, Langer was selected over Jaques for the 2007 Ashes series, which {{would turn out to}} be his last. Langer scored an 80 and a century in the first test, but it was slim pickings to follow for him.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{calibrating}} a pressure transducer {{which has a}} reference portion and an active portion is reported. A miniature selector valve is positioned immediately adjacent the pressure transducer. A reference pressure, known pressure, and unknown pressure can be selectively admitted to the active side of the pressure transducer by the selector valve to enable calibration of the transducer. A valve admits <b>pressure</b> to the <b>selector</b> valve which has a piston and floating piston arrangement which allows proper selection with very small linear movement...|$|R
500|$|An Honorary Life Member of the MCC, Gilligan {{served as}} MCC {{president}} from 1967 to 1968. During his tenure, the MCC {{was involved in}} controversy over the non-selection of Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira in the England team {{on the grounds of}} his colour. Gilligan, in his capacity as MCC president, was aware of this having seen a private letter which communicated the explicit threat from the South African prime minister B. J. Vorster that the forthcoming tour would be cancelled if D'Oliveira were selected. However, he and the others who saw the letter, G. O. B. Allen and Billy Griffith, respectively the MCC treasurer and secretary, kept this information to themselves. When the English selectors met to choose the team, Gilligan, Allen and Griffith were present to represent the MCC. A BBC programme in 2004 claimed that Gilligan <b>pressured</b> the <b>selectors</b> to leave out D'Oliveira, but D'Oliveira's biographer Peter Oborne suggests that Allen carried far more influence at the meeting. He writes of Gilligan's part in the affair: [...] "It would be wrong to make too much of Gilligan's embarrassing past. Given that presidents are appointed for only a year, it was a very strong president indeed who could impose his personality on the permanent MCC secretariat of Griffith and Allen, and Gilligan was not a strong president." [...] Initially D'Oliveira was left out of the team, but when a player withdrew with an injury, the selectors added him as a replacement; the South African government barred D'Oliveira from taking part and the MCC cancelled the tour.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{instruments}} were typically provided, including a compass, altimeter, tachometer, oil pressure indicator, airspeed gauge, radiator temperature dial, fuel air <b>pressure</b> indicator, fuel <b>selector,</b> and air exchange; these were somewhat difficult to view {{due to their}} low-set position in the cockpit. According to [...] "Dodge" [...] Bailey, Chief Test Pilot of the Shuttleworth Collection, the S.E.5's cockpit was [...] "the best of the bunch from the era". Individual in-service S.E.5s would often receive customisations and user-specified tweaks {{at the request of}} their pilots. Popular changes included reducing the dihedral of the wings in order to increase its manoeuvrability and the removal of the head faring to increase the pilot's visibility to the rear. James McCudden, an ace pilot, was famous for his prolific fine-tuning of his aircraft in order to produce improved performance from it; McCudden was able to increase the top speed by 9 MPH and to raise the service ceiling from the standard 17,000 ft to 20,000 ft. His adaptions included replacing the standard pistons with high compression versions, shortening the exhaust (saving weight and improving exhaust scavenging), and changes to mixture, ignition and other engine settings as well as fitting a scavenged propeller spinner (which he himself credited as gaining 3 mph alone) [...]|$|R
25|$|May {{returned}} in 1961 and {{was expected to}} take back his captaincy, but declared himself unfit. Cowdrey was hurriedly brought to Lords and was told he would take over {{only a few days}} before the First Test. Although Richie Benaud had beaten England 4â€“0 in the last Ashes series the 1961 Australians were considered to be the weakest sent to England with Benaud and Alan Davidson struggling with injuries and many players unused to English conditions. They nearly upset England in the First Test at Edgbaston, leading by 321 runs in the first innings and Ted Dexter had to save the game with an innings of 180. Before the Second Test at Lords Cowdrey made 149 and 121 for Kent against the tourists and was 7 runs from victory when the game ended. May returned to the England team, but insisted that Cowdrey be captain despite <b>pressure</b> from the <b>selectors.</b> Benuad was unable to play, but the Australians under Neil Harvey rose to the occasion, Davidson taking 5/42 in the first innings, Bill Lawry making his maiden Test century of 130 and Garth McKenzie taking 5/37 to clear up the second innings in their 5 wicket victory. May agreed to lead England in the Third Test at Headingley and Cowdrey made 93 and 22 in a low scoring match as Fred Trueman took 11/93 to even the series. Cowdrey missed the Fourth Test at Old Trafford with a fever, where Australia won a nail-biting match to retain the Ashes. May thought England would have won if Cowdrey had played, even if he wasn't fit, but he returned for the drawn Fifth Test at the Oval.|$|R
