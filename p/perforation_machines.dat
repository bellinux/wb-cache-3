50|$|Historically, {{perforation}} patterns {{other than}} linear {{were used to}} mark stamps. A series of patents had been issued in the late 19th Century for <b>perforation</b> <b>machines</b> to be used on rail lines for ticketing. Libraries and private collections used similar perforating stamps to mark ownership of books. End sheets, title pages, and image plates were punched with the namesake of the collection. Today, similarly elaborate perforation patterns continue {{to be used in}} orienteering.|$|E
5000|$|But {{a problem}} {{more serious than}} press sniping plagued the Series of 1902: that the {{existing}} technique of stamp production could not ensure the quality control needed to present designs of this opulence to best advantage. For, one result of cramming so much detail into the stamps was that the images were larger than usual, leaving little white space at their edges. This defect magnified an endemic problem of stamp production at that time: that many stamps emerged from the <b>perforation</b> <b>machines</b> with the design seriously off-center. Lopsided examples of these stamps with portions of the images cut off are all too common; and relatively few collectors have succeeded in assembling {{a complete set of}} the 1902 series in which all the denominations are well-centered.|$|E

5000|$|Archer then {{abandoned}} {{this approach}} {{in favour of}} perforation, a process which used rows of small round pins to punch out the holes. In 1848 Archer patented his <b>perforation</b> <b>machine</b> which worked on the [...] "stroke" [...] principle. The arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation, and this became known as [...] "comb" [...] perforation. Perforation trials were conducted in 1849 and 1850 {{under the auspices of}} the British Government and stamps from these trials were first issued towards the end of 1850. The Archer machine proved the viability of the process but never entered service. Archer's patent for his perforating machine (no. 12,340 of 1848, dated May 23, 1849) was purchased for Â£4,000 in June 1853. New machines based on Archer's principles were constructed by David Napier and Son Ltd; these were initially used in October 1853 for revenue stamps and from January 1854 for postage stamps.|$|R

50|$|The Masker {{portion of}} the system is {{designed}} to silence a vessel's engine noise from detection by threat vessels and to reduce self-noise to increase the vessel's own sonar efficiency. The Masker portion typically consists of two bands fitted to the outside of the hull adjacent the vessel's engine rooms, compressed air is then forced into the bands and escapes through <b>machined</b> <b>perforations</b> to create a barrier of air bubbles in the sea about the hull, thus trapping machinery noise within the hull where it is dissipated.|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom was {{the first}} country to issue postage stamps with <b>perforations.</b> The first <b>machine</b> {{specifically}} designed to perforate sheets of postage stamps was invented in London by Henry Archer, an Irish landowner and railroad man from Dublin, Ireland. The 1850 Penny Red {{was the first}} stamp to be perforated during trial course of Archer's perforating machine. After a period {{of trial and error}} and modifications of Archer's invention, new machines based on the principles pioneered by Archer were purchased and in 1854 the U.K. postal authorities started continuously issuing perforated postage stamps in the Penny Red and all subsequent designs.|$|R
25|$|The generations who led {{and fought}} the American Civil War were born into an {{independent}} United States {{and they would}} determine whether it could continue as a united republic. Steam power on land and sea had begun to shrink {{the world and the}} telegraph moved information at the speed of electricity. In 1851, Congress reduced rates for typical uses such as printed matter to one cent, and three-cent letter postage versus five or ten-cent rates. Postal distances for each rate were extended as much as ten times, for example, from three hundred to 3,000 miles. Their world was filled with mechanized innovations that included the first U.S. postage stamps produced from <b>machine</b> <b>perforation</b> to replace the cutting tasks which had been done manually. These were accompanied by innovations in paper types and printing techniques.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of modifications of the porous transport layer (PTL) on the water management in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells is investigated. Laser perforation and milling are used to locally remove either the whole PTL or only the micro porous layer in the PTL. The changed liquid water distribution is visualized using synchrotron radiography and ESEM liquid water imaging. The observed effects are correlated with in-situ performance characteristics, pre-assembly and post-mortem analysis to examine on the beneficial and obstructive effects of the modifications. The analysis reveals that laser-perforation results in PTFE loss and hydrophilic regions which results in a good performance at dry conditions but serious flooding at high humidification conditions. <b>Machined</b> <b>perforations</b> show beneficial effects in the in-situ performance characteristics at high humidification conditions. A draining of {{the vicinity of the}} perforations is observed which results in an improved oxygen diffusivity. Water balancing and synchrotron visualization indicate that under the analyzed operating conditions the MPL increases the humidification of the ionomer on the one hand but creates an additional diffusion barrier by liquid water in the interface between the cathode catalyst layer and the MPL on the other hand...|$|R
