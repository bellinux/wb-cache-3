40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Oxidative stress {{increases}} platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (<b>PDGF)</b> <b>gene</b> expression in endothelial cells {{that contributes to}} vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress generates by dys-regulated redox balance between ROS producing systems and antioxidant systems. Also, Curcumin (Cur) as a main part of turmeric has anti- inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and antitumor effects. This {{study was conducted to}} test the Curcumin as an environmental potent antioxidant decreases risk of arthrosclerosis. 						Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted during 2015 in Iran. Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were incubated with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) (20, 40 and 80 µM) and Curcumin (10 µM) for 24 h. Then, the level of <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> expression was analyzed by Real-Time PCR in untreated and treated cells. 						Results: The results demonstrated significant increase in the level of <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> expression in H 2 O 2 treated groups versus control.

40|$|Destruction of {{tooth support}} {{due to the}} chronic {{inflammatory}} disease periodontitis is {{a major cause of}} tooth loss. There are limitations with available treatment options to tissue engineer soft tissue periodontal defects. The exogenous application of growth factors (GFs) such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has shown promise to enhance oral and periodontal tissue regeneration. However, the topical administration of GFs has not led to clinically significant improvements in tissue regeneration because of problems in maintaining therapeutic protein levels at the defect site. The utilization of <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> transfer may circumvent many of the limitations with protein delivery to soft tissue wounds. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the effect of PDGF-A and PDGF-B gene transfer to human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) on ex vivo repair in three-dimensional collagen lattices. HGFs were transduced with adenovirus encoding PDGF-A and PDGF-B genes. Defect fill of bilayer collagen gels was measured by image analysis of cell repopulation into the gingival defects. The modulation of gene expression at the defect site and periphery was measured by RT-PCR during a 10 -day time course after gene delivery. The results demonstrated that PDGF-B gene transfer stimulated potent (> 4 -fold) increases in cell repopulation and defect fill above that of PDGF-A and corresponding controls. PDGF-A and PDGF-B gene expression was maintained for at least 10 days. <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> transfer upregulated the expression of phosphatidylinosital 3 -kinase and integrin α 5 subunit at 5 days after adenovirus transduction. These results suggest that <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> transfer has potential for periodontal soft tissue-engineering applications...|$|E

Furthermore, the administration of CAPE critically reduced the expression levels of Hif- 1 a, NF-kB and PDGF molecules in the lung of MCT-induced PAH rats. In vitro assay showed that an increased expression level of hif- 1 α and <b>pdgf</b> <b>genes</b> in hPASMCs was observed under hypoxia or PDGF stimulation, which was significantly suppressed following CAPE treatment. For chemical inhibition, we indicated that cellular signaling molecules ERK, AKT and NF-kB {{were involved in the}} up-regulation of hif- 1 a and <b>pdgf</b> <b>genes,</b> which were responsible for the proliferation of hPASMCs exposed to hypoxia or PDGF stimulation.

We have now analyzed the levels and sites of expression of the cognate <b>PDGF</b> alpha-receptor <b>gene</b> in brain and spinal cord of embryonic and adult mice by in situ hybridization. The predominant cell populations in both gray and white matter expressing transcripts of the <b>PDGF</b> alpha-receptor <b>gene</b> are glial cells or their precursors.

Expression of the <b>PDGF</b> alpha-receptor <b>gene</b> was first observed at embryonic day 15, increased through postnatal day 14, and fell to lower levels in adults. Expression of the alpha-receptor gene corresponds in temporal sequence to the developmental period of glial migration and proliferation and to the expression of PDGF A by neurons.

To date, limited information exists regarding the safety profile and systemic biodistribution of <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> therapy vectors when delivered locally to periodontal osseous defects. The {{aim of this}} preclinical {{study was to determine}} the safety profile of adenovirus encoding the PDGF-B gene (AdPDGF-B) delivered in a collagen matrix to periodontal lesions. Standardized alveolar bone defects were created in rats, followed by delivery of matrix alone or containing AdPDGF-B at 5. 5 [*]×[*] 108 or 5. 5 [*]×[*] 109 plaque-forming units/ml. The regenerative response was confirmed histologically. Gross clinical observations, hematology, and blood chemistries were monitored to evaluate systemic involvement. Bioluminescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to assess vector biodistribution. No significant histopathological changes were noted during the investigation. Minor alterations in specific hematological and blood chemistries were seen; however, most parameters were within the normal range for all groups. Bioluminescence analysis revealed vector distribution at the axillary lymph nodes during the first 2 weeks with subsequent return to baseline levels. AdPDGF-B was well contained within the localized osseous defect area without viremia or distant organ involvement. These results indicate that AdPDGF-B delivered in a collagen matrix exhibits acceptable safety profiles for possible use in human clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) is transcribed in human atherosclerotic plaques, indicating that production of growth factors within plaques could occur during atherogenesis. However, since atherosclerotic plaques are composed of several cell types and three of these [...] macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [...] can express the PDGF genes, the cell type responsible for <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> expression was not clear. In the present study we explore further the expression of PDGF-A and -B and identify transcriptionally active cell types. We assayed PDGF-A and -B mRNA levels in dissected fractions of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and normal artery and then sequentially rehybridized these blots with three cDNA probes that recognize cell type-specific markers: fms for macrophages, von Willebrand factor for endothelial cells, and smooth muscle alpha-actin for smooth muscle cells. In plaques, PDGF-A expression correlated with smooth muscle actin; PDGF-B expression correlated strongly with fms. PDGF-A expression correlated with smooth muscle actin. In normal vessel wall, PDGF-A expression was high {{in the media and}} again correlated with smooth muscle actin, whereas PDGF-B expression was high in the adventitia. Since transcripts from both PDGF genes are found in normal artery where cell turnover is very low, we suggest that <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> expression does not necessarily function to produce smooth muscle cell proliferation. We propose that these genes may have an important nonmitogenic, maintenance function in normal arterial tissue and in the atherosclerotic plaque...|$|E

To determine the biologic effects of this growth factor in vivo, we have introduced an eukaryotic expression vector plasmid encoding recombinant PDGF B by direct gene transfer into porcine iliofemoral arteries using DNA liposome complexes. The presence of PDGF B plasmid DNA and expression of recombinant mRNA were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis, and recombinant PDGF protein was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Intimal thickening was observed in porcine arteries 21 days following transfection with the recombinant <b>PDGF</b> B <b>gene</b> compared with arteries transduced with a control gene, E. coli beta-galactosidase. An eightfold increase in intimal to medial ratio was present in <b>PDGF</b> B <b>gene</b> transfected arteries compared with control transfected arteries (P = 0. 001).

Northern blot analysis demonstrated the coexpression of the c-sis/PDGF- 2 protooncogene and the PDGF-R gene in all astrocytomas examined. The majority of the tumors also expressed the PDGF- 1 gene. There was no correlation between {{the expression of the}} two <b>PDGF</b> <b>genes.</b> Nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed the PDGF-R and PDGF- 1 genes but not the c-sis/PDGF- 2 protooncogene.

In contrast, nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed only PDGF-R mRNA but not c-sis/PDGF- 2 mRNA. The coexpression of a potent mitogenic growth factor protooncogene (c-sis) and its receptor gene in astrocytoma tumor cells suggests the presence of an autocrine mechanism that may contribute to the development and maintenance of astrocytomas.

40|$|AbstractThrombin is {{a potent}} mitogen for mesangial cells and stimulates <b>PDGF</b> B-chain <b>gene</b> {{expression}} in these cells. It also activates phospholipase C (PLC) resulting {{in an increase in}} cytosolic Ca 2 + and diacylglycerol (DAG) that are the physiological activators of protein kinase C (PKC). Immunoprecipitation of specific PKC isotypes from thrombin-stimulated mesangial cells with subsequent measurement of their enzymatic activity shows activation of Ca 2 +-dependent PKC α and Ca 2 +-independent PKC Σ in a time dependent manner. Optimum activation of both of these isozymes was obtained at 60 minutes. PKC α activity increased 83 % over basal while activity of PKC Σ increased 104 %. Prolonged exposure of mesangial cells to phorbol myristate acetic acid (PMA) inhibited the enzymatic activity of PKC α but not PKC Σ. This inhibition of PKC α had no effect on thrombin-induced DNA synthesis but abolished <b>PDGF</b> B-chain <b>gene</b> expression induced by thrombin.

Restoration of functional cementum {{is considered a}} criterion for successful regeneration of periodontal tissues, including formation of periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone.

40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) {{is characterized by}} accumulation of alveolar macrophages spontaneously releasing exaggerated amounts of the potent mesenchymal cell growth factor platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). To evaluate the relative contribution of the two PDGF genes to this process, PDGF-A and -B gene transcription rates and mRNA levels were examined in normal and IPF alveolar macrophages. While normal alveolar macrophages constitutively transcribe both PDGF-A and PDGF-B genes, LPS stimulation increases the transcription of both genes more than threefold. Importantly, IPF alveolar macrophages spontaneously transcribe both genes at a rate similar to that observed for normal macrophages after in vitro stimulation. Consistent with the transcription data, normal macrophages contain mRNA for both PDGF-A and -B, but PDGF-B mRNA is 10 -fold more abundant. Strikingly, in IPF, both PDGF-A and -B mRNA levels were markedly increased, with persistence of the 10 -fold dominance of PDGF-B mRNA. Thus, the exaggerated release of PDGF by IPF alveolar macrophages is likely modulated by upregulated <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> transcription rates and concomitantly increased mRNA levels and the persistent 10 -fold excess of B greater than A PDGF mRNA suggests that the PDGF released by alveolar macrophages is likely mostly of the potent B-chain homodimeric form...|$|E
40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factor}} D (PDGF-D) {{is the most}} {{recently}} discovered member of the PDGF family.

In contrast to {{other members of the}} PDGF family of growth factors, which have been extensively investigated using different knockout approaches in mice, PDGF-D has until now not been characterized by gene inactivation in mice. Here, we present the phenotype of a constitutive Pdgfd knockout mouse model (Pdgfd(-/-)), carrying a LacZ reporter used to visualize Pdgfd promoter activity. Inactivation of the <b>Pdgfd</b> <b>gene</b> resulted in a mild phenotype in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and the offspring was viable, fertile and generally in good health. We show that <b>Pdgfd</b> reporter <b>gene</b> activity was consistently localized to vascular structures in both postnatal and adult tissues. The expression was predominantly arterial, often localizing to vascular bifurcations. Endothelial cells appeared to be the dominating source for <b>Pdgfd,</b> but reporter <b>gene</b> activity was occasionally also found in sub-populations of mural cells. Tissue-specific analyses of vascular structures revealed that NG 2 -expressing pericytes of the cardiac vasculature were disorganized in Pdgfd(-/-) mice. Furthermore, Pdgfd(-/-) mice also had a slightly elevated blood pressure. In summary, the vascular expression pattern together with morphological changes in NG 2 -expressing cells, and the increase in blood pressure, support a function for PDGF-D in regulating systemic arterial blood pressure, and suggests a role in maintaining vascular homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Mesangial cells express platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) A- and B-chain mRNA and release PDGF. Several {{polypeptide}} growth factors, including PDGF itself, induce PDGF A- and B- chain mRNA abundance. To understand the molecular mechanisms {{associated with the}} changes in mRNA abundance, we measured the effects of PDGF BB homodimer on PDGF A- and B-chain gene transcription in cultured mesangial cells. The data demonstrate 2 - and 4 -fold increases in <b>PDGF</b> A-chain <b>gene</b> transcription in response to PDGF BB homodimer at 5 and 24 h time points respectively. <b>PDGF</b> B-chain <b>gene</b> transcription was also induced approximately 3 -fold at 2, 5 and 24 h time points in response to treatment with PDGF BB homodimer. The effect of PDGF BB on the half-life of PDGF A- as well as PDGF B-chain mRNA was measured directly by the pulse-chase method. There was no effect on PDGF A-chain mRNA half-life whereas PDGF B-chain mRNA half-life was increased 1. 5 -fold. These studies indicate that, in human mesangial cells, {{the increase in the}} levels of PDGF A- and B-chain mRNA in response to PDGF- receptor(s) activation is mediated at the level of gene transcription.

In each case, transformation resulted in a 50 - 100 % decrease in available PDGF receptors. All transformed cells except the methylcholanthrene-transformed mouse cells produce a PDGF competitor into the conditioned medium.

Expression of the A-chain has been reported to occur in human solid tumor cell lines independently of c-sis expression. We report here the non-coordinate expression of the A- and B-chains in human leukemia cell lines. The PDGF-A and B-chain (c-sis) RNA expression as well as secretion of PDGF polypeptides are induced in the K 562 cell line upon induction of megakaryoblastic differentiation with 12 -O-tetradecanoyl phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) whereas erythroid differentiation induced with sodium butyrate is accompanied by c-sis expression only. Simultaneously with megakaryoblastic differentiation the RNA level for another platelet protein, the transforming growth factor-beta was also increased, but in a complex manner. The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL- 60 does not express PDGF-A RNA, whereas the promonocytic cell line U 937 does. Preferential induction of the A-chain RNA is obtained in both cell lines after treatment with TPA which causes monocytic differentiation.

Immunoreactive PDGF A and B could be partially released by incubation of matrix material with heparin but not with other glycosaminoglycans. Digestion of matrix with chondroitin ABC lyase but not heparitinase or collagenase displaced some PDGF from its attachment sites.

Steady-state expression of the A-chain RNA was seen only in the promonocytic leukemia cell line U 937 and in the T-cell leukemia cell line MOLT- 4. It has previously been reported that both PDGF A and <b>PDGF</b> B <b>genes</b> are induced during megakaryoblastic differentiation of the K 562 erythroleukemia cells and transiently during monocytic differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL- 60 and U 937 cells. In this study we show that PDGF A RNA expression was induced in HL- 60 and Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells and increased in U 937 and MOLT- 4 cells after a 1 - to 2 -h stimulation with an 8 pM concentration of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). PDGF A RNA remained at a constant, elevated level for at least 24 h in U 937 cells, but returned to undetectable levels within 12 h in HL- 60 cells. No PDGF A expression was induced by TGF-beta in K 562 cells or in lung carcinoma cells (A 549). Interestingly, essentially no PDGF B-chain (c-sis proto-oncogene) RNA was expressed simultaneously with PDGF A. In the presence of TGF-beta and protein synthesis inhibitors, PDGF A RNA was superinduced at least 20 -fold in the U 937 and HL- 60 cells. PDGF A expression was accompanied by secretion of immunoprecipitable PDGF to the culture medium of HL- 60 and U 937 cells. The phorbol ester tumor promoter tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate also increased PDGF A expression with similar kinetics, but with a mechanism distinct from that of TGF-beta.

RNase protection assay and in situ hybridization showed that PDGF A-chain mRNA levels in VSMCs of SHRs were twofold higher than in those of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Gel retardation assays showed that levels of Sp 1 and AP- 2 in VSMCs of SHRs were twofold more abundant than in those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. Treatment with four pharmacologically different species of antihypertensive drugs for 2 wk decreased the levels of both PDGF A-chain mRNA and Sp 1, but not AP- 2 level in VSMCs of SHRs with regression of aortic hypertrophy, indicating that increases in levels of both PDGF A-chain mRNA and Sp 1 in VSMCs of SHRs were associated with high blood pressure. These results suggest that high blood pressure is a stimulus which upregulates <b>PDGF</b> A-chain <b>gene</b> expression in VSMCs of SHRs, resulting in an autocrine enhancement in hypertensive vascular hypertrophy, and that the activation of the gene may be mediated through increases in Sp 1 in these cells...|$|R

The primary end point was changed from progressive disease rate at 16 weeks postrandomization to RR. Pazopanib 800 mg was administered orally once daily. Pazopanib 800 mg was administered orally once daily. RESULTS: The study enrolled 225 patients with metastatic RCC; 155 patients (69 %) were treatment naïve, and 70 patients (31 %) had received one prior cytokine- or bevacizumab-containing regimen. Overall RR was 35 %; median duration of response was 68 weeks. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 52 weeks. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 and time from diagnosis to treatment of more than 1 year were correlated with prolonged PFS. Pazopanib was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, and hair depigmentation. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated AST and ALT.

In the vessel wall, the binding of lipoproteins to endothelial cells is markedly enhanced by lipoprotein lipase (LpL), synthesized by the underlying smooth muscle cells. While {{it is known that}} LpL is localized to the glomerulus, it is not known if and how it modulates the lipoprotein–mesangial interaction. MethodsVery low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) was isolated from rats and was used to treat cultured primary rat MCs. Binding studies were done with and without LpL and with/without pretreatment with heparanase, which degrades cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), known to modulate the LpL–lipoprotein interaction in blood vessels. VLDL/LpL was also used to assess MC proliferation and gene expression of the cytokine platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). ResultsLpL enhanced VLDL binding to MCs by as much as 200 -fold, and most of this effect was blocked by pretreatment with heparanase. LpL amplified VLDL-driven MC proliferation and increased VLDL-induced PDGF expression. Heparanase pretreatment of cells eliminated both of these amplifications. LpL alone increased MC proliferation and <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> expression. DiscussionAs in the vessel wall, LpL enhances VLDL binding to MCs. MCs respond to LpL binding by proliferating and expressing cytokines such as PDGF. LpL may be a crucial paracrine mediator of the glomerular response to circulating lipoproteins, amplifying a response that includes cytokine elaboration, influx of circulating monocytes, and eventual sclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Lysophosphatidylcholine induces platelet-derived {{growth factor}} gene {{expression}} in a cultured human glomerular mesangial cell lineBackgroundOxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) {{has been considered}} important in the pathogenesis of progressive renal injury. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) is a major phospholipid component of oxLDL. On the other hand, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has also been implicated in proliferative disease of the kidney. This study investigated the difference in the potential of PC and lysoPC to induce DNA synthesis and <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> expression in a human glomerular mesangial cell line (HMCL). MethodsDNA synthesis in HMCL was measured by [3 H] thymidine incorporation. The mRNA expression levels of the PDGF A chain and B chain genes were measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ResultsLysoPC treatment up-regulated the [3 H] thymidine incorporation level in a dose-dependent fashion. The [3 H] thymidine incorporation level in HMCL coincubated with lysoPC started to increase after 4 hours of treatment, peaked at 24 hours, and decreased thereafter. The level in HMCL incubated with 100 μ M of lysoPC (palmitoyl or stearoyl) increased to 7 - or 10 -fold of the control at peak time, respectively. However, PC treatment did not increase [3 H] thymidine incorporation in HMCL. PC treatment did not induce mRNA expression of either PDGF A or B chain genes. LysoPC did not induce PDGF A chain mRNA expression either. The only B chain mRNA expression was induced by lysoPC. The mRNA expression level in HMCL treated with 50 μ M lysoPC for two hours increased to 1. 6 -fold that of the control. ConclusionLysoPC may induce DNA synthesis in a mesangial cell through the induction of PDGF BB as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor...|$|E
40|$|The platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (<b>PDGF)</b> A-chain <b>gene</b> is {{expressed}} in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific manner. Here we identify an S 1 nuclease sensitive region within the first intron that functions as a negative regulatory element in HeLa but not in human glioblastoma (A 172) cells in transient transfection assays. A 147 bp DNA fragment that contains this element functions in a position and orientation independent manner to negatively regulate both the PDGF A-chain promoter and the heterologous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. The cell-type specific effect of this 147 bp DNA fragment is seen when it is located downstream but not upstream of the reporter gene driven by either the PDGF A-chain or TK promoters. The negative regulatory element has been localized to a 24 bp DNA sequence within the S 1 sensitive site that retains negative regulatory activity and recognizes a nuclear protein in HeLa but not in A 172 cells. Furthermore, the 24 bp element functions as a cell type-specific negative element independent of its position. These results suggest that a functional silencer within the first intron exhibits a non-B-form DNA structure under superhelical stress in vitro and {{may contribute to the}} cell type-specific transcriptional regulation of <b>PDGF</b> A-chain <b>gene</b> in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The four platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) li-gands and PDGF receptors (PDGFRs), α and β (PDGFRA, PDGFRB), are {{essential}} proteins that are expressed during embryonic and mature nervous systems, i. e., in neural pro-genitors, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and vascular cells. PDGF exerts essential roles from the gastrulation period to adult neuronal maintenance by {{contributing to the}} regulation of development of preplacodal progenitors, placodal ectoderm, and neural crest cells to adult neural progenitors, in coordinat-ing with other factors. In adulthood, PDGF plays critical roles for maintenance of many specific cell types in the nervous system together with vascular cells through controlling the blood brain barrier homeostasis. At injury or various stresses, PDGF modulates neuronal excitability through adjusting vari-ous ion channels, and affecting synaptic plasticity and function. Furthermore, PDGF stimulates survival signals, majorly PI 3 -K/Akt pathway but also other ways, rescuing cells from apo-ptosis. Studies imply an involvement of PDGF in dendrite spine morphology, being critical for memory in the developing brain. Recent studies suggest association of <b>PDGF</b> <b>genes</b> with neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we will describe the roles of PDGF in the nervous system, from the discovery to recent findings, {{in order to understand}} the broad spectrum of PDGF in the nervous system. Recent development of pharma-cological and replacement therapies targeting the PDGF system is discussed...|$|R
40|$|By in vivo DMS {{footprint}} and {{reporter gene}} analyses we identified two transcription factor binding {{sites in the}} human c-sis/PDGF B gene promoter. The low basal activity of the PDGF B promoter in HeLa and undifferentiated K 562 cells, which express low PDGF B mRNA levels, and in PC 3 cells, which express a high PDGF B mRNA level, results from binding of a weak transcriptional activator between positions - 64 and - 61 relative to the transcription start site. Cytotrophoblast-like JEG- 3 cells, which do not express the 3. 5 kb PDGF B mRNA, contain a transcriptional activator directed at the - 64 /- 61 sequence, but DNA methylation may render the endogenous promoter inaccessible to this activator. A CCACCCAC element at position - 61 /- 54 was identified as the in vivo binding site for a strong transcriptional activator in phorbol ester-treated megakaryocytic K 562 cells, which express a high PDGF B mRNA level. Primary human fibroblasts, which do not transcribe the <b>PDGF</b> B <b>gene,</b> contain a transcriptional activator that recognizes an element between positions - 60 and - 45 but does not bind to the endogenous unmethylated promoter.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} that some low-grade oligodendrogliomas may be comprised of proliferating glial progenitor {{cells that are}} blocked {{in their ability to}} differentiate, whereas malignant gliomas have additionally acquired other mutations such as disruption of cell cycle arrest pathways by loss of Ink 4 a–Arf. We have modeled these effects in cell culture and in mice by generating autocrine stimulation of glia through the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). In cell culture, PDGF signaling induces proliferation of glial precursors and blocks their differentiation into oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In addition, coexpression of PDGF and PDGF receptors has been demonstrated in human gliomas, implying that autocrine stimulation may be involved in glioma formation. In this study, using somatic cell type-specific gene transfer we investigated the functions of PDGF autocrine signaling in gliomagenesis by transferring the overexpression of PDGF-B into either nestin-expressing neural progenitors or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -expressing astrocytes both in cell culture and in vivo. In cultured astrocytes, overexpression of PDGF-B caused significant increase in proliferation rate of both astrocytes and neural progenitors. Furthermore, <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> transfer converted cultured astrocytes into cells with morphologic and gene expression characteristics of glial precursors. In vivo, gene transfer of PDGF to neural progenitors induced the formation of oligodendrogliomas in about 60 % of mice by 12 wk of age; PDGF transfer to astrocytes induced the formation of either oligodendrogliomas or mixed oligoastrocytomas in about 40 % of mice in the same time period. Loss of Ink 4 a–Arf, a mutation frequently found in high-grade human gliomas, resulted in shortened latency and enhanced malignancy of gliomas. The highest percentage of PDGF-induced malignant gliomas arose from of Ink 4 a–Arf null progenitor cells. These data suggest that chronic autocrine PDGF signaling can promote a proliferating population of glial precursors and is potentially sufficient to induce gliomagenesis. Loss of Ink 4 a–Arf is not required for PDGF-induced glioma formation but promotes tumor progression toward a more malignant phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF), a potent mitogen for mesenchymal cells, {{consists}} of PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 polypeptide chains which are linked by disulfide bonds. Sequence analysis has revealed that: (a) the PDGF- 2 chain is encoded by the c-sis protooncogene, the cellular counterpart of the simian sarcoma viral oncogene; (b) the PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 chains are related; and (c) the PDGF- 1 gene has no known viral homologue. We have previously {{shown that the}} PDGF- 2 gene is expressed during 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) induced monocytic differentiation of human HL- 60 leukemia cells. In the present study, PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 gene expression was compared in HL- 60 cells, human THP- 1 monocytic leukemia cells, and human monocytes. Uninduced HL- 60 cells, uninduced THP- 1 cells, and resting monocytes had no detectable PDGF- 1 or PDGF- 2 mRNA. In contrast, both PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 transcripts were detected in HL- 60 cells and monocytes induced with TPA, while only PDGF- 1 mRNA was found in TPA-treated THP- 1 cells. Moreover, neither of these transcripts were found during drug induced granulocytic differentiation of HL- 60 cells. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis: (a) failed to increase PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 mRNA levels in uninduced HL- 60 cells; (b) increased PDGF- 2, but not PDGF- 1, mRNA in resting monocytes; and (c) increased levels of PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 mRNA in HL- 60 cells and monocytes treated with TPA. This effect of cycloheximide was related in part to stabilization of both transcripts. Thus, PDGF- 1 and PDGF- 2 genes are differentially regulated in myeloid cells, although they share common control mechanisms at the post-transcriptional level. Differential regulation of <b>PDGF</b> <b>gene</b> expression would result in altered chain composition of the PDGF protein and possibly changes in biological activity.

40|$|Background. IgA {{nephropathy}} (IgAN), {{characterized by}} mesangial IgA deposition, runs a variable clinical course with tubulointerstitial damage and renal failure in {{no less than}} 30 % of patients. Histologically, IgA is rarely detected in renal tubules. The direct toxicity by IgA on renal tubules remains uncertain. We hypothesize that mediators released from human mesangial cells (HMC) triggered by IgA deposition may lead to activation of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). Methods. The binding of IgA to PTEC or HMC was assessed by flow cytometry. IgA-HMC medium was prepared by collecting the spent medium in which growth arrested HMC were incubated with IgA isolated from patients with IgAN, healthy control subjects, or other nephritic control patients. PTEC was cultured with the IgA-HMC medium in {{the presence or absence}} of neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α, IL- 1 β, TGF-β, or <b>PDGF.</b> <b>Gene</b> expression and protein synthesis of TNF-β, MIF, or ICAM- 1 by PTEC were determined by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Results. The binding of IgA isolated from patients with IgAN to PTEC was increased when compared to binding of IgA from healthy control subjects (P < 0. 005). However, the binding to PTEC was less than one tenth that of HMC in IgAN. The binding to PTEC was not mediated through known IgA receptors, as shown by competitive binding assays and gene expression of the receptors. Despite the in vitro binding, PTEC cultured with isolated IgA exhibited no increased cell proliferation or enhanced synthesis of TNF-α, MIF, or sICAM- 1. However, when PTEC were cultured with IgA-HMC medium prepared from IgAN patients, there was enhanced proliferation of PTEC (P < 0. 001) and increased synthesis of TNF-α, MIF, and sICAM- 1 when compared with PTEC cultured with IgA-HMC medium from control subjects (P < 0. 001). The synthesis of MIF and sICAM- 1 by PTEC cultured with IgA-HMC medium was reduced by neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α (P < 0. 001) but not by neutralizing antibodies to IL- 1 β, TGF-α, or PDGF. Conclusion. Our finding implicates that TNF-α released from the mesangium after IgA deposition activates renal tubular cells. The glomerulotubular communication could play an important role in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial damage in IgAN. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Methods and Findings: Myocardial function was monitored {{every two weeks}} up to six weeks after therapy. Echocardiography revealed time dependent improvement of left ventricular function evaluated by M-mode, fractional shortening, anterior wall tissue velocity, wall motion score index, strain and strain rate in animals treated with VEGF plus PDGF overexpressed stem cells (VIP) compared to nanofiber expanded cells (Exp), freshly isolated cells (FCB) or media control (Media). Improvement observed was as follows: VIP. Exp. FCB. media. Similar trend was noticed in the exercise capacity of rats on a treadmill. These findings correlated with significantly increased neovascularization in ischemic tissue and markedly reduced infarct area in animals in the VIP group. Stem cells {{in addition to their}} usual homing sites such as lung, spleen, bone marrow and liver, also migrated to sites of myocardial ischemia. The improvement of cardiac function correlated with expression of heart tissue connexin 43, a gap junctional protein, and heart tissue angiogenesis related protein molecules like VEGF, pNOS 3, NOS 2 and GSK 3. There was no evidence of upregulation in the molecules of oncogenic potential in genetically modified or other stem cell therapy groups.

40|$|AbstractPlatelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) B-chain mRNA is readily {{detectable}} in malignant mesothelioma (MM) cell lines, {{but not in}} normal mesothelial (NM) cell lines. The high affinity receptor for PDGF B-chain dimers, the PDGF β-receptor, is expressed in MM cell lines. NM cell lines predominantly express the PDGF α-receptor. Coexpression of the PDGF β-receptor and its ligand may lead to an autocrine growth stimulating loop in the malignant cell type. In nuclear run off experiments, PDGF B-chain mRNA was detectable in MM cells only, indicating an increased level of transcription in this cell type. The proximal promoter of the <b>PDGF</b> B-chain <b>gene</b> contains DNaseI hypersensitive (DH) sites and mediates reporter gene activation in both normal and malignant cells. Nuclear proteins, extracted from both cell types, interact with DNA sequences within the proximal promoter around bp − 64 to − 61 relative to the transcription start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) indicate that these factors are more abundantly present in the malignant than in the normal cell type. A DH site around − 9. 9 kb was found in both cell types. When tested in CAT assays, this region exerted a stimulatory effect on transcription in malignant cells. The elevated level of transcription of the <b>PDGF</b> B-chain <b>gene</b> in malignant cells {{may well be the}} result of interaction of regulatory sites in the proximal promoter and an enhancing element located at − 9. 9 kb from the transcription start site...|$|R
