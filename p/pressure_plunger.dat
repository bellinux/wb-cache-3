A 2 -level screening design was created to evaluate the effect of 5 process parameters on these coefficients.

The interfacial heat transfer coefficients were calculated with an inverse heat conduction method using as inputs the measured die temperatures obtained from the various casting conditions in the screening design.

Taguchi orthogonal array is designed with three levels and four process Parameters with the help of software Minitab 15. In the first run nine experiments are performed and Cycle time is calculated. Taguchi method stresses the importance of studying the response variation using the signal–to–noise (S/N) ratio, resulting in minimization of cycle time variation due to uncontrollable parameter. The Cycle time was considered as the quality characteristic with the concept of "the larger-the-better". The S/N ratio for the larger-the-better Where n is the number of measurements in a trial/row, in this case, n= 1 and y is the measured value in a run/row.

The crop trajectories (wad of crop) were measured using a high-speed camera {{from the side of the}} baler through viewing windows. The viewing windows were divided into four regions for determining the crop displacement, velocity and acceleration. Crop strain was used to evaluate the potential change in density of the crop before being compressed by the plunger. Generally, the vertical crop strain was found to be higher in the top half of the bale compared to the bottom. Average strain values for side measurements were 12. 8 % for the top and 2. 1 % for the bottom. <b>Plunger</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured to compare peak pressures between the top and bottom halves of each compressed wad of crop, and to develop pressure profiles based on the plunger’s position. Results of comparing the mean peak <b>plunger</b> <b>pressures</b> between the top and bottom locations indicated the mean pressures were significantly higher at the top location with the exception of one particular setting.

This beam of water is ejected from the nozzle, cutting through the material by spraying it with the jet of high-speed water. The process is the same for abrasive waterjets until the water reaches the nozzle. Here abrasives such as garnet and aluminium oxide, are fed into the nozzle via an abrasive inlet.

The diecasting process, on one hand, is a versatile and high productivity process but, on the other, the amount of defects found in the castings is high and sometimes compromising the characteristics of the final product. Thus the reduction or, at least, the limitation of defects is capital in order to obtain much more reliable components, especially in the automotive field. For this reason {{it is important to know}} how the process works and investigate all the variables and parameters that may have consequences on the products and may compromise their mechanical characteristics, or worse may cause disease. This implies an increasingly detailed knowledge of process, castings’ microstructure and properties. The paper presents the results of analyses carried out on a reference casting specifically designed to generate as many kinds of defects as possible, at different levels of severity. The purpose of such a casting is to make the evaluation of defects quality level simpler, to generate defects of different degree through controlled variations of process parameters and to make the process monitoring easier and more effective by means of in-mold sensors. The paper also presents analyses and results carried out on industrial production diecastings, adopting the same way of proceeding optimized thanks to the reference casting mentioned above.

A trained sensory panel applying multidimensional approximation methodology performed sensory analysis.

Other substances such as aldehydes, alcohols and sesquiterpenes reported quantitative differences and some compounds were not detected. These chemical flavor results were consistent with the report of sensory analysis, which showed enhanced quality descriptors for FMC juices. Zumex juice had high score for undesirable flavor descriptors. The analysis established a relationship between changes in chemical profile and sensory descriptors for mandarin juice produced with different squeezers...|$|R
40|$|The pressure-density {{relationship}} {{and the pressure}} distribution inside the compression chamber of a newly designed New Holland BB 960 large square baler were studied for the baling of alfalfa, whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw. An analytical model was developed for the pressure distribution inside the compression chamber of the large square baler in the x-, y-, and z-directions by assuming isotropic linear elastic properties for forage materials. In order to validate this model, a tri-axial sensor was designed and {{used to measure the}} forces inside the compression chamber when whole green barley, barley straw, and wheat straw were baled. The experimental results proved that the developed analytical model for each of the tested forage materials had a good correlation with the experimental data with a reasonable coefficient of determination (0. 95) and standard error (20. 0 kPa). Test data were also used to develop an empirical model for the pressure distribution inside the compression chamber of the baler for each of the tested forage materials using least square method in regression analysis. These empirical models were simple equations which were only functions of the distance from the full extension point of the plunger along the compression chamber length. Analytical and empirical models were also developed for the pressure-density relationship of the baler for baling alfalfa and barley straw. Results showed that bale density initially decreased with distance from the plunger, and then remained almost constant up {{to the end of the}} compression chamber. The developed empirical model for both alfalfa and barley straw was a combination of a quadratic and an exponential equation. In order to validate the developed models, field tests were performed by baling alfalfa and barley straw of different moisture contents, flake sizes, and load settings. The forces on the plunger arms were recorded by a data acquisition system. The actual bale bulk density was calculated by measuring the bale dimensions and weight. Results showed that both load setting and flake size had a significant effect on the plunger force. The plunger force increased with increased load setting and flake size. Comparing analytical and empirical models for bale density as a function of the <b>pressure</b> on the <b>plunger</b> showed that the trend of variation of density with pressure in both models was similar, but the rate of change was different. The variation rate of density with pressure in the analytical model was higher than that of the empirical model. The analytical model underestimated the bale density at low <b>plunger</b> <b>pressures</b> but showed more accurate prediction at higher pressures, while the empirical model accurately predicted the bale density at both low and high pressures. Some crop properties such as coefficient of friction and modulus of elasticity were determined for the development of the pressure distribution model. Results showed that static coefficient of friction of alfalfa on a polished steel surface was a quadratic function of material moisture content, while the relationship between the coefficient of friction of barley straw on a polished steel surface and material moisture content was best expressed by a linear equation. Results of this study also proved that modulus of elasticity of alfalfa and barley straw was constant for the density range encountered in the large square baler...|$|R
