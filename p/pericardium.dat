5|$|The heart wall {{is made up}} {{of three}} layers: the inner endocardium, middle {{myocardium}} and outer epicardium. These are surrounded by a double-membraned sac called the <b>pericardium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the <b>pericardium</b> which {{surrounds}} the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the <b>pericardium</b> this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the heart}} varies among the {{different}} animal groups, with hearts in vertebrates ranging {{from those of the}} smallest mice (12mg) to the blue whale (600kg). In vertebrates, the heart lies {{in the middle of the}} ventral part of the body, surrounded by a <b>pericardium.</b> which in some fish may be connected to the peritoneum.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when the chest is suddenly decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in the chest cavity but their movement is more restricted near the hilum. Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are fixed to the thyroid cartilage and the <b>pericardium</b> respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the <b>pericardium,</b> which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the <b>pericardium,</b> and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, <b>pericardium,</b> and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse {{to form a}} primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between {{the third and fourth}} week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the <b>pericardium.</b> This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further development will include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|E
5|$|Many {{details about}} the anatomy of Lobatus gigas were not well known until Colin Little's 1965 general study. In 2005, R. L. Simone gave a {{detailed}} anatomical description. L.gigas has a long extensible snout with two eyestalks (also known as ommatophores) that originate from its base. The tip of each eyestalk contains a large, well-developed lensed eye, with a black pupil and a yellow iris and a small slightly posterior sensory tentacle. Amputated eyes completely regenerate. Inside {{the mouth of the}} animal is a radula (a tough ribbon covered in rows of microscopic teeth) of the taenioglossan type. Both the snout and the eyestalks show dark spotting in the exposed areas. The mantle is darkly coloured in the anterior region, fading to light gray at the posterior end, while the mantle collar is commonly orange. The siphon is also orange or yellow. When the soft parts of the animal are removed from the shell, several organs are distinguishable externally, including the kidney, the nephiridial gland, the <b>pericardium,</b> the genital glands, stomach, style sac and the digestive gland. In adult males, the penis is also visible.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the <b>pericardium</b> and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E
25|$|Congenital diaphragmatic hernia* is {{uncommon}} in dogs. Most diaphragmatic hernias {{are caused by}} trauma. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are usually communications between the peritoneum and <b>pericardium.</b> They are often incidental findings.|$|E
25|$|TCM Information: Species: Salvia miltiorrhiza. Pinyin: Dan Shen. Common Name: Salvia Root. Qualities: Bitter, Cool. Meridians: Heart, <b>Pericardium,</b> Liver. Actions: Invigorate blood, tonify blood, {{regulate}} menstruation, clear {{heat and}} soothe irritability.|$|E
25|$|The heart {{derives from}} {{embryonic}} mesodermal germ-layer cells that differentiate after gastrulation into mesothelium, endothelium, and myocardium. Mesothelial <b>pericardium</b> forms the outer {{lining of the}} heart. The inner lining of the heart, lymphatic and blood vessels, develop from endothelium.|$|E
25|$|The sternum is {{composed}} of highly vascular tissue, covered by {{a thin layer of}} compact bone which is thickest in the manubrium between the articular facets for the clavicles. The inferior sternopericardial ligament attaches the <b>pericardium</b> to the posterior xiphoid process.|$|E
25|$|TCM Information: Species: Bupleurnum chinense. Pinyin: Chai Hu. Common Name: Hare's Ear Root. Quality: Bitter, Pungent(Acrid), Cool. Meridians: Gallbladder, Liver, <b>Pericardium,</b> San Jiao. Actions: Treats {{alternating}} chills and fever, clears lesser yang disorders, relieves liver qi stagnation, raises yang qi {{to treat}} prolapse, treats certain menstrual disorders.|$|E
25|$|Harley died {{suddenly}} from rupture of a coronary artery and haemorrhage into the <b>pericardium</b> on 27 October 1896 at his house, 77 (now 25) Harley Street. His body was cremated at Woking on 30 October, and the remains buried at Kingsbury Old Church {{on the same}} day.|$|E
25|$|The zàng-fǔ {{are also}} {{connected}} to the twelve standard meridians–each yang meridian {{is attached to a}} fǔ organ, and five of the yin meridians are attached to a zàng. As there are only five zàng but six yin meridians, the sixth is assigned to the <b>Pericardium,</b> a peculiar entity almost similar to the Heart zàng.|$|E
25|$|Less common {{symptoms}} {{that may be}} seen in the setting of aortic dissection include congestive heart failure (7%), fainting (9%), stroke (6%), ischemic peripheral neuropathy, paraplegia, and cardiac arrest. If the individual had a fainting episode, about half the time it is due to bleeding into the <b>pericardium</b> leading to pericardial tamponade.|$|E
25|$|The {{myocardium}} thickens and secretes a {{thick layer}} of rich extracellular matrix containing hyaluronic acid which separates the endothelium. Then mesothelial cells form the <b>pericardium</b> and migrate to form most of the epicardium. Then the heart tube is formed by the endocardium, which is the inner endothelial lining of the heart, and the myocardial muscle wall which is the epicardium that covers the outside of the tube.|$|E
25|$|Surgical techniques, using a tube or {{catheter}} {{to drain}} fluid from the peritoneum, chest, or the <b>pericardium</b> around the heart, often {{are used in}} cases of severe blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen, especially {{when a person is}} experiencing early signs of shock. In those with low blood-pressure, likely because of bleeding in the abdominal cavity, cutting through the abdominal wall surgically is indicated.|$|E
25|$|The cephalic tentacles are pale, {{except for}} black eyespots. Snout is brown, distal lips are pale and foot is pale. Pallial roof has black pigment bands along edges of ctenidium and dorsal edge of genital duct; visceral coil pale except for black pigment on testis. Ctenidium is {{positioned}} {{a little in}} front of <b>pericardium.</b> There are 24-25 ctenidial filaments, that are broadly triangular with lateral surfaces ridged. Osphradium is narrow, positioned slightly posterior to middle of ctenidium.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart is}} located in the abdomen a short {{distance}} within the middle line of the dorsal body-wall, and above the intestine. Unlike in insects, the heart is not divided into chambers, but consists of a simple tube. The aorta, which supplies haemolymph to the cephalothorax, extends from the anterior end of the heart. Smaller arteries extend from sides and posterior end of the heart. A thin-walled sac, known as the <b>pericardium,</b> completely surrounds the heart.|$|E
25|$|In dogs, {{the most}} common symptom of {{coccidioidomycosis}} is a chronic cough, which can be dry or moist. Other symptoms include fever (in approximately 50% of cases), weight loss, anorexia, lethargy, and depression. The disease can disseminate throughout the dog's body, most commonly causing osteomyelitis (infection of the bone marrow), which leads to lameness. Dissemination can cause other symptoms, depending on which organs are infected. If the fungus infects the heart or <b>pericardium,</b> it can cause heart failure and death.|$|E
25|$|The Ex-Maze is a {{minimally}} invasive procedure, first reported in 2007, that also creates a lesion pattern across both atria epicardially on the beating heart. As with other procedures off-bypass, the surgeon can confirm that AF corrects to normal sinus rhythm during the procedure. Laparoscopic instruments {{are used to}} access the <b>pericardium</b> through the diaphragm. Like many heart-cauterizing instruments, the Ex-Maze device uses heat generated by a radiofrequency coil. The coil is inside a plastic tube that uses suction to maintain contact against the beating heart’s surface.|$|E
25|$|Russell Brain {{comments}} that while Head was a physician by profession, {{he was a}} born teacher. Appointed medical registrar to the London Hospital in 1896 and elected assistant physician four years later, there is a verbatim report {{of one of his}} rounds in 1900. On this day he showed the young men a patient with mitral stenosis, adherent <b>pericardium</b> and heart failure. Almost twenty years later, one of these young men (a Dr. Donald Hunter) recorded him as teaching on the difference between bronchial and cardiac asthma.|$|E
25|$|A serous {{membrane}} (also {{referred to as}} a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The {{serous membrane}}s have two layers; parietal and visceral, surrounding a fluid filled space. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ (the viscera), and the parietal layer lines the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a cavity wall). Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity. For example, the <b>pericardium</b> is the serous cavity which surrounds the heart.|$|E
25|$|Pericardial effusion* is a {{collection}} of fluid in the <b>pericardium.</b> It is usually serosanguinous (bloody fluid). Serosanguinous accumulation can be caused by cancer, usually hemangiosarcoma or a heart base tumor, idiopathic pericarditis. Rare causes include trauma, clotting disorders, and left atrial rupture. Serous accumulation is rare and caused by heart failure, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernias, uremia, pericardial cysts, or hypoalbuminemia. Rarely pericardial effusion can be caused by infection and consist of pus. An echocardiogram should be done prior to draining the fluid, if possible, to identify the cause (e.g., tumor). Drainage of the fluid (pericardiocentesis) relieves the clinical signs and, in the case of idiopathic pericarditis, can be curative.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue with}} tissue culture is {{introducing}} the proper factors or stimuli required to induce functionality. In many cases, simple maintenance {{culture is not}} sufficient. Growth factors, hormones, specific metabolites or nutrients, chemical and physical stimuli are sometimes required. For example, certain cells respond to changes in oxygen tension {{as part of their}} normal development, such as chondrocytes, which must adapt to low oxygen conditions or hypoxia during skeletal development. Others, such as endothelial cells, respond to shear stress from fluid flow, which is encountered in blood vessels. Mechanical stimuli, such as pressure pulses seem to be beneficial to all kind of cardiovascular tissue such as heart valves, blood vessels or <b>pericardium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mailer {{married his}} second wife, Adele Morales, in 1954. She was a painter, {{well known in}} New York City. They had two daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. Mailer stabbed her twice with a {{penknife}} during a party, puncturing her <b>pericardium</b> which needed emergency surgery. His wife would not press charges and he later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of assault for a suspended sentence. Morales recovered and in 1997 published a memoir of their marriage entitled The Last Party, which recounted her husband stabbing her at a party and the aftermath. This incident has been {{a focal point for}} feminist critics of Mailer, who point to themes of sexual violence in his work.|$|E
25|$|The manubrium joins {{with the}} body of the sternum, the clavicles and the cartilages of the first pair of ribs. The {{inferior}} border, oval and rough, is covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation {{with the body}}. The lateral borders are each marked above by a depression for the first costal cartilage, and below by a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the upper angle of the body, forms a notch for the reception of the costal cartilage of the second rib. Between the depression for the first costal cartilage and the demi-facet for the second is a narrow, curved edge, which slopes from above downward towards the middle. Also, the superior sternopericardial ligament attaches the <b>pericardium</b> to the posterior side of the manubrium.|$|E
25|$|Most {{dissection}} {{involves the}} careful isolation and removal of individual organs, called the Virchow technique. An alternative more cumbersome technique involves {{the removal of}} the entire organ body, called the Letulle technique. This technique allows a body to be sent to a funeral director without waiting for the sometimes time-consuming dissection of individual organs. The Rokitansky method involves an in situ dissection of the organ block, and the technique of Ghon involves dissection of three separate blocks of organs - the thorax and cervical areas, gastrointestinal and abdominal organs, and urogenital organs. Dissection of individual organs involves accessing the area in which the organ is situated, and systematically removing the anatomical connections of that organ to its surroundings. For example, when removing the heart, connects such as the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava are separated. If pathological connections exist, such as a fibrous <b>pericardium,</b> then this may be deliberately dissected along with the organ.|$|E
25|$|In an aortic dissection, blood penetrates the intima {{and enters}} the media layer. The high {{pressure}} rips the tissue of the media apart along the laminated plane splitting the inner two-thirds and the outer one-third of the media apart. This can propagate {{along the length of}} the aorta for a variable distance forward or backwards. Dissections that propagate towards the iliac bifurcation (with the flow of blood) are called anterograde dissections and those that propagate towards the aortic root (opposite of the flow of blood) are called retrograde dissections. The initial tear is usually within 100mm of the aortic valve, so a retrograde dissection can easily compromise the <b>pericardium</b> leading to a hemopericardium. Anterograde dissections may propagate all the way to the iliac bifurcation of the aorta, rupture the aortic wall, or recanalize into the intravascular lumen leading to a double-barrel aorta. The double-barrel aorta relieves the pressure of blood flow and reduces the risk of rupture. Rupture leads to hemorrhaging into a body cavity, and prognosis depends on the area of rupture. Retroperitoneal and pericardial ruptures are both possible.|$|E
25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine <b>pericardium),</b> homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|E
500|$|The <b>pericardium</b> {{surrounds}} the heart. It {{consists of two}} membranes: an inner serous membrane called the epicardium, and an outer fibrous membrane. [...] Blood vessels and nerves reach the cardiac muscle from the epicardium. These help influence the heart rate. These enclose the pericardial cavity which contains the [...] pericardial fluid that lubricates {{the surface of the}} heart.|$|E
500|$|The {{human heart}} is {{situated}} in the middle mediastinum, {{at the level of}} thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the <b>pericardium</b> surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The back surface of the heart lies near the vertebral column, and the front surface sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. The upper part of the heart is the attachment point for several large blood vessels – the venae cavae, [...] aorta and pulmonary trunk. The upper part of the heart is located {{at the level of the}} third costal cartilage. The lower tip of the heart, the apex, lies to the left of the sternum (8 to 9cm from the midsternal line) between the junction of the fourth and fifth ribs near their articulation with the costal cartilages.|$|E
500|$|Except as larvae, coconut crabs cannot swim, {{and they}} will drown if left in water {{for more than an}} hour. They use a special organ called a branchiostegal lung to breathe. This organ can be {{interpreted}} as a developmental stage between gills and lungs, {{and is one of the}} most significant adaptations of the coconut crab to its habitat. The branchiostegal lung contains a tissue similar to that found in gills, but suited to the absorption of oxygen from air, rather than water. This organ is expanded laterally and is [...] to increase the surface area; located in the cephalothorax, it is optimally placed to reduce both the blood/gas diffusion distance and the return distance of oxygenated blood to the <b>pericardium.</b> Coconut crabs use their hindmost, smallest pair of legs to clean these breathing organs and to moisten them with water. The organs require water to properly function, and the coconut crab provides this by stroking its wet legs over the spongy tissues nearby. Coconut crabs may drink water from small puddles by transferring it from their chelipeds to their maxillipeds.|$|E
