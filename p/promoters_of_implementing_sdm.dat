40|$|The {{concepts}} of spatial-division multiplexing (SDM) technology were first {{proposed in the}} telecommunications industry as an indispensable solution to reduce the cost-per-bit of optical fiber transmission. Recently, such spatial channels and modes have been applied in optical sensing applications where the returned echo is analyzed for the collection of essential environmental information. The key advantages <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>SDM</b> techniques in optical measurement systems include the multi-parameter discriminative capability and accuracy improvement. In this paper, to help readers without a telecommunication background better understand how the SDM-based sensing systems can be incorporated, the crucial components of SDM techniques, such as laser beam shaping, mode generation and conversion, multimode or multicore elements using special fibers and multiplexers are introduced, along with the recent developments in SDM amplifiers, opto-electronic sources and detection units of sensing systems. The examples of SDM-based sensing systems not only include Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry or Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDR/BOTDA) using few-mode fibers (FMF) and the multicore fiber (MCF) based integrated fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, but also involve the widely used components with their whole information used in the full multimode constructions, such as the whispering gallery modes for fiber profiling and chemical species measurements, the screw/twisted modes for examining water quality, {{as well as the}} optical beam shaping to improve cantilever deflection measurements. Besides, the various applications of SDM sensors, the cost efficiency issue, as well as how these complex mode multiplexing techniques might improve the standard fiber-optic sensor approaches using single-mode fibers (SMF) and photonic crystal fibers (PCF) have also been summarized. Finally, we conclude with a prospective outlook for the opportunities and challenges of SDM technologies in optical sensing industry...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{majority}} of patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer {{are in a position}} to choose between having a mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation therapy (breast-conserving therapy). Since the long-term survival rates for mastectomy and for lumpectomy with radiation therapy are comparable, patients' informed preferences are important for decision-making. Although most clinicians believe that they do include patients in the decision-making process, the information that women with breast cancer receive regarding the surgical options is often rather subjective, and does not invite patients to express their preferences. Shared decision-making (SDM) is meant to help patients clarify their preferences, resulting in greater satisfaction with their final choice. Patient decision aids can be very supportive in SDM. We present the protocol of a study to beta test a patient decision aid and optimise strategies for the implementation of SDM regarding the treatment of early-stage breast cancer in the actual clinical setting. METHODS/DESIGN: This paper concerns a pre-implementation and post-implementation study, lasting from October 2014 to June 2015. The intervention consists <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>SDM</b> using a patient decision aid. The intervention will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative measures, acquired prior to, during and after the implementation of SDM. Outcome measures are knowledge about treatment, perceived SDM and decisional conflict. We will also conduct face-to-face interviews with a sample of these patients and their care providers, to assess their experiences with the implementation of SDM and the patient decision aid. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC) ethics committee. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at national conferences. Findings will be used to finalise a multi-faceted implementation strategy to test the implementation of SDM and a patient decision aid in terms of cost-effectiveness, in a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT).

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Computer Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The {{need for}} {{information}} systems has increased {{to a point where}} virtually all business environments require some sort of software to aid in its daily operations. This study will address the need for quality information systems by examining techniques which can potentially aid in producing consistent high-quality information systems. Two techniques in particular, namely Process Maturity Models (PMMs) and Systems Development Methodologies (SDMs) are examined. Process Maturity Models such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) as well as the ISO- 9000 standards aid in standardising and improving an organisation’s information systems development processes. These Process Maturity Models often require either the use of certain Systems Development Methodologies {{or at the very least}} techniques used within some Systems Development Methodologies. Systems Development Methodologies refer to a set of development processes, tools, techniques etc. which can be used during software development to standardise the entire development process by offering the use of modelling techniques, tools to analyse requirements, illustration of processes etc. These techniques differ from one Systems Development Methodology to the next. This study aims to identify the relationship between Process Maturity Models and Systems Development Methodologies. During the research process a questionnaire was sent out to people within the information technology business environment. The questionnaire contained questions used to determine and measure the usage of Systems Development Methodologies and how projects were affected. The questionnaire was also used to do an informal assessment of each respondent’s Capability Maturity Model level. Furthermore the data retrieved was statistically analysed and the results were interpreted. The results indicate that a relationship exists between the use of SDMs and the success of the respondent’s development processes and developed products. A total of 73 % of respondents indicated that they do use SDMs to some extent, the most common being the Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The majority <b>of</b> organizations <b>implementing</b> <b>SDMs</b> have been doing so for three years or more. Results also show that most of the respondents are not certified in some formal Process Maturity Model; however, they do <b>implement</b> some <b>of</b> the processes required by models such as the CMMI. An informal assessment performed indicated that 65 % of respondents can be grouped into a perceived CMMI level 2 category. Project outcome was measured and the relationship between PMM implementation as well as SDM use was measured. Results show no statistical evidence which indicates that an organisation’s perceived CMMI level is influenced by SDM use, both vertically and horizontally. Results do, however, indicate that organizations which have been <b>implementing</b> <b>SDMs</b> for a longer period of time are more likely to apply CMMI level 4 activities. Results also indicate that the horizontal use (number <b>of</b> projects/people which <b>implement</b> <b>SDM</b> knowledge) <b>of</b> SDMs have a significant effect on the development process- and the developed product success. Lastly the results indicated that organizations which satisfy more of the CMMI’s level 4 activities experience a higher quality development process which leads to a more successful development process.

40|$|Shared {{decision-making}} (SDM) {{is promoted}} as tool for improving quality and responsiveness of care, while lowering overall costs. The underlying idea of SDM is well-conceptualised {{and a wide}} range of experiments in the Netherlands and abroad have been executed {{over the last couple of}} years. However, successful and sustainable implementation remains rather limited. This paper aims to contribute to meaningful implementation by analysing barriers and opportunities for Shared Decision Making and consists of three parts: 1) an overview of key characteristics of SDM, 2) an overview of practical tools for implementation and in what respect these fit key characteristics and goals of SDM, and 3) an analysis of barriers and opportunities. We conducted a literature review to create an overview of key characteristics and practical tools for implementation. Building on this we interviewed 83 professionals as well as patients, and observed 13 applications of SDM tools and 3 moral case deliberations in four departments of a hospital in Amsterdam: neurology, psychiatry, emergency obstetrics and oncology. We payed extra attention to intercultural differences and competences needed by professionals for applying SDM. Results show, first, that all existing definitions of SDM focus on a process in which the physician and patient go through multiple phases of decision-making together in which they share preferences and reach an agreement on treatment. SDM holds the middle ground between a paternalistic and an informed decision making model, overcoming informational asymmetry between the physician and patients. Second, from often used implementation strategies, like option grids, training of professionals, an individual care plan and e-health programs, the individual care plan meets relevant criteria for the SDM process best: information sharing, check of understanding, discussion of pros and cons, mutual agreement and a reflection meeting. Third, all patients and professionals are supportive of the idea <b>of</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>SDM,</b> but have a broad range on perspectives on what SDM is, possible ways of implementation, and its feasibility. In the obstetrics department, for instance, higher educated patients valued SDM higher and most professionals believed <b>SDM</b> was already <b>implemented.</b> The results show how meaningful implementation of SDM can be improved by addressing lack of consensus between professionals on 1) what SMD means in practice, 2) appropriate tools for implementation, and 3) whether proposed benefits might be applicable to specific treatment types. Furthermore, the underlying assumption of SDM is that both professional and patient are able to reflect on their position and integrate each other’s knowledge sources. This requires a set of competences (knowledge, attitude and skills) of both parties involved that can be further supported through 1) including competences for dealing with patient feedback in medical training, and 2) aligning with existing moral case deliberation (MCD) practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mental {{health care}} has lagged behind other health-care domains in {{developing}} and applying shared decision making (SDM) for treatment decisions. This is despite compatibilities with ideals of modern mental health care such as self-management and recovery-oriented practice, and growing policy-level interest. Psychiatric medication is a mainstay of mental health treatment, but there are known problems with prescribing practices, and service users report feeling uninvolved in medication decisions and concerned about adverse effects. SDM has potential to produce better tailoring of psychiatric medication to individuals' needs. Objectives This conceptual review argues that several aspects of mental health care that differ from other health-care contexts (e. g. forms of coercion, questions about service users' insight and disempowerment) may impact on processes and possibilities for SDM. It is therefore problematic to uncritically import models of SDM developed in other health-care contexts. We argue that decision making for psychiatric medication is better understood in a broader way that moves beyond the micro-social focus of a medical consultation. Contextualizing specific medication-related consultations within longer term relationships, and broader service systems enables recognition of the multiple processes, actors and agendas that shape how psychiatric medication is prescribed, managed and used, and which may facilitate or impede SDM. Conclusion A broad conceptualization of decision making for psychiatric medication that moves beyond the micro-social can account for why SDM in this domain remains a rarity. It has both conceptual and practical utility for evaluating research evidence, identifying future research priorities and highlighting fruitful ways <b>of</b> developing and <b>implementing</b> <b>SDM</b> in mental health care...|$|R
2500|$|Mitterrand {{invited the}} Communist Party into his first government, a {{controversial}} move at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, {{rather than taking}} advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Mitterrand followed a radical economic program, including nationalization of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl advanced European integration via the Maastricht Treaty, but he accepted German reunification only reluctantly. During his time in office he was a strong <b>promoter</b> <b>of</b> culture and <b>implemented</b> a range <b>of</b> costly [...] "Grands Projets".

40|$|Abstract Background Sciatica is {{a common}} {{condition}} worldwide that is characterized by radiating leg pain and regularly caused by a herniated disc with nerve root compression. Sciatica patients with persisting leg pain after {{six to eight weeks}} were found to have similar clinical outcomes and associated costs after prolonged conservative treatment or surgery at one year follow-up. Guidelines recommend that the team of professionals involved in sciatica care and patients jointly decide about treatment options, so-called interprofessional shared decision making (SDM). However, there are strong indications that SDM for sciatica patients is not integrated in daily practice. We designed a study aiming to explore the barriers and facilitators associated with the everyday embedding of SDM for sciatica patients. All related relevant professionals and patients are involved to develop a tailored strategy to <b>implement</b> <b>SDM</b> for sciatica patients. Methods The study consists of two phases: identification of barriers and facilitators and development of an implementation strategy. First, barriers and facilitators are explored using semi-structured interviews among eight professionals of each (para) medical discipline involved in sciatica care (general practitioners, physical therapists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and orthopedic surgeons). In addition, three focus groups will be conducted among patients. Second, the identified barriers and facilitators will be ranked using a questionnaire among a representative Dutch sample of 200 GPs, 200 physical therapists, 200 neurologists, all 124 neurosurgeons, 200 orthopedic surgeons, and 100 patients. A tailored team-based implementation strategy will be developed {{based on the results of}} the first phase using the principles of intervention mapping and an expert panel. Discussion Little is known about effective strategies to increase the uptake of SDM. Most implementation strategies only target a single discipline, whereas multiple disciplines are involved in SDM among sciatica patients. The results of this study can be used as an example for <b>implementing</b> <b>SDM</b> in other patient groups receiving multidisciplinary complex care (e. g., elderly) and can be generalized to other countries with similar context, thereby contributing to a worldwide increase of SDM in preference sensitive choices. </p...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increasingly}} complex array of interventions facing healthcare professionals and patients, {{coupled with a}} potentially diverse number of professionals operating within the primary care team, the adoption of shared decision making (SDM) - with or without patients' decision aids - in an interprofessional manner is essential to ensure the highest quality of care for patients. In this article, we propose a framework for interprofessional education about SDM targeted to primary care settings. Five areas {{of knowledge and skills}} were agreed to be essential for all relevant stakeholders for interprofessional education in SDM to be successful: understanding the concept of SDM; acquiring relevant communication skills to facilitate SDM; understanding interprofessional sensitivities; understanding the roles of different professions within the relevant primary care group; and acquiring relevant skills to <b>implement</b> <b>SDM.</b> We suggest a series of teaching methods for the aforementioned areas, using principles from adult learning...|$|R

40|$|In {{this first}} of three papers we examine the use of niche {{concepts}} in ecology and especially in species distribution modelling (SDM). This paper deliberately focuses {{on the lack of}} clarity found in the term niche. Because its meanings are so diverse, the term niche tends to create confusion and requires constant qualification. The literature houses many idiosyncratic ideas of what the niche is, but few examples where niche is more explanatory than the terminologies of population and community ecology or the statistical methods used to <b>implement</b> <b>SDM</b> analyses. In many cases the original (and inspirational) concepts are not directly applicable to our modern applications (e. g. set theory). There are some conceptual limitations found in individual definitions of niche (e. g. the fundamental niche concept), so it is perhaps understandable why more neutral terminology is becoming popular in SDM. An examination of the literature reveals a wide range of uncritical use of niche terminology. Our findings in this paper do not necessarily support the position of niche as a universally useful concept...|$|R
