40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed {{to determine the effects}} of inner-ring speed and <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> on roller bearing fatigue life. The effects of the resultant hoop and radial stresses on the principal stresses were considered. The maximum shear stresses below the Hertzian contact were determined for different conditions of inner-ring speed and load, and were applied to a conventional roller bearing life analysis. The effect of mean stress was determined using Goodman diagram approach. Hoop stresses caused by <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> and centrifugal force can reduce bearing life by as much as 90 percent. Use of a Goodman diagram predicts life reduction of 20 to 30 percent. The depth of the maximum shear stress remains virtually unchanged...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Even though {{electronic}} devices are {{a reality in}} the aerospace industry, mechani-cal issues involving assembly through mechanical <b>fit,</b> more precisely <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> of bushings in primary structures and movable structures still demand attention in some aspects. Histori-cally, this subject was demonstrated to affect all aircraft manufacturers during aircraft design, assembly and their operation. Also, existing methods in the literature are not capable of accu-rately predicting {{the interaction between the}} parts due to the combined behavior of differences in stiffness and the asymmetry of applied loads. This paper demonstrates a numerical method-ology for evaluating <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> through a contact finite element model and takes into account considerations about materials compatibility, surface treatment and load asymmetries. Also a final solution considering dimensioning aspects and a comparison between the analytical and the numerical methodology are presented...|$|R

40|$|Press-fitted railway axles and {{wheels are}} {{subjected}} to fretting fatigue loading with a potential hazard of crack initiation in <b>press</b> <b>fits.</b> Typically, the resistance against crack initiation and propagation in <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> is investigated in full-scale tests, which procedure is both costly and time consuming. In this context, combined experimental and numerical approaches are of increasing practical importance, as these may reduce the experimental effort and, moreover, {{provide a basis for}} the transferability of experimental results to different axle geometries and materials. This study aims at evaluating stress-strain conditions under which fretting fatigue crack initiation is likely to occur. Experiments on small-scale specimens under varying fretting fatigue load parameters and their finite-element modelling to characterize the resulting stress-strain fields are performed. Subsequently, different multiaxial fatigue parameters are applied to predict crack initiation under fretting fatigue conditions...|$|R

50|$|Interference Fits, {{also known}} as <b>Press</b> <b>Fits</b> or Friction Fits, are {{fastenings}} between two parts in which the inner component {{is larger than the}} outer component.

40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to propose a {{frictional}} damper so as to enhance structural damping leading to the chatter suppression in the slender endmill tool. The proposed damper is composed of a core <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> inside a multi-fingered hollow cylinder. Core and cylinder both are <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> into an axial hole inside the tool. First, an analytical model is developed for the damper. Then, a parameter study is conducted to find optimum parameters of the damper for the increase of the stability limit as much as possible. In order to validate the analytical model, a nonlinear finite element model of the damped milling tool is simulated using ANSYS software package. Having finite element model, the stability lobe diagrams for simple tool and optimally damped tool are extracted from frequency response functions. Modal test is applied to a real specimen of damped tool in order to validate finite element results. Good agreement between experiments and modeling is obtained...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} fatigue crack growth investigations on a hollow railway axle which were undertaken as a joint research project between the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and the GKSS Research Centre Geesthacht, Germany, within an activity of ESIS-TC 24 (Technical Committee on the Integrity of Railway Structures). Since no analytical stress intensity factor (SIF) solutions for semi-elliptical surface cracks in the S-transitions of railway axles were available, {{the first step in}} the research was to generate them for both reverse and rotary bending. The results were then used to investigate both the effects of rotary bending, and, of the <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> at the wheel and gear, on the fatigue crack growth and residual lifetime so as to provide essential input information for setting up inspection intervals. It was found that the effect of rotary bending, although existent, was rather moderate whereas the <b>press</b> <b>fits</b> had a large and detrimental effect...|$|R

50|$|In {{most modern}} Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems, the motor housing {{is a part}} of the rack casting which is usually made from {{lightweight}} materials, such as aluminum alloys. The stators are traditionally <b>press</b> <b>fitted</b> into the housing. Tolerance rings can be used instead of press fitting. With their wavelike protrusions, tolerance rings generate a retention force when compressed between the housing and the stator. These protrusions act as springs and allow the mating components to expand and contract at different rates while still providing the required retention force.|$|R

50|$|Most {{trailers}} have {{a separate}} axle for each wheel, like those used on a bicycle. These separate axles usually mount directly on the frame using either threaded nuts, a quick-release mechanism, or some <b>press</b> <b>fit</b> arrangement.

The amount of force applied in hydraulic presses may be anything from a few pounds for the tiniest parts to hundreds of tons for the largest parts.|$|E
