25|$|The tuna {{are caught}} by the {{following}} methods: <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line,</b> handline and longline. The <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> method is most commonly used, and results in 90 percent (2002) of the total fish catch. This traditional use of the <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> method in the Maldivian tuna industry {{has contributed to the}} sustainability of the tuna resources. With recent further improvements in fishing gear and methods, it appears that the catch levels may be close to the maximum sustainable yield.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{even more}} {{extensive}} and sustainable coastal resource is forage fish, such as anchovies and herring. This fishery {{is an integral part}} of the <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> tuna fishery, since tuna feed on the forage fish. Future development of the traditional <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> tuna fishery depends on the availability of this bait fishery. Catch rate for forage fish have increased greatly in recent years, but there is not enough data to really know what the current status of the forage fish stocks are.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 {{there were}} 1,674 vessels, of which {{motorised}} vessels for coastal <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> tuna fishing accounted for 1,407 vessels. Of the remainder, 5 were sailing dhoni (masdhoni), 48 were mechanised dhoni (vadhudhoni), 209 were vadhudhoni with sails, and 5 were rowing boats used to troll reef waters.|$|E

25|$|Tuna in {{particular}} are of major importance to commercial fisheries. Though tuna migrate across oceans, trying to find them {{there is not the}} usual approach. Tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant, along the boundaries of currents, around islands, near seamounts, and in some areas of upwelling along continental slopes. Tuna are captured by several methods: purse seine vessels enclose an entire surface school with special nets, <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> vessels which use poles baited with other smaller pelagic fish as baitfish, and rafts called fish aggregating devices are set up, because tuna, as well as some other pelagic fish, tend to congregate under floating objects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> vessels – {{are used}} mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E

60|$|Presently, however, Rollo {{came to a}} boy who was {{fishing on}} the bank of the stream, and he asked him if he would be good enough to hook in one of those lilies for him with his <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line.</b> The boy was very willing to do it. He threw a loop of his line over one of the pond lilies, and drew it in. Rollo thanked the boy for his kindness, and gave the pond lily to his mother.|$|E

I was only too glad to know you were all safe. I got up early in the morning, and went down to watch for you. You must have been surprised to see me fishing, but I had nothing else to do, and so I hired a <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> of a boy. It helped very much to pass the time away." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, we started, and Jone {{sat in the}} front, {{with his}} back to me, and the long-legged gilly rowed like a good fellow. When we got to a good place to fish he stopped, and took a fishing-rod that was in pieces and screwed them together, and fixed the line all right so that it would run along the rod to a little wheel near the handle, and then he put on a couple of hooks with {{artificial}} flies on them, which was so small I couldn't imagine how the fish could see them. While he was doing all this I got a little fidgety, because I had never fished except with a straight <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> with a cork to it, which would bob when the fish bit; but this was altogether a different sort of a thing. When it was all ready he handed me the pole, and then sat down very polite to look at me.|$|E
