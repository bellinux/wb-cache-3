40|$|Conformal {{crystals}} are non-uniform structures {{created by}} a conformal transformation of regular two-dimensional lattices. We show that gradient-driven vortices interacting with a conformal pinning array exhibit substantially stronger pinning effects over a much larger range of field than found for random or periodic <b>pinning</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The <b>pinning</b> enhancement is partially due to matching of the critical flux gradient with the pinning gradient, but {{the preservation of the}} sixfold ordering in the conformally transformed hexagonal lattice plays a crucial role.

40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulations, we {{demonstrate that}} superconductors containing periodic pinning arrays {{which have been}} diluted through random removal of {{a fraction of the}} pins have pronounced commensurability effects at the same magnetic field strength as undiluted pinning arrays. The commensuration can occur at fields significantly higher than the matching field, produces much greater critical current enhancement than a random <b>pinning</b> <b>arrangement</b> due to suppresion of vortex channeling, and persists for arrays with up to 90 % dilution. These results suggest that diluted periodic pinning arrays may be a promising geometry to increase the critical current in superconductors over a wide magnetic field range.

40|$|Abstract Hydrodynamics in microcavities with cylindri-cal micropin fin arrays {{simulating}} {{a single}} layer of a water-cooled electronic chip stack is investigated experimentally. Both inline and staggered <b>pin</b> <b>arrangements</b> are investigated using pressure drop and microparticle image velocimetry (lPIV) measurements. The pressure drop across the cavity shows a flow transition at pin diameter–based Reynolds numbers (Red) * 200. Instantaneous lPIV, performed using a pH-controlled high seeding density of tracer microspheres, helps visualize vortex structure unreported till date in microscale geometries. The post-transition flow field shows vortex shedding and flow impingement onto the pins explaining the pressure drop increase. The flow fluctuations start at the chip outlet and shift upstream with increasing Red. No fluctuations are observed for a cavity with pin height-to-diameter ratio h/d = 1 up to Red * 330; however, its pres-sure drop was higher than for a cavity with h/d = 2 due to pronounced influence of cavity walls. ...|$|R
50|$|The current {{feedback}} operational amplifier (CFOA or CFA) {{is a type}} of electronic amplifier whose inverting input is sensitive to current, rather than to voltage as in a conventional voltage-feedback operational amplifier (VFA). The CFA was invented by David Nelson at Comlinear Corporation, and first sold in 1982 as a hybrid amplifier, the CLC103. An early patent covering a CFA is , David Nelson and Kenneth Saller (filed in 1983). The integrated circuit CFAs were introduced in 1987 by both Comlinear and Elantec (designer Bill Gross). They are usually produced with the same <b>pin</b> <b>arrangements</b> as VFAs, allowing the two types to be interchanged without rewiring when the circuit design allows. In simple configurations, such as linear amplifiers, a CFA can be used in place of a VFA with no circuit modifications, but in other cases, such as integrators, a different circuit design is required. The classic four-resistor differential amplifier configuration also works with a CFA, but the common-mode rejection ratio is poorer than that from a VFA.|$|R
40|$|The highly {{nonlinear}} many-body {{physics of}} a chain of mutually interacting atoms in contact with a periodic substrate gives rise to complex static and dynamical phenomena, such as structural phase transitions and friction. In the limit of an infinite chain incommensurate with the substrate, Aubry predicted a structural transition with increasing substrate potential, from the chain's intrinsic arrangement free to slide on the substrate, to a <b>pinned</b> <b>arrangement</b> favoring the substrate pattern. To date, the Aubry transition has not been observed. Here, using a chain of cold ions subject to a periodic optical potential we qualitatively and quantitatively establish a close relation between Aubry's sliding-to-pinned transition and superlubricity breaking in stick-slip friction. Using friction measurements with high spatial resolution and individual ion detection, we experimentally observe the Aubry transition and the onset of its hallmark fractal atomic arrangement. Notably, the observed critical lattice depth for a finite chain agrees well with the Aubry prediction for an infinite chain. Our results elucidate the connection between competing ordering patterns and superlubricity in nanocontacts - the elementary building blocks of friction. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Each pattern is keyed {{in such a way that}} a plug with one pattern cannot be mated with any socket of another pattern.

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} magnetization, pinning, ordering, {{and dynamics}} of vortices interacting with <b>pinning</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{which have a}} density gradient. We focus on conformal crystal structures obtained by conformally transforming a spatially uniform periodic array, as well as non-conformal gradient structures and structures with quasiperiodic order. The conformal structures feature a density gradient and local ordering. Using magnetization simulations we find that conformal pinning arrays exhibit enhanced pinning compared to non-conformal gradient arrays as well as compared to random, periodic, and quasiperiodic arrays, for {{a broad range of}} fields. The effectiveness of conformal arrays arises from the continuum of length scales introduced into the arrays by the conformal transformation, allowing for a broad range of local commensuration effects. At higher vortex fillings above the range of conformal effectiveness, we show that a non-conformal rectangular gradient array exhibits strong pinning due to a novel commensuration effect and vortex ordering. Using transport simulations where vortices are driven along the gradient and at an angle to the gradient, we confirm the effectiveness of conformal pinning at increasing the critical current. For a rotated drive, the gradient arrays produce a strong vortex guidance effect in the direction perpendicular to the gradient. Comment: 17 pages, 19 postscript figure...|$|R
40|$|Disordered hyperuniformity is a {{state of}} matter which has {{isotropic}} liquid like properties while simultaneously having crystalline like properties such as little variation in the density fluctuations over long distances. Such states arise for the packing of photoreceptor cells in chicken eyes, jammed particle assemblies, and in nonequilibrium systems. An open question is what possible applications could utilize properties of hyperuniformity. One of the major issues for applications of type-II superconductors is how to achieve high critical currents by preventing the motion or depinning of vortices, so there is great interest in understanding which pinning site geometries will lead to the optimal pinning of vortices. Here, using large scale computational simulations, we show that vortices in a type-II superconductor with a hyperuniform <b>pinning</b> <b>arrangement</b> exhibit enhanced <b>pinning</b> compared to an equal number of pinning sites with a purely random arrangement, and that the enhancement is robust over a wide range of parameters. The stronger pinning arises in the hyperuniform arrays due to the suppression of pinning density fluctuations, permitting higher pin occupancy and the reduction of weak links that lead to easy flow channeling. We also show that in general, in amorphous vortex states in the presence of either random or hyperuniform pinning arrays, the vortices themselves exhibit disordered hyperuniformity due to the repulsive nature of the vortex-vortex interactions.

40|$|We examine vortex pinning and {{dynamics}} in thin-film superconductors interacting with square and rectangular pinning arrays for varied vortex densities including densities significantly {{larger than the}} pinning density. For both square and rectangular pinning arrays, the critical depinning force shows maxima at only certain integer matching fields where the vortices can form highly ordered arrays. For rectangular arrays the depinning force and commensurability effects are anisotropic with a much lower depinning threshold for vortex motion in the easy flow directions. We find evidence for a crossover in pinning behavior in rectangular pinning arrays as the field is increased. We also show analytically, and confirm with simulations, that for B = 2 B_ϕ the strongest pinning can be achieved for rectangular <b>pinning</b> <b>arrangements</b> rather than square for one direction of driving force. Under an applied driving force we find a remarkable variety of distinct complex flow phases in both square and rectangular arrays. These flow phases include stable sinusoidal and intricate pinched patterns where vortices from different channels do not mix. As {{a function of the}} driving force certain flow states become unstable and transitions between different phases are observed which coincide with changes in the net vortex velocities. In the rectangular arrays the types of flow depend on the direction of drive. We also show that two general types of plastic flow occur: stable flows, where vortices always flow along the same paths, and unstable or chaotic flows.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a pinned composite material which possesses spatially varying through-thickness thermal conductivity. When a constant temperature distribution is applied to one surface, a range of temperatures can be obtained on the opposing surface. One perceived market for this material is the pharmaceutical drug development process where it is desirable to run many in vitro tests at varying temperatures simultaneously. This led to a multi-pronged iterative design process which consisted of numerical simulation, specimen fabrication, and experimental prototype testing. Numerical simulation identified three <b>pin</b> <b>arrangements</b> of interest: clusters, a 1 D linear gradient, and a 2 D linear gradient of pins. Further simulation focused on a 1 D gradient of pins and specific candidate base and pin materials. Two different manufacturing processes which utilized a special-purpose 3 -axis CNC machine were evaluated. The first batch process inserts pin nails using a commercial pin nailer whereas the second continuous process inserts spooled wire. In experimental tests, prototypes were fabricated using the batch process. For example, a 4 °C change in temperature across the length of the test specimen was achievable. However, agreement between experimental and numerical results was imperfect. The thermal response of the prototypes was generally consistent with expectations except that the top surface was 10 - 15 °C cooler than expected. Follow-up analysis suggested this was due to several effects including probe quenching (approximately 4 °C) and manufacturing process variation (up to 8 °C) amongst other effects. The thesis concludes by identifying a number of desirable modifications in experimental protocol that will address these issue...|$|R

As the design freedom of such panels {{is limited to}} the arrangement density of pins, more compactly arranged pins come to mind.

40|$|Hybrid FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are {{composed}} of general-purpose logic resources with different granularities, together with domain-specific coarse-grained units. This thesis proposes a novel hybrid FPGA architecture with embedded coarse-grained Floating Point Units (FPUs) to improve the floating point capability of FPGAs. Based on the proposed hybrid FPGA architecture, we examine three aspects to optimise the speed and area for domain-specific applications. First, we examine the interface between large coarse-grained embedded blocks (EBs) and fine-grained elements in hybrid FPGAs. The interface includes parameters for varying: (1) aspect ratio of EBs, (2) position of the EBs in the FPGA, (3) I/O <b>pins</b> <b>arrangement</b> of EBs, (4) interconnect flexibility of EBs, and (5) location of additional embedded elements such as memory. Second, we examine the interconnect structure for hybrid FPGAs. We investigate how large and highdensity EBs affect the routing demand for hybrid FPGAs over a set of domain-specific applications. We then propose three routing optimisation methods to meet the additional routing demand introduced by large EBs: (1) identifying the best separation distance between EBs, (2) adding routing switches on EBs to increase routing flexibility, and (3) introducing wider channel width {{near the edge of}} EBs. We study and compare the trade-offs in delay, area and routability of these three optimisation methods. Finally, we employ common subgraph extraction to determine the number of floating point adders/subtractors, multipliers and wordblocks in the FPUs. The wordblocks include registers and can implement fixed point operations. We study the area, speed and utilisation trade-offs of the selected FPU subgraphs in a set of floating point benchmark circuits. We develop an optimised coarse-grained FPU, taking into account both architectural and system-level issues. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-offs between granularities and performance by composing small FPUs into a large FPU. The results of this thesis would help design a domain-specific hybrid FPGA to meet user requirements, by optimising for speed, area or a combination of speed and area.
