50|$|The {{alkali metal}} salts {{decrease}} in stability down the group. Anhydrous lithium hypochlorite is stable at room temperature; however, sodium hypochlorite has not be <b>prepared</b> <b>drier</b> than the pentahydrate (NaOCl·(H2O)5). This is unstable above 0 °C; although the more dilute solutions encountered as household bleach possesses better stability. Potassium hypochlorite (KOCl) is known only in solution.|$|E
40|$|A <b>prepared</b> <b>dry</b> feed {{containing}} bloodworm meat Glycera chirori Izuka and oyster meal Crassostrea rivularis Gould, {{together with}} a natural diet consisting of G. chirori and shelled C. rivularis (1 : 1 ratio) and a mixed diet consisting of the <b>prepared</b> <b>dry</b> feed and the natural diet in equal proportion were evaluated as broodstock diets for female Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei_(Boone). Results showed that shrimp fed the <b>prepared</b> <b>dry</b> feed gave higher maturation ratio and significantly higher hepatosomatic index (HSI) values (P < 0. 05) than those fed the natural diet and the mixed diet. The <b>prepared</b> <b>dry</b> feed and the mixed diet induced higher total spawn numbers and significantly higher average daily spawns per female than the natural diet (P < 0. 05), while the gonadosomatic index (GSI) values and fecundity (eggs per spawn) were not significantly affected by these diets. Results of {{this study showed that}} both the <b>prepared</b> <b>dry</b> feed and the mixed diet outperformed the natural diet to improve the spawning performance of female L. vannamei, and that using G. chirori meal and C. rivularis meal as the main ingredients of the <b>prepared</b> <b>dry</b> feed would be an effective way to promote the broodstock nutrition...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{emulsions}} have distinct {{advantages over}} the other oral dosage forms by improving the bio availability and by reducing the side effects, {{but the number of}} emulsion formulations currently in use are few compared with other oral dosage forms due to lack of physical- chemical and compliance problems. To overcome these problems <b>dry</b> emulsions are <b>prepared.</b> <b>Dry</b> emulsions are <b>prepared</b> by <b>drying</b> liquid o/w emulsions containing a solid carrier in the aqueous phase. The solid carrier provides the dry emulsions with bulk and mass. Dry emulsions are lipid based powder formulations from which an O/W emulsion can be reconstituted in-vivo or in-vitro.
