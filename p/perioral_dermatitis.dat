40|$|Background: Demodex is a genus of mites living {{predominantly}} in mammalian pilosebaceous units. They {{are commonly}} {{detected in the}} skin of face, with increasing numbers in inflammatory lesions. Causation between Demodex mites and inflammatory diseases, such as rosacea, blepharitis, <b>perioral</b> and seborrhoeic <b>dermatitis</b> or chalazion, is controversially discussed. Clinical observations indicate a primary form of human Demodex infection. The aim of this review was to highlight the biological aspects of Demodex infestation and point out directions for the future research. Methods : We conducted a broad review based on the electronic database sources such as MEDLINE, PubMed and Scopus {{with regard to the}} characteristics of the Demodex species, methods of examination and worldwide epidemiology, molecular studies and its role in the complex human ecosystem. Results: Demodex mites are organisms with a worldwide importance as they act in indicating several dermatoses, under certain conditions. However, correlations between Demodex and other parasites or microorganisms occupying one host, as well as interactions between these arachnids and its symbiotic bacteria should be considered. There are few methods of human mites' examination depending on purpose of the study. Nevertheless, paying attention must be needed as polymorphism of Demodex species has been reported. Conclusion: Overall, the present review will focus on different aspects of Demodex mites’ biology and significance of these arachnids in human’s health. </p...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY – Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} reaction or type IV allergic reaction can cause different oral manifestations. They can be localized or diffusely visible on oral mucosa and usually appear 24 - 72 hours after antigen input. The antigens that cause {{this type of}} reaction are mostly external, such as contact allergens (particularly metals) and drugs. It {{has been shown that}} the most common oral manifestations are cheilitis, gingivitis, stomatitis, <b>perioral</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> burning mouth syndrome, lichenoid reaction and orofacial granulomatosis. The most important part of diagnosis is the use of patch testing that indicates contact allergic reaction to an allergen. The results of patch testing have shown that the most common proven allergens are gold, nickel, mercury, palladium, cobalt, acrylate, etc. Although connection between specific clinical manifestations and positive pat-ch test results was not always found, patch testing is necessary to prove contact hypersensitivity. Therefore, in patients with oral symptoms, allergic hypersensitivity to dental components has to be considered...|$|E
40|$|Changes in hematopoietic and lymphoid {{tissues of}} young Swiss mice fed a {{balanced}} semipurified diet containing T- 2 toxin (20 ppm) were examined after one, two, three, four or six weeks. During {{the first three}} weeks of exposure of T- 2 toxin, lymphoid tissues, bone marrow and splenic red pulp became hypoplastic, resulting in anemia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Subsequently, during continued exposure to T- 2 toxin, hematopoietic cells regenerated in bone marrow and splenic red pulp and became hyperplastic by six weeks. Granulopoiesis and thrombopoiesis resumed in advance of erythropoiesis. All lymphoid tissues remained atrophic throughout the six week trial. Mice exposed to T- 2 toxin also developed <b>perioral</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and hyperkeratosis with ulceration of the mucosa of the esophageal region of the stomach. These results indicated that young mice were susceptible to both the irritant and the hematopoietic-suppressive toxic effects of dietary T- 2 toxin. However, supression of hematopoiesis was transient and did not lead to hematopoietic failure.
