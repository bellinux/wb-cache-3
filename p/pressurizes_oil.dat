50|$|The {{original}} prototype weighed 84 kilograms, dived autonomously to {{depths of}} 500 meters, and generated 1.7 watt-hours of energy per dive. SOLO-TREC draws upon the ocean's thermal energy as it alternately encounters warm surface water and colder conditions at depth. Key to its operation are the carefully selected waxy substances known as phase-change {{materials that are}} contained in 10 external tubes, which house enough material to allow net power generation. As the float surfaces and encounters warm temperatures, the material melts and expands; when it dives and enters cooler waters, the material solidifies and contracts. The expansion of the wax <b>pressurizes</b> <b>oil</b> stored inside the float. This oil periodically drives a hydraulic motor that generates electricity and recharges the vehicle's batteries. Energy from the rechargeable batteries powers the float's hydraulic system, which changes the float's volume (and hence buoyancy), allowing it to move vertically.|$|E
40|$|The figure depicts an {{apparatus}} for mechanical testing of nuts. In the original application {{for which the}} apparatus was developed, the nuts are of a frangible type designed for use with pyrotechnic devices in spacecraft applications {{in which there are}} requirements for rapid, one-time separations of structures that are bolted together. The apparatus {{can also be used to}} test nonfrangible nuts engaged without pyrotechnic devices. This apparatus was developed to replace prior testing systems that were extremely heavy and immobile and characterized by long setup times (of the order of an hour for each nut to be tested). This apparatus is mobile, and the setup for each test can now be completed in about five minutes. The apparatus can load a nut under test with a static axial force of as much as 6. 8 x 10 (exp 5) lb (3. 0 MN) and a static moment of as much as 8. 5 x 10 (exp 4) lb in. (9. 6 x 10 (exp 3) N(raised dot) m) for a predetermined amount of time. In the case of a test of a frangible nut, the pyrotechnic devices can be exploded to break the nut while the load is applied, in which case the breakage of the nut relieves the load. The apparatus can be operated remotely for safety during an explosive test. The load-generating portion of the apparatus is driven by low-pressure compressed air; the remainder of the apparatus is driven by 110 -Vac electricity. From its source, the compressed air is fed to the apparatus through a regulator and a manually operated valve. The regulated compressed air is fed to a pneumatically driven hydraulic pump, which <b>pressurizes</b> <b>oil</b> in a hydraulic cylinder, thereby causing a load to be applied via a hydraulic nut (not to be confused with the nut under test). During operation, the hydraulic pressure is correlated with the applied axial load, which is verified by use of a load cell. Prior to operation, one end of a test stud (which could be an ordinary threaded rod or bolt) is installed in the hydraulic nut. The other end of the test stud passes through a bearing plate; a load cell is slid onto that end, and then the nut to be tested is threaded onto that end and tightened until the nut and load cell press gently against the bearing plate...|$|E

With a shaft diameter of 2 in. and a radial clearance of 0, 002 in. the eccentricity is generally not greater than 2 x 10 - 5 in., as inferred from the pressure measurements, for loads exceeding 300 Ib and rotational speeds up to 1200 rev/&.

40|$|DissertationThis {{dissertation}} investigates an oil {{switching system}} to address {{and reduce the}} jitter observed in the breakdown electric field strength of a <b>pressurized,</b> <b>oil</b> dielectric. The experimental work is conducted in two phases, {{the first of which}} examines the effects of oil chemistry on breakdown statistics, and the second of which considers the effects of high-K particle additions to the best-performing fluids. A single-shot high voltage advanced dielectric test stand (HVADTS) was designed and built to test these oils. The HVADTS is capable of applying a 250 kV pulse with a 1 -cos rise-time of 1. 6 us to a <b>pressurized</b> <b>oil</b> dielectric. Numerous oil chemistries were evaluated, including straight-chain hydrocarbons and branched olefins, silicone and ester fluids, alkylbenzene and transformer oil. Following the oil chemistry evaluation, a high-K particle dielectric was added in concentrations up to 5 % (by weight) to the best-performing fluids. Parameters such as particle concentration, gap spacing, electrode surface conditions and ambient fluid pressure are investigated experimentally. The experimental analysis is supported by PIC electrostatic simulations and a suite of diagnostics such as SEM imagery, optical profilometry, water titration, mass-spectrometry, and particle measurements.

50|$|An early form of {{circuit breaker}} was {{described}} by Thomas Edison in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used fuses. Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental short circuits and overloads. A modern miniature circuit breaker {{similar to the ones}} now in use was patented by Brown, Boveri & Cie in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to BBC, was credited as the inventor on DRP (Deutsches Reichspatent) 458392. Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.Interconnection of multiple generator sources into an electrical grid required development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short circuit currents produced by networks.

50|$|For {{high speed}} and high power machines, {{a loss of}} {{lubricant}} can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also in dirty environments the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris that increases friction.

Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex internal combustion engines {{in parts of the}} engine where directly splashed oil cannot reach, such as up into overhead valve assemblies.

40|$|Abstract: A {{small-scale}} scroll expander {{was developed}} and tested. The expander {{was based on a}} compliant scroll compressor having a displacement of ∼ 6. 8 cm 3. A test loop was also developed for determining expander performance parameters. The loop employed a compressor to pressur-ize the working fluid up to 2758 kPa and a heat exchanger to create the expander inlet conditions that would characterize an operating power cycle. The expander was tested with R 134 a as the working fluid. For power output measurements, a dynamometer was used where torque and rotational rate weremeasured. An important feature in adapting a scroll compressor to expander duty was the lubrication of the scroll wraps during operation and the lubrication required by the journal bearings within the expander housing. The approach used in this study was to dissolve a compatible oil into the circulating working fluid to lubricate the wraps, while a pump was employed to deliver <b>pressurized</b> <b>oil</b> to the bearings. The <b>pressurized</b> <b>oil</b> supply was also used to generate a controlled force to the upper stationary scroll wrap through a sealed piston assembly. This force maintained axial contact between the upper and lower scroll wraps during operation. After expansion, the R 134 a vapour passed through an orifice flow meter and then to a liquid-cooled heat exchanger. It then enters a compressor and heat exchanger to complete the flow loop. A series of performance tests were conducted on the expander at various expander rota-tional speeds, inlet and outlet pressures, and scroll sealing pressures. Test results show consistent isentropic efficiencies of over 70 per cent for the expander at its maximum efficiency operating points. The expander performance, however, is a function of speed, pressure ratio, and scroll sealing pressure...|$|R
50|$|Most {{pressurized}} lubrication systems incorporate an overpressure {{relief valve}} to allow oil {{to bypass the}} filter if its flow restriction is excessive, to protect the engine from oil starvation. Filter bypass may occur if the filter is clogged or the oil is thickened by cold weather. The overpressure relief valve is frequently incorporated into the oil filter. Filters mounted such that oil tends to drain from them usually incorporate an anti-drainback valve to hold oil in the filter after the engine (or other lubrication system) is shut down. This is done to avoid a delay in oil pressure buildup once the system is restarted; without an anti-drainback valve, <b>pressurized</b> <b>oil</b> would have to fill the filter before travelling onward to the engine's working parts. This situation can cause premature wear of moving parts due to initial lack of oil.|$|R
