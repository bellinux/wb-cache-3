50|$|An {{inscription}} of the king, {{dated to}} his 14th regnal year, has been found.

50|$|Typically catalogs of tokens are {{organized}} by location, time period and/or type of item. Historically {{the need for}} tokens {{grew out of the}} need for currency. In America some tokens legally circulated alongside or instead of currency up until recently. Hard Times Tokens and Civil War Tokens each were the size of the contemporary cent. Afterwards, value based items, such as Good For (amount of money), Good For one quart of Milk, Good For one beer, Good For one ride… and others were specifically linked to commerce of the store or <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common {{denominations}} that turn up are the 1/- and the 5/- postal notes.

These are regarded by collectors of the postal orders of the Commonwealth of Nations as being worth slightly more than the same item paid within the Orange Free State. It also depends on both the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> and the place of encashment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{language}} {{used in the}} inscriptions is Sanskrit, which {{appears to have been}} the dynasty's official language. Prakrit influence can be noticed in some stray cases. The inscriptions begin with a symbol representing the word siddham (translated as [...] "success" [...] or [...] "hail!"), followed by the word svasti. Next, the records mention the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> the ruling monarch and the land grant order. Finally, the inscription exhorts the future kings to uphold the grant, followed by imprecatory verses (to curse those who dishonour the grant) and benedictory verses (to bless those who honour the grant). The inscriptions end with the date {{and the name of the}} scribe.|$|E

5000|$|... 1992 series {{passports}} had a {{dark blue}} cover and contained 16 pages. All information in the passport is recorded in the Ukrainian language, except for the holder's name, date and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> birth, and <b>issuing</b> authority, which are given both in Ukrainian and Russian, or stamps about person's residence in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or Sevastopol, which could be written only in Russian.|$|R
5000|$|The next known {{king of the}} dynasty is Bhavadatta, whose copper-plate {{inscription}} {{was found}} at Rithpur (also Rithapur or Ridhapur) in Amravati district, Maharashtra. The inscription was engraved by one Boppadeva. It mentions the king's name as [...] "Bhavattavarman", which is probably a mistake or a Prakrit form of the Sanskrit name [...] "Bhavadattavarman". It names Arthapati as the king's aryaka, which is variously interpreted to mean [...] "father" [...] or [...] "grandfather"; according to another interpretation, aryaka is an epithet of Bhavadatta. The inscription names the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> as Nandivardhana, and states that the king and the queen were staying at Prayaga as pilgrims. Like Arthapati's inscription, it mentions Maheshvara, Mahasena and the Nala family.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{settlement was}} named Vila, from the Latin villa, which meant [...] "estate, manor" [...] and in late antiquity came to mean [...] "small town". This evolved into Weil. Later the suffix [...] "die Stadt" [...] (the town) {{was added to}} distinguish the town from villages of the same name, such as Weil im Dorf and Weil im Schönbuch. The current name is unusual in that it contains the German dative case (the word Stadt is feminine). It arose because the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> in official documents was usually given as [...] "gegeben zu Weil, der Stadt" [...] ("issued in Weil, the town"). The Roman origins of the city are immortalized in the coat-of-arms which feature the SPQR motto ("Senatus Populusque Romanus", i. e. Senate and People of Rome).|$|E
5000|$|The {{principal}} currency was {{the silver}} penny, {{some of which}} had a stylised portrait of the king. Royal coins had [...] "EADVVEARD REX" [...] on the obverse {{and the name of}} the moneyer of the reverse. The <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> is not shown, but in Æthelstan's reign the location was shown, allowing the location of many moneyers of Edward's reign to be established. There were mints in Bath, Canterbury, Chester, Chichester, Derby, Exeter, Hereford, London, Oxford, Shaftesbury, Shrewsbury, Southampton, Stafford, Wallingford, Wareham, Winchester and probably other towns. No coins were struck in the name of Æthelred or Æthelflæd, but from around 910 mints in English Mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on the reverse. This ceased before 920, and probably represents Æthelflæd's way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother. There was also a minor issue of coins in the name of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. There was a dramatic increase in the number of moneyers over Edward's reign, with less than 25 in the south in the first ten years rising to 67 in the last ten years, around 5 in English Mercia rising to 23, plus 27 in the re-conquered Danelaw.|$|E
50|$|Four years later, the {{returning}} {{prisoners of war}} of the bloc founded Nir Etzion in the Mount Carmel area near Haifa. Nir Etzion sought to accept {{the majority of the}} bloc's children into it, but despite wishing to unite in a new <b>place</b> <b>of</b> residence, the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> joining Nir Etzion was a matter of debate among the children, many of whom joined the Nahal military unit. The survivors of Masu'ot Yitzhak, Ein Tzurim, and Revadim founded their communities anew in Israel proper.|$|R

It considers the assessment of best interests around <b>place</b> <b>of</b> residence, <b>issues</b> around the perception of risk and the perceptions of the family. We gesture at some practical considerations, but also make the suggestion that we require tighter functional assessments of residence capacity coupled with broader judgements about best interests...|$|R
