5000|$|After the {{realisation}} {{that the}} surplus was a structural one {{rather than a}} temporary variation, the wine regulations were changed to be more interventionist in 1978, with a ban on additional vineyard plantations, which means that a system of <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> was introduced to regulate replantations. Also, requirements to distil the surplus wine into industrial alcohol were introduced, a procedure {{often referred to as}} [...] "emergency distillation", although it has remained in force for decades. At about the same time, domestic wine consumption of simpler wine qualities started to drop within the larger wine producing countries of Europe, making it even harder to return to the previous state of market equilibrium. From the 1980s, this has meant a marked reduction in the total demand, in terms of quantity, {{despite the fact that the}} wine-importing countries of northern Europe have increased their consumption. Increasing wine exports from the New World, often in a style arrived at by market research rather than long tradition, also meant increased competition and changing tastes among wine consumers. As a result, the reduced total demand also included a shift in the demand towards higher quality level. Since it was realised that the vineyards in some locations would be unlikely to yield wines of the necessary quality, increased financial incentives for giving up vineyards, so-called grubbing-up schemes or vine pull schemes, were introduced in the late 1980s. This led to reduced overproduction, but a complete balance has so far never been achieved.|$|E

40|$|In 2008, the EU {{voted to}} liberalize its system of <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> which has {{strictly}} regulated vine plantings in the EU. However, after an intense lobbying campaign {{the liberalization of}} the planting right system was overturned in 2013 and new regulations could create an even more restrictive system. European wine associations have complained about the detrimental effects of the new regulations. There is a precedent in history. In 1726, the French political philosopher and landowner Montesquieu complained to the French King about the prohibition on planting new vines. Montesquieu was not successful in his demands to remove the system of <b>planting</b> <b>rights.</b> Old and recent history suggests that political forces against liberalization of <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> are very strong. Only the French Revolution in 1789 led to a fundamental liberalization of <b>planting</b> <b>rights.</b> The “liberal period” of the 19 th century was sustained by {{the combination of the}} French Revolution’s liberal ideology, the thirst for wine of Napoleon’s armies and diseases that wiped out most of the French vineyards. That said, in the past and the present, enforcement of <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> is a major problem. In fact, despite the official restrictions, Montesquieu managed to plant his vines, allowing him to become a successful wine producer and merchant and to travel and to spend time thinking, discussing and ultimately writing up his ideas which influenced much of the Western world’s constitutions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{assesses the}} {{existence}} of both greater profitability for large-scale farms and economies of scale in the French viticulture sector, thereby confirming or invalidating the argument put forward by the European Commission to justify the abolition of vine <b>planting</b> <b>rights.</b> According to this argument (1) economic efficiency increases with {{the extension of the}} vine area in vineyards, and (2) vine <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> prevent the expansion of farms. This article discusses the issue of economies of scale in agriculture and focuses on specific matters related to viticulture. The key issue of our demonstration lies in the impossibility of defining economies of scale by comparing the profits of farms producing different types of product at different prices. By using an assessment of these variables through FADN, it proposes and justifies the interest of using a measurement of output which is the net value added per unit of labor. The report prepared on behalf of the European Parliament is criticized as it demonstrates a positive correlation between size and efficiency, without taking account of the broad farm gate price dispersion for wine. This article demonstrates {{that in the case of}} France, over the period 2005 – 2007, farm size has little impact on performance. The significant differences observed are the result of differences in the selling price of wine. In summary, the main argument put forward by the European Commission to justify canceling vine <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> is not adapted to the case of France because it considers wine as a single product sold at a single price...|$|E
40|$|The Economics of Alcohol: Essays on Consumption, Taxation, Regulation and ContractsKoen DeconinckPhD SummaryThis {{dissertation}} contains five chapters discussing some of {{the economic}} aspects of alcohol consumption and production. Following a concise introductory chapter, the second chapter, Peer Effects in Alcohol Consumption: Evidence from Russia, {{contributes to the literature}} on the determinants of alcohol consumption by studying the importance of social influence in the individual decision to start drinking beer in Russia. Between 1996 and 2007, beer consumption in Russia grew strongly from about 15 liters per capita to 80 liters per capita, and beer has become the most important alcoholic beverage in Russia, overtaking vodka. Our empirical analysis, using individual-level panel data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, indicates that peer effects {{played an important role in}} the spread of beer consumption. By contrast, economic variables such as prices or incomes probably played only a minor role. These results may hold important policy implications given the widespread problem of alcoholism in Russia. The third and fourth chapter analyze regulatory issues. Chapter 3, The Economics of <b>Planting</b> <b>Rights</b> in Wine Production, presents the first economic model of the so-called planting rights system used to restrict the growth of the total area of vineyards in the European Union, home to half of the worlds vineyards. The <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> system forbids any new plantings of vineyards in the European Union except when a planting right has been obtained from a government reserve or from a former vineyard owner who has grubbed up his vines. This cap-and-trade system, which has been in place since the 1970 s, is subject to large differences in implementation in the different Member States of the EU. We develop a theoretical model analyzing the welfare and distributional effects of the <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> system, as well as of the differences in implementation. Our results show the importance of distinguishing between land owners, <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> owners and wine producers to study the distributional consequences of (a liberalization of) the <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> system. In the fourth chapter, The Political Economy of Geographical Indications, we contribute to the economic analysis of geographical indications (GIs)  government-backed collective labels to certify the geographical origins of a product, such as Champagne. Government regulation stipulates the geographical area which can identify its products with the GI. An increase in the total area of the GI region can have three effects. First, production increases and hence prices of the product would decrease. Second, certain fixed costs (such as marketing) can be spread over a larger production volume, thus reducing the costs for individual producers. Third, the actual or perceived quality of the product may decrease, whether because of a decline in quality as land with less suitable terroir is added, or because of reputational effects. We derive the size of thesocially optimal GI region and then proceed with a political economy analysis to study how a government subject to lobbying will set the size of the GI area. Interestingly, our analysis shows that if producers can influence decision-making, the political outcome may either be too small or too large from a social welfare perspective. Chapter 5, Tied Houses: An Economic Analysis of Brewery-Pub Contracts, studies the contracts between publicans and brewers. In several countries (including Belgium) a large number of pubs have exclusivity agreements (or ties) with brewers. This is often the case for pubs which the publican rents from the brewer, or in pubs where the brewer has made financial or material investments on behalf of the publican. These contracts have attracted a great deal of criticism from publicans, who complain about paying unreasonably high wholesale prices for beer compared to pubs which are free of tie. Our chapter presents an economic analysis of the contracts between brewers and publicans to answer two questions. The first question is how the terms of contract are determined  and in particular, why contracts for rental pubs typically have a low rent but a high wholesale price, even though this high wholesale price generates inefficiencies. The second question is why wholesale prices differ between tied and free pubs. Our analysis emphasizes that publicans are typically risk-averse (inducing brewers to use the wholesale price rather than a fixed payment to extract surplus) and credit-constrained, with publicans sorting into different contracts depending on their initial wealth. As our analysis shows, publicans who bear only a small part of the total investment in a pub will face a higher wholesale price since their own outside options are limited, the brewers opportunity costs are higher, and the brewer has more bargaining power. The implication of our analysis for current policy debates is that credit constraints need to be taken into account in analyzing price differentials, and that it is important to distinguish between opportunity costs and bargaining power as determinants of the wholesale price. Chapter 6, How Beer Created Belgium: The Contribution of Beer Taxes to Dutch War Finance During the Dutch Revolt, illustrates the development of public finance and state power by analyzing the contribution of beer taxes to war finance during the Dutch Revolt (1566 - 1648). Specifically, we show that fiscal revenues from beer taxes gave the present-day Netherlands the military power to break away from the Spanish-occupied Low Countries in the course of the Dutch Revolt (1566 - 1648), leaving the territory of present-day Belgium behind as the remainder of the Spanish Low Countries. The border established by this separation still forms the division between Belgium and the Netherlands. The outcome of the Revolt was unusual, in that a small rebellious region eventually prevailed over the mighty Spanish Empire. The explanation for this remarkable outcome lies in a combination of developments in war technology and the extraordinary capacity of the Dutch to finance the war. Because of technological developments and innovations in strategy and tactics, warfare during the Dutch Revolt was an increasingly capital-intensive undertaking. The capacity to finance war expenditures therefore became of paramount importance. The Spanish army in the Low Countries was constantly short on funds, which led to frequent payment arrears among its troops. As a result, demoralization, desertion and mutinies undermined the Spanish position. The Dutch, on the other hand, could count on a superior system of public finance to finance war expenditures. As we document in this chapter, a substantial part of the Dutch taxation system consisted of taxes on beer. In fact, the excise tax on beer was the single largest component of government revenues in Holland, the leading province in the Dutch Republic. Hence, beer taxes played a crucial role in financing the Dutch Revolt, and thus in the separation of the Low Countries and the determination of the present-day border between Belgium and the Netherlands. The surprisingly large contribution of beer taxes can be explained by the combination of the importance of beer in daily consumption patterns in early modern times and an efficient enforcement of the beer tax. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The 42 nd Meeting of the Research Centre for Appraisal and Land Economics (Ce. S. E. T.) focused its {{attention}} on land markets, {{given that the}} new Common Agricultural Policy, which has proposed strong reforms that have been much discussed, has arrived at an advanced stage of definition. The land market theme, although little contemplated in economic evaluations of agricultural policies, is an essential topic for the understanding of development processes, especially after the economic crisis linked to real estate appraisal. The hypotheses of totally decoupling direct aid, adopting undifferentiated payments per hectare, and introducing a bonus for "greening", as contemplated in the CAP reform proposal, could significantly modify the present equilibrium in terms of competitiveness between crops and, more in general, {{the structure of the}} sector itself. Following an in-depth analysis of the specific elements of the extant CAP reform and those linked to other communautaire measures, such as the liberalization of <b>planting</b> <b>rights</b> for vineyards and further elements of a structural nature where other economic and social activities are competing for land use, it is possible to appreciate the tensions in the market as regards current and future rural funds. The multidisciplinary perspective that characterized the meeting held in Palermo, allowed us to compare and integrate different theoretical and operational approaches, while examining in detail all the aspects dealt with, both from an appraisal and from a territorial economy standpoint. The most important Italian researchers in estimates and legal affairs and the main actors on the territory, like the Natural Resources Agency, the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and a delegate of the Agronomy and Forestry Doctors' Order, attended the meeting. Furthermore the contribution of Professor Giovanni La Via, member of the European Parliament should be emphasized; he is an academic of the appraisal of farmland and a BUDG rapporteur of the European Parliament, who defined the dynamics of land values {{in the light of the}} most updated forecasts of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The interesting researches presented during the meeting were organized, as a consequence of the multidisciplinary nature of the meeting, in three parallel sessions, with the aim of promoting a comparison between the various theoretical and operational approaches: "The agricultural policy instruments and their effects on land values"; "The dynamics and the appraisal of land property values"; "The evaluation of public assets in rural areas". During the conference many research ideas were put forward, there was a mutual enrichment of knowledge while issues to be developed emerged. It is the hope of the Centre that the debate and the dialogue between all the parties involved will continue. As the principle of multidisciplinary debate is innate in Ce. S. E.

This legislation provides for farmers’ privilege, {{which is one of}} the exceptions to <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> It allows farmers to save seed of protected varieties for their own use. Farmers’ privilege, and particularly its impact on smallholder farmers in developing countries, is a widely debated issue. During the public consultation process, several comments proposing amendments to the farmers’ privilege provision were received from various stakeholders. However, no comments were received from the smallholder farmers who may be directly impacted by this provision. This pilot study was undertaken to assess the understanding of the farmers’ privilege concept by smallholder farmers from the historically disadvantaged communities and their current practices with regard to seed saving. The results showed that the majority of the smallholder farmers were not aware of the existence of the legislation on <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> and therefore do not understand the farmers’ privilege concept and its implications.

40|$|In my opinion, the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should {{investigate}} {{whether it is}} feasible and viable to implement a legislative scheme for the collective administration of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> A collecting society for <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> would involve an organisation that administers the <b>rights</b> of individual <b>plant</b> breeders. It could grant permission to use propagating material and set conditions for their use. Such collective management would be a tool that rights-holders could employ when the individual exercise of the rights is impractical or inefficient. Such a regime could address a number of concerns raised by the inquiry into plant breeders’ enforcement. The exclusive role of the <b>Plant</b> Breeders’ <b>Rights</b> Office {{is to determine the}} validity of applications for <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> It would be inappropriate for this independent arbiter {{to be involved in the}} management and enforcement of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> An independent collecting society for <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> would fulfil this separate role. The seed industry has expressed concerns that many of its members – especially individual plant breeders and small-to-medium businesses - lack the capacity or expertise to enforce <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> A collecting society for <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> would be able to bring infringement actions on behalf of its members. The seed industry has also raised concerns about the ability of their members to manage and exploit <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> A collecting society would help facilitate transactions between the owners of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights,</b> and the users of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> Furthermore, there is a need to provide formal, legislative backing for the industry practice of end-point royalties. There is a need to amend the <b>Plant</b> Breeders’ <b>Rights</b> Act 1994 (Cth) to provide for statutory licensing in respect of end-point royalties. A collecting society for <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> would be an appropriate independent body to administer statutory licenses in respect of end-point royalties. The Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should also take into account some of the issues and challenges, which have arisen in respect of the collective administration of intellectual property rights. The Federal Government – and the agricultural industry – would have to make a significant outlay to start-up such a collecting society. There would be a need to determine the nature of such a collective administration – in particular, whether it would be a voluntary system; a compulsory system; or a mix of the two. A collecting society in respect of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> would enjoy a dominant position in the marketplace. There would be a need to obtain authorisation from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in respect of the operation of the scheme. Furthermore, there would be a need for proper regulatory oversight of a collecting society in respect of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights.</b> Voluntary codes of conduct have proven to be an ineffective means of governing collecting societies in the context of copyright law. There would need to be an administrative body empowered to establish, either mandatorily or at the request of an interested party, the royalties to be paid for the use of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights,</b> when the administration of such copyright is entrusted to a collective-administration society. The Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should seek to preserve the special identity of the <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> regime. It would be inappropriate to discard unique doctrinal features – such as the criteria for distinctiveness, uniformity, and stability; the cascading <b>rights</b> of <b>plant</b> breeders; the doctrine of essential derivation; and the special exceptions for farm-saved seed. The <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> regime should be a viable alternative to the patent regime. The Advisory Council on Intellectual Property should clarify the ‘cascading rights’ of plant breeders. The Cultivaust litigation illustrated that there needs to be further elucidation as to the circumstances in which <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> cascade from propagating material to harvested material and products arising from the harvested material. In particular, it is worth defining what a reasonable opportunity to exploit propagating material involves. As a matter of clarification, the Cultivaust litigation involved questions of the exhaustion of <b>plant</b> breeders’ <b>rights</b> – rather than matters of the farmers’ privilege. The Full Federal Court was critical that the trial judge confused the two issues. Unfortunately, the issues paper compounds the error of the trial judge – by conflating questions of ‘cascading rights’ and farm saved seed (in 4. 1 of the issues paper). It would be preferable if the Advisory Council on Intellectual Property decouple the issues of a reasonable opportunity to exploit propagating material from matters of farm-saved seed. One should not confuse rights with exceptions. The integrity of the farm saved seed provisions under the <b>Plant</b> Breeders’ <b>Rights</b> Act 1990 (Cth) should be respected and preserved. Such exceptions serve an important practical and symbolic function. The defence provides recognition of an old-tradition of saving seeds in farming. The farm-saved seed exception also provides legitimacy to the <b>Plant</b> Breeders’ <b>Rights</b> Act 1990 (Cth), especially amongst rural and regional sectors. There would be a political outcry amongst agricultural communities if the farm-saved seed provisions were curtailed, replaced, or annulled.
