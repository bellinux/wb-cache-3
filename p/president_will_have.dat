50|$|Law 7 of 1978 {{stipulates}} that former presidents {{are entitled to}} a pension.

2500|$|The president's role {{is largely}} political, {{preparing}} {{the work of}} the European Council, organising and chairing its meetings, seeking to find consensus among its members and reporting to the European Parliament after each meeting; the president will also [...] "at his level and in that capacity, ensure the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy, without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security". Some overlap between the roles of the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, and the High Representative—notably in foreign policy—leaves uncertainty about how much influence the President of the European Council will acquire. There is further concern over whether the <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> sufficient personnel and resources to fulfil the duties of the post effectively and that, in lacking a ministry, the President might become a [...] "play ball" [...] between EU leaders.|$|E

5000|$|In many cases, {{the general}} manager of a {{business}} is given a different formal title or titles.

50|$|Under law, the President shall {{nominate}} a new Chairman of the Government {{within two}} weeks of the resignation of a previous government or inauguration ceremony of President. The State Duma is to discuss the matter {{within two weeks}} of the nomination and make a decision.

Should the State Duma decide to give the President its approval, the President may immediately sign the respective appointment decree.

The party of the ruling president wins the elections in the House of Representatives; in cases where the party of the president and the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are different, a sufficient enough number will break away and join the party of the president, thereby ensuring that the <b>president</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> control of the House of Representatives.|$|E

Although NASA has an amazing array of technology and the most talented workforce in history, it lacks top-level vision.
