50|$|<b>Probe</b> <b>card</b> {{efficiency}} {{is affected by}} many factors. Perhaps {{the most important factor}} impacting <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> {{efficiency is}} the number of DUTs that can be tested in parallel. Many wafers today are still tested one device at a time. If one wafer had 1000 of these devices and the time required to test one device was 10 seconds and the time for the prober to move from one device to another device was 1 second, then to test an entire wafer would take 1000 x 11 seconds = 11,000 seconds or roughly 3 hours. If however, the <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> and the tester could test 16 devices in parallel (with 16 times the electrical connections) than the test time would be reduced by almost exactly 16 times. Note that because now the <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> has 16 devices, as the prober touches down on the round wafer, it may not always contact an active device and will therefore be a little less than 16 times as fast to test one wafer.|$|E

Different technologies and treatments were employed to get adequate characteristics. In order to control thermal expansion or mechanical properties, nanoparticles of amorphous silica or bacterial cellulose were added to the material.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{instrument}} to accurately and verifiably measure mechanical properties across an entire MEMS wafer is under development. We have modified the optics on a conventional microelectronics probe station to enable three-dimensional imaging {{while maintaining the}} full working distance of a long working distance objective. This allows standard <b>probes</b> or <b>probe</b> <b>cards</b> to be used. We have proceeded to map out mechanical properties of polycrystalline silicon along a wafer column by the Interferometry for Material Property Measurement (IMaP) methodology. From interferograms of simple actuated cantilevers, out-ofplane deflection profiles at the nanometer scale are obtained. These are analyzed by integrated software routines that extract basic mechanical properties such as cantilever curvature and Young’s modulus. Non-idealities such as support post compliance and beam take off angle are simultaneously quantified. Curvature and residual stress are found to depend on wafer position. Although deflections of cantilevers varied across the wafer, Young’s modulus E ~ 161 GPa is independent of wafer position as expected. This result is achieved because the non-idealities have been taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Many micro-electronic {{systems are}} based on {{transceiver}} architecture, as represented in Fig. 1. Traditionally, the test methods are core-based, resulting in long test times and introducing some risks of affecting the signal integrity. In the core-based strategy, every block is tested against its own specifications, whereas path-based testing relies on system-level parameters. This new approach has been developed for some years, and represents a first step towards a full built-in-self-test (BIST) solution, the transmitter and the receiver being path-based tested. However, the test configuration still requires RF signal generation and capture, consequently high-performance instruments, contact blocks, <b>probe</b> <b>cards,</b> and test boards. The next step will rely on the so-called loopback technique. Some blocks of the transmitting path are used to generate the stimuli applied to the receiving blocks, which act as a digitizing + processing chain.

40|$|Probe-after-bump is {{the primary}} probing {{procedure}} for flip chip technology, since it does not directly contact the bump pad, and involves a preferred under bump metallurgy (UBM) step coverage on the bump pads. However, the probe-after-bump procedure suffers from low throughputs and high cost. It also delays the yield feedback to the fab, and makes difficult clarification of the accountability of the low yield bumped wafer between the fab and the bumping house. The probe-before-bump procedure can solve these problems, but the probing tips may over-probe or penetrate the bump pads, leading to poor UBM step coverage, due to inadequate probing conditions or poor <b>probing</b> <b>cards.</b> This work examines the impact of probing procedure on flip chip reliability, using printing and electroplating bumpings on aluminum and copper pads. Bump height, bump shear strength, die shear force, UBM step coverage, and reliability testing are {{used to determine the}} influence of probing procedure on flip chip reliability. The experimental results reveal that bump quality and reliability test in the probe-before-bump procedure, under adequate probing conditions, differ slightly from the corresponding items in the probe-after-bump procedure. UBM gives superior step coverage of probe marks in both probe-before-bump and probe-after-bump procedures, implying that UBM achieves greater adhesion and barrier function between the solder bump and the bump pad. Both printing and electroplating bump processes slightly influence all evaluated items. The heights of probe marks on the copper pads are 40 – 60 % lower than those on the aluminum pads, indicating that the copper pad enhances UBM step coverage. This finding reveals that adequate probing conditions of the probe-before-bump procedure are suited to sort flip chip wafers and do not significantly affect bump height, bump shear strength, die shear force, or flip chip reliability...|$|R
40|$|The EU-project SMARTIEHS (SMART InspEction {{system for}} High Speed and multi-functional testing of MEMS and MOEMS) {{develops}} a new inspection concept for MEMS and MOEMS (M(O) EMS) testing on the wafer level. The inspection systems on market today {{are based on}} a serial approach inspecting one M(O) EMS structure at the time. The SMARTIEHS concept is based on a parallel approach. A wafer-to-wafer inspection concept is adopted from the electronic <b>probing</b> <b>cards</b> in the micro electronics industry. In SMARTIEHS a micro-optical probing wafer is aligned on top of the M(O) EMS wafer under investigation. The 4 -inch probing wafer contains a 5 x 5 array of micro-optical interferometers, allowing the inspection of 25 MEMS structures within one measurement cycle. The measurement time can thus be reduced by a factor of 25. This factor can be easily increased by extending the size of the probing wafer. In the project two different types of interferometers are developed to demonstrate the multifunctional approach of the system. A laser interferometer is applied for the detection of the resonance frequency and the amplitude distribution, while a low coherent interferometer is applied for the measurement of shape and deformation. A 5 x 5 channel Smart Pixel camera array detects the interference signals. This paper presents the design of the micro-optical low coherent interferometer array. The configuration is based on the well known Mirau-interferometer.

40|$|Integrated {{circuits}} (ICs) {{are usually}} tested during manufacture {{by means of}} automatic testing equipment (ATE) employing <b>probe</b> <b>cards</b> and needles that make repeated physical contact with the ICs under test. Such direct-contact probing is very costly and imposes limitations {{on the use of}} ATE. For example, the probe needles must be frequently cleaned or replaced, and some emerging technologies such as three-dimensional ICs cannot be probed at all. As an alternative to conventional probe-card testing, wireless testing has been proposed. It mitigates many of the foregoing problems by replacing probe needles and contact points with wireless communication circuits. However, wireless testing also raises new problems which are poorly understood such as: What is the most suitable wireless communication technique to employ, and how well does it work in practice? This dissertation addresses the design and implementation of circuits to support wireless testing of ICs. Various wireless testing methods are investigated and evaluated with respect to their practicality. The research focuses on near-field capacitive communication because of its efficiency over the very short ranges needed during IC manufacture. A new capacitive channel model including chip separation, cross-talk, and misalignment effects is proposed and validated using electro-magnetic simulation studies to provide the intuitions for efficient antenna and circuit design. We propose a compact clock and data recovery architecture to avoid a dedicated clock channel. An analytical model which predicts the DC-level fluctuation due to the capacitive channel is presented. Based on this model, feed-forward clock selection is designed to enhance performance. A method to select proper channel termination is discussed to maximize the channel efficiency for return-to-zero signaling. Two prototype ICs incorporating wireless testing systems were fabricated and tested with the proposed methods of testing digital circuits. Both successfully demonstrated gigahertz communication speeds with a bit-error rate less than 10 ^− 11. A third prototype IC containing analog voltage measurement circuits was implemented to determine the feasibility of wirelessly testing analog circuits. The fabricated prototype achieved satisfactory voltage measurement with 1 mV resolution.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in demand for the wafer-level test techniques that evaluates the functionality and performance of the wafer chips before packaging them, since the trend of integrated circuits are getting more sophisticated and smaller in size. Throughout the wafer-level test, the semiconductor manufacturers are able to avoid the unnecessary packing cost and to provide early feedback on the overall status of the chip fabrication process. A <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> is a module of wafer-level tester, and can detect the defects of the chip by evaluating the electric characteristics of the integrated circuits(IC's). A <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> analyzer is popularly utilized to detect such a potential <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> failure which leads to increase in the unnecessary manufacture expense in the packing process. In this paper, a new <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> analysis strategy has been proposed. The main idea in conducting <b>probe</b> <b>card</b> analysis is to operate the vision-based inspection on-the- y while the camera is continuously moving. In doing so, the position measurement from the encoder is rstly synchronized with the image data that is captured by a controlled trigger signal under the real-time setting.

In an abstract, maximum likelihood formulation, the rat’s location is estimated by a conjoint probability density function of landmark positions.

Thus, pathological POC-US findings can be simulated easily with any phantom or patient. As a result, not only image interpretation on a screen, but also to some extent image acquisition can be trained within real-time settings: the probe has {{to be held in}} the right place to retrieve the information (landmarking). The corresponding video files are stored on the laptop computer itself. Unfortunately, the software is LINUX based; this affords a virtual machine to allow its use with WINDOWS®. With these restrictions, specific hard- and software has to be used. The concept was published open source by the authors, including technical instructions and a set of sample videos to start with [5]. Another, more up-to-date technology was created by Ostergren. The “Awesome Ultrasound Simulator” is an iOS mobile application, where two smartphones are combined, with one of them displaying the videos, the other serves as a remote control for choosing them [6]. This solution is a freely accessible resource as well, and has successfully been used in the Trauma Resuscitation Using in situ Simulation Team Training (TRUST) study by Petrosoniak and coworkers [7]. It is, however, only available for Apple™ devices, and dependent on a second remote operator to trigger the videos.
