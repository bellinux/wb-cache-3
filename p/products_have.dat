5|$|At independence, a King George V 5 pence {{registered}} {{envelope and}} 1 shilling telegram form were printed in green {{for use in}} Ireland until domestic products became available. Irish telegram forms were only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered envelopes have appeared in many values and sizes. The printed (but non-stamped) registered envelopes were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so envelopes from former periods, showing out-dated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors. Other <b>products</b> <b>have</b> carried post-paid imprint, such as commemorative and special issue postcards, including a series of St. Patrick's Day cards issued annually since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic ketoacidosis. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze <b>products</b> <b>have</b> fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), {{commonly}} known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They are solid and relatively large—cap diameter up to , with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white mycelium {{at the base of the}} stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its bitter taste. A number of natural <b>products</b> <b>have</b> been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of ergosterol, a fungal sterol.|$|E

5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new <b>products</b> <b>have</b> as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Han dynasty {{emperors}} {{and their}} successors maintained commercial and diplomatic ties with various South and Southeast Asian kingdoms. Han dynasty ships traveled {{as far as}} India, expanding the horizon for new foreign markets for Chinese goods and services through maritime trade within the orbit of the Indian Ocean. Trade relationships were also established between China and foreign empires through the conquered territories. Trade connected China with the Indian Mauryan, Sātavāhana and Shunga Empires, the Persian Parthian Empire, and the European Roman Mediterranean. Roman dancers and entertainers were sent to Luoyang {{as a gift to}} China from a Burmese kingdom in 120. A kingdom referred to in the Book of Han as Huangzhi delivered a rhinoceros in 2 as a tribute. An Indian embassy arrived in China between 89 and 105. Roman merchants from the province of Syria visited Nanyue in 166, Nanjing in 226, and Luoyang in 284. Foreign <b>products</b> <b>have</b> been found at archaeological sites excavating tombs in southern China. Originating with the overseas demand for Chinese silk, the ancient Silk Road trade routes were responsible for the transmission of goods and services as well as ideas between ancient Europe, the Near East, and China.|$|E
5|$|He participated {{as one of}} {{the four}} quarterbacks in the July 2011 Gridiron Kings event at Disney World (with the top 24 quarterbacks {{participating}} in the 2011 Elite 11), but he was overshadowed by Matt Davis. As a junior in the fall of 2011, he passed for 1,684 yards and 19 touchdowns. He led the team to the 2011 Division 1 MHSAA state quarterfinals where they lost 96 to eventual state champions Cass Technical High School. Prior to his senior season, he was regarded {{as one of the}} best quarterback prospects produced by the state of Michigan, a state whose greatest quarterback <b>products</b> <b>have</b> been Gary Danielson, Earl Morrall, Craig Morton and James Ninowski. From the start of ESPN's rankings with the class of 2006 through the class of 2012, no Michigan quarterback ever ranked in the top 100. The closest were Rob Bolden (112th, 2010) and Gardner (128th, 2010). Prior to his senior year, he was ranked as ESPN's 37th best and Rivals.com's 17th best prospect and rising in the national class of 2013. Entering his senior season, he and Max Browne were the only two 5-star rated quarterbacks in the class of 2013 by Rivals.com. A few weeks into his senior season, he had risen to 26th at ESPN, but suffered season-ending mononucleosis with five games remaining on the schedule. By the beginning of November, he was the top quarterback in the country according to some evaluators. He ended his high school career ranked 127th by ESPN and 81st by Rivals.com.|$|E

5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these <b>products</b> <b>have</b> no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E
