Coordinated multi-object activities, or group activities, present {{in a variety of}} applications such as surveillance, sports, and biological monitoring records, etc., are the main focus of this paper. Unlike earlier attempts which model the complex spatial temporal constraints among multiple objects with a <b>parametric</b> <b>Bayesian</b> <b>network,</b> we propose a Discriminative Temporal Interaction Manifold (DTIM) framework as a data-driven strategy to characterize the group motion pattern without employing specific domain knowledge. In particular, we establish probability densities on the DTIM, whose element, the discriminative temporal interaction matrix, compactly describes the coordination and interaction among multiple objects in a group activity. For each class of group activity we learn a multi-modal density function on the DTIM. A Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) classifier on the manifold is then designed for recognizing new activities. Experiments on football play recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|The highly {{uncertain}} {{nature of}} a railway disruption complicates the tasks carried by the Dutch Operational Control Centre Rail (OCCR) in the Netherlands. A good prediction of disruption length is believed to help the decision making {{in dealing with the}} disruption. Zilko, et al. [Non-Parametric Bayesian Network to Forecast Railway Disruption Lengths, In: The Second International Conference on Railway Technology: Research, Development and Maintenance (Railways 2014), Ajaccio, France (2014) ] proposes the use of the Non- <b>Parametric</b> <b>Bayesian</b> <b>Network</b> (NPBN) method, a graphical model based on a probabilistic approach that represents the dependence between the variables of interest, to predict the disruption length. The model offers an attractive feature for the real-time decision making environment in the OCCR, which is its ef?ciency and fast inference. This paper extends the model construction. More variables are added into the NPBN model to increase the prediction power of the model. From the data analysis, it turns out that some of the influ-encing variables are discrete variables; thus resulting in a mixed discrete and continuous model. This raises some serious questions because the NPBN method is originally designed to work with continuous variables. This paper investigates how the presence of discrete variables affects the NPBN method and how one can proceed with the mixed discrete and continuous model. As an illustration, a model about the railway disruption in the Netherlands caused by track circuit failures is presented in this paper as well.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal in reservoir engineering is to optimize hydrocarbon recovery from a reservoir. To achieve the goal, good {{knowledge of the}} subsurface properties is crucial. One of these properties is the permeability. Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) {{is the most common}} tool used to deal with this situation. However, {{it is not the only}} way. Recently, a research on a more general approach based on a dynamic <b>Bayesian</b> <b>network</b> using the Non <b>Parametric</b> <b>Bayesian</b> <b>Networks</b> (NPBN) has been initiated. This research, which uses a twin experiment, indicates the NPBN approach to be a promising alternative to EnKF as a tool to tackle history matching problem. Analysis of the spatial correlation of the permeability estimates from both methods reveals puzzling behavior. For the same pair of cell, the EnKF method tends to have higher correlation than the NPBN method. Two pairs of cells from the NPBN estimate even have completely negative correlation. Nevertheless, the NPBN method is still in its infancy and further investigations and improvements still need to be performed. However, based on the obtained results, there are even more reasons to believe it as a promising approach in tackling history matching problem in reservoir engineering.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{graphical}} {{tool for the}} calculation of treewidth, a metric on the parametric structure {{of a system that}} is intimately tied to the complexity of system analysis. For many graphically describable systems, such as systems of parametric equations, as in a SysML <b>Parametric</b> Diagram, or <b>Bayesian</b> <b>networks</b> or even mind maps and writing term papers, analysis of the system is exponential in treewidth and linear in system size. A tool facilitating comprehensive analysis can serve to bring competitive advantage to a systems engineering workflow by reducing costly unanticipated behaviors. Furthermore, a byproduct of computing treewidth is a framework for enumerating computationally compatible distributed algorithms. In this paper, we pose this NP-complete problem from the perspective of finding satisficing solutions, exposing choices that can influence the complexity of the resulting system to the designer. A designer can contribute two important things to the structure of the system: a visual intuition about the relationships between the underlying objects and the ability to change the relationships themselves at design time to reduce analysis complexity. Having a visual tool that provides instant feedback will help designers achieve an intuitive grasp of the relationship between design decisions and system complexity. As complexity is the root of almost every systems engineering problem, and also something not easily understood, incorporating complexity analysis into a design process should improve resulting system designs. The tool uses a randomized, anytime algorithm for interactive optimization of treewidth. It presents a sequence of choices to a designer and incrementally lowers an upper bound on system treewidth over time. This algorithm is novel, as few algorithms are targeted at interactivity with a human user. We present a number of simple examples for using the tool. We show how our tool helps to decompose some example systems, including a quadrotor optimization, a sensor <b>network</b> optimization, a <b>Bayesian</b> <b>network,</b> and a mind map...|$|R
