5|$|Linguistic {{study of}} the Khmer {{language}} divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian. Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the Old Khmer language from 600 CE through 800, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the Khmer Empire from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen <b>Pinnow.</b> Following {{the end of the}} Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in morphology, phonology and lexicon. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.|$|E
25|$|Maison drove Oswald's {{troops out}} of Crivitz after a tough fight. At first, the Prussians fell back to high ground behind the village, then {{continued}} their retreat. General of Brigade Pierre Watier galloped forward from the village with the light cavalry. Watier summoned the Prussians to surrender, but their response was a charge by dragoons. The French horsemen unwisely opened fire with their carbines and were swept away by Oswald's counterattack. Gérard was captured and Bernadotte had to take shelter inside of an infantry square. The dragoons were finally halted by Pacthod's infantry. Later that evening, the French were able to seize the village of Meuss near Schwerin. During the action, the French cut off and wiped out the 1st battalion of the Arnim Infantry Regiment Nr. 13 at <b>Pinnow.</b>|$|E

50|$|The alley {{was known}} as Doktor Belows gränd during {{the end of the}} 17th century, {{probably}} in reference to a major proprietor in the block constantly disputing the use of the alley with his neighbours. It is most likely the alley named Herr Henning <b>Pinnows</b> gränd ("Alley of Mr. Henning Pinnow") and Herr Måns Erikssons gränd ("Alley of Mr. Måns Eriksson") in the 15th century, the former known to have sold a house to the latter in 1472. In 1513, the alley was then named after Gunilla Johansdotter Bese (1473-1553), wife of Erik Turesson Bielke (-1511) and mother to the grandfather of Queen Gunilla Bielke (1568-1597), and in 1674 the alley was even referred to as Sancta Gunillas gränd ("Alley of St Gunilla").|$|R

5000|$|Phthalonitrile {{was first}} {{described}} in 1896 by Johannes <b>Pinnow.</b> It was noted as {{a byproduct of}} the synthesis of ortho-dicyanodiazoamidobenzene via the reaction of ortho-amidobenzonitrile hydrochloride, sodium nitrite, and hydrochloric acid. [...] The first intentional synthesis involved dehydration of phthalamide by boiling in acetic anhydride. Another synthesis of historical interest is the Rosenmund von Braun reaction in which an ortho substituted dihalobenzene is treated with copper(I) cyanide, which results in the halide groups being replaced by cyano groups.|$|E
50|$|The Soviets {{eventually}} put German orphans in orphanages {{administered by}} Soviet military officers but staffed mostly {{with some of}} the remaining Germans. In Fall 1947, 4,700 German orphans were officially registered in Kaliningrad. In 1947 The Soviet Union sent trainloads of orphans to the communist GDR; these train rides took four to seven days, partly without food or toilet facilities and some children did not survive. In 1948, the children's village of <b>Pinnow,</b> then Kinderdorf Kyritz, was opened. Orphans who managed to live with Lithunian farmers remained there mostly undetected.|$|E
50|$|Franz Boas first {{suggested}} that Haida might be genetically {{related to the}} Tlingit language in 1894, and linguist Edward Sapir included Haida in the Na-Dené language family in 1915. This position was later supported by others, including Swanton, <b>Pinnow,</b> and Greenberg and Ruhlen. Today, however, many linguists regard Haida as a language isolate. This theory is not universally accepted; for example, Enrico (2004) argues that Haida does in fact belong to the Na-Dené family, though early loanwords make the evidence problematic. A proposal linking Na-Dené to the Yeniseian family of central Siberia finds no evidence for including Haida.|$|E

In the other direction, the B110 joins the B111, the road that runs along Usedom island's north shore, at Seebad Ahlbeck. Until 1945, the town had a railway station on the Ducherow-Swinemünde line, which now houses the island's nature park centre. Usedom today lies far from the island's only railway line, (Usedomer Bäderbahn). Usedom has a small harbour on the Usedomer See, an inlet with a narrow opening - the Kehle, or channel - into the lagoon.|$|E
