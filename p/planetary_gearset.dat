25|$|A Getrag F23 5-speed manual or an Aisin AF23 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission were available. The compact 5-speed automatic had several unique characteristics. The transmission lacked an overdrive, allowing for five forward gears to be packaged {{in the size}} of a typical four-speed manual gearbox, both providing close gear ratios for better acceleration and fuel efficiency while eliminating the heat and parasitic loss generated by the additional <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset.</b> The unit was also “fill-for-life”, meaning that it was not intended to be serviced {{for the life of the}} vehicle. The 2003 and 2004 Ion Coupes were available with the VTi continuously variable transmission or a Getrag F23 5-speed manual.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general layout}} of the initial {{production}} platform is considered {{by some to be}} a plug-in series hybrid design (since mechanical power initially drives the generator, which in turn charges the battery pack), despite its transmission design that makes it, by definition, a parallel hybrid. Power is drained from the batteries to run the electrical motors which move the vehicle. The internal combustion engine can run at a constant speed for both optimal efficiency and mechanical simplicity (i.e., {{there is no need for}} variable cam phasing). [...] The Voltec, like the Prius, uses a <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> to couple power from two sources to the wheels. Unlike the Prius, the Voltec only rarely drives the wheels with mechanical assist from the engine, and only when battery charge is depleted. The Voltec could therefore be considered a power-split hybrid.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with these}} chassis refinements, Sport package {{equipped}} models came with firmer rear shocks, bigger front brake calipers, and larger [...] rotors all around (up from 12.6/12.1-inch front/rear). Sport package equipped cars {{also get a}} viscous limited slip differential. An all-new Active Steering package can be ordered for sport package equipped models. It features a <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> on the steering shaft (similar to BMW), that varies the steering ratio between 12.0:1 and 18.5:1. A rear-wheel steering system that induces up to one degree of rear steer is also included in this package. The Active Steering package includes even stiffer shocks than the sport package at all four corners and the ride has been repeatedly reported as being too stiff for most customers except the most [...] "enthusiastic" [...] drivers. Base and Journey model [...] tires bump up from 215s to 225s, while the [...] upgrade (included in sport or wheel package) with 225/50-ZR18 front and 245/45-ZR18 rear is now a size smaller in front and larger in back than the 1st gen model's all-around 235/45R18s.|$|E

50|$|Automatic {{transmission}} {{families are}} usually based on Ravigneaux, Lepelletier, or Simpson <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets.</b> Each uses some arrangement {{of one or}} two central sun gears, and a ring gear, with differing arrangements of planet gears that surround the sun and mesh with the ring. An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses sliding gears on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets.</b> Although the Honda is quite different from all other automatics, it is also quite different from an automated manual transmission (AMT).|$|R
50|$|The {{predominant}} form {{of automatic}} transmission is hydraulically operated; using a fluid coupling or torque converter, {{and a set}} of <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets</b> to provide a range of gear ratios.|$|R
2500|$|The Turbo-Hydramatic {{heavy-duty}} three-speed {{automatic transmission}} became available during {{development of the}} Toronado. Called the TH425 in FWD form, the transmission's torque converter was separated from its <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset,</b> with the torque converter driving the gearset through a [...] wide silent chain-drive called Hy-Vo, riding on two [...] sprockets. The Hy-Vo chain drive was developed by GM's Hydra-Matic Division and Morse Chain Division of Borg-Warner. The chains were made from a very strong hardened steel and required no tensioners or idler pulleys because they were pre-stretched on a special machine at the factory. Although the rotation direction of the transmission's gearing had to be reversed, {{a large number of}} components were shared with the conventional TH400. Use of the automatic also obviated the need to devise a workable manual-shift linkage; no manual transmission was ever contemplated, as engineers deemed performance to be adequate with the automatic transmission and because virtually all U.S.-built luxury cars during this period came with automatic transmissions as standard equipment. With this, the [...] time was clocked in 9.5seconds.|$|E

It's the boundary between both continuously variable ranges. The two-modes switching occurs at this point, when the third <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> ring gear reach zero rotational speed, and all the <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> carriers gears reach the same rotational speed together.|$|E

50|$|Simpson left Ford in 1938. In 1948 he was {{diagnosed}} with cancer. Told he had less than six months to live, he moved to the American southwest (California and then Arizona). He spent much of his time drawing every arrangement he could conceive for <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets,</b> filing patents on each. He was granted 23 patents in this field during his lifetime.|$|R

5000|$|Simpson's {{preferred}} gearset {{was for a}} three-speed {{automatic transmission}} using two identical <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets</b> in series, linked by a common sun gear. The use of largely identical parts for {{the front and rear}} gearset made the transmission substantially cheaper to manufacture by reducing tooling costs. This three-speed gearing arrangement, patented in 1950, is commonly known as the [...] "Simpson Gearset," [...] although it is only one of numerous arrangements Simpson successfully patented during his life.|$|R

Together with the Modelica simulation environment Dymola, this library is suited and used for HIL (Hardware-In-the-Loop) simulations...|$|R
50|$|The 4F27E is a {{strengthened}} 4-speed F-4EAT automatic. It {{now has a}} four-element {{torque converter}} that includes a torque converter clutch and geartrain with two <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets,</b> a transfer-shaft gear final drive, and a larger differential. The hydraulic control system of the 4F27E transaxle has six electronically controlled solenoids for shift feel (through line pressure control), shift scheduling (through shift valve position control) and TCC (torque converter clutch) apply, controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM). The Mazda FS5A-EL (Ford FNR5) is the 5-speed successor to this transmission. It uses {{many of the same}} parts.|$|R

50|$|The Dynaflow was an {{automatic}} transmission used {{in various forms}} in Buick cars by the General Motors Corporation from 1947 until 1963. The transmission initially used a five-element torque converter, with two turbines and two stators, {{as well as a}} <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> that provided two forward speeds plus reverse. In normal driving, Dynaflow started in high gear (direct drive), relying on the converter's 2.1:1 torque multiplication to accelerate the vehicle. Low gear, obtained via the <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset,</b> could be manually engaged and held up to approximately 60 mph, improving acceleration.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} 3-speed hubs use {{a single}} <b>planetary</b> epicyclic <b>gearset.</b> The sun gear (in yellow above) is mounted solidly to the axle {{and is thus}} fixed relative to the bicycle frame.|$|R
40|$|A {{spur gear}} {{efficiency}} prediction method previously {{developed by the}} authors was extended to include power loss of <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets.</b> A friction coefficient model was developed for MIL-L- 7808 oil based on disc machine data. This combined with the recent capability of predicting losses in spur gears of nonstandard proportions allows the calculation of power loss for complete aircraft gearboxes that utilize spur gears. The method {{was applied to the}} T 56 / 501 turboprop gearbox and compared with measured test data. Bearing losses were calculated with large scale computer programs. Breakdowns of the gearbox losses point out areas for possible improvement...|$|R
5000|$|The Hydramatic used a two-element fluid {{coupling}} (not a torque converter, which {{has at least}} three elements, the pump, turbine and stator although Roto HydraMatic has a {{fluid coupling}} and a fixed stator) and three <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets,</b> providing four forward speeds plus reverse. Standard ratios for the original Hydra-Matic were 3.82:1, 2.63:1, 1.45:1 and 1.00:1 in automotive applications, and 4.08:1, 2.63:1, 1.55:1 and 1.00:1 in light truck and other commercial applications. The Controlled Coupling HydraMatic used 3.97:1, 2.55:1, 1.55:1, and 1.00:1. And Roto Hydramatic a three speed, four range automatic has a 3.50:1, 2.93:1, 1.56:1 and 1.00:1 ...|$|R

5000|$|The 45RFE was {{introduced}} in the Jeep Grand Cherokee in 1999, it is notable for including three <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets</b> rather than the two normally used in a 4-speed automatic. It also features three multiple disc input clutches, three multiple disc holding clutches, and a dual internal filter system (one primary filter for transmission sump, one for the fluid cooler return system). In the 45RFE applications four gears are utilized, with a different (1.50:1 rather than 1.67:1) second gear to increase versatility when downshifting. In 545RFE usage, an extra taller overdrive ratio is also used. Chrysler decided to refer to it as a [...] "multi-speed automatic".|$|R
50|$|A 4-speed {{transaxle}} which {{replaced the}} 125, {{was created for}} the 1985-1986 GM C platform (FWD)/GM H platform (FWD) cars, the Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4. Virtually no internal parts were shared with the 125, and overdrive was achieved by departing radically from the standard single Simpson compound <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset's</b> common sungear layout. This transaxle was first used in GM's 1985 Buick Park Avenue, Oldsmobile 98, and Cadillac Deville. In 1986, after switching to FWD, the Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile Delta 88, and later, the Pontiac Bonneville also used this transaxle. The 440-T4 was later renamed the 4T60 under GM's new transmission naming convention. A version of the 4T60 called the 4T60-HD, which incorporated upgraded final drive hardware but was otherwise mechanically indistinguishable from standard units, {{was used in the}} 1989-1990 Pontiac Grand Prix with the turbocharged engine. GM started adding electronic controls to the 4T60 in 1990 with the Cadillac Allante carline's unique F7, and after 1991 with the corporate 4T60-E.|$|R
40|$|A {{multi-mode}} power-split (MMPS) hybrid {{electric vehicle}} (HEV) has two <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets</b> and clutches/grounds which results in several operation modes with enhanced electric drive capability and better fuel economy. Basically, the battery storage system is involved in different operation modes to satisfy the power demand and minimize the fuel consumption, whereas the complicated operation modes with frequent charging/discharging will absolutely influence the battery life because of degradation. In this paper, firstly, we introduce the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film growth model based on the previous study of the battery degradation principles and was verified according to the test data. We consider both the fuel economy and battery degradation as a multi-objective problem for MMPS HEV by normalization with a weighting factor. An instantaneous optimization is implemented based on the equivalent fuel consumption concept. Then the control strategy is implemented on a simulation framework integrating the MMPS powertrain model and the SEI film growth map model over some typical driving cycles, such as New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). Finally, the result demonstrates that these two objectives are conflicting and the trade-off reduces the battery degradation with fuel sacrifice. Additionally, the analysis reveals how the mode selection will reflect the battery degradation...|$|R
50|$|The TBR {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the uneven torque-split feature in the planetary-type Torsen III. The <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> allows a Torsen III center differential to distribute torque unevenly between front and rear axles during normal (full traction) operation without inducing wind-up in the drivetrain. This feature is independent of the Torque Bias Ratio.|$|E
50|$|The ST300 had a three-element torque converter, a {{front and}} rear multiple-disc clutch pack, and a {{compound}} <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> with a front band and a clutch pack for reverse and manual low gear. The unit was cooled with a small auxiliary oil cooler located beneath the engine radiator. It had a die cast aluminum case, and weighed 152 lb.|$|E
50|$|The Simpson gearset is {{now more}} or less obsolete. Other gearsets can make 4 forward gears with just two planetaries. Most modern {{gearboxes}} employ the Ravigneaux <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> design, which produces 4 forward gears from a single set, or a Lepelletier gearset which provides 6 or more forward gears by adding another standard planetary to the Ravigneaux gearset.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shifting}} sequence {{was very}} different and much rougher than the Hydra-Matics that preceded it, or the Super Turbines and Turbo Hydramatics that followed it. The shift from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd range was long and drawn-out, ending with a harsh shift. The reason for this was that three things were happening. Not only was the transmission shifting to a very much higher range ( [...] 2.93 to 1.56, {{but it was also}} simultaneously emptying the fluid coupling and making a mechanical lock-up. The wide gap in the reduction ratio between first and second gears combined with the direct mechanical connection to the engine to create a shift that could be firm enough to lug the engine. Because of the mechanical lock-up, there was sometimes a shudder felt as the transmission shifted into third gear (fourth range) by refilling the fluid coupling. Direct drive (1:1 ratio) is achieved by splitting engine power between the fluid coupling (used for first gear) and the front clutch (used for second gear), which are both applied to provide third gear, effectively locking the <b>planetary</b> <b>gearsets</b> and forcing them to spin at engine speed. The design is unique in that it provides third gear by applying first and second gears at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Third Fixed Gear ratio:(clutches C2+C4 engaged, C1+C3 released)The first <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> pair {{are in a}} {{synchronous}} 1:1 {{fixed gear}} ratio by C4 clutch action, and, by the way, both motor-generators are mutually synchronous, either all as motor, or all as generator.

5000|$|Automatic Drive, which {{combined}} a three-speed <b>planetary</b> <b>gearset</b> and a lock-up torque converter, {{debuted in}} early 1950 as a $201 option on all Studebaker models.

Studebaker's management refused and thereby lost out on {{what could have}} been significant [...] "plus" [...] business.|$|E
