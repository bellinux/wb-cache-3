40|$|Background: Nationally {{representative}} data of {{high school}} students in the U. S. indicate that levels of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> are higher among students in Georgia than in most states. This study seeks to understand the increased risk for <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> among youth in Georgia and make recommendations for prevention and interventions. Methods: Analyses were conducted using the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative dataset sampling {{of high school}} students in grades 9 - 12 in the United States. Data from a total of 13, 583 adolescents were used in the study. <b>Physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> was defined as reporting being hit, slammed into something, or injured with an object or weapon on purpose by someone they were dating or going out with among students who dated or went out with someone during the 12 months before the survey. Cross-sectional analyses of the prevalence of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> victimization by demographic characteristics will be conducted. Results: In the U. S. overall, 10. 3 % {{of high school students}} report any <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence.</b> Among the 38 states including data on <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> in 2013, the state of Georgia ranked third highest (12. 4 %) only preceded by Louisiana (14. 8 %) and Arkansas (13. 8 %) for reports of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence.</b> In Georgia, <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> did not differ by grade level or by sex. However, in terms of race/ethnicity, Hispanic youth (18. 1 %) were significantly more likely than African American youth (9. 6 %) or of white youth (10. 7 %) to report <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence.</b> Conclusion: The state of Georgia has high levels of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> among high school youth and Hispanic high school {{students are more likely to}} report physical dating victimization compared to their peers. Culturally specific risk factors and influences may be an important factor for public health professionals and policy makers to explore to reduce the health disparity and adverse health outcomes associated with dating violence among youth...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the causal relationship between women’s working status and the risk of spousal violence against them. In India, working women tend to be more subject to <b>physical</b> spousal <b>violence</b> than non-working women. Given that there is virtually no option outside marriage for women in India, more spousal violence against working women can be understood as a result of male backlash. However, there are concerns that the positive relationship between women’s labor force participation and <b>physical</b> spousal <b>violence</b> might be driven by reverse causality or omitted variable bias. In this paper, I address these issues by exploiting plausibly exogenous variations in rural women’s working status driven by rainfall shocks and the rice-wheat dichotomy. The IV regression results indicate that women’s working status has a signi…cant negative e¤ect on the incidence of <b>physical</b> spousal <b>violence.</b> Women’s labor force participation will decrease the probability of <b>physical</b> spousal <b>violence</b> by 0. 07. The …ndings suggest that the positive relationship between women’s working status and the <b>physical</b> spousal <b>violence</b> is likely to be a result of endogeneity rather than the male backlash...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess whether <b>physical</b> {{intimate}} partner <b>violence</b> affects the nutritional status of adult women with different levels of body mass index (BMI). This was a population-based cross-sectional study with 625 women selected through complex multistage cluster sampling. Information on <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> was obtained with the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales, and nutritional status was measured as BMI (kg/m 2). A quantile regression model {{was used to assess}} the effect of <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> at all percentiles of BMI distribution. <b>Physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> occurred in 27. 6 % of the women (95 %CI: 20. 0; 35. 2). Mean BMI was 27. 9 kg/m 2 (95 %CI: 27. 1; 28. 7). The results showed that <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> was negatively associated with BMI between the 25 th and 85 th percentiles, corresponding to 22. 9 and 31. 2 kg/m 2.

5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in a cutting. Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included <b>physical</b> <b>violence</b> from onsite security officers.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> and low birth weight. Methods This cross-sectional study included 604 children with approximately 30 days of age who visited four primary health care units {{in the city of}} Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the second dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Children with a birth weight below 2. 500 g were considered underweight. Information regarding <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> was obtained by the Portuguese version of the Conflict Tactics Scale. The study investigated the 12 months prior to interview. <b>Physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> was analyzed as a dichotomous variable and cumulatively. Associations between <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> and low birth weight were verified by logistic regression models based on crude and adjusted odds ratios and their respective 95 % confidence intervals. Results Some (7. 1 %) babies were born underweight, and 33. 6 % of the mothers had been exposed to <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence.</b> <b>Physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> was significantly associated with low birth weight (OR= 3. 69; 95 %CI= 1. 57 - 8. 66). Notably, the odds of low birth weight increase with the severity of violence. Conclusion These findings draw attention to the consequences of <b>physical</b> intimate partner <b>violence</b> on the nutritional status of newborns and emphasize the need of greater attention during prenatal care to improve women's quality of life and to reduce the rate of low birth weight...|$|R
40|$|Zimbabwe {{faces an}} acute {{generalized}} HIV/AIDS epidemic combined with rapidly deteriorating {{economic and political}} conditions, under which levels of domestic violence are on the rise. We aimed to determine possible demographic and behavioral factors associated with <b>physical</b> domestic <b>violence</b> in a rural setting {{in order to better}} inform both national and local domestic violence and HIV prevention policies. Using the Project Accept baseline data set, we selected demographic, socio-economic, and behavioral variables that might be associated with <b>physical</b> domestic <b>violence</b> based on a review of the literature. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out, and odds ratios (OR) were computed using logistic regression. Women reporting <b>physical</b> domestic <b>violence</b> {{were significantly more likely to}} report (i) a history of childhood domestic violence (OR= 2. 96, P< 0. 001), (ii) two or more lifetime partners (OR= 1. 94, P< 0. 001), (iii) some form of sexual abuse as a child (OR= 1. 82, not significant), and (iv) low or medium socio-economic status as measured by type of homestead (OR= 1. 4, P= 0. 04) than women who reported no experience of <b>physical</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> Married women were less likely to experience <b>physical</b> domestic <b>violence</b> than unmarried women (OR= 0. 65, P= 0. 011). Women at greatest risk of domestic violence include those with a personal history of violence or sexual abuse, multiple lifetime partners, and low or medium socio-economic status. Risk assessments and joint interventions for both domestic violence reduction and HIV prevention should target these population groups, which are effective both on the public health and global heath diplomacy levels...|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the attackers}} {{seem to have}} wanted to force the Jews to convert, {{although}} they were also interested in acquiring money from them. <b>Physical</b> <b>violence</b> against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, {{did their best to}} protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home. The attacks on the Jews were witnessed by Ekkehard of Aura and Albert of Aix; among the Jewish communities, the main contemporary witnesses were the Mainz Anonymous, Eliezer ben Nathan, and Solomon bar Simson.|$|E

40|$|PurposeOne {{suggested}} {{approach to}} preventing adolescent dating violence {{is to prevent}} behavioral precursors to dating violence, such as bullying. However, no longitudinal study has examined bullying as a behavioral precursor to dating violence. In this study, longitudinal data were used to examine (1) whether direct and indirect bullying perpetration {{in the sixth grade}} predicted the onset of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> perpetration by the eighth grade and (2) whether the associations varied by sex and race/ethnicity of the adolescent. MethodsData were collected in school from sixth graders in three primarily rural counties and then again when students were in the eighth grade. Analyses were conducted with 1, 154 adolescents who had not perpetrated dating violence at the sixth-grade assessment. The sample was 47 % male, 29 % black, and 10 % of another race/ethnicity than black or white. ResultsDirect bullying, defined as hitting, slapping, or picking on another kid in the sixth grade, predicted the onset of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> perpetration by the eighth grade, controlling for indirect bullying and potential confounders. Although indirect bullying, defined as spreading false rumors and excluding students from friendship groups, was associated with the onset of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> perpetration in bivariate analyses, it did not predict the onset of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence</b> when controlling for direct bullying. None of the associations examined varied by sex or race/ethnicity of the adolescents. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that efforts targeted at preventing direct bullying may also prevent the onset of <b>physical</b> dating <b>violence.</b> 13 IPA 1303570 /PHS HHS/United States 13 IPA 130569 /PHS HHS/United StatesCC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United StatesR 01 DA 13459 /DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesR 49 CCV 423114 /PHS HHS/United StatesR 49 CE 423114 /CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 01 - 06 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24768162 PMC 470249...|$|R

Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott.

25|$|Although {{females are}} less likely than males to {{initiate}} <b>physical</b> <b>violence,</b> they can express aggression by using a variety of non-physical means. Exactly which method women use to express aggression is something that varies from culture to culture. On Bellona Island, a culture based on male dominance and <b>physical</b> <b>violence,</b> women tend to get into conflicts with other women more frequently than with men. When in conflict with males, instead of using physical means, they make up songs mocking the man, which spread across the island and humiliate him. If a woman wanted to kill a man, she would either convince her male relatives to kill him or hire an assassin. Although these two methods involve <b>physical</b> <b>violence,</b> both are forms of indirect aggression, since the aggressor herself avoids getting directly involved or putting herself in immediate physical danger.|$|E
