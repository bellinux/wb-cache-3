The increasing application in clinical practice explains this machine's success. The benefits of this type of extracorporeal circulation are that a lower consumption of blood and blood products is observed in the peri-operative and post-operative phase and that a lower inflammatory response is being measured in peri-operative blood samples in comparison to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThere is {{increasing}} awareness that erythrocyte transfusions after pediatric cardiac surgery have deleterious effects. Despite reports of decreased transfusion requirements associated with smaller cardiopulmonary bypass circuits, {{the relationship between}} circuit <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> and need for transfusion has not been systematically examined. MethodsPediatric patients at our institution who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass between January 2005 and December 2010 were reviewed. Demographics, intraoperative data, and transfusion of {{packed red blood cells}} were retrospectively recorded. Cardiopulmonary bypass <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> was indexed by patient body surface area. Logistic regression analysis was used to correlate these variables with need for transfusion. ResultsIn the perioperative period, 1912 patients received transfusions and 266 did not. In univariate analysis, indexed <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} transfusion (odds ratio, 1. 007; P < . 001). Other significant variables in univariate analysis included age, surgeon, Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1 (RACHS- 1) category, preoperative hemoglobin, total bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, use and duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, lowest body core temperature, and cardiopulmonary bypass flow rate. Previous cardiac surgery was not a significant predictor. In multivariable analysis controlling for RACHS- 1 category, surgeon, minimal core body temperature, and preoperative hemoglobin, indexed <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> remained an independent predictor of transfusion (odds ratio, 1. 006; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 005 - 1. 007, P < . 001). ConclusionsPerioperative need for transfusion in pediatric cardiac surgical patients is independently related to the <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. It therefore seems prudent to minimize circuit <b>prime</b> <b>volumes</b> to avoid unnecessary use of blood products...|$|R

40|$|Reduction of priming {{volumes of}} the {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB) circuit in neonatal cardiac surgery to decrease haemodilution and blood transfusion requirements can be achieved {{with the use of}} neonatal low prime oxygenators and smaller diameter tubing. We have further reduced our prime volume {{with the use of a}} custom-designed arm allowing for remote positioning of a double-headed roller pump. This arm enables the double pump to be placed alongside the main heart-lung machine close to the operating table, and to position the pump inlet and outlet tubing immediately at the reservoir outlet and oxygenator inlet, respectively, therefore reducing tubing lengths. Priming volumes of four cases using this configuration were compared to four cases using our standard neonatal bypass setup. Results showed a 29 % decrease in <b>priming</b> <b>volume</b> and a 58 % reduction in blood utilization during CPB. This reduction in <b>priming</b> <b>volume</b> is clinically significant as it lowers the ratio of <b>priming</b> <b>volume</b> to patient blood volume and reduces homologous blood requirements...|$|E

40|$|Microstructure-sensitive creep {{models have}} been {{developed}} for Ni-base superalloy single crystals. Creep rupture testing was conducted on fourteen single crystal alloys at two applied stress levels at each of two temperatures, 982 and 1093 C. The variation in creep lives among the different alloys could be explained with regression models containing relatively few microstructural parameters. At 982 C, gamma-gamma prime lattice mismatch, gamma <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> fraction, and initial gamma prime size were statistically significant in explaining the creep rupture lives. At 1093 C, only lattice mismatch and gamma <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> fraction were significant. These models could explain from 84 to 94 percent of the variation in creep lives, depending on test condition. Longer creep lives were associated with alloys having more negative lattice mismatch, lower gamma <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> fractions, and finer gamma prime sizes. The gamma-gamma prime lattice mismatch exhibited the strongest influence of all the microstructural parameters at both temperatures. Although a majority of the alloys in this study were stable with respect to topologically close packed (TCP) phases, it appeared that up to approximately 2 vol% TCP phase did not affect the 1093 C creep lives under applied stresses that produced lives of approximately 200 to 300 h. In contrast, TCP phase contents of approximately 2 vol% were detrimental at lower applied stresses where creep lives were longer. A regression model was also developed for the as-heat treated initial gamma prime size; this model showed that gamma prime solvus temperature, gamma-gamma prime lattice mismatch, and bulk Re content were all statistically significant...|$|R

Transfusion-free pediatric cardiac surgery is unrealistic {{for the vast majority of}} procedures in neonates or small infants; however, considerable progress has been made by using techniques that decrease the need for homologous blood products or even allow bloodless surgery in older infants and children. These techniques involve a decrease in <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> by downsizing the bypass circuit with the help of vacuum-assisted venous drainage, microplegia, autologous blood predonation with or without infusion of recombinant (erythropoietin), cell salvaging, ultrafiltration and retrograde autologous priming.

40|$|The {{recent efforts}} on {{improving}} the physiological aspects of heart-lung perfusion techniques concern mainly two areas {{connected with the}} extracorporeal system. These are the reduction of <b>priming</b> <b>volume</b> required in the oxygenator and the requirement for a monitored control of the blood's gas exchange parameters to maintain a more physiological perfusion during bypass. This thesis presents a contribution in these areas. First, this thesis presents a heart-lung system specifically designed to operate in conjunction with an improved Kay Cross disc oxygenator. This oxygenator requires exclusive control features, not generally available in commercial units, since it performs the dual function of heat-exchanging and oxygenating the blood. This dual function provides an overall reduction in the systems <b>priming</b> <b>volume.</b> Secondly, a unique Rotating Cylinder oxygenator design, demonstrating a 1 / 3 <b>priming</b> <b>volume</b> requirement over the equivalent Kay Cross model, is presented and evaluated for clinical suitability.

A prospective, randomized trial was conducted in 49 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery either {{with the use of a}} standard or mini-CPB system (Synergy). We determined early postoperative inflammatory response (leukocytosis, C-reactive protein, urine interleukin- 6), platelet consumption and activation (urine thromboxane B 2), proximal renal tubular injury (urine N-acetyl-glucosaminidase), and intestinal injury (intestinal fatty acid binding protein). Results. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with a mini-CPB system, we observed decreased <b>priming</b> <b>volumes</b> with subsequent attenuation of on-pump hemodilution, improved hemostatic status with reduced platelet consumption and platelet activation, decreased postoperative bleeding and minimized transfusion requirements. We also found reduced leukocytosis and decreased urinary interleukin- 6. Levels of urine N-acetyl-glucosaminidase were on average threefold lower, and urinary intestinal fatty acid binding protein was 40 % decreased in the patients on the mini-CPB system, as compared with standard CPB. Conclusions. The use of the mini-CPB system during myocardial revascularization represents a viable non-pharmacologic strategy that can attenuate the alterations in the hemostatic system, reduce bleeding and transfusion requirements, decrease systemic inflammatory response, and reduce immediate postoperative renal and intestinal tissue injury...|$|R

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. Inconel 617 is a solid-solution-strengthened Ni-based superalloy {{with a small amount of}} gamma prime (γ′) present. Here, samples are examined in the as-received condition and after creep exposure at 923 K (650 °C) for 574 hours and 45, 000 hours and at 973 K (700 °C) for 4000 hours. The stress levels are intermediate (estimated, respectively, as of the order of 350, 275, and 200 MPa) and at levels of interest for the future operation of power plant. The hardness of the specimens has been measured in the gage length and the head. TEM thin foils have been obtained to quantify dislocation densities (3. 5 × 10 [Superscript: 13] for the as-received, 5. 0 × 10 [Superscript: 14], 5. 9 × 10 [Superscript: 14], and 3. 5 × 10 [Superscript: 14] lines/m[Superscript: 2] for the creep-exposed specimens, respectively). There are no previous data in the literature for dislocation densities in this alloy after creep exposure. There is some evidence from the dislocation densities that for the creep-exposed samples, the higher hardness in the gage length in comparison with the creep test specimen head is due to work hardening rather than any other effect. Carbon replicas have been used to extract gamma prime precipitates. The morphology of γ′ precipitates in the ‘as-received’ condition was spheroidal with an average diameter of 18 nm. The morphology of these particles does not change with creep exposure but the size increases to 30 nm after 574 hours at 923 K (650 °C) but with little coarsening in 45, 000 hours. At 973 K (700 °C) 4000 hours, the average gamma prime size is 32 nm. In the TEM images of the replicas, the particles overlap, and therefore, a methodology has been developed to estimate the volume fraction of gamma prime in the alloy given the carbon replica film thickness. The results are 5. 8 vol pct in the as-received and then 2. 9, 3. 2, and 3. 4 vol pct, respectively, for the creep-exposed specimens. The results are compared with predictions from thermodynamic analysis given the alloy compositions. Thermodynamic prediction shows that nitrogen content is important in determining the gamma <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> fraction. This has not previously been identified in the literature. The higher the nitrogen content, the lower the gamma <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> fraction. This may explain inconsistencies between previous experimental estimates of gamma <b>prime</b> <b>volume</b> fraction in the literature and the results here. The observed decrease in the γ′ volume fraction with creep exposure would correspond to an increase in TiN. At present, there are insufficient experimental data to prove that this predicted relationship occurs in practice. However, it is observed that there is a higher volume fraction of TiN precipitates in the gage length of a creep sample than in the head. This suggests that secondary TiN particles are precipitating at the expense of existing γ′ due to the ingress of N from the atmosphere, possibly via creep cracks penetrating in from the surface of the gage length. This effect is not expected to be observed in real components which are much larger and operate in different atmospheres. However, this highlights the need to be conscious of this possibility when carrying out creep testing. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
