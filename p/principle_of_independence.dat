[...] Transparency International condemned the anti-Macovei motion, stating that the text voted by the Senate was [...] "written in a superficial manner and motivated by political reasons, ignoring the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> of judiciary."

2500|$|In the Fisher model, {{the fates}} of the balls are {{independent}} {{and there is}} no dependence between draws. We may as well take all n balls at the same time. Each ball has no [...] "knowledge" [...] of what happens to the other balls. For the same reason, {{it is impossible to know}} the value of n before the experiment. If we tried to fix the value of n then we would have no way of preventing ball number n+1 from being taken without violating the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> between balls. n is therefore a random variable, and the Fisher distribution is a conditional distribution which can only be determined after the experiment when n is observed. The unconditional distribution is two independent binomials, one for each color.|$|E
60|$|What a woman! And {{how true}} were Myra's last words at Hurstley, that {{women would be}} his best friends in life! He ceased to think; and, {{dropping}} into his chair, fell into a reverie, in which {{the past and the}} future seemed to blend, with some mingling of a vague and almost ecstatic present. It was a dream of fair women, and even fairer thoughts, domestic tenderness and romantic love, mixed up with strange vicissitudes of lofty and fiery action, and passionate passages of eloquence and power. The clock struck and roused him from his musing. He fell from the clouds. Could he accept this boon? Was his doing so consistent with that <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>independence</b> on which he had resolved to build up his life? The boon thus conferred might be recalled and returned; not legally indeed, but by a stronger influence than any law--the consciousness on his part that the feeling of interest in his life which had prompted it might change--would, must change. It was the romantic impulse of a young and fascinating woman, who had been to him invariably kind, but who had a reputation for caprice, which was not unknown to him. It was a wild and beautiful adventure; but only that.|$|E
