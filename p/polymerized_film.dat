Co-SOSIP of different propagators showed an increase in photocurrent generation activity up to 40 times compared to single color devices.

The polymer is built up via a solid-state oxidative coupling which occurs between tetrafunctionalized semiamphiphilic porphyrins preorganized as a regular paving of the plane by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. The precursor LB film, together with the polymerized one, is extensively studied. Hence, {{the orientation of the}} macrocyclic rings before and after the oxidative coupling is derived from linear dichroism, electron spin resonance, and X-ray measurements. The oxidative coupling itself is followed by infrared and Raman spectroscopy. Evidence is given for the formation of covalent links between adjacent porphyrins within each monolayer. Transmission X-ray experiments indicate {{the emergence of a new}} crystalline phase in the plane of the monolayer after the two-dimensional oxidative coupling. The solubility behavior of the precursor and polymerized LB films is consistent with the polymerization process. This two-dimensional polymer exhibits outstanding mechanical properties since holes up to 0. 01 mm 2 in area can be bridged by only one monolayer. This strengthening of the lateral cohesion of the film, when compared with classical LB films, is consistent with the two-dimensional character of the polymerization process.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{detecting}} thin film thickness with reflectometric interference spectroscopy (Rifs) methods, a phenomenon of “double peak ” often appears in reflected spectrum, which seems like some adjacent peaks being connected very closely, and which is different from reflected spectrum as usual. Spectrum analysis and simulating are used to find why this occurs. It is found that this phenomenon {{is associated with the}} uneven surface of film, when uneven degree of film increases, “double peak ” begin to appear. That is, when thickness value of detecting point changing, light was reflected at different thickness point of film, all these reflected spectrum are added to produce total reflected spectrum, and lead “double peak ” to occur. “Double peaks ” are easy to see when film thickness changes greatly. But simulating results also show the “double peak ” won’t affect detecting precision, because the wavelength position of extrema being same as usual position of reflected spectrum without “double peak”. The reason is that the wavelength position of extrema is the only important thing to calculate film thickness, and the thickness being calculated through Rifs is the mean value of film. A series of simulating results are provided, as well as actual experimental result with “double peak ” phenomenon. Simulating results of <b>polymerized</b> <b>film</b> show that the “double peak ” occurs after thickness difference exceed 1 / 10.
