Iran's national Internet connectivity infrastructure is based on two major networks: the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and the <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network.</b> The PSTN provides a connection for end-users to Internet service providers (ISPs) over mostly digital lines and supports modem-based connections. The Data Communication Company of Iran (DCI), a subsidiary of TCI, operates the <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network.</b> Iran's external Internet links use the basic Internet protocol of TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol) via satellite exclusively. For data lines, copper, fiber, satellite and microwave are the available media, and popular services are high-speed Internet via digital subscriber lines (DSL), high-bandwidth lease lines and satellite. About 33 Iranian cities are connected directly by the Trans-Asia-Europe cable network, or [...] "silk road", connecting China to Europe. According to the Statistical Center of Iran, 13.5 million households (i.e. 55.5% of all Iranians) have access to the internet (2016). Of this number, 7 million households have access to fixed high-speed internet connection and 10.7 million households have access to wireless high-speed internet.

40|$|Datanet 1 and the {{convergence}} of the computer and telecommunications  This article describes {{the efforts of the}} Dutch national company for telecommunication, PTT, in introducing and developing a public network for data communication in the Netherlands in the last decades of the twentieth century. As early as the 1960 s, private companies started to connect their local computers. As a result, small private computer networks started to emerge. As the state company offering general access to public services in telephony, the PTT strove to develop a <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network,</b> accessible to every user and telephone subscriber. This ambition was realized with Datanet 1, the <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network</b> which was officially opened in 1982. In the years that followed, Datanet became the dominant network for data transmission, despite competing efforts by private companies and computer manufacturers. The large-scale application of Datanet in public municipal administration serves as a case study for the development of data communication in practice, that shows that there was a gradual migration from X- 25 to TCP/IP protocols. The article concludes by stating that the introduction and development of data transmission transformed the role of the PTT in Dutch society, brought new working practices, new services and new responsibilities, and resulted in a whole new phase {{in the history of the}} computer...|$|E
40|$|In an {{external}} architecture for testing communication protocols, the service provider is an abstraction {{of the stack}} of protocols and the <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network</b> interconnecting the lower tester with the implementation under test. In this paper, {{the effects of a}} <b>public</b> <b>data</b> <b>network</b> are studied (i. e. the service provider) when testing a protocol implementation's conformity to its speci"cation. The three main characteristics of a service provider are dynamic round trip delay (RTD), message buffering and lossy transmission. It is shown that if proper care is not taken in test architectures and test cases, the dynamic attributes of a service provider may make correct test cases useless. The outline of the paper is as follows. First, the notion of a time server protocol (TSP) in a test architecture to estimate the RTD dynamically in the service provider is introduced. The generalization capability of neural networks is used as the central idea in the dynamic estimation of RTDs from previous actual measurement of delays. Second, the notion of a test architecture's reliability and the properties that a reliable architecture must satisfy are de"ned. A reliable test architecture is obtained by augmenting a basic test architecture with a TSP and a "lter protocol to discard spurious events. Finally, some dif"culties in assigning test verdicts are studied and measures are suggested for overcoming them. Thus, an extended service provider is designed by augmenting the actual service provider with the new components. This work proposes an interface to an extended service provider to conceal the side-effects of the bare service provider...|$|E
