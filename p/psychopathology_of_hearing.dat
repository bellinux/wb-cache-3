50|$|<b>Psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> Everyday Life (Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens) is a 1901 work by Sigmund Freud, {{based on}} Freud's {{researches}} into slips and parapraxes from 1897 onwards. The <b>Psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> Everyday Life became perhaps the best-known of all Freud's writings.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{called the}} Mistake Book (to {{go with the}} Dream Book and the Joke Book), The <b>Psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> Everyday Life {{became one of the}} {{scientific}} classics of the 20th century. Freud realised he was becoming a celebrity when he found his cabin-steward reading the Mistake Book on his 1909 visit to the States. The Rat Man came to Freud for analysis as a result <b>of</b> reading the <b>Psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> Everyday Life. Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan considered The <b>Psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> Everday Life one of the three key texts for an understanding of the unconscious, alongside The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), and Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious (1905). Through its stress on what Freud called [...] "switch words" [...] and [...] "verbal bridges", The <b>Psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> Everyday Life is considered important for psychopathology.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present paper is on {{sketching}} a <b>psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> the body in schizophrenia. Our hypothesis is that the psychopathological alterations of the lived body {{are closely related to}} spatiotemporal alterations in the brain’s resting state. Hence our plea for a spatiotemporal <b>psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> embodiment. We will shed some light on the resting state itself, its spatiotemporal structure and self-specific organisation and then address the resting state’s spatial and temporal abnormalities in schizophrenia and how they account for the abnormal experience of body, time, and space in this psychopathological condition. Finally, we sketch the implications <b>of</b> such spatiotemporal <b>psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> embodiment that concerns the spatialization and temporalization and self-specification of the lived body and its intero-, proprio- and extero-ceptive input by the resting state’s spatiotemporal structure and self-specific organisation...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To review {{scientific}} literature concerning the prevalence, childhood outcome and adult outcome {{of child sexual}} abuse, and the hypothetical models that have been postulated to explain its psychopathology. Method: Selective critical review of literature. Results: Estimates of prevalence of sexual abuse suggest {{that a significant number}} of children of both sexes are affected. Research into the <b>psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> sexual abuse is hindered by methodological problems. However, sexual abuse has been associated with a number of psychiatric disorders and maladaptive lifestyles in childhood and adulthood. Several theoretical models <b>of</b> the <b>psychopathology</b> <b>of</b> child sexual abuse are examined and compared. Conclusions: A transactional model is the most comprehensive and encompassing...|$|R
