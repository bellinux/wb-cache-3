40|$|Abstract — At {{the time}} of {{transformer}} energization, a high current will be drawn by the transformer. This current is called transient inrush current and it may rise to ten times the nominal full load current of transformer during operation. Energization transient can produce mechanical stress in the transformer causes protection system mal-function. This current often affects the power system quality and may disrupt the operation of sensitive electrical loads such as computer and medical equipment connected to the system. Reduction {{and the way to}} control energization transient currents have become important concerns to the power industry. Conventionally, controlled switching or point on wave switching was the method being used to counter the problem, but this method requires the knowledge of residual fluxes of transformer before energization, which was quite tedious to get. Hence, this paper proposes a technique to mitigate inrush current in three phase transformers which involves injecting some amount of DC flux in the primary of transformer, the process known as <b>prefluxing.</b> After setting the initial fluxes of the transformer it is energized by conventional controlled switching. To verify the efficientness of the proposed <b>prefluxing</b> method to mitigate inrush current for power transformer, a MATLAB simulation model is designed and developed. The results are verified using the sample in which transformer is connect with a supply source, which have conformed the efficient inrush current control.

40|$|Whole body calcium influx, branchial calcium efflux, and renal Ca 2 + {{excretion}} {{were measured}} in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) either exposed to environmental hypercapnia or infused intra-arterially with NaHCO 3. These experiments {{were performed to}} assess the potential impact on Ca 2 + balance {{of the changes in}} gill morphology that are known to accompany acid-base disturbances in this species. After 48 hours of environmental hypercapnia, gill filamental chloride cell fractional area was significantly reduced. Despite this reduction, and the presumed involvement of the chloride cell in calcium influx, whole body calcium influx was increased after 12 hours of hypercapnia and remained elevated for 48 hours. Branchial calcium efflux was unaltered during hypercapnia exposure, whereas renal Ca 2 + excretion was elevated over <b>preflux</b> values only at 6 hours of hypercapnia. Measurement of the kinetics of whole body calcium influx after 48 hours of hypercapnia revealed {{a significant increase in the}} maximal uptake rate of Ca 2 + yet the affinity constant of Ca 2 + uptake was unaffected. Measurements of high-affinity. Ca 2 +-ATPase activities and ATP-dependent Ca 2 + transport of gill basolateral membrane vesicles revealed that the ATP-dependent Ca 2 + extrusion mechanism of the gills was not affected by hypercapnia. The results of this study clearly show that the reduced chloride cell surface area that accompanies hypercapnia in trout does not impair calcium homeostasis. Whole body Ca 2 + influx was significantly increased after 6 hours of NaHCO 3 infusion and remained elevated throughout the duration of the experiment. Branchial and renal Ca 2 + effluxes were largely unaffected by NaHCO 3 infusion. Plasma total Ca 2 + concentrations were significantly decreased after 6 hours of NaHCO 3 infusion and remained so until 48 hours. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
