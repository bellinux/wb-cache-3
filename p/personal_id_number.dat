40|$|In {{record linkage}} (RL), or exact file matching, {{the goal is}} to {{identify}} the links between entities with information on two or more files. RL is an important activity in areas including counting the population, enhancing survey frames and data, and conducting epidemiological and follow-up studies. RL is challenging when files are very large, no accurate <b>personal</b> identification (<b>ID)</b> <b>number</b> is present on all files for all units, and some information is recorded with error. Without an unique <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> one must rely on comparisons of names, addresses, dates, and other information to find the links. Latent class models can be used to automatically score the value of information for determining match status. Data for fitting models come from comparisons made within groups of units that pass initial file blocking requirements. Data distributions can vary across blocks. This article examines the use of prior information and hierarchical latent class models in the context of RL. Comment: 14 pages, 0 figure...|$|R

50|$|In Sweden {{there is}} no {{explicit}} law on obligation of identification. But still the police can demand identification in case of crime suspicion, {{because they have the}} duty to identify the identity of suspects. A person who is suspect of a crime giving a fine or an extra fee, such as no local traffic ticket, and are without an identity card, are suspect of identity fraud, a crime that can give prison and warrants an arrest. Normally those are brought to the police station and are asked for their name and <b>personal</b> <b>id</b> <b>number</b> and are checked against the photo stored in the passport or driver's license database. A fine is not given if the identity is given correctly. Driver's licenses are valid as identification card in Sweden.

30|$|The {{farmers in}} the {{experimental}} auction were each assigned a <b>personal</b> <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> and given a bag of bidding tickets {{so as to be}} able to bid anonymously during the auction experiment. Once the farmers were all seated, the coordinator explained that the experimental auction consisted of various rounds (depending on the treatment) and that each participant would make various bids to acquire digestate. With all the rounds over, one round would randomly be selected to reveal the auction winner and the second highest bid which would represent the market price (Vickrey auction) (Vickrey 1961). The number of rounds depended on the experiment treatment the farmer had been allocated to but in never treatment, after each round, data on the highest bid and the second highest bid which determined the sale price were provided.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper aims to {{recognize}} <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> from {{three types of}} valid identification documents in China: the first-generation ID card, the second-generation ID card and the driver license of motor vehicle. We have proposed an approach using local similarity voting to automatically recognize <b>ID</b> <b>numbers.</b> Firstly, we extract the candidate region which contains <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and then locate the numbers and characters. Secondly, we recognize the numbers by an improved template matching method based on the local similarity voting. Finally, we verify the <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and characters. We have applied the proposed approach {{to a set of}} about 100 images which are shot by conventional digital cameras. The experimental results have demonstrated that this approach is efficient and is robust to the change of illumination and rotation. The recognition accuracy is up to 98 %.

50|$|This concept can be {{illustrated}} with an analogy. Imagine that two companies, X and Y, each assign <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> to their employees. X {{should not have}} two employees with the same <b>ID</b> <b>number,</b> and likewise for Y; {{but it is not}} a problem for the same <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> to be used at both companies. For example, if Bill works for company X and Jane works for company Y, then it is not a problem for each of them to be employee #123. In this analogy, the <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> is the identifier, and the company serves as the namespace. It does not cause problems for the same identifier to identify a different person in each namespace.|$|R
