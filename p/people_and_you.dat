You can be your own person, treat people with respect, be very demanding but demanding in a way that doesn't trample on <b>people.</b> <b>And</b> <b>you</b> don't have to give up your faith to win in the NFL. It confirmed and re-affirmed an awful lot of the beliefs I held about coaching....|$|E

I {{want to thank you}} for all the trouble that you have gone to, to send me to college and to bring me up, you have really been wonderful. My thanks to Ella Lee [...] for letting me stay with her during my college career, and to Belva Jo [...] for putting up with me the way she did, she had to I know, but I fell in love with her about a week ago, if she was older I would have asked her to marry me, but that would be impossible.|$|E
2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside." [...] The book took four and a half years and seven revisions to complete.|$|E

50|$|And so I'm {{telling you}} as my {{superior}} about what I have found out. I am telling <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> are wise <b>and</b> <b>you</b> should keep these words for yourself, {{so that no}} many <b>people</b> know, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> should take proper guard.|$|R

50|$|In {{this world}} {{it is very}} {{important}} where <b>you</b> come from, <b>and</b> that is because <b>people</b> are prejudiced <b>and</b> afraid of strangers. Different places produce different kinds of <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> who <b>you</b> are is determined by where you are from.|$|R
