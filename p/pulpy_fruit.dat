60|$|At {{a certain}} {{season of the}} year, when {{the fruit of the}} hundred groves of the valley has reached its maturity, and hangs in golden spheres from every branch, the islanders {{assemble}} in harvest groups, and garner in the abundance which surrounds them. The trees are stripped of their nodding burdens, which, easily freed from the rind and core, are gathered together in capacious wooden vessels, where the <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruit</b> is soon worked by a stone pestle, vigorously applied, into a blended mass of a doughy consistency called by the natives “Tutao.” This is then divided into separate parcels, which, after being made up into stout packages, enveloped in successive folds of leaves, and bound round with thongs of bark, are stored away in large receptacles hollowed in the earth, from whence they are drawn as occasion may require.|$|E

After three days spent without food or water, in the desert, one is not particular. While we were still eating the fruit, the lady of my vision set her companion to work to partially flay the oribé which her dogs had killed, and busied herself in making a fire of fallen boughs. As soon as it burned brightly she took strips of the oribé flesh, toasted them, and gave them to us on leaves. We ate, and now were allowed a little more water. After that she took Tota to the spring and washed her, which she sadly needed, poor child! Next came our turn to wash, and oh, the joy of it! ...|$|E

5000|$|Chrysobalanus attains {{a maximum}} height of 25 or 30 feet (8-10 m). It {{is found in}} coastal areas as a wild plant, and is {{frequently}} planted in gardens. It has a low-growing and sprawling habit. It can form dense stands and become invasive. The leaves are obovate or obcordate in outline, about 2in long, thick, glossy, and deep green in color. It has small white flowers, in axillary racemes or cymes, not too showy, {{but they have a}} dainty and sweet fragrance. This plant bears a damson-sized edible red <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruit</b> with a black and thin skin, resembles a large plum in appearance, being oval 1.5in long. The sweet fruits with white flesh, which is cottony and of insipid taste, adheres closely to the large oblong seed turn from creamy tones to dark-blue pleasing tasty peaches which can be made into a sweet preserved jam, made by the earliest arrivals to the low-lying Florida peninsula.

50|$|Asian palm civets are omnivores {{utilizing}} fruits such as {{berries and}} <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits</b> {{as a major}} food source, and thus help to maintain tropical forest ecosystems via seed dispersal. They eat chiku, mango, rambutan and coffee, but also small mammals and insects. Ecologically, they fill a similar niche in Asia as common raccoons in North America. They {{play an important role}} in the natural regeneration of Pinanga kuhlii and P. zavana palms at Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. They also feed on palm flower sap, which when fermented becomes toddy, a sweet liquor. Because of this habit, they are called the toddy cat.|$|R
50|$|A {{juvenile}} {{specimen of}} Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. Pinacosaurus and other ankylosaurs likely relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Though Pinacosaurus may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants, they may have had a more varied diet, including tough leaves and <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits.</b> Inversely, this might suggest ant-eater-like insectivorous behaviour.|$|R
5000|$|The large, edible, <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits</b> of {{some members}} {{typically}} called anona by Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking {{people of the}} family's Neotropical range, include species of Annona: custard apple (A. reticulata), cherimoya (A. cherimola), soursop/guanábana/graviola (A. muricata), sweetsop (A. squamosa), ilama (A. diversifolia), soncoya (A. purpurea), atemoya (a cross between A. cherimola and A. squamosa); and biriba (Rollinia deliciosa, which may require reclassification under Annona.). The names of many of those fruits are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, consumption of the neotropical annonaceous plant Annona muricata (soursop, graviola, guanabana) has been strongly associated as a causal agent in [...] "atypical Parkinsonism". The causative agent, annonacin, is present {{in many of the}} Annonaceae. It is thought to be responsible for up to 70% of Parkinsonian conditions in Guadeloupe. Exposure is typically through traditional food and natural medicines.|$|R
50|$|The {{golden lion tamarin}} has a diverse, {{omnivorous}} diet {{consisting of}} fruits, flowers, nectar, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates. They rely on microhabitats for foraging and other daily activities and tamarins will use bromeliads, palm crowns, palm leaf sheaths, woody crevices, lianas, vine tangles, tree bark, rotten logs, and leaf litters. The golden lion tamarin uses its fingers to extract prey from crevices, under leaves, and in dense growth; a behavior known as micromanipulation. It is made possible by elongated hands and fingers. Insects make up to 10-15% of its diet. Much of the rest is made of small, sweet, <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits.</b> During the rainy season, the golden lion tamarin mainly eats fruit, however during drier times, it must eat more of other foods like nectar and gums. Small vertebrates are also consumed more at these times as insects become less abundant.|$|R
500|$|Like other ornithischians, Ankylosaurus was herbivorous. Its wide muzzle {{was adapted}} for non-selective low-browse cropping, {{although}} comparisons of beak shape with [...] Euoplocephalus suggest {{it was more}} selective than the latter. Ankylosaurus likely feed on [...] abundant ferns and low bushes. Though ankylosaurs may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants, {{they may have had}} a more varied diet, including tough leaves and <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits.</b> The retraced position of the nostrils, which have been compared to those of fossorial worm lizards and blind snakes, may have allowed Ankylosaurus to dig in the ground for roots and tubers. It could also have occasionally eaten small invertebrates. With its low center of gravity, it would to have been unable to knock down trees as in modern elephants, and is unlikely to have been capable of stripping off and chewing bark. Assuming it was endothermic, Ankylosaurus would have eaten [...] of food per day.|$|R
50|$|Like other ornithischians, Ankylosaurus was herbivorous. Its wide muzzle {{was adapted}} for non-selective low-browse cropping. The teeth of Ankylosaurus were worn {{on the face}} of the crowns, rather than on the tip of the crowns, as in nodosaurid ankylosaurs. In 1982, Carpenter {{ascribed}} two very small teeth to baby Ankylosaurus, which originate from the Lance and Hell Creek Formations and measure 3.2 to 3.3 mm in length, respectively. The smaller tooth is heavily worn, leading Carpenter to suggest that ankylosaurids in general or at least the babies did not swallow their food whole but employed some sort of chewing. Though ankylosaurs may not have fed on fibrous and woody plants, they may have had a more varied diet, including tough leaves and <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits.</b> Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{urbanization}} and deforestation have {{enhanced the}} opportunities of contact {{between humans and}} monkeys {{and the impact of}} human activities on primate behavior is receiving growing attention. This study explores whether activity budgets and diet of a group of capuchin monkeys (Cebus libidinosus) inhabiting the area of the swimming pools of the National Park of Brasília is affected by the presence of visitors providing food to them. During one year, both in the dry and the wet seasons, we scored capuchins' behavior via scan sampling every ten minutes. Results showed that this group spent less time foraging for wild foods than other comparable groups living in similar habitats. Moreover, capuchins relied more on human food during the dry season, when <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits</b> were less available, than in the wet season. Our findings confirm other studies on different monkey species that have shown that access to human food decreases the time spent foraging for wild food and the home range size. They also show that capuchins are able to modify their diet, to exploit alternative food sources, and to change their activity budget in response to the availability of new food opportunities and to seasonal food availability...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{comparative}} feeding ecology of three species of colobus (Procolobus badius, Procolobus verus, and Colobus polykomos) on Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone. We collected dietary data on each species by scan-sampling habituated groups. Because these groups {{were observed in}} the same study area during overlapping time periods, the confounding effects of temporal and spatial variability in food availability were reduced. Our {{results show that the}} annual diets of the two larger species (Procolobus badius and Colobus polykomos) include roughly equal proportions of fruits (including seeds), young leaf parts, and mature leaf parts, although P. badius had a greater intake of floral parts. Procolobus verus consumed almost no mature leaf parts, few fruits and seeds, and many young leaf parts. Colobus polykomos commonly fed from lianas. Seeds were the dominant fruit item eaten by all three colobus, and the fruits they selected were generally dull and non-fleshy, in contrast to the brightly-colored, <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits</b> eaten by guenons. Leguminous plants contributed substantially to the diets of both the larger species, but comparisons with other African forest sites indicate that colobine biomass is not closely correlated with the abundance of leguminous trees in the forest...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{retardation}} of the processes of growth and differentiation is certainly {{as important as the}} processes of growth and differentiation themselves. It is striking, therefore, that whereas the analysis of growth has been carried out for a considerable period of time already, the analysis of inhibition was only commenced a few decades ago. It has to be admitted that Wiesner (1894) succeeded in demonstrating the presence of a substance retarding germination in the slime of the mistletoe (Viscum album), but this remained a solitary observation for some time. About 1920 a series of important publications appeared which deal with inhibiting substances. Oppenheimer (1922) discovered a substance of this kind in the fruit pulp of ripe tomatoes, Reinhard (1933) found one in tomato juice, Köckemann (1934) some in other <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits</b> such as apples, pears, quinces and tomatoes, Lehmann (1937) one in the exocarp of buckwheat, Ruge (1939) some in the fruits of Helianthus annuus and Avena sativa, Fröschel (1939, 1940) one in Beta, Stolk (1952, 1953 a) some in the roots of Fuchsia hybrida and Pelargonium zonale and in the roots of Allium Cepa...|$|R

40|$|In {{and around}} wooded areas P. h. javanicus feeds {{almost entirely on}} berries and <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits,</b> perhaps rarely on small, slow animals. It does not damage the seeds it {{swallows}} and which it deposits later, up to a few kilometers from the tree wherefrom it took the fruit. The deposited seeds are fully germinable and cleansed of the adhering fruit meat, thus preventing possible destruction of the germ through moulds. Notably for some palm seeds — {{such as those of}} the sugar palm — passage through the Tody Cat’s intestinal tract seems necessary for rendering them germinable. A typical habit seems to be its accomplishing an auto-peristaltic movement whenever it arrives at an open spot, a fresh earthslide or the like. Right here it prefers to deposit its droppings and in so doing start reforestation. For many seeds it is the only agent performing this service. Its usefulness in this respect is hardly known, much less appreciated and honoured. Its alleged rapacity as to poultry is definitely exaggerated, probably false, and certainly needs scientific investigation and proof. The quantity of consumption-fruit it takes from man-owned fruit trees must be considered trivial as compared to what other animals take, and for which it is too often blamed.

40|$|Whereas {{scientific}} research on inhibiting substances has mainly occupied {{itself with the}} effect of these substances on the germination process, I was able to demonstrate the presence of a root-inhibiting agent during my studies on root formation in Fuchsia hybrida and Pelargonium zonale (Stolk, 1952). In connection with this previous investigation I tried to find out whether a similar substance is present as well in bulbous plants and, by doing so, as a suitable species for my experiments the Liliaceous Allium Cepa was selected. My principal object was to corroborate and, if possible, extend the results obtained with Fuchsia and Pelargonium. A confirmation appeared highly desirable because the experiments with Fuchsia and Pelargonium could not possibly be very accurate on account of the direct method of measuring and that is why I used in my experiments with Allium a root-auxanometer which will be described in the following section. Substances retarding germination were demonstrated in the slime of Viscum album by WIESNER (1894), in the fruit pulp of ripe tomatoes by OPPENHEIMER (1922), in tomato juice by REINHARD (1933), in other <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits</b> such as apples, pears, quinces and tomatoes by KÖCKEMANN (1934), in the exocarp of buckwheat by LEHMANN (1937), in the fruits of Helianthus annuus and Avena sativa by RUGE (1939) and in Beta by FRÖSCHEL (1939, 1940). That not one and the same inhibitor is involved, is evident {{from the fact that the}} above-mentioned authors found differences between the inhibiting substances they studied in their behaviour towards high temperatures. The inhibiting substances found by OPPENHEIMER and LEHMANN, for instance, are thermolabile. those discovered by REINHARD, KÖCKEMANN and FRÖSCHEL thermostabile. Also in their chemical behaviour certain differences can be demonstrated.

40|$|Scientific {{research}} concerning growth inhibitors, {{which has}} been pursued for several decades already, dealt mainly with {{the effect of these}} substances on the germination process. WIESNER (1894) demonstrated the presence of a growth inhibitor in the slime of the mistletoe (Viscum album) which prevented the germination of a great variety of seeds. OPPENHEIMER (1922) supplemented the analysis by placing seeds on the pulp of ripe tomatoes and he observed a strong inhibitive effect {{as a result of this}} treatment. In addition, however, he found that the inhibiting substance is thermolabile and insoluble in ether or alcohol. REINHARD (1933) corroborated Oppenheimer’s results for the most part. According to this author, however, the inhibiting agent in tomato juice is thermostabile, and it is not destroyed by boiling, neiher by neutralisation or by diluting the juice 50 times. In other fleshy fruits such as apples, pears and quinces KÖCKEMANN (1934) detected inhibiting substances capable of preventing the germination of Lepidium seeds. These substances were reported to be sensitive to peroxide and to alkali, thermostabile and soluble in water and in ether, but insoluble in petroleum ether. On the other hand, the inhibiting agent extracted by LEHMANN (1937) from the exocarp if buckwheat is thermolabile. In Helianthus annuus and Avena sativa, finally, RUGE (1939) demonstrated the presence of an inhibitor that reduces the speed of germination to a considerable extent. FRÖSCHEL’S investigations on Trifolium and Beta will be dealt with in 4. This survey is not quite exhaustive, but clearly demonstrates that the inhibiting agent should not be regarded as a definite, well-defined chemical substance which is always the same in every individual case, but as a group of substances with analogous activities but most probably with widely divergent physical and chemical properties. Following KÖCKEMANN (1934) we can classify the inhibiting substances into two groups, as follows : 1. inhibiting substances in the testa or in the seed, and 2. inhibiting substances in the mesocarp of <b>pulpy</b> <b>fruits...</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to Les Hiddins, Aboriginal {{people would}} eat the fruit without chewing so they wouldn't {{stick to the}} tongue. The {{ripeness}} of the berry is indicated not only by its softness, but often also by a slight translucence. When quite ripe the sticky, gelatinous, sweet pulp surrounding the single seed is pleasant to eat, but its great stickiness often make the seed almost impossible to spit out. Birds have the same difficulty and may sometimes be seen wiping their beaks free of seeds against the branch of a tree. Jennifer Isaacs lists berries of L. exocarpi and L.spathulata as being eaten in the Central desert Peter Latz notes that the calories obtained would be rather low. Aborigines often pluck whole branches from the tree and pick off the berries at their leisure. These berries are particularly favored by children. Although all Aboriginal groups have two or more names for mistletoes, it appears {{that they do not}} give separate names to each species. The Walpiri word for both L. murrayi and L. spathulata is pawurlirri. The Antakirinja people around Coober Pedy call the berries of L. exocarpi Ngantja.Reference to the fruit was first contained in a letter written by Governor Gawler during an ill-fated expedition in 1839 led by Charles Sturt. Gawler to his brother-in-law, Henry Cox, 20 December 1839: [...] "The poor boy (Henry Bryan) accompanied me most cheerfully, he had been resting all day and did not appear to suffer from the subsequent exertion. He brought me the <b>pulpy</b> but bitter <b>fruit</b> of the mesembryantheumum and the little berries of the exocarpi - and ate plenty of them himself - he made many observations about our course, appearing to recollect its striking features well, and calculated our distances with much precision".|$|R
