This [...] "Ferreed" [...] method reduced power consumption and allowed both contacts to be used for <b>voice</b> <b>path.</b> The coils were wired for coincident current selection similar to a magnetic core memory, so operating the contacts for one crosspoint would release the other crosspoints in its row and column.|$|R

50|$|Audible ringing {{is usually}} {{generated}} in the switching system closest to the calling party, especially when {{under the control of}} strict implementations of Signalling System No. 7 and the Customized Application of Mobile Enhanced Logic (CAMEL) signaling system.

50|$|In {{traditional}} GSM networks, a call {{between two}} Mobile Stations (MS) involve a dual encoding/decoding process. Speech signals are first encoded in the originating MS, converted to G.711 {{in the local}} transcoder, converted back to a GSM codec in the remote transcoder and finally converted back to speech at the terminating MS. In this configuration the two transcoders are operating in tandem introducing a voice quality degradation. It is possible to eliminate this problem by removing the two transcoding operations in the <b>voice</b> <b>path</b> if the two MS are using the same codec.|$|R
