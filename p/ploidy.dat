Many studies have provided reliable evidence that the transcription levels of reference genes are not constant at different developmental stages and in different experimental conditions. However, suitable reference genes which are stably expressed in polyploid preimplantation embryos of different developmental stages have not yet been identified. Therefore, it is critical to verify candidate reference genes to analyze gene expression accurately in both diploid and polyploid embryos. We examined the expression levels of 12 candidate reference genes in preimplantation embryos of four different <b>ploidies</b> at six developmental stages. Stability analysis of the reference genes was performed by four independent software programs, and the stability of three genes was evaluated by comparison with the Oct 4 expression level during preimplantation development in diploid embryos. The expression levels of most genes in the polyploid embryos were higher than that in the diploid embryos, but the increasing degree were disproportionate with the <b>ploidies.</b> There were no significant difference in reference gene expressions among embryos of different <b>ploidies</b> when they reached the morula stage, and the expression level remained flat until the blastocyst stage.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{differences among}} poplar clones of various <b>ploidies,</b> 12 hybrid poplar clones (P. simonii × P. nigra) × (P. nigra × P. simonii) with different <b>ploidies</b> {{were used to}} study phenotypic variation in growth traits and photosynthetic characteristics. Analysis of variance showed remarkable differences {{for each of the}} investigated traits among these clones (P < 0. 01). Coefficients of phenotypic variation (PCV) ranged from 2. 38 % to 56. 71 %, and repeatability ranged from 0. 656 to 0. 987. The Pn (photosynthetic rate) photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) curves of the 12 clones were S-shaped, but the Pn-ambient CO 2 (Ca) curves were shaped like an inverted "V". The stomatal conductance (Gs) -PPFD and transpiration rate (Tr) -PPFD curves had an upward tendency; however, with increasing PFFD, the intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci) -PPFD curves had a downward tendency in all of the clones. The Pn-PPFD and Pn-Ca curves followed the pattern of a quadratic equation. The average light saturation point and light compensation point of the triploid clones were the highest and lowest, respectively, among the three types of clones. For Pn-Ca curves, diploid clones had a higher average CO 2 saturation point and average CO 2 compensation point compared with triploid and tetraploid clones. Correlation analyses indicated that all investigated traits were strongly correlated with each other. In future studies, molecular methods should be used to analyze poplar clones of different <b>ploidies</b> to improve our understanding of the growth and development mechanisms of polyploidy...|$|R
30|$|Hybridization and {{polyploidy}} are {{amongst the}} most important evolutionary mechanism in plants. The parents can be deduced by comparing the genome size of possible parents and their offspring. If parents have say 20 and 30  pg then their offspring will mostly have 25  pg. In more complicated allopolyploids the contribution of each parent can often be calculated. In Gagea inferred polyploids run from triploid to decaploid (Peruzzi 2003) whereby several species show different <b>ploidies</b> (Henker 2005). Three different hybrids have been described that have the same parents, G. lutea and G. pratensis but combining different <b>ploidies.</b> These three hybrids are here discussed under the names as found in the literature.

The hybrids mostly occur in anthropogenically disturbed sites like churchyards, parks and marginally used meadows. Their parent species are found in forests (G. lutea) and forest edges (G. pratensis).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Doubled haploid {{technology}} {{has been used by}} various private companies. However, information regarding chromosome duplication methodologies, particularly those concerning techniques used to identify duplication in cells, is limited. Thus, we analyzed and characterized artificially doubled haploids using microsatellites molecular markers, pollen viability, and flow cytometry techniques. Evaluated material was obtained using two different chromosome duplication protocols in maize seeds considered haploids, resulting from the cross between the haploid inducer line KEMS and 4 hybrids (GNS 3225, GNS 3032, GNS 3264, and DKB 393). Fourteen days after duplication, plant samples were collected and assessed by flow cytometry. Further, the plants were transplanted to a field, and samples were collected for DNA analyses using microsatellite markers. The tassels were collected during anthesis for pollen viability analyses. Haploid, diploid, and mixoploid individuals were detected using flow cytometry, demonstrating that this technique was efficient for identifying doubled haploids. The microsatellites markers were also efficient for confirming the <b>ploidies</b> preselected by flow cytometry and for identifying homozygous individuals. Pollen viability showed {{a significant difference between the}} evaluated <b>ploidies</b> when the Alexander and propionic-carmin stains were used.

In freshwater, a severe cataract outbreak was recorded in both <b>ploidies</b> reared at 16 °C. The cataract score was significantly higher in triploids compared to diploids, and the severity was lower in both <b>ploidies</b> fed the HH diet. The cataract development at 10 °C was minor. Low gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity in fish reared at 16 °C before seawater transfer was followed by osmoregulatory stress with elevated plasma electrolyte concentrations and high mortality in sea water. Both diploids and triploids reared at 10 °C developed cataracts during the seawater period, with higher severities in triploids than diploids and a reduced severity in the fish fed the HH diet.

40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the effect of}} triploidy on the survival, growth and gonadal development of turbot from 6 to 48 months of age. From 6 to 24 months of age (first sexual maturity), survival was similar in both <b>ploidies</b> (P N 0. 05). From 24 to 48 months of age, after the first sexual maturity, survival was 91. 9 % in diploids and 100 % in triploids, which did not exhibit the post-spawning-associated mortality. Growth was similar for both <b>ploidies</b> {{during the first year}} of life. After that, triploids grew significantly (P b 0. 05) more that diploids, with more marked differences after each spawning season. From 24 to 48 months, the average weight difference between both <b>ploidies</b> was 11. 4 F 1. 9 %, ranging from 4. 3 to 23. 0 %. At 47 months of age, the biomass of triploids was 10. 3 % greater in total weight and 14. 3 % greater in eviscerated weight. Gonads of triploid males were similar to that of diploids, whereas in triploid females, they were significantly smaller and rudimentary. A histological analysis carried out at 47 months of age showed complete sterility of triploids in both sexes. Sex ratio was 1 male (M) : 0. 6 female (F), for diploids, significantly (P b 0. 05) different from 1 : 1, and 1 M: 3. 3 F for triploids, significantly (P b 0. 05) different from 1 : 1 and from the diploids. Since females grow more than males, culture of triploids benefited from the high female ratio, which helped to reduce size dispersion. In addition, their sterility allowed better performance by avoiding the reduction in growth that takes place during the spawning periods. Together, these observations indicate that triploidy induction can be an interesting option for turbot aquaculture, especially for the production of large-size fish of more than 2 years of age.

Here, the ability to detect heterozygous mutations is important and this can only be done if the sequence of the diploid genome is obtained. In the pioneering efforts to sequence individuals, Levy et al. and Wheeler et al., who sequenced Craig Venter and Jim Watson, respectively, outlined models for covering both alleles in a genome. Wendl and Wilson followed with a more general theory that allowed for an arbitrary number of coverings of each allele and arbitrary <b>ploidy.</b> These results point to the general conclusion {{that the amount of}} data needed for such projects is significantly higher than for traditional haploid projects.

It appears that H19 expression is tightly linked to the <b>ploidy</b> of the cell. Diploid liver cells express high levels of H19, whereas the polyploid cell fraction do not express H19. Also, diploid mesenchymal stem cells express high levels of H19 compared to polyploid mesenchymal stem cells.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{proposed by}} Thomas Cavalier-Smith, was labeled the Neomuran revolution.

Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because {{they are based on}} the [...] "theoretically and empirically" [...] unsound model of molecular clocks. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy, until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of nucleosomes. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and <b>ploidy</b> cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.|$|E
40|$|A mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with a {{variable}} number of flagella per cell {{has been used}} to investigate flagellar size control.

Because cells of the same size, but with very different pool sizes, have flagella of identical length, it appears that the concentration of the unassembled flagellar precursor protein pool does not regulate flagellar length.

2500|$|V. rotundifolia is a {{sprawling}} shrub that can grow {{as tall as}} 1.5 m though it typically ranges from 0.5 to 1 m in height. As a product of its rapid nodal rooting, the plant can form dense mats reaching in excess of 10 m from the parent plant. New stems are green, square and fleshy initially before maturing brown and woody. Older, large-diameter stems are covered with heavily fissured bark. Running horizontal stems produce frequent upright branches. Leaves are strongly aromatic, intensifying when crushed. The majority of leaves are simple, but they can occasionally be palmate trifoliate or 2-leaved. Leaves measure 2 to 6.5cm in length and 1-4.5cm in width. Leaf margins are entire. The leaf shape varies from ovate to obovate with acute bases and obtuse apexes. Occasionally, leaf apexes are acute or emarginate. Upper leaf surfaces are dark green whereas lower leaf surfaces range in color from silver to white to light green; all leaf surfaces are tomentose. Petiole bases are typically somewhat purple and measure 0 to 1cm in length. Blades are cupped downward slightly. Leaf veins are lighter green than surrounding tissue. Flowers are borne in indeterminate panicles that may be terminal or axillary. Infloresences measure 3 to 7cm in length. The calyx is cup-shaped and 4 to 4.5cm long. Flowers are zygomorphic, purple to blue-purple, and short pedunculate. They are two-lipped and funnel-form (measuring 8mm in length). Four stamens are didynamous and extend beyond the corolla tube (measuring 9 to 10mm). The style extends beyond the stamens (total length: 12mm). Pollen is tricolpate. Ovaries consist of two carpels with each containing two single seeded locules. Fruits are globose drupes that are green while immature but turn yellow and red before maturing to bluish black. The fruits are frequently incorrectly characterized in the literature as [...] "seeds or berries". Each drupe contains a maximum of four seeds though there are usually fewer {{as a result of}} seed abortion. Each seed is encapsulated in a separate compartment. Endosperm is absent.
