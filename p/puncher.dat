5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak <b>puncher,</b> and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them down with a tap.|$|E

This was regarded as one of his best wins.|$|E
25|$|By this stage, Fitzsimmons had {{established}} his own style. He developed a certain movement and caginess {{from one of}} the greatest bare-knuckle fighters, Jem Mace. Mace encouraged Fitzsimmons to develop his punching technique, drawing on the enormous power he had gained from blacksmithing. Fitzsimmons delivered short, accurate and occasionally conclusive punches. He soon built up a reputation as by far the hardest <b>puncher</b> in boxing.|$|E
25|$|In July 2001, Morales {{defeated}} future champion In Jin Chi of South Korea and retained his title. Chi gave {{a strong}} effort, but Morales was the sharper, harder <b>puncher</b> and outworked him {{for much of}} the fight. Morales was cut and swollen over the left eye in the 6th round by an accidental clash of heads and Chi was penalized one point in the 10th round.|$|E

The scor-ing opportunities were spread around, with seven <b>Punchers</b> adding to the 54 to 12 non-dis-trict victory over the Junction Eagles. Mason’s super star running back David Mora was on the just-back-after-injury list, so he saw limited play-ing time, but was able to score twice and still led the <b>Punchers</b> in rushing yards. Greatly imbalanced games are always tough. It is espe-cially irksome to Eagles fans and players to lose to their longtime rival, but those in attendance may well have see...|$|R

25|$|A {{person who}} creates a design {{is known as}} an {{embroidery}} digitizer or <b>puncher.</b> A digitizer uses software to create an object-based embroidery design, which can be easily reshaped and edited. These files retain important information such as object outlines, thread colors, and original artwork used to punch the designs. When the file is converted to a stitch file, it loses much of this information, rendering editing difficult or impossible.|$|E
25|$|Wide, looping punches {{have the}} further {{disadvantage}} of taking {{more time to}} deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely {{to take advantage of}} the poor position it leaves the <b>puncher</b> in.|$|E
25|$|After {{beginning}} 1996 {{with two}} more quick knockouts over Guy Stanford and Anthony Brooks, he successfully defended his British title with an easier-than-expected fifth round stoppage of the tough undefeated <b>puncher</b> Mark Delaney (21–0). Despite Delaney being a good fighter in his own right, Calzaghe's critics {{said that he had}} still not really been tested. Calzaghe said in reply that he could only beat whoever was out there and prepared to fight him. Calzaghe rounded off the year with victories over two experienced opponents in Warren Stowe and Pat Lawlor.|$|E

25|$|Following {{his loss}} to Brewster, Klitschko began his journey {{back towards the}} top of the heavyweight division. First, he {{defeated}} DaVarryl Williamson by technical decision. The fight was halted because of a Klitschko cut caused by an accidental headbutt. He then knocked out undefeated Cuban contender Eliseo Castillo. Klitschko then signed to fight undefeated power <b>puncher</b> Samuel Peter in an IBF and WBO eliminator. Though Peter scored three knockdowns (two in round 5, one in round 10) Klitschko withstood the Nigerian's power and went on to outbox Peter {{for the majority of the}} rounds.|$|E
25|$|As an amateur, Klitschko {{represented}} Ukraine at the 1996 Olympics, {{winning a}} gold medal in the super-heavyweight division. After turning professional later that year, he defeated Chris Byrd in 2000 to win the WBO heavyweight title. Klitschko's first reign as champion ended in an upset knockout loss to Corrie Sanders in 2003, which was followed by another knockout loss to Lamon Brewster in 2004. It was during this time that Klitschko hired Emanuel Steward as his trainer, which began an eight-year partnership that lasted until Steward's death in 2012. In particular, Steward was credited with Klitschko's transition from an aggressive <b>puncher</b> to a more defensively-oriented boxer, much as he had done with Lennox Lewis in 1995 to 2003.|$|E

He was a ringside analyst for HBO's boxing coverage for twelve years until 2004. Outside boxing, he is a successful entrepreneur and known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill, which has sold over 100 million units worldwide. In 1999, he sold the naming rights to the grill for $138 million.|$|E

On March 16, 2002, Margarito crowned himself world champion, beating Diaz by knockout in round ten. He defended that crown with a decision in twelve over Danny Perez Ramírez and a knockout in two over former WBA title holder Andrew Lewis. Lewis was a southpaw and a hard <b>puncher,</b> but had been exposed as having a weak chin, while Margarito proved that he has a world class chin. He publicly asked for a unification bout with then WBC and WBA Champion Ricardo Mayorga.|$|E
25|$|The Royalists faced many {{difficulties}} in Military Region 2. Fire Support Base <b>Puncher,</b> the Ban Na outpost of Long Tieng, {{was surrounded by}} PAVN infantry and sappers. On 14 February 1971, an accidental bombing killed 30 civilians. By 15 February, Vang Pao's L'Armee Clandestine was in desperate shape. The PAVN were {{within striking distance of}} the main guerrilla base at Long Tieng. The next two Unity Battalions, BCs 603 and 604, were pulled from the final stages of training and sent to reinforce the Hmong irregulars. To maintain unit integrity, the Thais had to fend off Vang Pao's attempt to parcel out platoons of Thai replacements into Hmong guerrilla units. The Thais were trained to fight cohesively as mobile offensive troops, and they intended to retain that capability.|$|E

25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter <b>puncher</b> often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{his native}} Germany, Schmeling won three of his next four fights, with one draw, {{including}} knockout wins over first Walter Neusel, then another redeeming his previous loss to Steve Hamas. However, many among the American press and fans remained unmoved {{on the idea of}} rooting for Schmeling in light of the Nazi Party's behavior. Articles continued to be published declaring the German 'washed up,' a 'has been,' or a 'Nazi puppet.' When he was matched with undefeated black sensation Joe Louis in 1936 for the German's first fight on American soil in more than two years, he was clearly the betting underdog, considered a name opponent for Louis to roll over on his route to the title. Nevertheless, he was number two contender for the title behind Louis. Prior to the match, Schmeling carefully studied films of Louis's prior fights, dissecting apparent flaws in the Detroit fighter's technique. Among the weaknesses he noticed was the fact that Louis lowered his left hand after throwing a left jab. In the ring, Schmeling exploited this subtle flaw to his own advantage, countering nearly every Louis jab with his best punch, the right cross. The fight proved to be a competitive, hard-hitting affair for the first three rounds, but, in the fourth, a counter right from the German dropped Louis {{for the first time in}} his career. Though Louis rose, he was badly dazed for the remainder of the fight. For a further eight rounds, Schmeling battered Louis, often standing toe-to-toe with the vaunted <b>puncher</b> and landing that same right hand to the jaw repeatedly. In the twelfth, he sent the American tumbling to the floor once more, and this time Louis could not recover. He was counted out on the floor, and Schmeling had scored the most talked-about sports upset of the year.|$|E
500|$|Robinson was {{the modern}} {{definition}} of a boxer <b>puncher.</b> He was able to fight almost any style: he could come out one round brawling, the next counterpunching, and the next fighting on the outside flicking his jab. Robinson would use his formless style to exploit his opponents weaknesses, he also possessed great speed and precision. He fought in a very conventional way with a firm jab, but threw hooks and uppercuts in flurries in an unconventional way. He possessed tremendous versatility—according to boxing analyst Bert Sugar, [...] "Robinson could deliver a knockout blow going backward." [...] Robinson was efficient with both hands, and he displayed a variety of effective punches—according to a TIME magazine article in 1951, [...] "Robinson's repertoire, thrown with equal speed and power by either hand, includes every standard punch from a bolo to a hook—and a few he makes up {{on the spur of}} the moment." [...] Robinson commented that once a fighter has trained to a certain level, their techniques and responses become almost reflexive. [...] "You don't think. It's all instinct. If you stop to think, you're gone." ...|$|E
