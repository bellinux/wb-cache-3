Their countries were now occupied by the Soviet Union, and intense <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> had been put on anyone with a position of privilege or wealth before 1939. Mass arrests and some killings had taken place. Fearing a worsening of the situation, the vast majority of {{the remaining}} Baltic Germans decided to leave. About 7,000 resettled from Estonia by late March 1941, and approximately 10,500 resettled from Latvia by late March 1941.|$|E
25|$|In 1970–71, Catholics made {{up about}} 36% of the {{population}} and about 18% of the UDR. By the end of 1972 the number of Catholics in the UDR had dropped to 3% and never rose above that figure again. There are a number of reasons for this. In {{the early years of the}} conflict, relations soured between the Catholic community and the Army. This was mainly due to incidents such as the Falls Curfew, internment, Bloody Sunday and Operation Motorman. There were also frequent claims of UDR soldiers abusing Catholics at checkpoints and during house searches. Catholic Church and Irish nationalist leaders withdrew their support for the regiment. Many Catholic soldiers left the regiment due to <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> from their own community, and the IRA's policy of singling out Catholic soldiers for assassination. Catholics within the regiment also reported being intimidated by Protestant fellow soldiers. Other Catholics resigned in protest at what they saw as the Army's harsh and biased treatment of their community, especially after Operation Demetrius (the introduction of internment). The Belfast Telegraph reported that 25% of the regiment's Catholics resigned in 1971, half of those in the months following Operation Demetrius. By the end of 1972, the vast majority had resigned or simply stopped turning up for duty.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pressures</b> <b>and</b> <b>intimidations</b> on {{journalists are}} widespread, {{giving rise to}} self-censorship.

Impunity for crimes against journalists remains the norm. A June 2013 survey of 150 Bulgarian journalists by the Bulgarian affiliate of the Association of European Journalists remarked that 80% of them reported the existence of undue <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> 60% said that internal pressures had distorted editorial contents.|$|R

5000|$|In mid-trial {{and without}} cross-examining Hamilton, the BBC capitulated on 21 October 1986. The Director-General, Alasdair Milne, stated he was {{instructed}} {{to do so by}} the Governors of the BBC. The corporation was directed to pay the men's legal costs. Hamilton and Howarth were awarded £20,000 each and in the next edition of Panorama, on 27 October, the BBC made an unreserved apology. The settlement of the case raised serious concerns regarding political <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> the <b>intimidation</b> of witnesses. Before the BBC defence lawyers had an opportunity to interrogate Hamilton, the Board of Governors met during the trial and instructed the BBC Board of Management to settle the case. [...] "...the BBC executives at this meeting expressed serious doubts about the decision. It was pointed out the BBC had not even begun to put its case".|$|R

40|$|Relations {{between the}} British {{government}} and the BBC are often fraught at times of armed conflict, particularly {{in the absence of}} national consensus. A pattern of <b>pressure</b> on, <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> of, the BBC underlies efforts by successive governments to set the agenda for reporting 'in the national interest'. The effects of such <b>pressure</b> is considerable <b>and,</b> some claim, has led to over-dependence on official and 'establishment' sources in the BBC's coverage of conflicts. Such over-dependence, it could be argued, is typified by the 'flagship' current affairs series Panorama which has been accused by current affairs practitioners and media analysts of generally reflecting a 'Westminster consensus'. This paper examines Panorama's coverage of the invasion of Iraq to explore claims that Britain's longest-running current affairs series largely reflects 'elite opinion'. Textual and content analysis of an archive of Panorama programmes related to the war is used to examine the charge that Panorama draws on a limited range of 'establishment' views and perspectives in its war coverage, whilst marginalising more critical opinions and explanations...|$|R

However, its origins are most commonly associated with the temperance movement in the late 19th century and first two decades of the 20th century. Discovering the power of utilizing the mass media to exert pressure on politicians is usually attributed to Wayne Wheeler, the de facto leader of the Anti-Saloon League. Under his mentorship, a number of skilled practitioners of pressure politics emerged within the league (Odegard, 1928). One of the most accomplished of these was William E. Johnson, better known as [...] "Pussyfoot" [...] Johnson.|$|R
40|$|Within Australian {{secondary}} schools, debate often associates the utilisation {{of either}} single-sex or coeducational classroom settings for Physical Education (PE), as the learning experienced {{by students in}} PE can differ greatly between the two settings. Thirty-nine PDHPE teachers were selected as participants, and data was gathered through questionnaire and focus group interview processes, to enable participants to convey their views regarding how students’ participation and performance in practical PE {{may be influenced by}} single-sex and coeducational classroom settings. The majority of participants believed that single-sex PE classroom settings allowed students to achieve higher levels of both participation and performance. Factors such as distractions, uneven skill levels, uneven strength levels, harassment, self-consciousness, embarrassment, competitiveness, peer <b>pressure,</b> gaining respect <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> were identified to potentially negatively influence students’ participation and performance in PE, and most commonly have a greater negative effect on students’ participation and performance in PE within coeducational settings. Furthermore, the suitability of PE classroom settings was identified to be dependent on contextual factors pertaining to the school and class, Stage of students and activities being taught. This study therefore gives an insight into how students’ participation and performance in PE may be influenced by single-sex and coeducational classroom settings...|$|R
40|$|On 27 March 1952, the Australian Minister for Immigration, Harold E. Holt, granted formal {{permission}} for Japanese {{women who were}} either married or engaged to Australian soldiers to enter Australia. In response, in the mid- 1950 s, the Department of Defence developed a policy which sought to dissuade Australian servicemen from marrying Asian women. Through a series of administrative procedures involving compulsory interviews, medical assessments and security checks, Australian military commanders employed a combination of <b>pressure,</b> <b>intimidation</b> <b>and</b> misinformation {{in their efforts to}} persuade Australian servicemen to abandon their plans to marry local Asian women. This article argues that, {{in the absence of any}} official policy responsibility in immigration matters, the Australian Department of Defence maintained a fervent commitment to the tenets of racial exclusivity contained at the heart of the White Australia policy from the mid- 1950 s to the early 1970 s by discouraging Australian servicemen from entering into Asian marriages. 18 page(s...|$|R

The extent of de facto discrimination typically depends on the level of involvement of local Islamic teachers. Most non-Muslim citizens did not openly practice their faith for fear of societal rejection. Persons who raise their children with non-Muslim religious teachings face societal discrimination.

5000|$|The Bloods gang {{was formed}} {{initially}} {{to compete against}} {{the influence of the}} Crips in Los Angeles. The rivalry dates back to the 1960s when Raymond Washington and several other Crips confronted Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens, students at Centennial High School in Compton, California. In response to the attack, Scott, who lived in Compton, established the Piru street-gang, the first [...] "Bloods" [...] street gang. Owens established the West Piru street-gang. The Bloods street-gang was initially formed to provide members protection from the Crips. Many of the non-Crip street-gangs used to call one another [...] "blood". On March 21, 1972, shortly after a concert featuring Wilson Pickett and Curtis Mayfield, twenty youths belonging to the Crips attacked and robbed Robert Ballou Jr. outside of Hollywood Palladium. Ballou was beaten to death after he refused to give up his leather jacket. The sensational media coverage of the crime and the continued assaults by the Crips increased their notoriety. Several non-Crips gangs formed during this period were no match for the Crips and they became concerned with the escalating Crip attacks. The Pirus, Black P. Stones, Athens Park Boys and other gangs not aligned with the Crips often clashed with the Crips. On June 5, 1972, three months after Ballou's murder, Fredrick [...] "Lil Country" [...] Garret was murdered by a Westside Crip. This marked the first Crips murder against another gang member and motivated non-Crip street-gangs to align with each other. The Brims struck back on August 4, 1972, by murdering Thomas Ellis, an original Westside Crip. By late 1972, the Pirus held a meeting in their neighborhood to discuss growing Crips <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>intimidation.</b> Several gangs that felt victimized by the Crips joined the Piru Street Boys to create a new federation of non-Crips neighborhoods. This alliance would transform into the [...] "Bloods". The Pirus are therefore considered to be the original founders of the Bloods.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe challenges that Iran poses are, arguably, {{some of the}} most significant foreign policy issues leading Washington's agendas today. Iran's power projection and regional ambitions, according to many American politicians and social scientists, defy the U. S. and its allies in the region. However, more than three decades of U. S. foreign policies towards Iran, including economic sanctions, political <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> <b>intimidation</b> have neither altered the Islamic authority's aggressive diplomacy nor achieved regime change; instead, these foreign policy choices-by arousing nationalist sentiment and revealing a collective sense of discontent toward American policies among many Iranians-have actually facilitated hardliners in gaining public support. In this context, this thesis, by assessing the lessons learned from previous U. S. strategies, their successes and failures, and by considering the unintentional consequences, many of which caused a backlash among the Iranian people, as well as by examining the political and social climate that exists in Iran today, looks for a sustainable, viable and ultimately successful resolution within the Iranian society.
