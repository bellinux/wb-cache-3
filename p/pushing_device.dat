50|$|One more {{alternative}} to explosive deflection {{is to move}} the asteroid slowly over a time. Tiny constant thrust accumulates to deviate an object sufficiently from its predicted course. Edward T. Lu and Stanley G. Love have proposed using a large heavy unmanned spacecraft hovering over an asteroid to gravitationally pull the latter into a non-threatening orbit. The spacecraft and the asteroid mutually attract one another. If the spacecraft counters the force towards the asteroid by, e.g., an ion thruster, the net effect is that the asteroid is accelerated towards the spacecraft and thus slightly deflected from its orbit. While slow, this method {{has the advantage of}} working irrespective of the asteroid composition or spin rate - rubble pile asteroids would be difficult to deflect by means of nuclear detonations while a <b>pushing</b> <b>device</b> would be hard or inefficient to mount on a fast rotating asteroid.

Torso perturbations were applied with a <b>pushing</b> <b>device</b> while the subjects were restrained at the pelvis in a kneeling-seated position. Torso kinematics and the muscle activity of the lumbar part of the M. Longissimus were recorded for 14 healthy subjects. Four conditions were included: a flexion, extension and neutral lumbar posture with eyes closed and the neutral posture with eyes open. Frequency response functions of the admittance and reflexes showed that there was no significant difference between the eyes open and eyes closed conditions, thereby confirming that vision does not play a role in the stabilization of the trunk during small-amplitude trunk perturbations. In contrast, manipulating posture did lead to significant differences. In particular, the flexed condition led to a lower admittance and lower reflex contribution compared to the neutral condition. Furthermore, the muscle pre-activation (prior to the onset of the perturbation) was significantly lower in the flexed posture compared to neutral. This confirms that flexing the lumbar spine increases the passive tissue stiffness and decreases the contribution of reflex activity to trunk control...|$|E

While attempts have recently been made to modify feeding practices {{with the aim of}} increasing species-appropriate behavioural repertoires, scientific investigation in the field is lacking. The current study investigated the effects of a novel feeding device on the feeding behaviour of 22 domestic cats housed in a cattery facility. Cats were provided with their usual morning food ration split evenly between their normal feeding method (food bowl) and a novel feeding device for a period of 80 minutes in a single exposure. Durations and frequencies of food interest, food consumption, exploration of feeding devices and remaining weights of food left at the end of observation period were measured. While 19 of the 22 cats showed olfactory exploration towards the device, only 7 cats acquired food from it. Within-subjects analysis of the sub-population of 7 cats using the device revealed no significant differences in weight of food acquired from bowl versus device (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, P= 0. 180) suggesting these cats were as successful at gaining their food ration from the device as they were from the food bowl. However, it took cats significantly longer to gain food from the device than the bowl (Paired-samples t-test, P< 0. 01) and they did so in a significantly greater number of visits to the device (Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{rapid advance}} in modern {{electronics}} and photonics is <b>pushing</b> <b>device</b> design to the micro- and nano-scale, {{and the resulting}} high power density imposes immense challenges to thermal management. When device size shrinks to the same order of or even below the wavelength or mean-free-path of heat carriers, the transport of heat carriers and the interaction between them will differ {{from those in the}} macroscopic regime. This imposes challenges on designing micro/nano-devices with required thermal performance, while, at the same time, also opens the door for designing novel materials and structures with promising thermal properties. ^ This research explores structures with unique heat transfer properties for thermal management applications. It also seeks to build a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of electron and phonon transport, and the coupling between them, in order to guide the design of strategies to enhance heat dissipation in solid-state devices. Graphene is a unique material with 2 D lattice structure and single-atomic-layer thickness, and we explore several mechanisms that can affect thermal transport in it. The thermal conductivity (κ) of zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is found to be higher than that of armchair-edge ones in our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and phonon localization at edges is attributed to underlie such edge-chirality dependence. Thermal rectification (TR) is a phenomenon in which heat flows more easily in one direction than in the opposite direction, which is particularly useful for thermal management. Using MD simulations, we find significant TR in asymmetrically defected GNRs and pristine GNRs with asymmetric geometry. However, TR in these two structures arises from different mechanisms. In the former case, GNRs are pristine on one side while defective on the other, and TR is caused by the different temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of the two sides. In the latter case, TR can be enabled by phonon lateral confinement when the width of the GNR is smaller than the phonon mean free path. These findings will provide useful guidance to the fabrication of thermal rectifiers from pristine materials including but not limited to graphene. ^ A two-temperature non-equilibrium MD simulation technique is developed to atomistically model electron-phonon coupled thermal transport across metal/semiconductor interfaces. On the metal side, the lattice part of thermal transport is modeled with MD while the electronic part is simultaneously modeled with the Fourier’s law using the finite difference method. On the semiconductor side, electrons are neglected and only phonons are considered. Our method naturally accounts for the effect of defects, interface, temperature, etc., on thermal properties of phonons and also includes the coupling between electron and phonon. We use this technique to compute the thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of Si/Cu and CNT/Cu interfaces. In a region within a “cooling lengt” distance to the interface, electron and phonon are revealed to be in thermal non-equilibrium, which considerably impedes heat transfer across the interface. The TBR of CNT/Cu interfaces predicted using our method is in better agreement with experimental results than conventional MD methods. ^ A two-temperature Boltzmann transport equation method is also built, which considers electron and phonon {{on both sides of the}} interface. It was reported that an interlayer with intermediate phonon spectra between two dielectric materials could reduce the phononic interfacial thermal resistance. In this work, we show that an appropriate choice of interlayer materials with relatively strong electron-phonon coupling could significantly enhance interfacial thermal transport across metal-dielectric interfaces. Our Boltzmann transport simulations demonstrate that such enhancement is achieved by the elimination of electron-phonon nonequilibrium near the original metal-dielectric interface. Moreover, we reveal that interlayer can substantially accelerate hot electron cooling in thin films with weak electron-phonon coupling, for example, Cu, Ag, and Au, supported on a dielectric substrate. At the same time, lattice heating in the thin film is largely reduced. ^ A Monte-Carlo simulation approach is proposed to solve electron-phonon coupled thermal transport problems in metal-semiconductor heterojunctions. This approach enables us to conduct a spectral electron-phonon simulation considering the selection rules for three-phonon scatterings. We demonstrate the approach using a Au-Si bilayer system under ultrafast laser radiation. Nonequilibrium between electrons and different phonon modes are observed. This approach enables first-principles-based simulation of heat transfer across metal-nonmetal interfaces, which will be useful for designing thermoelectric devices and for thermal management of electronic devices. ^ The results from this study offer new understandings of nanoscale thermal transport involving multiple types of heat carriers, and the approaches developed have strong predictive capability, which will aid the thermal design of novel micro- or nano-devices. This research also provides new perspectives of atomic- and nano-scale engineering of materials and structures to enhance efficiency of thermal management. ...|$|E

In modern electronic circuits, {{the control of the}} threshold voltage is essential for improving circuit performance and reducing static power consumption. Here, we propose a silicon nanowire tran-sistor with three independent GAA electrodes, demonstrating, within a unique device, a dynamic configurability in terms of both polarity and threshold voltage (VT). This silicon nanowire transistor is fabricated using a vertically stacked structure with a top-down approach. Unlike conventional threshold voltage modulation techniques, the threshold control of this device is achieved by adapting the control scheme of the potential barriers at the source and drain interfaces and in the channel. Compared to conventional dual-threshold techniques, the proposed device does not tradeoff the leakage reduction at the detriment of the ON-state current, but only through a later turn-ON coming from a higher VT. This property offers leakage control at a reduction of loss in performance. The measured characteristic demonstrates a threshold voltage difference of ∼ 0. 5 V between low-VT and high-VT configurations, while high-VT configuration reduces the leakage current by two orders of magnitude as compared to low-VT configuration.
