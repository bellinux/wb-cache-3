First of all, the experiment system of diamond saw wire was set up by test cistern, equipment of diamond wire saw underwater, hydraulic pressure system, measuring and controlling system, diamond saw wire and single layer seabed oil <b>compound</b> <b>pipes</b> so on. Next, the cutting parameters, which include pipe sizing, working pressure, tensioning force of diamond saw wire, cutting velocity and advancing velocity were initialized and the first experimentation was done. Then, after adjusting the cutting parameters according to the analysis of cutting test, the next cutting experimentation underwater was done. In the end, the wearing capacity of diamond beads was measured and got the optimal advancing velocity which can minish the wearing capacity and prolong the cutting time of diamond beads. So, using these cutting parameters to cut the seabed oil <b>compound</b> <b>pipes</b> validated the feasibility of engineering application...|$|R
50|$|Overuse or mis{{application}} {{of thread}} tape {{may be a}} hazard. Excess application of PTFE tape can prevent mating threads from fully engaging, reducing the shear point of the threads. Combining thread-seal tape with a <b>pipe</b> dope <b>compound</b> can also overload threads. Also, internal overhangs of loose material may constrict a joint or slough off and form a foreign body that could jam a valve seat. Therefore, use of PTFE tape as a thread sealant is generally not considered appropriate in fluid power (hydraulic) systems.|$|R

The boiler was equipped with a Schmidt superheater. Steam distribution to the four cylinders was rather unique, being led from the superheater header in the smokebox to a steam collector box which was arranged between the two cylinders of the rear engine unit, from where a branch was led to the cylinders of the front engine unit by a central steam pipe with flexible joints, since this engine unit could move sideways in relation to the boiler barrel. This pipe took the place of the usual receiver <b>pipe</b> on <b>compound</b> Mallets.|$|R
50|$|Thread {{sealants}} such as joint <b>compound</b> (<b>pipe</b> dope or {{thread seal}} tape such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on compression fitting threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|R
50|$|Pipes are {{commonly}} joined by welding, using threaded pipe and fittings; sealing {{the connection with}} a <b>pipe</b> thread <b>compound,</b> Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Thread seal tape, oakum, or PTFE string, or by using a mechanical coupling. Process piping is usually joined by welding using a TIG or MIG process. The most common process pipe joint is the butt weld. The ends of pipe to be welded must have a certain weld preparation called an End Weld Prep (EWP) which is typically at an angle of 37.5 degrees to accommodate the filler weld metal. The most common pipe thread in North America is the National Pipe Thread (NPT) or the Dryseal (NPTF) version. Other pipe threads include the British standard pipe thread (BSPT), the garden hose thread (GHT), and the fire hose coupling (NST).|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the elastic}} plastic finite element method, the burst {{capacity}} of steel pipeline with corrosion defects i. e. longitudinal and circumferential aligned double corrosion defects are analyzed, respectively. The corresponding interaction rules for longitudinal and circumferential aligned corrosion defects are proposed, respectively. A new method is suggested for pipeline with more general interaction type named as compound aligned corrosion defects. Through the {{projections of the}} corrosion profile on the longitudinal and circumferential directions, the effective length, effective width and effective depth of adjacent corrosion defects are defined. Using the burst capacity expression of pipeline with single corrosion defect, the burst capacity of the pipeline with double interacting corrosion defects is calculated. The predictions of burst capacity of the <b>pipe</b> with <b>compound</b> aligned corrosion defects are in good agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, the method is extended for pipeline with colonies of corrosion defects and the assessment procedure is presented for the corroded pipe under internal pressure only. Due to the incorporation of the effective length, width and depth in those solutions, the resistance effect of uncorroded region between corrosion defects can be reasonably taken into account. Therefore, the procedure is validated to yield more accurate predictions than those in current assessment codes after compare with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Three pipes were {{recovered}} during excavations at CA-ALA- 554. Ethnographically, Native Californians smoked {{a range of}} plants, {{the most common of}} which is tobacco, in pipes. In order to determine the specific uses of these pipes, we extracted organic residues from the <b>pipes</b> and identified <b>compounds</b> using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Results show that the pipes have strong nicotine signatures, indicating they were used to smoke tobacco. Biomarkers for other plants are not present. Although tobacco use was introduced to California in ancient times, the precise date is unknown. The presence of nicotine in these pipes has implications for the timing of when tobacco entered California, and for indigenous horticultural practices.

40|$|The {{compounding}} of Polyvinylchloride (PVC) {{with some}} additives was studied for {{the enhancement of}} physical and mechanical properties. Two categories of formulations (un-plasticized and plasticized PVC) were prepared with PVC (K value ranging from 60 to 70) taking as base polymer. Different additives generally categorized as plasticizers, fillers, stabilizers, pigments and processing aids, were mixed in the standard concentration unit “parts per hundred resins (phr) ” with base polymer. Cable compound and shoe compound were prepared in plasticized-PVC category containing mainly plasticizing additives like diisooctyl phthalate (DIOP) (40 phr) and epoxidized soybean oil (2 - 3 phr) with general plasticizer (50 - 80 phr) respectively. Whereas the rigid <b>pipe</b> and sheet <b>compounds</b> were prepared as un-plasticized PVC category containing different fillers/stabilizers like tribasic lead sulphate (6 phr), lead stearate (1 phr), glyceryl monostearate (0. 4 phr) in rigid pipe and butylin mercaptides (2 - 2. 5 phr), fatty alcohol and fatty acid ester (0. 5 - 0. 8 phr) in rigid sheet compound. Experimental investigation was carried out for analyzing the mechanical properties like tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness and physical property i. e. specific gravity for the compounded samples. An appreciable increase was observed in tensile strength from 460 Kg/cm 2 (base PVC-polymer) {{to a range of}} 550 Kg/cm 2 for un-plasticized PVC compounds (rigid PVC-pipe and sheet) with little increase in elongation at break from 56 % (base polymer) to 124. 33 % and 150 % (for <b>Pipe</b> and Sheet <b>compounds</b> respectively). On the other side the elongation at break for plasticized PVC compounds was increased from 56 % to 250. 67 % (for cable compound) and 351. 33 % (for shoe compound), where as the tensile strength was decreased from 460 Kg/cm 2 to 150. 33 Kg/cm 2 (for cable compound) and 120. 33 Kg/cm 2 (for shoe compound). The hardness (shore A, D) was increased from 40 to 80 for all the compounds except shoe compound with hardness of 65. 33. The impact of plasticizers was found in direct proportion on elongation at break but having inverse proportion on tensile strength...|$|R

40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} waste can contain considerable amounts {{of polyvinyl chloride}} (PVC). This paper describes {{a study of the}} recycling of PVC pipes collected from such waste materials. In a sorting facility for the specific disposal of construction and {{demolition waste}}, PVC was found to represent one-third of the plastics separated by workers. Pipes were sorted carefully to preclude any possible contamination by poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) found in the waste. The material was ground into two distinct particle sizes (final mesh of 12. 7 and 8 mm), washed, dried and recycled. The average formulation of the pipes was determined based on ash content tests and used in the fabrication of a similar compound made mainly of virgin PVC. Samples of recycled <b>pipes</b> and of <b>compound</b> based on virgin material were subjected to tensile and impact tests and provided very similar results. These results are a good indication of the application potential of the recycled material and of the fact that longer grinding to obtain finer particles is not necessarily beneficial...|$|R

However, the manufacturing process of raw material utilised in concrete cause envirmental influences, significantly consumes energy and natural resources. Aggregate usually accounts the majority of the entire volume of concrete around 70 to 80 %, but cement and water accounts 20 to 30 %. Replacing any of these materials by industrial waste material has a positive impact on the environment and reduces the intensive use of energy and natural resources. There are a lot of manufacturing wastes that can be utilized in concrete. Therefore, here an effort will be done to fractional substitution of Coarse Aggregates by Polystyrene Beads. The research identified the benefits and potential risks of using this material with a view to recommending its use in the engineering environment and studied the properties, such as the compressive strength and tensile strengths of polystyrene concrete and compares that with the normal concrete...|$|R
40|$|For {{decades and}} even centuries, Swedish towns, {{prompted}} by the need for clean water, had discussed potential water systems. Some towns had developed plans, but it was first {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century that the gradual conversion was made to pipe-bound systems for water and sanitation. Not until 1863, after towns had gained the authority to collect taxes, borrow money, lay <b>pipes</b> through private <b>compounds,</b> and monitor the urban environment, did infrastructure development become the task of local government. Cholera epidemics and fire protection (and thus lower insurance fees) were among the factors motivating the town councils and property owners. Especially from 1875 on, the hygienic value of waterwas also emphasized in the effort to enforce public health legislation. Pipes for the systems were imported and designs emulated. When workers in Söderköping, a small but very old town with roots in the Middle Ages,dug up what appeared to be some kind of ancient wooden pipe of undetermined age and origin, another part of the townwas inexplicably flooded. The pipes were later dated to the 13 th century (Östergötland County Museum, Department of Archeology, personal communication, 1998). Numerous variants of pipes have been discovered during archeological excavations...|$|R
40|$|A {{factory in}} New Hampshire had a {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) release detected in a storm-water outfall <b>pipe.</b> Hydrogen Release <b>Compound</b> (HRC) injection {{was determined to be}} the best remedial solution. Tight soils, shallow water table, access limitations, and pending property sale complicated remediation. Groundwater was directly below the floor slab. The plume was centered on the storm-water drain which carries runoff from the upgradient parking lot under the building. The VOCs are believed to have entered the subsurface in the central area of the building through spillage; the storm drain system was a preferential pathway. The groundwater contamination was addressed through bioremediation using HRC. Application required many injection points and applications, due to the low permeability of the soil. Due to interference with operations and property sale, repeated openings of the floor for injections using a drill rig were not feasible. Permanent injection points were installed, but would not be accessible for direct injection. Therefore, a trench was cut into the concrete floor slab between each point and the wall. Piping ran from the injection point to the wall, terminating at a standpipe with a quick-connect fitting. Each trench was then fillled with concrete to restore the floor slab. Since starting HRC treatment, VOC levels at the outfall have dropped to below the state regulatory standard. One well had levels of 1800 ug/L and 1200 ug/L of Cis- 1, 2 Dichloroethene and Vinyl Chloride in April, 2008. By January, 2009, both were below MCLs.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of 43 pharmaceuticals and 2 metabolites of ibuprofen was evaluated at the inlet and the outlet of a pressure sewer pipe {{in order to}} asses if in-sewer processes affect the pharmaceutical concentrations during their pass through the <b>pipe.</b> The target <b>compounds</b> were detected at concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few μg/L, which {{are in the range}} commonly found in municipal wastewater of the studied area. The changes in concentrations between two sampling points were negligible for most compounds, i. e. from - 10 to 10 %. A higher decrease in concentrations (25 - 60 %) during the pass through the pipe was observed for diltiazem, citalopram, clarithromycin, bezafibrate and amlodipine. Negative removal was calculated for sulfamethoxazole (- 66 ± 15 %) and irbesartan (- 58 ± 25 %), which {{may be due to the}} conversion of conjugates back to their parent compounds in the sewer. The results show that microbial transformation of pharmaceuticals begins in sewer, albeit to different extents for different compounds. Therefore, the in-sewer transformation of pharmaceuticals should be assessed especially when their concentrations are used to estimate and refine the estimation of their per capita consumption in a catchment of interest in the sewage epidemiology approachThe study is a part of the project CTM 2011 - 27163 financed by the Spanish Ministery of Economy and Competitiveness.
