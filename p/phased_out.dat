5|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{high voltage}} power cables as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being <b>phased</b> <b>out.</b> Its use in solder for electronics is also being <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> by some countries {{to reduce the amount}} of environmentally hazardous waste. Lead is one of three metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials, helping detect organic acids, aldehydes, and acidic gases.|$|E

40|$|Britain and Germany are in {{the process}} of <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> the use of coal in power {{generation}} and this represents a major shift in the energy supply system of both countries. The article compares the process of <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> coal power generation in both countries. A PESTEL analysis technique is used to capture the external context of the coal <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> in both countries. This technique allows the identification of the drivers and barriers of the coal <b>phase</b> <b>out,</b> taking into account the differences between the two contexts. Important contrasts and lessons arise out of this comparative discussion of Britain and Germany. This comparison leads to an analysis of the risks and opportunities for the coal <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> in both countries and enables the transferability of the analysis to other countries that may face a decision to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> coal. For instance, several central and eastern European nations are still reliant on coal in power generation, but may need to reconsider energy policy in view of their climate obligations. The evaluation of factors identified in the PESTEL analysis phase helps the formulation of suggestions for policymakers in relation to the management of the coal <b>phase</b> <b>out...</b>|$|R

5|$|As the VOR {{system was}} phased {{in around the}} world, the LFR was {{gradually}} <b>phased</b> <b>out,</b> mostly disappearing by the 1970s. There are no remaining operational LFR facilities today. At its maximum deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR stations in the U.S. alone.|$|E
5|$|By the 1730s, {{the rating}} volunteer-per-order was <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> and {{replaced}} with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers. For example, a captain was allowed four servants for every 100men aboard his ship; many of these servants were young men destined to become officers.|$|E

25|$|The party also {{states that}} it would <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> fossil fuel-based power generation, and would close all {{coal-fired}} power stations by 2023. The Green Party would also <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> nuclear power within ten years.|$|R
30|$|Now {{that the}} nuclear <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> is well underway, {{and the new}} government’s focus is moving on to <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> coal. In the {{beginning}} of April 2018, the new minister of economic affairs and energy, Peter Altmeier, announced a target of cutting coal-fired power generation in half, by 2030. A roadmap for the coal <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> will be determined {{over the course of}} the year 2018. Chances are that the coal <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> will be nationally administered, resulting in negotiations between the government and the plant owners and potentially through litigation. Bypassing the EU-ETS, however, risks a drop in CO 2 prices, incentivising coal-fired power plant operators outside Germany to produce more electricity and potentially offsetting some of the CO 2 savings from the coal <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> in Germany (especially if less efficient plants fill the gap).|$|R
5|$|Forest owners with pre-1990 forests were {{to receive}} a fixed one-off free {{allocation}} of units. Transport (liquid fossil fuels), stationary energy and industrial processes would not receive a free allocation of units. Trade-exposed industries would have received a free allocation of 90% of 2005 emissions annually to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free allocation of units would have <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> {{at the rate of}} a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year. Agriculture would have received a free allocation of 90% of 2005 emissions each year to 2018. From 2019 to 2029 the free allocation would have <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> at the rate of a 1/12 (8.3%) reduction each year.

50|$|The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an {{international}} agreement that seeks to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> chemicals that damage the ozone layer. The Montreal protocol was signed in 1987, went into practice in 1989, and was further amended in London in 1990 and in Copenhagen in 1992. The protocol set a quicker timetable for industrialized nations to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> chemicals than it did for developing nations. For example, developed countries were to phase-out chlorofluorocarbons by 1995, but developing countries have until 2010 to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> this chemical. Other chemicals that it wanted to <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> were halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, hydrochloroforlourocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, and methyl bromide.|$|R
30|$|<b>Phasing</b> <b>out,</b> {{switching}} {{and moving}} – {{these are the}} central topics of the debate: <b>phasing</b> <b>out</b> nuclear power; switching to relatively cleaner coal and gas energy; moving to renewable energies: solar, wind, water, biomass and geothermal energy.|$|R

5|$|Although {{approximately}} 96% of {{the population}} had access {{to at least one}} digital service, take up was initially sluggish, with only 28% of Australia's 7.8 million households having adopted free-to-air digital television by March 2007. However, by August 2010, 75% of Australian households had made the switch. Analog transmissions began to be <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> in 2010, and ceased to be available nationwide by the end of 2013.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effects of}} the German nuclear <b>phase</b> <b>out,</b> {{focusing}} on the seven nuclear power plants affected by the March 2011 moratorium, and continuing through the final <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> of the last plant in 2022. We provide an ex-post assessment of model analyses on the impact of the nuclear moratorium presented by the modelling community, in 2011 or shortly after These are then compared with the real-world developments over 2011 - 2013. Amongst others, modelers were right to forecast a modest effect on electricity prices, a reduction of the net export surplus, and a slight increase of fossil and renewable electricity generation. Overall, the impacts were modest, and the <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> has proceeded gently, without any major disturbance. We also provide recent modelling results on the final <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> of all German nuclear power plants by 2023. Given the expected conventional expansions and a continuous rise in renewable electricity generation, we expect the nuclear <b>phase</b> <b>out</b> to proceed smoothly, and no capacity shortages to occur...|$|R
5|$|Although cavalry {{was used}} {{extensively}} {{throughout the world}} during the 19th century, horses became less important to warfare after {{the beginning of the}} 20th century. Light cavalry was still seen on the battlefield {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, but formal mounted cavalry began to be <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> for combat during and immediately after World War I, although units that included horses still had military uses well into World War II.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{adaptation}} is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) {{that fits}} into a common basketball court sized arena. This was quite popular when races {{were held at}} imperial distances, which gradually was <b>phased</b> <b>out</b> by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s.

5|$|In 1794, officers' {{servants}} were abolished and a {{new class}} of volunteers called 'volunteer class I' was created for boys between the ages of 11 and 13 who were considered future midshipmen and lived in the gunroom on a ship-of-the-line or with the midshipmen on a frigate or smaller vessel. Volunteers were paid £6 per year. By 1816, the rating of midshipman ordinary was <b>phased</b> <b>out,</b> and all apprentice officers were rated as midshipmen.|$|E
