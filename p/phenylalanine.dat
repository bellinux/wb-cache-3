5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} <b>phenylalanine</b> or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain.

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from <b>phenylalanine</b> in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain.

Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (<b>phenylalanine,</b> tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{envelope}} glycoprotein (GP) of Ebolavirus (EBOV) mediates viral entry into host cells. Through mutagenesis, we {{and other groups}} reported that two <b>phenylalanines</b> at positions 88 and 159 of GP are critical for viral entry. However, it remains elusive which steps of viral entry are impaired by F 88 or F 159 mutations and how. In this study, we further characterized these two <b>phenylalanines</b> through mutagenesis and examined the impact on GP expression, function, and structure. Our data suggest that F 159 plays an indirect role in viral entry by maintaining EBOV GP's overall structure. In contrast, we did not detect any evidence for conformational differences in GP with F 88 mutations. The data suggest that F 88 influences viral entry during a step after cathepsin processing, presumably impacting viral fusion...|$|R

40|$|SummaryToll-like {{receptor}} 2 (TLR 2) initiates potent immune {{responses by}} recognizing diacylated and triacylated lipopeptides. Its ligand specificity {{is controlled by}} whether it heterodimerizes with TLR 1 or TLR 6. We have determined the crystal structures of TLR 2 -TLR 6 -diacylated lipopeptide, TLR 2 -lipoteichoic acid, and TLR 2 -PE-DTPA complexes. PE-DTPA, 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine-N-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, is a synthetic phospholipid derivative. Two major factors contribute to the ligand specificity of TLR 2 -TLR 1 or TLR 2 -TLR 6 heterodimers. First, the lipid channel of TLR 6 is blocked by two <b>phenylalanines.</b> Simultaneous mutation of these <b>phenylalanines</b> made TLR 2 -TLR 6 fully responsive not only to diacylated but also to triacylated lipopeptides. Second, the hydrophobic dimerization interface of TLR 2 -TLR 6 is increased by 80 %, which compensates {{for the lack of}} amide lipid interaction between the lipopeptide and TLR 2 -TLR 6. The structures of the TLR 2 -lipoteichoic acid and the TLR 2 -PE-DTPA complexes demonstrate that a precise interaction pattern of the head group is essential for a robust immune response by TLR 2 heterodimers...|$|R

Conserved aromatic residues in the RRM are located {{on the surface of the}} beta-sheet and are important for RNA binding. To further our understanding of the structural basis of RRM-nucleic acid interaction, we carried out a high resolution analysis of UP 1, the N-terminal, two-RRM domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 1 (hnRNP A 1), whose structure was previously solved at 1. 75 - 1. 9 A resolution. The two RRMs of hnRNP A 1 are closely related but have distinct functions in regulating alternative pre-mRNA splice site selection.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes new peptide-based {{methods for}} assembling and controlling the morphologies, metrics, and properties of gold nanoparticle superstructures. The {{aim of this}} research is to develop the peptide-based method by modifying the peptide sequences and controlling the reaction conditions for the synthesis and assembly of gold nanoparticle superstructures to achieve reliable control over their morphology and metrics, and furthermore study their properties and applications. With this goal in mind, the C-terminus of a gold-binding peptide was modified with different numbers of hydrophobic <b>phenylalanines</b> to affect peptide assembly and ultimately nanoparticle assembly. The addition of hydrophobic <b>phenylalanines</b> to the C-terminus of peptide conjugates promoted fiber bundling which in turn lead to the formation of thick or intertwined 1 -D nanoparticle superstructures. Furthermore, I prepared spherical gold nanoparticle superstructures with varied diameters (40 nm, 75 nm, and 150 nm) and visible to near-infrared optical properties by using a single peptide conjugate molecule yet varied reaction conditions.

40|$|Dopamine {{receptor}}s {{belong to}} the seven transmembrane helix-containing, G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Mutagenesis studies suggest that dopamine and its analogues interact with aspartate- 114 in helix 3 and two helix 5 serines (194 and 197) of the D 2 receptor. In addition to these amino acids, hydrophobic residues within the receptor core may be important not only for binding but also for receptor activation. Described is a site-directed mutagenesis investigation into the roles of these hydrophobic residues in the long isoform of the human D 2 receptor. Replacement of helix 6 <b>phenylalanines</b> (389 or 390) with alanines resulted in disrupted binding to several agonists and antagonists and impaired inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. Replacement of the helix 5 phenylalanine- 198 with an alanine selectively disrupted [3 H]N- 0437 binding, whereas the affinities for other agonists and antagonists remained unchanged. This mutant remained functionally intact when stimulated with dopamine or bromocriptine. Replacement of the helix 7 phenylalanine- 411 or the helix 6 leucine- 387 with alanines produced receptors that bound agonists well but were unable to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Based on these data, two conserved helix 6 <b>phenylalanines</b> (389 and 390) appear to be crucial for ligand binding, and phenylalanine- 411 in helix 7 and leucine- 387 in helix 6 may be important for propagating conformational changes from the agonist binding site(s) to G protein coupling domain(s) of the D 2 receptor...|$|R
