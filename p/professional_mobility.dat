The study recommends that a comprehensive discussion related to <b>professional</b> service <b>mobility</b> be one of the priorities in the APEC 2015 summit, in particular covering topics such as the APEC-wide Qualifications Referencing Framework, guiding principles in country-to-country labor policies, human capital management, and the systematic collection of good labor statistics...|$|R

Specific research problems of the study are to analyze the correlation properties of the mobile identity and mobile professional; the possibilities of forming <b>professional</b> <b>mobility</b> of teachers in the absence or underdevelopment of personal preconditions for mobility; search the features that can compensate this deficiency. Methods. The study is based on a theoretical analysis of different methodological approaches to the description of the personal and <b>professional</b> <b>mobility.</b> Also there were used the results of non-formal interview which was aimed at identifying the characteristics of the mobile professional teacher of high school. Results and scientific novelty. The concepts of «personal mobility» and «professional mobility» are clarified. Personal mobility is defined in the work as an integrative personal qualities, based on the individual properties (activity, plasticity, flexibility, adaptability, high energy source) and manifests itself in the behavior and activities of the entity in the form of commitment, independence, openness to new experience, creativity and motivation for self-development, speed decisionmaking. <b>Professional</b> <b>mobility</b> is interpreted as a strategy to adapt to the changing conditions of professional activity, which is a special case of the general personal life strategy. Psychological readiness for pedagogical activity is considered as a link between the personal and <b>professional</b> <b>mobility.</b> Nine types of teacher's <b>professional</b> <b>mobility,</b> emerging as a result of different levels of personal mobility combined with the severity of psychological readiness for pedagogical activity are described. Practical significance. The analysis of the conjugacy problem of personal and <b>professional</b> <b>mobility</b> creates an informational basis for prolonged work on the formation of <b>professional</b> <b>mobility</b> behavior of the high school teacher, the main focus of which is the development of technologies for psychological support of the formation of psychological readiness for activity as a mediating link between the personal and <b>professional</b> <b>mobility.</b> </p...|$|E
