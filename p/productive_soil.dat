The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly <b>productive</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E

The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, <b>productive</b> <b>soil)</b> was built around large cotton plantations whose owners' wealth grew mainly from slave labor. The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state {{within a few years}} of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.|$|E

2500|$|Between the Berkshires and {{the rest}} of the state lies the Connecticut River Valley, known within Massachusetts as the Pioneer Valley. This ancient rift valley {{appeared}} in the Mesozoic Era when North and South America broke away from Europe and Africa. [...] Dinosaur footprints near Mount Tom bear witness to that era, and series of basalt and sedimentary rock ridges (collectively known as the Metacomet Ridge) including Mount Toby, Mount Holyoke, Mount Tom, and others extending south to Long Island Sound and the valley's abrupt thousand-foot (300 meter) western escarpment illustrate the tectonic forces. [...] More than a hundred million years later, as the Pleistocene epoch ended, receding glaciers left moraines that dammed the Connecticut River, creating Lake Hitchcock. [...] Lacustrine silt deposits replaced soil scraped away by the glaciers, leaving behind deep, <b>productive</b> <b>soil</b> after the river breached the obstructing moraine and the lake disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|The Greek {{government}} had been desperately short of money {{since the start}} of the revolution, and in February 1823, the banker Andréas Louriótis arrived in London, seeking a loan from the City. Assisted by the London Greek Committee, which included several MPs and intellectuals, Louriótis began to lobby the City for a loan. One of the British philhellenes, Edward Blaquiere, issued a report in September 1823 which grossly exaggerated Greece's wealth and claimed that once independent, Greece would easily become [...] "one of the most opulent nations of Europe". Blaquiere further assisted the campaign by published two books in 1824, in which he claimed :"I should have no hesitation whatever in estimating the physical strength of regenerated Greece to be fully equal to the whole South American continent", concluding there was [...] "no part of the world...with a more <b>productive</b> <b>soil</b> or happier climate than Greece...Of all the countries or governments who have borrowed money in London within the last ten years...Greece possesses the surest and most ample means of re-payment".|$|E
2500|$|... "White Russia", a {{compound}} of the Belarusian bel- (-, [...] "white") and Rus ( [...] , Rus') adopted in 1991. The meaning is [...] "Russian" [...] in the cultural and historic ( [...] , ruskʺ; Old Belarusian: , ruski; , russkiy) but not national sense ( [...] , rossiyánin), a distinction sometimes made by translating the name as [...] "White Ruthenia", although [...] "Ruthenian" [...] has other meanings as well. The name is first attested in the 13th century as German Weissrussland and Latin Russia Alba, first in reference to Russia's White and then Black Sea coasts. The exonym was next applied to Great Novgorod and then Muscovy after its conquest of that region, finally being applied to its present region in the late 16th century to describe ethnically Russian regions being conquered from Poland. This last change was politically motivated, with Russia employing the foreign term to justify its revanchism at Poland's expense. The original meaning of [...] "white" [...] in Belarus's name is unknown. It may simply have arisen from confusion with legends concerning Caucasian Albania or from a use of colors to distinguish cardinal directions as seen in [...] "Red Russia". Other theories include its use to distinguish Belarus as [...] "free" [...] or [...] "pure", particularly of Mongolian control, or to distinguish the region from [...] "Black Russia", a region of <b>productive</b> <b>soil.</b> For the further etymology of Rus, see Russia below.|$|E
