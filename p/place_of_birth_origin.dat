Method: Population data come from decen-nial U. S. Census Bureau surveys. Disability data for adults ≥ 50 years old come from the 2008 American Community Survey. Results: The Hispanic population in the Midwest has tripled since 1980 and now constitutes 6. 6 % of the entire Midwest population. Older Midwest Hispanics are somewhat younger, have a higher male–female ratio, {{and are more likely to}} be born outside the continental United States than Southwest Hispanics.

40|$|Motherhood has {{recently}} re-emerged as ‘material’ for artistic practice, {{and as a}} viable subject of academic research that both recognizes and extends earlier feminist assertions that the maternal is a key site for the anxious psychosocial negotiations of identity, subjectivity, equality, ethics and politics. Additionally, pregnancy and birth have graphically entered the public domain. Hundreds of thousands of short films <b>of</b> live <b>birth,</b> for instance, circulate around the globe on video sharing platforms such as YouTube, some with followings of many million viewers. Yet, how might we understand the desire to perform and spectate birth? ‘YouTube birth’ raises questions about performing and spectating birth in digital culture, {{and the meaning of}} watching our own birth with a mass public of millions of viewers. In this paper I explore these questions through revisiting the psychoanalytic notion of the ‘primal scene’. The primal scene is the Freudian articulation of the crucial role of infantile sexual and violent fantasies in structuring psychic life, linked to the loss of, or denial of, the material/maternal body as source or origin. Although within feminist scholarship the primal scene as a theoretical concept is radically out of date, it may be productive to revisit primal fantasies in the digital age, and the ways digital technologies shift our relation to ‘analogue’ notions <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> scene, <b>birth,</b> <b>origin</b> and loss. Exploring the continued <b>place</b> <b>of</b> psychoanalysis in helping to understand issues to do with origin, reproduction and temporality, I ask both what psychoanalysis might have to offer our understanding of performing and watching birth, and how a psychoanalytic configuration of the primal scene may itself need to change in relation to digital primal fantasies and technologies that function through fungibility and loss-less-ness...|$|R

Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions Political involvement is gauged by self-assessment of interest in politics, voting behaviour and election involvement (with special reference to the 1970 General Election), party identification and membership history. Political knowledge and sophistication is assesed by formation of party images (Conservative, Labour, Liberal and Plaid Cymru), correct identification of: the current prime minister, the Cardiganshire MP, the Secretary of State for Wales and the functions of the Welsh Office, and use made of MP and/or local councillor to help with a problem. Attitudinal data: voluntary mention of important problems facing the country (up to 5 recorded) and, in addition, attitudes towards a number of general policy issues are collected (e. g. rising prices, Common Market, unemployment, strikes, governmental influence etc.). Further, the respondent is asked to state the forms of political protest that he believes can, under certain circumstances, be justified (e. g. pulling down signposts, blowing up pipelines etc. - 9 categories). Welsh politics specifically: attitudes towards the amount of say the Welsh have in British governmental matters affecting Wales (and, particularly, perceptions of governmental understanding of the needs of Cardiganshire in relation to other parts of Britain), respondent-preferred governmental system for Wales (5 categories), opinions on topics including the preservation of the Welsh language, the Investiture, Sunday opening, English people living in Wales etc. - questions relating to Welsh identity are closely considered. Finally, respondents are asked to state their likes and dislikes of life in Cardiganshire. Contextual data include: perception of class consciousness and Welsh national consciousness (respondent is asked to describe a stereotype Welsh character and a type with completely opposite characteristics, he is then asked to place himself on a scale between these two extremes), whether Welsh speaking (if yes, amount spoken in home, social and work environments is given), whether attends (or follows through the media) national and local eisteddfodau and cymafa ganu. Data include newspaper and magazine readership (Welsh periodicals included), TV news and current affairs viewing, radio news and current affairs listening. Background Variables Sex, age, cohort, marital status, number of children, household composition, terms of home tenure (5 categories), age when left school, whether had any further full-time education, whether ever lived outside Cardiganshire (5 categories), <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of parents, occupation of father, whether respondent has even been outside the British Isles, identification of head of household, employment status (i. e. full or part-time etc.), job description and occupational classification of head of household (and respondent where different), finally, religious and political party affiliations and voting behaviour of parents...|$|R
40|$|Hirsutism is a {{term that}} refers to the {{presence}} of excess body and facial hair in women, that is more typical of the hair growth pattern in men. Areas where hirsutism appears are hormonal depended areas and include the face (upper lip, chin), and the body (chest, upper and lower back, upper and lower abdomen, forearms and pelvic areas). Hirsutism should be clinically distinguished from hypertrichosis, which is referred as an increased hair growth at normal sites such as the arms. The volume and distribution of the hair follicles are genetically influenced. As a consequence, morphological differences in hair growth and predisposition toward hirsutism are observed between different ethnic groups. Several investigators have examined the prevalence of hirsutism in selected populations and {{it has been suggested that}} Mediterranean people show great tendencies in hirsutism. In this study, five hundred and ninety two Greek women, from 18 to 35 years, were evaluated by individual interviews based on a questionnaire, physical examination and some of them (100) by further hormonal controls in order to detect hirsutism which seems to be rather common among Greek women with a percentage of 16. 4 %. There are strong family and racial influences in hirsutism, so is highly prevalent within families, suggesting a genetic basic for the disorder. By examining familial background, 65. 3 % of hirsute women mentioned their mother was also hirsute and 65. 5 % of hirsute women mentioned their father was hypertrichotic. This study also demonstrated the presence of hirsutism in correlation to factors that influence the hair growth in women. Correlations between the presence of hirsutism in women and age, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> and residence, <b>origin,</b> women’s height and medical history were non significant. From women’s medical history, only a clue was observed in correlation between hirsutism and diabetes mellitus as the two diabetic women in the sample, were both hirsutes. Rapid progression of hair growth was not noticed in hirsute women, except for one and the onset of hirsutism started mostly in puberty. Women with galactorrhea and symptoms of virilization were not detected, except for one with no breast development and irregular menses. Hirsutism was correlated to the body mass index, as it was observed that overweight (BMI> 25) and obese women (BMI> 30) were hirsutes in 25. 9 % and 25 % respectively, while thin (BMI< 18. 5 %) and normal women (BMI< 24. 99) were hirsutes in 5. 5 % and 16. 8 %, respectively. Hirsutism was correlated to the acne, as it was observed that acneic women were hirsutes in 20. 9 %, whereas women without acne were hirsutes in 13. 1 %. Hirsutism was also correlated to the menstruation, as 13. 2 % of the women with normal menses were hirsutes, whereas 27. 7 % of the women with abnormal menses were hirsutes. Correlations between the presence of hirsutism in women and drug history was non significant, except for contraceptives as 28. 9 % of the hirsute women and 10. 5 % of the non hirsute women had been treated with oral contraceptives. ...|$|R

The proposed hypothesis was that players born {{earlier in the year}} would be over-represented compared to those born later in their age band. A secondary hypothesis was that access to the ETP would be independent <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> Methods: The dates and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> all elite youth footballers (n = 1936) selected onto the ETP since its inception were examined. χ 2 tests were used to establish if the dates <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> differed from the expected population distribution. Odds ratios were used to identify spatial variation in relation to <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> and talent production. Results: The results showed that admission to the ETP is not independent <b>of</b> quarter <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> (P. 05, χ 2 = 256. 817, w =. 388). <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> analysis showed an unequal geographical distribution of players gaining selection onto the ETP. Selection onto the ETP was not independent <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> (P <. 05, χ 2 = 149. 457, w =. 278). Footballers developed in counties that had an ETP centre were almost 50 % more likely to gain selection than those without a centre (OR 1. 455, 95 % CI 1. 314 - 1. 612).
