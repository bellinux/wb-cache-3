5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local <b>product</b> <b>made</b> by traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end <b>product</b> <b>made</b> by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{conceptual}} {{research paper}} is about Malaysians’ perceptions toward <b>products</b> <b>made</b> in Malaysia versus <b>products</b> <b>made</b> in China. Local products are generally {{perceived as being}} of lesser quality compared to others. It is now common for most products to have the label “Made in China”; unfortunately, <b>products</b> <b>made</b> in China are also not renowned for their quality. With this in mind, what would Malaysians’ choices be? <b>Products</b> <b>made</b> in China are often cheaper compared to locally <b>made</b> <b>products,</b> mainly due to China's massive production industry. Apart from price, other factors that will be tested {{in this study are}} ethnocentrism and product quality (including aesthetics, performance and durability) that might affect consumers’ purchase decisions toward <b>products</b> <b>made</b> in China or Malaysia...|$|R

5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. Onion rings {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed <b>product</b> <b>made</b> from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the United States and Western European {{countries}} {{introduced legislation}} to reduce lead air pollution. The impact was significant: while {{a study conducted}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of population had elevated blood lead levels, in 1991–1994, a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%. The main <b>product</b> <b>made</b> of lead {{by the end of the}} 20th century was the lead–acid battery, which posed no direct threat to humans. From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the Western Bloc grew by a third. The share of the world's lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major lead production in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.|$|E

Pulque's popularity {{is low and}} continues to fall. Twenty years ago, about 20 trucks would come every three days to Xochimilco (in southern Mexico City) to deliver pulque, but now the number is down to one or two. Only five pulquerias remain in this district, where {{there used to be}} 18. The situation is similar in most other parts of Mexico, as well. The remaining pulquerias are very small establishments, selling a <b>product</b> <b>made</b> by small producers.|$|E

By mid-year they were producing three of their own cars a week and producing Léon Bollée cars under licence. Lawson claimed to have made 20 cars by July 1897 making the Daimler Britain's first motor car to go into serial production, an honour that is also credited to Humber Motors who had also displayed, but in their case their production models, at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1896. The Daimlers had a twin-cylinder, 1526cc engine, mounted {{at the front of}} the car, four-speed gearbox and chain drive to the rear wheels.|$|E
25|$|The Rambler American was {{introduced}} to the Mexican market in 1958 through direct importation from the US. Early in the year, American Motors signed an agreement with an assembly plant based in Monterrey, Nuevo León, that produced a number of vehicles for different makes and had its own dealership network. Virtually, the whole Rambler line was available. However, production and sales volumes were low and the agreement was terminated in late 1959. American Motors resumed the importation of its products into the country until a new partner was located. Early in 1960, the company signed a new agreement with Willys Mexicana S.A. de C.V. and the first model produced was none other than the Rambler American, becoming the first American Motors <b>product</b> <b>made</b> and sold by the company that would become Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos S.A.|$|E

The Master Agreement also provided that its breach would {{have no effect on}} the License Agreement and would not be grounds for its termination. Apparently, LGE was willing to allow Intel’s customers to combine the microprocessor products with products not licensed by LGE, but only upon payment of a further royalty to LGE for the right to do so. This point is not discussed in the Court’s opinion, which recites the facts only in very limited terms because the record was under seal to protect trade secrets.|$|E
25|$|Women of Native American {{societies}} in North America including the Apache, Maricopa, Pima, and Tohono O'odham brewed a Saguaro cactus beer or wine, called tiswin for rituals. Apache women also produced a <b>product</b> <b>made</b> from corn, which {{was similar to}} Mexican beers, known as tulpi or tulapa which was used in girls' puberty rights. The Coahuiltecan and other tribes from their Texas vicinity made an intoxicant from yucca and the red beans of the mountain laurel. In the North American colonies women continued with homebrewing and {{for at least a}} century was the predominant means of beer production. While Thomas Jefferson may have been famous for his brewing, Martha Jefferson was equally renowned for her wheat beer. The first commercial brewster in the Thirteen Colonies was Mary Lisle, who inherited her father's brewery in 1734 and operated it until 1751.|$|E
25|$|Farnham {{has long}} had a strong {{association}} with the creative arts.

Allen, potters such as Mary Watts and landscape gardeners such as Gertrude Jekyll worked in the area. Lewen Tugwell, a Farnham sculptor in the 1960s, invented a technique for production of a unique craft <b>product</b> <b>made</b> from resin, Shattaline. Items made by this process in his workshops in Long Garden Walk are now very collectable. Farnham has several art galleries - the New Ashgate Gallery in Lower Church Lane has exhibitions by established and new artists in a variety of media, the exhibition changing on the first Saturday of each month. The gallery at Farnham Maltings also has frequent exhibitions.|$|E
