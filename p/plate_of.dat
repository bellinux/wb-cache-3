5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E

5|$|Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E
5|$|The mesosoma is half {{as broad}} than the head when viewed dorsally. The {{junction}} of the mesoscutellum (middle {{part of the}} scutellum) and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct; on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron (the lateral exoskeletal <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> the prothorax) is well developed and the mesopleuron (the lateral exoskeleton <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> the mesothorax) is separated {{from the rest of}} the mesosoma by distinct sulci (deep grooves of the head). The propodeum is high and the propodeal spiracles (external openings) are slit-like and located around the mid-regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla (the reservoirs) is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior margins are bordered by a carina. The trochantellus (proximal end of the femur) is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs; the large spur ("calcar") is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the calcar. Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth.|$|E

5|$|These ore bodies {{formed in}} {{different}} places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E
5|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all {{birds in}} the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published a <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton {{noted that it}} confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Needham (died 3 May 1731), {{also known}} as Mother Needham, was an English procuress and brothel-keeper of 18th-century London, who has been {{identified}} as the bawd greeting Moll Hackabout in the first <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> William Hogarth's series of satirical etchings, A Harlot's Progress. Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and {{died as a result of}} the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory.|$|E
5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter. The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad and a <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of}} the temple.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for Jordanian hospitality and {{is influenced by the}} Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
5|$|The {{zygomatic}} {{plates are}} almost completely vertical. As Winge already noted, the front {{margin of the}} zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the zygomatic <b>plate</b> <b>of</b> living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the zygomatic plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the zygomatic arches is bended forward and the zygomatic plates are bended outward. Furthermore, the zygomatic notch, the notch between the zygomatic plate and arch, is deep, not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|E
