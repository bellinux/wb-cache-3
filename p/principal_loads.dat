Problems arise because not all teachers possess the potential sensitivity adequate for identifying and analyzing materials for character education in the learning materials or lesson books used. The teachers tend to merely teach whatever is explicit in the learning materials while the materials for character education implicit in the learning materials are not perceived and revealed. As a result, the character education implied is not worked out and does not reach the learner. To solve the problem, certain strategies need to be employed in carrying out character education integrated in the competency-based class subjects. The strategies cover presentation and learning strategies, the former further covering implicit and explicit strategies and the latter further covering deductive and inductive strategies. The strategies could also be combined into implicit-deductive, implicit-inductive, explicit-deductive, and explicit-inductive ones.

Prolonged indirect fractures of the shaft of the femur {{are among the most}} common fractures encountered in orthopedic practice. Since the femur is the largest bone of the body and one of the <b>principal</b> <b>loads</b> bearing bone in the lower extremity, fractures can cause prolonged morbidity and extensive disability unless treatment is appropriate. In the recent years interlocking intramedullary nailing has become the technique of choice which decreases the complications and the duration of morbidity. In our country no study has bean achieved to compare this technique and traditional plating method. The aim of our study was to compare the time needed for fracture union of these two techniques. Materials & Methods: This study was a prospective clinical trial. 48 cases were randomly divided in two groups and were undergone plating method and interlocking intramedullary nailing. The groups were followed for bone union for at least one year. The information were analyzed by statistical exams (t-test, chi square, Cox regression, Kaplan meier) Results: Interlocking intramedullary nailing technique group showed a decreased union time (14. 4 weeks) compared with plating technique (19. 6 weeks) (P< 0. 001). The union time in open fracture in two groups were significantly increased (P< 0. 02). Conclusion: Interlocking technique is seriously recommended for treatment of femur shaft fractures because of decreased fracture union time and rapid rehabilitation and providing the facility for this technique is cost effective for all orthopedic surgery centers...|$|E

50|$|All {{parts of}} a bearing are subject to many design constraints. For example, {{the inner and outer}} races are often complex shapes, making them {{difficult}} to manufacture. Balls and rollers, though simpler in shape, are small; since they bend sharply where they run on the races, the bearings are prone to fatigue. The loads within a bearing assembly are also affected by the speed of operation: rolling-element bearings may spin over 100,000 rpm, and the <b>principal</b> <b>load</b> in such a bearing may be momentum rather than the applied load. Smaller rolling elements are lighter and thus have less momentum, but smaller elements also bend more sharply where they contact the race, causing them to fail more rapidly from fatigue.

One of the objectives {{of this study was to}} numerically investigate the existence of a relationship between load transfer capacity of a joint in rigid pavements and its dynamic response. The approach adapted for the present study is based on a numerical model which accurately represents the mechanism of shear transfer in reinforced concrete members implemented it in a commercially available finite element code. That tool is then used for the analysis of two models which consisted of various joint conditions. One model represented an ideal condition of full load transfer across a joint, while the other model was used to simulate variable load transfer conditions. The results obtained are analyzed in the time and frequency domains. These results provided a comprehensive description of the joint response characteristics, and enabled the derivation of a clear relationship between the response frequencies and the joint's shear transfer capabilities.

Evaluation of this approach requires {{the determination of the}} effectiveness of stiffness tailoring through the use of curvilinear fiber paths in flat panels including the reduction of stress concentrations around the holes and the increase in load carrying capability.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{applications}} for fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) is growing, the importance of understanding the failure behavior of this material is rising. This is merely conceivable by developing precise computational material models, which saves time, material, and energy. In general, the polymer matrix is the constitute with the lowest strength against failure in a FRP; hence the matrix requires additional attention especially under transverse compression where it is considered as the <b>principal</b> <b>load</b> carrying component of the FRP. In the present work, a comparative study on the modeling of matrix cracking in FRP laminates under transverse compression is carried out. To do so, an eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) approach is developed for discrete crack modeling, and the conventionally used smeared crack approach is applied via an existing Abaqus/Explicit implementation for continuum crack modeling. The comparison of the results illustrates that despite different kinematics behind the models, they both successfully predict a near identical material degradation and energy dissipation in the material response, but with differing predictions when considering frictional tractions and the predicted maximum stress levels. XFEM is established to be mesh-objective and the smeared crack method predicts the material response optimally when the mesh discretization is one element per ply with reduced integration excluding non-linear geometry effects. Moreover, the wedge effect described by geometrical deformation is distinctly represented as cracks are studied explicitly in XFEM, which provides the possibility of further study for inter-laminar effects such as delamination, crack propagation and crack migration.
