However, the ‘effectiveness’ of these features in situations where wind <b>power</b> <b>park</b> <b>modules</b> are connected to ‘weak’ systems needs further clarification. The objective of the paper is to study the response of wind <b>power</b> <b>park</b> <b>modules</b> in distribution systems to transmission network faults during reverse power flows. The focus lies on the ‘effectiveness’ of their fast voltage control. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the differences made by the pre-fault operating point, the wind power park module’s fault and post-fault control modes and their settings, and the load modelling. The results show that correct load modelling is very important, the post-fault transmission system voltage recovery is worsened during reverse power flows, and that reactive current injection significantly affects the post-fault voltage recovery. Certain grid connection requirements worsened voltage recovery or even caused instability for some control settings...|$|E
40|$|Power {{systems are}} {{undergoing}} a historic structural and technological transformation. The increase of distributed generation (DG), recently mostly wind <b>power</b> <b>park</b> <b>modules</b> (WPPMs) and photovoltaic <b>power</b> <b>park</b> <b>modules</b> (PVPPMs), is already {{changing the way}} power systems are structured and operated. Distribution systems are turning from ‘passive’ into ‘active’ parts of the system (ADS). This structural and technological transformation influences the power system’s network fault response and stability. This thesis investigates the network fault response of transmission and distribution systems with very high penetration of distributed generation. The impact of DG on transient stability, large disturbance voltage stability, and frequency stability is analysed. The analysis is limited to symmetrical, three-phase network faults only but extended to adequately represent all voltage levels, including DG connected at low voltage (LV). Requirements for the response of DG to network faults are defined in grid connection requirement (GCR). The massive insertion of DG into distribution systems (DSs) leads to new challenges like the regular occurrence of reverse power flow (RPF) from the distribution to transmission level etc. Further, DG {{is more likely to}} be exposed to fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) events than transmission and sub-transmission connected generating facilities. The overall objective of this thesis is, therefore, to critically review the necessity and the specification of current and proposed grid connection requirements with regard to the network fault response of transmission systems with very high penetration of distributed generation and to propose changes to the specification where needed. The scientific contributions of this thesis are (1) a proposed comprehensive methodology of aggregation of DGs and dynamic equivalencing to derive highly accurate dynamic equivalent models of ADSs that considers the composition of ADS with DG classes in terms of their technology type and grid code performance (performance legacy); (2) a case study demonstrating that nowadays undervoltage protection schemes for small- and medium-scale DG connected in LV distribution networks may become a risk for power system stability; (3) identification of minimum requirements and improvement of existing grid connection requirements for the network fault response of DG to maintain power system stability. <br/...|$|E
3000|$|Recognizing the {{operating}} difficulties arising {{from a large}} penetration of wind, many power system operators are making emulated inertia response from wind turbines mandatorily. For example, the European draft code (ENTSO-E) requires an inertia response from power plants above an agreed size. It specifies that [11], “The relevant TSO shall have the right, determined in cooperation with other TSOs in the relevant synchronous area, to require each <b>Power</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Module,</b> which does not inherently have a capability to supply additional active power to the network by its inertia and which is greater than a MW size to be specified by the relevant TSO, to install a feature in the control system which operates the <b>Power</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Module</b> so as to supply additional active power to the network in order to limit {{the rate of change}} of frequency following a sudden generation loss.” [...]...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find out what environmental impact a wave <b>power</b> <b>park</b> has on the Swedish west coast by creating a consultation paper (”Samrådsunderlag”) for the Lysekilproject at Uppsala University. To highlight the complexity of the problem a system analytic approach was used and illustrated by a Causal Loop Diagram. The overall assessment of the Lysekilprojects wave <b>power</b> <b>park</b> at the Swedish west coast is that it will have a low impact on the environment. This is due to the relative small size of the wave <b>power</b> <b>park</b> and some technical solutions made with the environmental aspect in mind. Artificial reefs and a sanctuary for marine species are effects created by the wave <b>power</b> <b>park</b> and in the longer term the impact will give access to an untapped source of renewable energy, wave energy. Thus reducing the need of fossil fuels and making it possible to reach the Swedish national environmental goals. Lysekilsprojekte...|$|R
