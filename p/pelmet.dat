5000|$|A <b>pelmet</b> (also {{called a}} [...] "cornice board") is a {{framework}} placed above a window, used to conceal curtain fixtures. These {{can be used}} decoratively (to hide the curtain rod) and help insulate the window by preventing convection currents. It is similar in appearance to a valance, which performs the same function but is made of fabric. A <b>pelmet</b> can be made of plywood, and may be painted, or fabric covered.|$|E

50|$|The foyer leads {{directly}} into the ballroom, a large auditorium with a shallow barrel-vaulted ceiling, complete with raised viewing dais, stage, proscenium, fixed banquettes and a sprung maple dance floor. The decorative scheme is kitsch and flamboyant, the effect created through red velour padded walls with gilt picture-frame style panels and decorated pilasters, scallop-shaped lights, a red velour <b>pelmet,</b> French chandeliers and Chinese lanterns.|$|E
5000|$|A window valance (or <b>pelmet</b> [...] in the UK) {{is a form}} {{of window}} {{treatment}} that covers the uppermost part of the window and can be hung alone or paired with window blinds, or curtains. Valances are a popular decorative choice in concealing drapery hardware. Window valances were popular in Victorian interior design. In draping or bunting form they are commonly referred to as swag.|$|E

50|$|Window {{valances}} {{are also}} called window top treatments. The earliest recorded {{history of interior design}} {{is rooted in}} the renaissance Era, a time of great change and rebirth in the world of art and architecture, and much of this time saw understated, simple treatments, eventually moving towards more elaborate fabrics of multiple layers of treatments, including, towards the end of this period, valances, swags, jabots, and pelmets. By the Baroque and early Georgian period (1643-1730), elaborate and theatrical treatments placed high emphasis on the cornice and <b>pelmet</b> as a way to finish off the top of a window treatment.|$|E
50|$|The chancel end of {{the church}} {{featured}} a patterned screen wall with green glass inserts and a softly illuminated gold finished cross surmounting a polished copper flower bowl. Natural light was provided by triangular side dormer windows positioned between the main trusses, triangular front windows surrounding a triangular brickwork panel and three triangular tinted fibreglass rooflights. By night it was lit by indirect fluorescent lights housed in <b>pelmets</b> along the side wall and spot lights in the lighting baffles at the apex.|$|R

50|$|The church {{walls are}} lined with vertically-jointed tongue and groove tulip oak boards laid diagonally, {{radiating}} out from the apex with center infill panels at the intersection in a dark stained sheet material. Lighting <b>pelmets</b> lining the side walls are decorated with a triangular motif and have triangular cut outs in the base to allow light to wash both {{up and down the}} walls. Suspended lighting baffles at the apex filter light from the roof lights above. The chancel has a screen, altar, lectern and planter that also incorporate triangular forms. Behind the screen is a single flight of stairs to the ground floor.|$|R
5000|$|Early 19th-century Shaker {{interiors}} {{are characterized}} by an austerity and simplicity. For example, they had a [...] "peg rail," [...] a continuous wooden device like a <b>pelmet</b> with hooks running all along it near the lintel level. They used the pegs to hang up clothes, hats, and very light furniture pieces such as chairs when not in use. The simple architecture of their homes, meeting houses, and barns has had a lasting influence on American architecture and design. There {{is a collection of}} furniture and utensils at Hancock Shaker Village outside of Pittsfield, Massachusetts that is famous for its elegance and practicality.|$|E
50|$|The lower foyer was extensive, with {{interior}} finishes of {{dark brown}} brick and horizontal timber panelling stained dark brown; {{the ceiling was}} also lined with the same dark timber. This theme is continued through to rubbish bins, ashtrays and display units which are made of the same timber with strong horizontal design elements and aluminium details. Boxed, timber <b>pelmet</b> lighting ran along the walls throughout both {{the upper and lower}} foyers and the stairs. The foyer space was arranged symmetrically with staircases of identical detailing {{on either side of the}} centrally located ticket office. The ticket office was located in the space beneath the stairs to Cinema Two (which was previously occupied by a fountain and decorative light fitting). Bold geometric carpet with a pattern of purple, green and blue circles and ellipses in a black background covered the floor throughout the entire foyer area, including the stairs.|$|E
50|$|The Blue Room was {{the larger}} and more ornate of the two cinemas. The most obvious feature was the vaulted ceiling, a plaster moonscape with craters of varying depths which conceal red, blue and green lights. Larger, {{shallower}} craters are interspersed with the light craters creating a rich and complex surface. There are 294 light globes on three circuits. A variety of lighting effects could be achieved using these different circuits and the coloured globes. A <b>pelmet</b> which concealed recessed lighting covered the intersection between ceiling and wall and turquoise woollen drapes fell to meet the carpet which came about one metre up the wall. The original carpet with an op-art, circular dot pattern of blue and brown was used throughout the cinema. The curve of the vault frames the screen which has several layers of turquoise wool drapes forming the curtain and surrounds. Architectural drawings from the 1970s refurbishment reveal that the plaster ceilings {{are attached to the}} bottom chord of the earlier curved timber truss.|$|E
50|$|Ground floor {{dining rooms}} and sitting room have plaster {{ceilings}} with elaborate circular surrounds to central lights. Doors are cedar panelled with rectangular fan lights over. Deep cornices and <b>pelmets</b> are of moulded cedar. The front dining room has walls of full height cedar, with 4 inch 100mm beaded vertical boarding above the panelling to dado height. The fireplace is dark grey marble. The sitting room has full height cedar panelling {{and a white}} marble fireplace. The formal dining room opposite has rendered walls with deep cedar skirting. The fireplace is painted. The adjoining office has an angled fireplace sheeted over. This room leads into a vaulted strong room in the northwest corner, rendered, with metal vent grilles.|$|R
5000|$|He {{inherited}} {{from his father}} the magnificent house at Castle Coole in County Fermanagh, along with considerable debts. Nonetheless he furnished the house and its classical interiors designed by James Wyatt in an exuberant Regency fashion between 1802 and 1825. Elaborate curtains and <b>pelmets,</b> pier glasses, [...] "Grecian" [...] couches and a magnificent state bed designed to accommodate King George IV on his state visit to Ireland in 1821 (although the king {{did not make it}} as far as Castle Coole, much to the disappointment of the earl) were all supplied by the Dublin upholsterer John Preston at a total cost of around £35,000. Lord Belmore also commissioned Sir Richard Morrison to build a new stable block in 1817.|$|R
50|$|In 1981 she {{published}} Paint Magic, which {{introduced the}} country to the practices of stenciling, stippling and the pleasures of festoon blinds. It went on to sell over a million copies around the world. At a time when DIY meant rawlplugs and melamine kitchen units, Innes introduced middle England to a world of <b>pelmets</b> and passementerie. In 1983 she became the Design Editor of Cosmopolitan magazine. She established her own paint company, Paint Magic, which had several stores in the UK and abroad. The company, of which Innes was chief executive, pioneered innovative ready-made paint finishes for customers to try out at home as well as giving popular decorating classes. Paint Magic ceased trading after a decade. Innes moved to Spitalfields in the 1979, where she renovated a derelict house from scratch, and was a passionate campaigner for the regeneration of the area.|$|R
50|$|Daisy Archer, {{and later}} her {{daughter}} Joan born in 1890, were {{largely responsible for}} the woodcarvings that decorate the interior of the main house at Gracemere Homestead. Daisy's interest in woodcarving had been inspired chiefly by the station bookkeeper, Henry James King-Church. He also fostered Joan's initial interest in the craft. Unlike her mother, whose work was completed for private enjoyment, Joan exhibited her work and received prizes in Rockhampton and Toowoomba. The key pieces of carving in the house decorated the sitting room. Prior to the 1890s, Daisy was responsible for carving the fireplace surrounds, the fire screen, the carved panels of the bookshelves, a spinning chair and behind this, a carved <b>pelmet.</b> Her husband Robert suggested that the chimneypiece be panelled and embellished, and this work was probably carried out before 1905. King-Church was responsible for the roundel {{at the top of the}} chimney, which carried the date AD 1858 and was surrounded by the motto 'East West hame's best'. Underneath it he also completed an opposing pair of griffins. Below this was Joan's first carving, matched bird panels. Daisy's carving for the bookshelves shows the inspiration she drew from Nordic folk carvings. While her cousin and fiance Alister Archer (James Archer's son) served overseas during the First World War, Joan completed a replica of a Norwegian chair from c1200 AD that was held in the Oslo Museum. She also completed a dining room dresser. Joan continued the Nordic associations but tackled illustrative themes from folk tales and legends and included figures rather than only flowers, scrolls and other Neo-Renaissance motifs.|$|E
50|$|Access to {{the first}} floor is via an elegant timber {{staircase}} with walls and balustrades of paneled timber. A round handrail is fixed with brackets to the balustrade and follows the curve of the staircase. Treads and risers are lined with carpet. Natural light enters the stairwell through the large arched leadlight window which is framed by wall mounted Art Deco light fittings. The vaulted ceiling over the stair is simply detailed and forms an archway to the upper vestibule. The upper level vestibule has walls lined with hard plaster and timber-paneling. Plaster ceilings have moulded plaster cornices. Timber skirting boards, architraves architrave blocks are intact throughout the room and all interior timber work and joinery has a varnished finish. Internal openings are generous in height and doors feature tall glazed pivoting fanlights. The first floor offices have varnished joinery including doors, architraves and picture rails and unusual decorative <b>pelmets.</b> Skirtings in these rooms have been painted.|$|R
50|$|The Purple Room {{had a more}} gentle ambience; {{however, the}} ceiling was also a {{significant}} feature. The ceiling was vaulted with floating, sprayed vermiculite, square panels over concealed purple lighting, translucent purple resin light boxes and square air conditioning vents arranged in an irregular pattern. Carpet of the same design as the Blue Room but in shades of purple and mauve {{was used in the}} front half of the auditorium; however later the foyer carpet was used in the stairs and passageways. A purple version of the foyer carpet was in the back section. The Purple Room had the same seating configuration as the Blue Room but with a smaller number of seats. Seats were upholstered in purple vinyl and the walls are covered with purple wool drapes. Timber detailing was the same as Cinema One and also included an usher's seat. Wall lighting was concealed under <b>pelmets</b> {{at the top of the}} walls. A fire escape stair was located to the right of the screen.|$|R
5000|$|The core {{comprises}} four {{rooms and}} a generous entrance vestibule, accessed from a central front entrance. To {{each side of the}} vestibule is a bedroom with large, double-hung sash windows opening onto the front and side verandahs, and beyond the vestibule is the parlour. Opening off the parlour, to the east, is the dining room. These rooms have particularly fine cedar joinery, including door and window architraves, cornices, skirting boards, a decorative timber arch between vestibule and parlour, and elegant timber fireplace surrounds. There are two double chimneys and a fireplace {{in each of the four}} main rooms, with original plaster to the chimneys. Throughout, the original pine lining to walls and ceilings - 8" [...] deep, beaded tongue and groove boarding, horizontally laid on the walls - has been masked by later masonite sheeting with timber cover strips and wallpaper. Lights above some of the doors have early decorative wax paper. Several of the rooms have early decorative pressed metal cornices or <b>pelmets</b> above the windows.|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{structure of the}} urban Illawarra That the {{industrial structure}} of the Illawarra region is dominated by and heavily dependent on its heavy metallurgy complex hardly requires demonstration. As Robinson (1977) has shown, for example, six major enterprises, Austral ian Iron and Steel (A. I. S. l, Lysaghts, Tube Makers, Commonwealth Steel, Electrolytic Refining and Smelting (E. R. & S.) and Metal Manufacturers (M. M.), employ between them more than 75 % of the region's manufacturing workforce {{and more than one}} third of the region 's total (male and female) employed workforce in 1976 - 77. As can be seen from Table 1, however, the range of industrial activity carried out in the region's factories and workshops is very much wider than basic metallurgy. At the level of the individual plant, for instance, a quite bewildering array of products is manufactured, ranging from foundation garments to fibreglass pools and surfboards, from plastic bags to <b>pelmets</b> and pyjamas, from low loaders to lemonade, from hats to home cleansing preparations and horsecovers and from textiles to railway waggons. Nor are all these other activities necessarily small in scale nor oriented simply to meeting the needs of a local market though many, of course, are both...|$|R
