5|$|In February, Carlsen won the 3rd Grenke Chess Classic after a five-game tiebreak with Arkadij Naiditsch. Carlsen had {{finished}} joint first with Naiditsch on 4½/7, beating Michael Adams, Anand, and David Baramidze, and losing to Naiditsch in their classical encounter. This tournament victory meant that Carlsen began 2015 by winning {{two out of}} two tournaments. Carlsen continued his streak in April, winning Shamkir Chess with a score of 7/9 (+5–0=4), defeating Mamedyarov, Caruana, Vachier-Lagrave, Kramnik, and Rauf Mamedov.

5|$|Another {{assessment}} system, Chessmetrics, {{calculates that}} Gossip's highest rating was 2470 (number 50 in the world) in April 1889. By comparison, the world's three highest-rated players {{at that time}} had Chessmetrics ratings over 2700. Chessmetrics also ranks Gossip number 17 in the world during four one-month periods between February and July 1873, when opportunities for high-level competition were much rarer. Like Diggle, Chessmetrics considers New York 1889 Gossip's best individual performance, concluding that he scored 39% against opponents with an average rating of 2595, giving him a <b>performance</b> <b>rating</b> of 2539 for that tournament. In 1904, the Deutsche Schachzeitung, {{on the basis of}} its tabulation of players' percentage scores in all major international tournaments from London 1851 to Cambridge Springs 1904, ranked Gossip the number 62 living player in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) {{held the}} first major chess tournament for computers, the North American Computer Chess Championship, in September 1970. CHESS 3.0, a chess program from Northwestern University, won the championship. Nowadays, chess {{programs}} compete in the World Computer Chess Championship, held annually since 1974. At first considered only a curiosity, the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong. In 1997, a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning World Champion for the first time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ (it scored two wins, one loss, and three draws).

40|$|This {{research}} involved three successive studies where precision {{teaching methods}} {{were used to}} increase roller skaters <b>performance</b> <b>rates</b> of basic skating skills. The first study compared precision teaching methods both with and {{without the use of}} charting in a group design, and compared both within-subject and betweensubject differences for 12 skaters. Results showed that charting did not increase <b>performance</b> <b>rates</b> over that seen when charting was not used. The second study was a group design which compared two different types of goals, or performance aims, on skaters‟ performance. No difference was found between the two groups of 5 skaters when one group used a fixed, difficult goal and a second used a flexible, easier goal. In the final study, a single-subject design was used and 8 skaters completed a control condition where no goals were set before a goal was introduced for 4 skaters. It was found that an immediate increase in <b>performance</b> <b>rates</b> occurred following the introduction of the goal.

40|$|Background: Low <b>performance</b> <b>rate</b> of {{comprehensive}} diabetic foot examinations (CDFEs) causing health care disparity. Objective: Increasing performance of CDFEs at Phoenix Indian Medical Center, an Indian Health Service (IHS) facility. Design: Before-after design, convenience sample. Setting: An IHS adult ambulatory care clinic in urban Phoenix, Arizona. Target: Four primary care providers (PCPs). Interventions: Utilizing the PDSA framework, a multidisciplinary group of clinical staff developed {{a process to}} increase the <b>performance</b> <b>rate</b> of CDFEs. Brainstorming, use of the Ishikawa diagram, and root cause analysis led to identification of factors contributing to low rates of CDFEs in the clinic. The QI intervention addressed multiple aspects of activities related to the CDFE performance, including pre-visit planning, enhanced communication, making equipment for CDFEs accessible to healthcare providers, and requesting patients to remove shoes and socks. Measurement: Weekly <b>performance</b> <b>rate</b> of CDFEs. Results: The results, analyzed with a run chart, showed an upward trend in performance for some providers. The median aggregate <b>performance</b> <b>rates</b> for pre and post intervention were 82. 6 % and 80. 2 %, respectively. Limitations: This study should be replicated over a longer time frame with more participants. Two significant weaknesses were identified in this study. The required provider de-identification prevented provider feedback. The data collection method provided CDFE performance data based on provider empanelment. This {{method of data collection}} reflects composite team care rather than specific provider behaviors. Conclusions: This multidisciplinary approach to improving the <b>performance</b> <b>rates</b> of CDFEs showed an upward trend for some providers but was not statistically significant. Post intervention CDFE <b>performance</b> <b>rates</b> were not improved. Significance: This study highlights the role of the doctorally prepared advanced practice nurse (DNP) in designing, facilitating and evaluating a practice change project to address the <b>rate</b> of provider <b>performance</b> of CDFE for their AI/NA patients. An exemplar, this QI intervention can be replicated for quality improvement initiatives targeting improved healthcare outcomes, crucial to the national effort of addressing healthcare disparities...|$|R

The professionals in the Nigerian construction companies are not exception to the perceived low job <b>performance</b> <b>rate</b> within the industry. Extant literature points to the fact that job characteristics of employees can account for variance in their job <b>performance</b> <b>rate.</b> This study compares the job <b>performance</b> <b>rate</b> and job characteristics of construction professionals in indigenous and expatriate construction companies with a view to establish a relationship between job performance and job characteristics of construction professionals. A total of 762 questionnaires were collected and used for the study.  Eighty one (81) construction companies, 50 (62 %) indigenous and 31 (38 %) expatriate were selected using stratified random sampling technique. Data collected were analysed using mean item score, spearman rank correlation, linear regression analysis where appropriate. Findings of the study revealed that the relationship between job characteristics and job performance of construction professionals in construction companies in Nigeria is positive but low and the correlation coefficient is higher in expatriate construction companies. Based on the above finding, the study recommends that construction companies in Nigeria should endeavour and improve on their current core job dimensions (task significance, skill variety, task identity, autonomy and feedback) inherent in various jobs designed within their respective organizations as this will constitute as one of the variants that will improve the job <b>performance</b> <b>rate</b> of construction professionals.  ...|$|R
