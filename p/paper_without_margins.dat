40|$|Overwintering of soil {{dwelling}} arthropods {{and especially}} carabid beetles was much higher in unmown perennial field margins than in mown grass strips or barren crop fields. Over 200 generalist predators per m 2 {{were trapped in}} field margin enclosures after hibernation. Predator exclusion experiments showed that high-density aphid colonies in May were reduced by 49 % compared to predator-free conditions, both in field margins and in summer wheat crops. Over a 4 years period, aphid infestation levels in summer wheat and potatoes were 15 %- 65 % lower in a farming system with a network of perennial field margins, compared to a system <b>without</b> field <b>margins.</b> However, Diamond back moth and slug damage in Brussels sprouts {{were higher in the}} system with field margins compared to the control system <b>without</b> <b>margins...</b>|$|R

40|$|Firms {{active in}} OTC {{derivative}} markets increasingly use margin agreements to reduce counterparty credit risk. Making several simplifying assumptions, I use both a quasi- analytic approach and a simulation approach to quantify how margining reduces counterparty credit exposure. Margining reduces counterparty credit exposure by over 80 percent, using baseline parameter assumptions. I show how {{expected positive exposure}} (EPE) depends on key terms of the margin agreement and the current mark-to-market value of the portfolio of contracts with the counterparty. I also discuss a possible shortcut {{that could be used}} by firms that can model EPE <b>without</b> <b>margin</b> but cannot achieve the higher level of sophistication needed to model EPE with margin.
