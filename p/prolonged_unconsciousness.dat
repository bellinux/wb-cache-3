50|$|The {{duration}} of action of intravenous induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur. In order to <b>prolong</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> for the required duration (usually the {{duration of}} surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. This is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a volatile anaesthetic agent, or by administering medication (usually propofol) through an intravenous catheter. Inhaled agents are frequently supplemented by intravenous anaesthetics, such as opioids (usually fentanyl or a fentanyl derivative) and sedatives (usually propofol or midazolam). With propofol-based anaesthetics, however, supplementation by inhalation agents is not required.|$|R

30|$|During CM the {{red blood}} cells are parasitized, most often by Plasmodium Falciparum. P. Vivax and P. Knowlesi are also known to cause severe malaria, but unlike P.

Coma is the {{principal}} diagnostic difference between severe malaria and CM, with lumbar puncture ruling out bacterial central nervous system (CNS) infection or other cause of coma beyond severe malaria. CM is specific to P. Falciparum and is distinctive from other forms of malaria because of the sequestration of infected {{red blood cells}} in the microvasculature {{of the brain and}} compromise of the blood/brain barrier contributing to an immunopathogenic inflammatory cascade. This cascade together with ischemic and metabolic effects cause coma and often seizures during illness and contribute to the neuropathogenic basis of subsequent neurological and neurocognitive sequelae (John et al. 2008). Since coma is defined as <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> and unresponsiveness (usually between 1 h and 4 weeks), clinical language-independent data provide the only opportunity to gauge the extent to which brain injury may impact subsequent neurodevelopment and cognitive function.|$|E

30|$|Methadone {{toxicity}} outcomes {{can depend}} on us factors like age, gender, history of suicide attempts and psychological disorders, and the time interval between consumption of the drug and obtaining medical care (Eizadi-Mood et al. 2015). All of the aforementioned cases, except Tóth and Varga (2009) involved young males; also, {{as described in the}} original articles, men more frequently present with acute methadone toxicity. The proposed explanation for these findings is that men, especially while young, have a higher tendency to consume illicit drugs. It has been assumed that higher doses of methadone {{are more likely to be}} responsible for rhabdomyolysis and AKI. However, these consequences occur even at lower doses. Another assumption is that <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> is a necessary risk factor for rhabdomyolysis. However, there are reports of patients who are awake yet suffer rhabdomyolysis (Nanji and Douglas Filipenko 1983). In such cases, there may be other factors, like the time interval between consumption of the drug and obtaining medical care that explain the outcome (ie, the patient may have had a prolonged episode of unconsciousness before waking up and presenting to medical care).|$|E

METHODS: A cohort of forty-four patients aged 1. 6 - 25. 5 years (M= 16. 0) with traumatic acquired brain injury (TBI) or non-traumatic acquired brain injury (nTBI) were examined using the Western Neuro Sensory Stimulation Profile every two weeks, from the application for EINP until discharge. The level of consciousness was assessed with the Post-Acute Level of Consciousness Scale, and the level of disability was determined by the Disability Rating Scale. Long-term level of disability of all TBI patients (N= 32) was assessed between 2. 0 and 4. 4 years after discharge from EINP. RESULTS: Two-thirds of all patients recovered to consciousness. Three recovery patterns were identified: remaining in a vegetative state (VS), slow recovery of consciousness, and fast recovery of consciousness. In the long-term, 11 of the TBI patients were severely disabled, 13 were moderately disabled, and 4 were mildly disabled. All TBI patients who were in VS at discharge either had deceased, or recovered to a very severely disabled state.

40|$|Abstract The {{coexistence}} of {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains a controversial issue in the literature. To address this controversy, we focused primarily on the civilian-related literature of TBI and PTSD. Some investigators have argued that individuals who had been rendered unconscious or suffered amnesia due to a TBI are unable to develop PTSD because they {{would be unable to}} consciously experience the symptoms of fear, helplessness, and horror associated with the development of PTSD. Other investigators have reported that individuals who sustain TBI, regardless of its severity, can develop PTSD even in the context of <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness.</b> A careful review of the methodologies employed in these studies reveals that investigators who relied on clinical interviews of TBI patients to diagnose PTSD found little or no evidence of PTSD. In contrast, investigators who relied on PTSD questionnaires to diagnose PTSD found considerable evidence of PTSD.

In particular, patients with severe TBI were often misdiagnosed with PTSD. A number of investigators foun...|$|E

Dry electro-stunning (150 V, AC + DC, 100 Hz) of Claresse® for 0. 7 ± 0. 2 s (mean ± SD) resulted in unconsciousness for 48 ± 15 s, fulfilling the welfare requirements for obtaining pre-slaughter unconsciousness in less than 1 s. Current input for 5. 2 ± 0. 5 s with a measured current of 0. 57 ± 0. 16 A followed by chilling, resulted in <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> for 124 ± 20 s in Claresse®. Loss of behavioral responses {{to noxious stimuli and}} then death within 5 min in 9 out of 10 African catfish resulted from stunning for 9. 1 ± 0. 4 s (0. 91 ± 0. 18 A) followed by decapitation. The meat quality did not reveal any difference in color between electro-stunned (0. 76 A, 150 V, AC + DC for 15 s) and chilled-only Claresse®. Although flesh acidification was significantly higher in the stunned group {{on the day of the}} experiment, after 24 h the groups showed similar pH changes for the next six days. We conclude that dry electro-stunning (150 V, AC + DC) followed by chilling and decapitation is a reliable method for industrial pre-slaughter unconsciousness of Claresse® and African catfish and stunning (150 V, AC + DC) leaves no significant effect on flesh quality of Claresse® compared to chilling method...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Benzodiazepines {{are among}} the most {{frequently}} ingested drugs in self-poisonings. Elderly may be at greater risk compared with younger individuals due to impaired metabolism and increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess toxicity of benzodiazepines in elderly attempted suicide. Methods. A retrospective study of consecutive presentations to hospital after self-poisoning with benzodiazepines was done. Collected data consisted of patient's characteristics (age, gender), benzodiazepine ingested with its blood concentrations at admission, clinical findings including vital signs and Glasgow coma score, routine blood chemistry, complications of poisoning, details of management, length of hospital stay and outcome. According the age, patients are classified as young (15 - 40 -year old), middle aged (41 - 65 -year old) and elderly (older than 65). Results. During a 2 -year observational period 387 patients were admitted because of pure benzodiazepine poisoning. The most frequently ingested drug was bromazepam, the second was diazepam. The incidence of coma was significantly higher, and the length of hospital stay significantly longer in elderly. Respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia occurred more frequently in old age. Also, flumazenil was more frequently required in the group of elderly patients. Conclusion. Massive benzodiazepines overdose in elderly may be associated with a significant morbidity, including deep coma with aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and even death. Flumazenil is indicated more often to reduce CNS depression and prevent complications of <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness,</b> but supportive treatment and proper airway management of comatose patients is the mainstay of the treatment of acute benzodiazepine poisoning...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{stunning}} of farmed Atlantic cod is {{a method}} used to render the fish unconscious before further processing. However, evaluations of the stunning method at plants {{have shown that the}} electrical parameters need to be optimized to achieve instant stunning and <b>prolonged</b> duration of <b>unconsciousness.</b> One aim {{of the present study was}} to establish suitable stunning conditions for cod to comply with future fish welfare regulations. AQUI-S™ is an anaesthetic capable of producing rested fish at slaughter. In the current study, we wanted to assess some welfare aspects of using this agent. In addition, the two stunning methods were compared in terms of the magnitude of the stress response, and the resulting effect on product quality. The data show it was possible to stun cod instantly (0. 5 s) at 107 Vrms, 0. 5 + 0. 2 Arms. However, it was necessary to expose the fish for a longer period (e. g. 15 s) to the same voltage to prolong the period of unconsciousness to facilitate killing without recovery. AQUI-S™ (68 mg L- 1) rendered the fish unconscious without recovery. No noticeable avoidance behaviour or distress was observed during stunning. Blood pH, lactate levels, and blood drainage, as determined after recovery, were similar for both stunning methods. The ability of the white muscle to twitch was not affected by treatment although electrical stunning caused a drop in initial white muscle pH. Hence, a tendency for a more rapid onset of rigor mortis was observed. No detrimental effects on product quality (Quality Index scores, tendency for gaping, ultimate pH, and fillet texture) were observed for either stunning method. Moreover, no blood spots and discolourations of fillets, or spinal fractures were observed. To comply with both good fish welfare protocols, and at the same time ensuring good product quality, we have fundamentally shown that this is indeed possible when cod are stunned with either of the methods described here...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} determine whether high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) at 70 - 98 % in atmospheric air are a suitable alternative for stunning rabbits compared to conventional approaches such as electronarcosis. Aversion to the gas and efficacy in causing <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> and death were studied {{in a total of}} 480 rabbits by means of behavioural parameters, physiological indicators (presence of rhythmic breathing and corneal reflex) and electroencephalography (EEG, brain function). The use of any of the 4 studied concentrations of the gas caused more nasal discomfort and vocalisations than the use of atmospheric air (P< 0. 001). EEG activity confirmed that loss of posture is a good indicator of the onset of unconsciousness in rabbits exposed to CO 2, occurring earlier (P< 0. 05) at 90 and 98 % than at 70 and 80 %. Rabbits showed signs of aversion for 15 s before the onset of unconsciousness, which occurred around 30 s after the beginning of the exposure to the gas, similar to species such as swine in which high concentrations of CO 2  are also used for stunning. CO 2  at 80 to 98 % is suggested as a reasonable concentration range to induce a long state of unconsciousness and death in rabbits, while 70 % CO 2  is not recommended because it requires too long duration of exposure (more than 360 s) to ensure effectiveness. Despite the advantages in terms of pre-stun handling and irreversibility, CO 2  is not free of animal welfare concerns. In consequence, a debate is necessary to ascertain if CO 2  can be considered a suitable alternative to stun rabbits, considering the advantages and drawbacks cited, quantified in the present study as 15 s of aversion (nasal discomfort and vocalisations) before losing posture...|$|E

40|$|Non-penetrating head {{injuries}} {{are a major}} problem facing society today, accounting for {{billions of dollars of}} hospital costs and lost income each year 68. Recognizing that each type of head injury is associated with a unique set of loading conditions and pathology pattern, this dissertation focussed on one particularly serious head injury, traumatic coma, also known as diffuse axonal injury (DAI). DAI occurs most frequently as a result of lateral, rotational motions of the head, and can be produced in the absence of impact. Integration of physical, analytical and animal models for DAI with clinical and isolated tissue data shed light on the complex relationship between head motion and <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness.</b> ^ Simple physical models of the head were used to investigate the influence of head size, brain shape, brain/skull adhesion and applied load on tissue injury (as indicated by 2 ̆ 2 intracranial 2 ̆ 2 deformation). Skull physical models for baboon and man were developed to determine the influence of the falx cerebri on brain motion, and as an empirical method to scale applied loads to man. Deformation patterns of models accelerated at levels known to produce DAI were compared to pathology data. Large deformations occurred in regions at high risk to injury. Maximum strain levels in such regions increased linearly with peak rotational accelerations ((2 ̆ 7) (theta) (,p)). ^ A continuum analytical model developed to describe DAI consisted of a rigid, right-circular cylindrical shell filled with a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic material subjected to a sudden, distributed, axisymmetric, rotational load. The strain response for brain was examined as brain size and applied load magnitude, duration and waveshape were varied independently. Strain increased linearly with increasing (2 ̆ 7) (theta) (,p) and exponentially with increasing brain size (where the exponent, n, was frequency-dependent). ^ Animal data for DAI scaled to man using the physical and analytical models generated in this work {{led to the development of}} the first threshold for DAI in man. The modelling methods put forth in this work set the stage for similar investigations of other types of diffuse head injury, leading to the development of a family of injury-specific thresholds for man. ...|$|E
40|$|Figure 3. Late phase {{fluorescein}} angiogram, leakage of fluorescein from a subretinal neovascular membrane American {{study of}} the Tae Kwon Do national cham-pionships, found that 52 % of all injuries involved {{the head and neck}} region. 2 During the first European knock-down karate championships 53 % of the competitors were injured and 30 % of these injuries were to the head and neck. 3 These previous reports suggest that under tournament conditions the distinction between those martial arts disciplines that permit full contact and those that do not becomes blurred. This is consistent with previous work that has found that injuries tend to be more severe under tournament conditions than when training. 4 There have been several recommendations aimed at reducing both the rate and the severity of injury. The presence of trained ringside physicians for early di-agnosis and treatment is usually recommended, but severe traumatic maculopathies, such as described here, may result from a single blow, and their complications may not be treatable even if there is early diagnosis. The use of protective padding of the fists, forearms, shins, and feet has been recommended, 2 but their use did not prevent injury in this case. Additionally, a previous biomechanical study has shown that target acceleration is not significantly affected by the use of such padding. 5 Floor padding has also been recommended to prevent injury to a contestant when hitting the floor. 6 Lack of such padding may well have been a factor in the <b>prolonged</b> <b>unconsciousness</b> sustained in the case we describe.
