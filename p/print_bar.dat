50|$|The {{idea behind}} Internet 0 {{is to provide}} a {{general-purpose}} physical layer that operates well in many media. As such, it is very similar to morse code: a general-purpose layer 1 for the Internet. Logically, this is a recursive application of the internet principle (a ubiquitous protocol) to layer 1 of the network. The pulse-position modulation of Internet 0 operates best over a segregated wire, but it works in many media. It has been tested over radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), ultrasonics, optical, DC and AC power wiring, and even physical representations such as <b>printed</b> <b>bar</b> codes and engraving on a key.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bar charts {{are common}} data {{representations}} in {{scientific and technical}} papers. In order to recognize the <b>printed</b> <b>bar</b> charst, we present a new Hough based bar chart recognition algorithm which combines syntactic analysis into segmentation. We first detect the most salient feature in any bar chart, bar patterns, using syntactic analysis in the Hough domain. Then we group text primitives according to their centroids distribution in the Hough space. Finally, we interweave the two extracting processes to refine the recognition results. Our recognition algorithm is not dependent heavily on a priori knowledge and can recognize bar charts lying in arbitrary directions, such as oblique or skewed bar charts, or even hand-drawn bar charts. ...|$|R
40|$|Laser beams with {{extended}} {{depth of}} focus have many practical applications, such as scanning <b>printed</b> <b>bar</b> codes. Previous work has concentrated on synthesizing such beams by approximating the nondiffracting Bessel beam solution to the wave equation. In this paper, we introduce an alternate novel synthesis method {{that is based on}} maintaining a minimum MTF value (contrast) over the largest possible distance. To achieve this, the coefficients of an orthogonal beam expansion are sequentially optimized to this criterion. One of the main advantages of this method is that it can be easily generalized to noncircularly symmetrical beams by the appropriate choice of the beam expansion basis functions. This approach is found to be very useful for applications that involve scanning of the laser beam. </p...|$|R

[...] Arthur Conan Doyle A Case of Identity (1891) Original layouts for the first few {{mechanical}} typewriters were in alphabetical order (ABCDE etc.) but the frequent jams suffered by experienced typists forced the manufacturers to change the layout of the letters, placing keys that are often pressed in a sequence as far as possible from each other. This allows engaging the second <b>printing</b> <b>bar</b> of the typewriter before the first falls down, increasing the speed of the mechanism. Equal distribution of the load over most of fingers also increased the speed as the keys of the mechanical typewriter are more difficult to press.|$|R

40|$|Would-be infringers target {{university}} patents because faculty inventors {{are more}} likely to make inadvertent disclosures than industrial inventors, possibly because of the importance of quick disclosure and publishing in academic science. In Klopfenstein, the Federal Circuit held that the posting of lecture slides after a talk triggered the <b>printed</b> publication <b>bar</b> of the patent statute. First, I argue (contrary to other commentators) that the Federal Circuit is consistent with prior precedent; that the public accessibility and dissemination inquiries should rest on substance rather than form. The focus of the § 102 (b) inquiry remains on the inventor, who should lose the right to patent his invention if he makes a public disclosure. Klopfenstein possibly shows that the Federal Circuit will interpret the statute in light of advances in technology. Second, I argue that Klopfenstein is wholly consistent with the policies behind both the <b>printed</b> publication <b>bar</b> and the patent laws generally. Third, I argue that Congress need not amend the patent laws to protect university inventors; rather the solution to the publish-patent tension lies in the university's proper management of technology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{identification}} technology such as RFID {{promises to}} connect physical objects with virtual representations or even computational capabilities. However, even though RFID tags are continuously falling in price, their widespread use on consumer items is still several years away, rendering large-scale experiments {{with such an}} “internet of things ” difficult. Much more ubiquitous are <b>printed</b> <b>bar</b> codes, yet so far their recognition required either specialized scanner equipment, custom-tailored bar codes or costly commercial licenses – all equally significant deployment hurdles. We have developed a freely available EAN- 13 bar code recognition and information system that is both lightweight and fast enough for the use on camera-equipped mobile phones, thus significantly lowering the barrier for large-scale, real-world testing of novel information and interaction applications based on “connected ” physical objects. We hope that this “low tech ” version of bridging the gap will allow the community to quickly develop and try out more realistic and widespread applications, and thus gain real-world experiences for better jump-starting the future internet of things, today. 1 Today’s Role of Barcode Recognitio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBone {{scaffolds}} {{must have}} an appropriate porosity range with an interconnected and open porosity, and have a biodegradable rate and mechanical properties that match the injured tissue. The use of commercially available and low cost 3 D printing machines offers the ability to fulfil these requirements. Therefore, one of the aims {{of this study was}} to manufacture a PLA scaffold by a two-step route: 1) 3 D printing of a PLA porous bar and 2) laser cut PLA scaffolds from the 3 D <b>printed</b> <b>bar.</b> Laser cutting did not cause any significant degradation issues and scanning electron microscopy showed that 3 -D scaffolds had completely interconnected and uniform open porosity, with pore size between ∼ 550 to 600 μm in both axial and transversal direction. Conversely, mechanical test of PLA scaffold indicated that both compressive modulus and stress at yield were decreased by the laser cutting step but they remained adequate for trabecular bone replacement. Finally, the in vitro degradation behaviour of PLA scaffolds after 8 weeks immersed in PBS, did not revealed any significant decrease of weight, molecular weight, and compressive properties...|$|R

5000|$|For printing, the 407 used type wheels, an {{improvement}} over earlier tabulators that used <b>print</b> <b>bars.</b> The 48-character wheels were stationary until a character impulse was to be printed; the wheel then rotated in two steps. the first step rotated each wheel to one of 12 groups of characters based on the digit impulse associated with that print position. Digit impulses included the digits 1 through 9 (in reverse order), the 8-3 and 8-4 combination punches and a group (N) for no digit impulse. One of four characters in each group was then selected based on the zone impulse (0, 11, 12 or none) for that character position. This selection happened {{at the same time}} the type wheel was driven against the ribbon. The timing of the zone impulse selection was controlled by a complex set of linkages and electromagnets called the Analyzer, one for each of the 120 print positions. Each type wheel also emitted an impulse (called [...] "echo") for the character actually printed. The control panel could be wired so the echo impulses were accumulated for totals; report totals then reliably reflected what had actually been printed.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the model 1403, IBM printers utilized technology originally developed for their line of accounting machines. Models 402 and 405 used type bars. These were vertical bars, one for each <b>print</b> position. Each <b>bar</b> was one character wide with either the entire alphabet, including numerals and symbols, or just numerals & symbols only, molded into the front surface, in a single column. In <b>printing,</b> each <b>bar</b> was raised up until the correct character for that print position was opposite the paper, whereupon the bar was pushed toward the paper, so that the correct numeral or letter pressed against the ribbon, striking the paper much the way type slugs leave an impression on paper in a standard typewriter. This action was relatively slow, as it took time for each bar to be brought up into the correct position and then drop back down in preparation to print the next line.|$|R
