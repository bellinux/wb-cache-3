They gained control of works at Creyke's Siding and Moorends to the west, Medge Hall to the south, Swinefleet to the east, and Old Goole in the north, together with the mill on Hatfield Moors. Old Goole mill closed in 1902, although peat was stored there for another twelve years. The new company did not have complete control of the moors, as there were several small independent peat works on Crowle Moor. The company was restructured in 1899, by winding up the original company and creating a new one with the same name but additional working capital. At the same time, Swinefleet Works was formally purchased, whereas it had been leased by the old company. Sales of peat rose steadily from 39,444 tons in 1893 to 74,948 tons in 1898.|$|E

5000|$|There was {{formerly}} a peat works to the north-west of Goole Hall. This {{was owned by}} William Smith and Son, who owned another works at Creyke's Siding. Peat {{was brought to the}} mill from the moors by a [...] gauge tramway, which ran alongside Earnshaw's Warping Drain and passed just to the east of Goole Grange. The tramway was about 3 mi long, with a siding into the Grange. Motive power was provided by a steam locomotive, but no further details of the machine have been found. Both of Smith's mills were bought out by the British <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> <b>Litter</b> company, which was formed in 1896 from an amalgamation of the Hatfield Chase <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> <b>Litter</b> Company and several similar operations working on Thorne Moors. The mill continued to operate for only a few years, closing soon after 1902, although peat was stored there until 1914, and the buildings and tracks were not removed for many years afterwards.|$|E

They paid £58,000 for Griendtsveen's Moorends Works. The mill, which had been used for the production of paraffin since the late 1860s until it rebuilding in the 1880s, was damaged by a fire in 1898. The wooden baling presses were destroyed, but were replaced with steel presses, which were powered by a [...] stationary steam engine which burned peat as its fuel. Besides the canals and the aqueduct, the 1906 Ordnance Survey maps show two swing bridges, one on the northern section just beyond the junction where the line for the southern section turned off, and another where that line crossed the Cottage Dike. There was also a wind pump between the Cottage Dike and the southern canals, towards the eastern end of the canals. Marked towpaths ran along the northern edge of both sections of the canals and on the north-easterly side of the canal to the aqueduct and Mooorends Mill.|$|E

The <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> was processed and packaged and then shipped by both truck and by Southern Pacific Railroad until rail services to Likely were discontinued. The company, Radel, was dissolved in 1987 upon the owner's retirement.|$|R
50|$|The steam {{locomotive}} which {{worked on the}} tramway was built by Webster, Jackson and Co. who were based in Goole. The Goole Times newspaper carried a report on 7 June 1895 of {{a visit to the}} line by the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union. It commented that the visitors had been transported to the works on flat wagons, with their legs dangling over the sides, and although the train reached their destination fairly quickly, several were somewhat shaken by the experience. Bennett's became bankrupt in 1891, although they continued to trade until they were taken over by the Goole Moss Litter Company in 1893. The new company became part of the British <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> <b>Litter</b> Company in 1896, an amalgamation of most of the peat companies working on Thorne and Hatfield Moors.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{not known}} exactly when the tramway ceased to operate, but the Axholme Joint Railway, which crossed the parish, would have {{required}} a level crossing with it, and the North Eastern Railway, one of the promoters, met with the British <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> <b>Litter</b> Company to offer compensation if they would waive their rights to a level crossing. The Axholme Joint Railway opened in 1903, and included a siding which served Swinefleet Peat Works. The tramway locomotive was offered for sale in 1901, but {{is thought to have}} been scrapped on site, as no purchaser was found. The works was connected to the moors by a network of [...] gauge tramways, which were worked by horses until the 1950s and then by diesel locomotives. The mill was closed in July 2000, after 114 years of operation, although stockpiled peat continued to be removed from the moors until 2005, but was taken to Hatfield Works for processing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{adsorption}} behaviour of cobalt (II) from aqueous solutions on un-treated {{and treated}} <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> was investigated.

The influence of initial solution pH, <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> dose, initial cobalt (II) concentration and contact time, was studied in batch experiments. The optimum results were obtained at pH = 6. 0 (acetate buffer), an adsorbent dose of 5 g/L and an initial concentration of 240 mg Co(II) /L. The experimental results have show that in case of <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> treated with NaOH, the adsorption capacity increase with 15 % and the contact time necessary for to attain the equilibrium decrease until 15 min. In case of <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> treated with HNO 3, the adsorption capacity slowly decrease and the contact time required for to attain the equilibrium has almost the same value as un-treated peat.

50|$|Astley {{became more}} industrialised {{during the early}} 19th century, {{but not so much}} as {{neighbouring}} Leigh, Tyldesley and Boothstown. A factory was built by James and Robert Arrowsmith on Peel Lane at Astley Green, near the Bridgewater Canal in 1833. Until then, agriculture and cottage spinning and weaving had been the main economic activities. Fustians, muslins and, after 1827, silk were woven in the area. Handloom weaving declined after the cotton factory was built. Arrowsmith's factory lasted until 1955, when mining subsidence damaged its foundations and it was demolished, ending Astley's link with the textile industry.Astley on the Lancashire Coalfield and had several coal mines within its boundaries. On a map of 1768, a lane leading to Nook and Gin Pit Collieries was called the Coal Road and later North Coal Pit Lane. Gin Pit's name alludes a method of coal mining, raising coal using a horse gin. An early colliery at Cross Hillock was abandoned in 1886 because of flooding. Samuel Jackson developed the mines that became Astley and Tyldesley Collieries between Astley and Tyldesley.Peat works were opened close to Astley railway station by the Astley <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> <b>Litter</b> Company Limited in 1888.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century there were also sidings to peat moss works on Thorne and Hatfield Moors. Creyke's Siding was originally a small trailing siding {{to the west of the}} line. Its construction was negotiated by Richard Boynton Creyke, and authorised by an agreement dated 7 May 1863. It was close to Moor Road, and there was a signal box to the east of the line at the crossing. The <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> <b>Litter</b> Company built a works to the east of the line in 1886, and agreement was reached for a longer trailing siding to serve the works, on the opposite side of the main line to the original siding. The agreement was dated 11 February 1887. The siding agreement was assigned to William Smith & Co on 9 February 1894, who had taken over the works in 1889. The works was served by a network of [...] gauge horsedrawn tramways, extending onto the moors. Smiths also built a firelighter and disinfectant works near the northern end of the siding. Both products were peat based. The British Moss Litter Co Ltd took over the site in 1896, but failed to notify the North Eastern Railway, who noted the change in 1909. Lengthy correspondence followed, resulting in a new siding agreement being reached on 21 January 1910. The railway company also recorded that the siding was used by a farmer called Mr G Dougherty and by the Nego Firelighting Company in 1908. The peat works operated until 1950-51, and was largely demolished in 1970-71.|$|E
50|$|During this period, the {{population}} increased steadily, from 1,343 in 1801 to 1,889 in 1831, 2,548 in 1851 and 3,122 in 1871. A Burial Board {{was created in}} 1862, and established a general cemetery on a long plot on Mill Lane, with two mortuary chapels. One of them is now used to store equipment {{for the maintenance of}} the cemetery. Education in 1872 was provided by a National School. The parish had been bequeathed three houses, which included common rights and 10 acre of land, to be used for the education and relief of the poor. The houses were given by Richard Brewer in 1687, Thomas Walkwood in 1692 and Richard Clark in 1721. When the Enclosure Act was obtained, the land and common rights were consolidated, and the trustees received a little over 21 acre of tithe-free land and £206, which was used to repair the houses. They were then rented out, and the Charity Commissioners later appropriated the income to fund the National School. Education was managed by a School Board from 1871. White's Guide of 1872 includes a list of those engaged in trades and professions, and besides the National School, it lists nine other people under the Academies and Schools section, three of whom took in boarders. Farming was still a major occupation, as that section is much bigger than all the others, but a wide range of occupations are listed, some of which were pursued by women, including a Mrs Ann Bleasby, who was a blacksmith. Opportunities for paid work for the working classes were available at the Flax Mill, but the chief source of employment in 1894 was the harvesting of peat for the <b>Peat</b> <b>Moss</b> <b>Litter</b> Works.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of three major forms of peat processing by the manufacturing industry in The Netherlands since {{the last quarter of}} the 19 th century. At a time when peat as a fuel was gradually being replaced by coal, the first form was the <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> <b>litter</b> industry. <b>Peat</b> <b>moss</b> <b>litter</b> was made from white peat that was ground and sieved in factories which were located mainly in bog areas in the south-east of the province of Drenthe. It served as excellent bedding for horses and cattle. The second form of industrial peat processing was the manufacture, from 1921 onwards, of active carbon made from black peat. The Purit (Norit) factory, now part of the Cabot Corporation, is still the only active carbon factory using peat as a raw material. The third form of peat processing was the production of garden peat and potting soil. This is still a widespread activity in peat areas all over the world. The <b>peat</b> <b>moss</b> <b>litter</b> industry thrived from the 1880 s until shortly after the First World War. The arrival of the horse-drawn tram in all of the major cities of Europe created a great demand for animal bedding to be used in the vast stables of the tramway companies. <b>Peat</b> <b>moss</b> <b>litter</b> was cleaner, healthier and easier to handle than straw. There was similar demand from the armies, which used millions of horses during the First World War. Owing to the development of motorised vehicles, the peat market collapsed after the war and this plunged the industry into a prolonged crisis which was not overcome until peat was found to be a suitable growing medium for horticulture in the 1950 s. Living and working conditions in peatlands were harsh, earnings irregular and labourers’ rights limited. The peat manufacturing industry was the first to introduce collective labour agreements, medical benefits and pension plans. Nonetheless massive unemployment, poverty and the necessity to migrate to other parts of the country were clear signs that the era of peat was over for all but a handful of labourers...|$|E
