40|$|The {{impact of}} {{geometric}} variability on compressor performance is investigated using a compressor repeating-stage model based on well-known correlations for <b>profile</b> <b>losses,</b> endwall blockage, deviation, and {{the onset of}} stall. Previous computations with a quasi-two dimensional cascade analysis code are used to link geometric variability to performance deviations. Performance variability is then introduced probabilistically through random perturbations to tip clearances, <b>profile</b> <b>losses</b> and turning. For the variation input, at design incidence, the mean efficiency is found to decrease by 1 %, mostly due to the mean shift in <b>profile</b> <b>losses,</b> and the mean pressure rise is reduced by 2. 5 %, mostly because of the mean shift in turning. A parametric study for compressor stages of different designs shows a lower degradation of mean performance and a lower performance variability for stages which have higher work coefficient, lower degree of reaction, and higher blade aspect ratio. It {{was found that the}} influence of blade profile effects was well represented, but the impact of tip clearance variation was not well captured when compared to three-dimensional computations. It is concluded that to address the effects of tip clearance variability, emphasis should be placed on development of models which both can include the alteration of end-wall displacement thickness within the compressor stage and are appropriate for probabilistic description. by Antoine Vincent.

40|$|A {{number of}} CCS-technologies are {{currently}} being developed for the reduction of CO 2 emissions from thermal power stations. One such technology is the oxyfuel process, in which a mixture of CO 2 and steam is used as the working medium. The semi-closed oxyfuel combustion combined cycle (SCOC-CC) is an oxyfuel cycle where the working medium mainly consists of CO 2 (85 - 95 %). Current practice is to design turbomachinery using 1 D and 2 D flow tools, which primarily rely on loss models derived from experiments with air. For the oxyfuel case, the losses are hence extrapolated from air to a CO 2 /steam mixture, which can have adverse effects on {{the accuracy of the}} loss model. Therefore, the applicability and accuracy in using <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> correlations derived with air when changing the working medium to the oxyfuel like environment of pure CO 2 was investigated. The reason that 100 % CO 2 was chosen as the working medium and not a CO 2 /H 2 O mixture is that the water content present is relatively low and varies from case-to-case. Hence, a general water content could not be specified that was relevant for all cases. The study was done with typical compressor and turbine airfoils using a steady-state Navier-Stokes' 3 D flow solver. This solver type can resolve the boundary layer (y(+) of about unity) rather than relying upon a boundary layer equation, - hence eliminating the latter as a source of error. The hypothesis was that the <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> depended on the viscosity, and that amendments to the viscosity would affect the <b>profile</b> <b>loss.</b> This trend was observed, e. g. when changing the working medium from air to CO 2, the <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> coefficient (Y-p) for the compressor was reduced with 25 % and for the turbine with 6 %, respectively. A slight difference in <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> for an individual cascade was found when changing the working medium from air to CO 2. Theoretically, this difference leads to an increased mismatch of the stages downstream even at design point, and thus increases the losses and reduces the stability. However, the difference in <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> is relatively small at the design point, and thus it is the authors' opinion that the practical effect will be quite small. Therefore, it is considered safe to use loss correlations derived from air for design point calculations even when the working medium is CO 2. However, there is a certain risk involved that air- based loss models are not capable of predicting the behavior over the full operating range, as the boundary layers risk to behave in a different manner. Another aspect that was considered is how the wet surface area (physical size) of a turbomachine performing the same work (mho) will change between the two gases. This is important as the total <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> in a whole compressor or turbine is directly proportional to this change. The conclusion was that the total wet area would increase by some 20 % for CO 2 compared to air...|$|E

Steady {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) predictions were also performed to aid {{the interpretation of the}} results. The two leading-edge shapes gave rise to significantly different flows. For a blade with an elliptic leading edge (Blade A), the leading-edge boundary layer remained attached and laminar in the absence of wakes.

Measurements of the trailing-edge boundary layer indicated that the wake/leading-edge interaction for Blade A raised the suction-surface loss by 20 %. For a blade with a circular leading edge (Blade B), the leading-edge boundary-layer exhibited a separation bubble, which was observed to reattach laminar in the absence of wakes. The presence of the wake moved the separation position forward while inducing a turbulent reattachment upstream of the leading-edge time-average reattachment position. This produced a region of very high momentum thickness at the leading edge. The suction-surface loss was found to be 38 % higher for Blade B than for Blade A.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the mechanism of loss generation will aid steam path design and may lead to more reliable efficiency prediction when using a loss model. Loss estimation systems are still beneficial {{in the early stages of}} steam path design. A number of loss models for estimating turbine performance have been published over the past few decades. However, there have been surprisingly large deviations among them. They do not reflect the aerodynamic improvements towards modern blade design such as spline design and do not recognize the detailed refinements of the blade passage shape such as front loading and aft loading. In addition, it is not easy to set up new or modified methods in the loss models because it is necessary to have large quantity of test data. To establish a new loss estimation system, a method is presented for a turbine cascade blade operating in subsonic regions where the exit Mach number <= 0. 8. A prediction method based on entropy generation is developed to analyze the loss mechanism for the cascade blade. In the <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> model, the basic <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> model is induced from isentropic Mach number distribution along the blade surface. The trailing edge thickness loss model was introduced from CFD results and experimental data. In the secondary loss model, a correlation model for different geometries (aspect ratio, deflection angle and contraction ratio) is developed from validated CFD methods compared to the measurements. In addition, inlet loss and downstream loss are derived using the concept of boundary layer and entropy generation respectively. To acquire a Reynolds number correction curve, the performance of blade profiles is examined with three linear cascade blades which represent hub, mid-span and tip sections using numerical analysis. The Reynolds number is varied from 10, 000 to 10, 000, 000 to capture the operating regime for typical steam turbines. Twelve different levels of surface roughness on the same profile are calculated using the roughness model in ANSYS-CFX. The ratios of surface roughness to chord length are in the range of k_sc= 4. 2 × 10 ^(- 5) ~ 8. 3 × 10 ^(- 4). The CFD result is compared to Reynolds number correction curves from published literature (AMDC-KO, Aungier, Craig & Cox, Traupel, Sanders and Denton) and available measurement data. Based on these comparisons, a Reynolds number correction curve is properly selected and newly correlated for the estimation of steam turbine performance. In addition, CFD results show that the proposed correlation for the Reynolds number, including roughness effects, can be adopted in both <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> and secondary loss. The effect of an off-design incidence angle on the aerodynamic <b>profile</b> <b>loss</b> is examined experimentally with linear cascade blades which represent the hub, mid-span and tip sections. The cascade test covers a range of incidence angles from - 20 deg to + 20 deg. The results are evaluated with two existing kinds of incidence loss models (multiplier methods Ainley & Mathieson, Chen, Zehner / adder methods Stepanov, MK, MKT, BSM) and available measurement data (Zehner, Aronov, Hodson and Yamamoto). Based on these comparisons, it was found that the existing incidence model give quite good estimates in the mid-span profiles but there are some differences in the tip profile with a high inlet metal angle and the hub profile with a low inlet metal angle due to the different inlet geometry shape and a lack of data when developing the published models. To correlate the available test data, a new correlation method is proposed as a function of incidence, inlet metal angle, contraction ratio, leading edge diameter and inlet wedge angle. The results show that it is significantly more successful than the existing correlation methods.

Special attention is paid to the shock and <b>profile</b> <b>losses,</b> since they contribute significantly to the total pressure loss balance, specifically for transonic compressor stages. A new shock loss model is presented that calculates the shock position and the shock total pressure losses. The available experimental data were used to establish new loss correlations that account for experimental findings...|$|R
