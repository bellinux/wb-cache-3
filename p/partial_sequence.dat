40|$|<b>Partial</b> <b>sequences</b> for the 16 S rRNA {{mitochondrial}} gene {{were obtained from}} 10 penaeid shrimp species: Farfantepenaeus paulensis, F. brasiliensis, F, subtilis, F. duorarum, F. aztecus, Litopenaeus schmitti, L. setiferus, and Xiphopenaeus kroyeri from the western Atlantic and L. vannamei and L. stylirostris from the eastern Pacific. Sequences were also obtained from an undescribed morphotype of pink shrimp (morphotype II) usually identified as F. subtilis.

50|$|Finally, {{the fourth}} proof of Cayley's formula {{presented}} by Aigner and Ziegler {{is a double}} counting proof due to Jim Pitman. In this proof, Pitman considers the sequences of directed edges that may be added to an n-node empty graph to form from it a single rooted tree, and counts {{the number of such}} sequences in two different ways. By showing how to derive a sequence of this type by choosing a tree, a root for the tree, and an ordering for the edges in the tree, he shows that there are Tnn! possible sequences of this type. And by counting the number of ways in which a <b>partial</b> <b>sequence</b> can be extended by a single edge, he shows that there are nn &minus; 2n! possible sequences. Equating these two different formulas for the size of the same set of edge sequences and cancelling the common factor of n! leads to Cayley's formula.|$|E
5000|$|The {{phenomenon}} of prohormone conversion {{was discovered by}} Donald F. Steiner while examining the biosynthesis of insulin in 1967. At the same time, while conducting chemical sequencing of β-lipotrophic hormone (βLPH) with sheep pituitary glands Dr. Michel Chretien determined the sequence of another hormone, melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( [...] βMSH). This was the chemical evidence, {{at the level of}} primary protein sequence that peptide hormones could be found within larger protein molecules. The identity of the responsible enzymes was not clear for decades. In 1984, David Julius, working in the laboratory of Jeremy Thorner, identified the product of the Kex2 gene as responsible for processing of the alpha factor mating pheromone. Robert Fuller, working with Thorner, identified the <b>partial</b> <b>sequence</b> of the Kex2-homologous Furin gene in 1989. In 1990 human Kex2-homologous genes were cloned by the Steiner group, Nabil Seidah and co-workers, Wim J.M. van de Ven and co-workers, Yukio Ikehara and co-workers, Randal Kaufman and co-workers, Gary Thomas and co-workers, and Kazuhisa Nakayama and co-workers.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, the ECJ {{decision}} {{does not}} preclude a further test {{of the validity of}} the directive on the ground that it is inconsistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Art. 27.1 TRIPS provides that patents are only to be granted with respect to 'inventions'. The directive, however, provides that [...] "biological material which is isolated from its natural environment ... may be the subject of an invention even if it previously occurred in nature." [...] It is clearly arguable that merely isolating a human gene or protein from its natural environment is not an activity that can come within {{the meaning of the word}} 'invention'. The Danish Council of Bioethics in its Patenting Human Genes and Stem Cells Report noted that [...] "In the members' view, it cannot be said with any reasonableness that a sequence or <b>partial</b> <b>sequence</b> of a gene ceases to be part of the human body merely because an identical copy of the sequence is isolated from or produced outside of the human body."
