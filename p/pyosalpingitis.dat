40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} gestational trophoblastic disease in ectopic pregnancy. Study design. Medical records of 105 patients from January 2007 to October 2009. We excluded of the study 5 cases (one case where the answer of the biopsy was not clear; 4 others with diagnosis of adhnexial mass where the pregnancy test had resulted positive but the answer of biopsy have been resulted ruptured ovary cyst and <b>pyosalpingitis).</b> So definitely {{the size of the}} sample was 100 patients. Results. 79 patients with EP underwent surgery due to a (diagnosis of EP with hem peritoneum and enroptured ectopic pregnancy) and in 18 of them the answer of the biopsy was GTD. 4 of 75 cases admitted in our hospital with diagnosis of EP, (pregnancy test was used instead of estimation of the level of β-hCG because our hospital couldnʼt offer estimation of the level of β-hCG during 24 hours) have been not confirmed diagnosis of EP by biopsy, but ruptured ovary cyst with hem peritoneum, <b>pyosalpingitis.</b> 31 cases with EP (enraptured EP) underwent medical treatment with methotroxate. In 10 cases last management was failed and surgical intervention was institutionalized and histological analysis revealed GTD in 6 of them (partial mole). β-hCG level was detected in 31 cases with enraptured fallopian pregnancy; in all cases where treatment with methotroxate has been failed and GTD was confirmed, the level of β-hCG was > 10. 234 mUI/ml. 21 cases with enraptured fallopian pregnancy were successfully treated, and at this point we never learned the answer of biopsy. We registered one case with cervical pregnancy and one cornual (interstitial portion) pregnancy. Conclusion. we found 18 cases of GTD in EP / 11. 500 deliveries (1, 56 per 1, 000 deliveries), prevalence of the GTD in EP was about 18...|$|E
