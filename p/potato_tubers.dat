Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study, we {{describe}} {{the existence of a}} novel potassium channel in the plant (<b>potato</b> <b>tuber)</b> mitochondrial inner membrane. We found that substances known to modulate large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel activity influenced the bioenergetics of <b>potato</b> <b>tuber</b> mitochondria. In isolated mitochondria, Ca 2 + and NS 1619 (a potassium channel opener) were found to depolarize the mitochondrial membrane potential and to stimulate resting respiration. These effects were blocked by iberiotoxin (a potassium channel inhibitor) in a potassium-dependent manner. Additionally, the electrophysiological properties of the large-conductance potassium channel present in the <b>potato</b> <b>tuber</b> inner mitochondrial membrane are described in a reconstituted system, using planar lipid bilayers. After incorporation in 50 / 450 mM KCl gradient solutions, we recorded large-conductance potassium channel activity with conductance from 502 ± 15 to 615 ± 12 pS. The probability of channel opening was increased by Ca 2 + and reduced by iberiotoxin. Immunological analysis with antibodies raised against the mammalian plasma membrane large-conductance Ca 2 +-dependent K+ channel identified a pore-forming α subunit and an auxiliary β 2 subunit of the channel in <b>potato</b> <b>tuber</b> mitochondrial inner membrane.
