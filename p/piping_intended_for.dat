40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels are increasingly used for offshore subsea components as the technology allows for deeper recovery {{of oil and}} gas reserves. Alloy UNS S 31803 (EN 1. 4462 /UNS S 32205) combines high strength with good resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion. This grade is alloyed with nitrogen and has good weldability. For heavy-walled process <b>piping</b> <b>intended</b> <b>for</b> subsea sour service, the properties of the root pass are of high importance. For this reason, the effect of using nitrogen in the backing gas was investigated. Test pieces were manually welded with the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process using an ER 2209 filler wire. Tensile, bending and hardness testing was carried out and showed acceptable results across all specimens. Higher contents of nitrogen in the backing gas showed more austenite formation and a significant increase in pitting corrosion resistance when compared with pure argon. With Ar[*]+[*] 2 % N 2, there was no pitting, but a small weight loss of 1. 7 g/m 2 was measured. 10 % N 2 was required to pass both the corrosion tests ASTM G 48 Method A (4 g/m 2) and ASTM A 923 (1 g/m 2). The highest average impact toughness was achieved with pure nitrogen as the backing gas...|$|E
