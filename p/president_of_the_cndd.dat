According to Camara, he [...] "came {{to see if the}} terrain is favorable to us", declaring that the large crowds indicated that the people were indeed supportive of the coup. Also on 24 December, Camara said in a radio broadcast that the CNDD did not want to stay in power indefinitely and that it intended to lead the country for two years, promising [...] "credible and transparent presidential elections by the end of December 2010". This contradicted an earlier statement which promised an election within the constitutionally mandated period of 60 days.|$|E

The statement also announced <b>the</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution [...] "as well as political and union activity". Guinean national radio began playing the song [...] "Armée Guinéenne" [...] repeatedly. According to Camara, the coup was necessary because of Guinea's [...] "deep despair" [...] amidst rampant poverty and corruption, {{and he said that}} the existing institutions were [...] "incapable <b>of</b> resolving <b>the</b> crises which have been confronting the country." [...] Furthermore, Camara said that someone from the military would become President, while a civilian would be appointed as prime minister at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> a new government that would be ethnically balanced. The National Council for Democracy and Development would, according to Camara, include 26 officers as well as six civilians.|$|R
