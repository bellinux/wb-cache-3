40|$|Background. Despite the {{introduction}} of anti-D prophylaxis into clinical practice, RhD alloimmunization still presents a problem to date. The actual incidence of RhD alloimmunization in pregnant women remains unknown in most countries. Anti-D immunoglobulin is administered to RhD negative women at a fixed dose and in much greater amounts than is actually necessary. On the other hand, {{it is not possible}} to diagnose cases where greater doses are needed. To optimize the prevention of RhD alloimmunization in RhD negative women, it is important to diagnose conditions that lead to fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH), precisely determine the volume and subsequently administer the appropriate dose of anti-D immunoglobulin. The possibility to accurately detect FMH and precisely determine its volume would enable more effective and less costly prevention of RhD alloimmunization. Anti-D immunoglobulin could be administered only in indicated cases and only in doses essentially necessary for prevention of RhD alloimmunization. Methods and results. The Cochrane and UpToDate databases of systematic reviews, as well as national guidelines, were reviewed. Conclusions. Due to the medical significance and indispensable economic costs associated with prevention of RhD alloimmunization, it would be appropriate to establish exact methodical guidelines. The text itself should be limited to a list of <b>potentially</b> <b>sensitising</b> events during which anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered to RhD negative women if anti-D antibodies are not already present. Following each <b>potentially</b> <b>sensitising</b> event, the minimal dose of anti-D immunoglobulin necessary for prevention of RhD alloimmunization should be determined. After 20 weeks of gestation, the volume of FMH should also be determined to specify the necessary dose of anti-D immunoglobulin...|$|R

The cells were pressed with three different pressing forces and sensitised with plant extracts from red cabbage, beetroot, violet and henna, as well as with a ruthenium complex-based dye for comparison. The IPCE and iV values and the corresponding fill factors of the cells were evaluated and compared. No significant difference between the cells pressed with different pressing forces could be estab-lished. Among the plant extract-based <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> cells the ones sensitised with beetroot extract performed best. The cell that achieved the highest efficiency had a fill factor of 70 %. Compared to the ruthenium-sensitised cells the overall performance of the plant <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> cells were very poor and the produced photocurrents very low. The IPCE values were generally low: one of the best-performing cells had an IPCE value of slightly over 0. 06 in the 440 - 470 nm wavelength ranges. One {{reason for this is that}} it is difficult to obtain a plant extract dye as intense and deep in colour as ruthenium complex-based dyes, since pigment saturation is obstructed by the presence of other chemical compounds in the plant extracts. Another is that it is a delicate and difficult matter to match the energy levels in the electrolyte-semiconductor system with the energy levels of the pigments in the plant extract dye...|$|R

40|$|Electrodes in <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) are {{typically}} nanocrystalline anatase TiO 2 {{with a majority}} (101) surface exposed. Generally the <b>sensitising</b> <b>dye</b> employs a carboxylic anchoring moiety through which it adheres to the TiO 2 surface. Recent interest in exploiting the properties of differing TiO 2 electrode morphologies, such as rutile nanorods exposing the (110) surface and anatase electrodes with high percentages of the (001) surface exposed, begs {{the question of whether}} this anchoring strategy is best, irrespective of the majority surface exposed. Here we address this question by presenting density functional theory calculations contrasting the binding properties of two promising anchoring groups, phosphonic acid and boronic acid, to that of carboxylic acid. Anchor-electrode interactions are studied for the pro- totypical anatase (101) surface, along with the anatase (001) and rutile (110) surfaces. Finally the effect of using these alternative anchoring groups to bind a typical coumarin dye (NKX- 2311) to these TiO 2 substrates is examined. Significant differences in the binding properties are found depending on both the anchor and surface, illustrating that the choice of anchor is necessarily dependent upon the surface exposed in the electrode. In particular the boronic acid is found to show the potential to be an excellent anchor choice for electrodes exposing the anatase (001) surface. Comment: 44 pages, 15 figures, accepted by J.

50|$|A {{panchromatic}} emulsion produces a realistic reproduction {{of a scene}} as it appears to the human eye. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic, but some types are orthochromatic and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding <b>sensitising</b> <b>dyes</b> to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost {{two to three times}} as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.|$|R

40|$|Time-resolved angle-resolved {{evanescent}} wave induced fluorescence spectroscopy (EWIFS) has been used, {{for the first}} time, to determine interfacial concentration distributions of molecular species. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that in dynamic systems the non-radiative fluorescence decay coefficients of molecular species are effected only in a minor way {{by the presence of}} a dielectric interface. Consequently, measurements of interfacial fluorescence decay times are used to probe variations in molecular fluorescence quantum efficiencies, caused by the presence of an interface. The understanding of these variations is combined with angle-resolved {{evanescent wave}} theory. Examination of derived theoretical models using simulated data demonstrates that angle-resolved EWIFS is capable of measuring interfacial interactions on a nanometer scale. An evanescent wave induced fluorescence spectrometer is designed and fabricated to allow the measurement of the time-integrated and time-resolved interfacial emission. The spectrometer is also capable of accurate penetration depth variation, through the control of the incidence angle. Examination of simple, well-understood molecular systems allows testing and validation of experimental design and theoretical models.

In both technologies, the systems are driven by the initial absorption of photons to form charge carriers. These charge carriers may subsequently recombine or diffuse to the oxide surface where they may undergo interfacial electron transfer. In the case of modern solar cells, this involves transfer of the photogenerated charge from the <b>sensitising</b> <b>dye</b> to the semiconductor matrix; in the case of photocatalysis, this involves transfer of the photogenerated charge from the semiconductor to solution. In solar cells, the semiconductor is most often employed {{in the form of a}} mesoporous layer; in photocatalysis, it may be in form of either a mesoporous layer or as nanoparticles. Since 1972, the main foci of photocatalysis have been the photodestruction of organic pollutants and the splitting of water for hydrogen generation. Our studies have focussed on new applications of photocatalysis beyond these areas, in particular the applications of photocatalysis in nuclear fuel reprocessing; the development of novel, magnetic nanocomposite photocatalysts; and the production and characterisation, for sensor applications, of conducting mesoporous metal oxide films that exhibit high degrees of photo-induced superhydrophilicity. This lecture will present an overview of these studies, concentrating on our work on superhydrophilic materials – the onset of superhydrophilicity in metal oxides being thought to be due to the photogeneration of oxygen vacancies within the semiconductor lattice.

Human PCLS are an ex vivo model where all relevant cell types are present in their natural position. We use PCLS to test for modifications of local immune responses assessing a variety of immunological endpoints. Human PCLS were prepared from lung lobes of cancer patients. Tissue was exposed to LPS, dexamethasone, respiratory and contact allergens. Viability of PCLS was determined with WST- 1, LDH and LIVE/DEAD staining for confocal microscopy. Cytokine contents were detected with Luminex technology and ELISA. Employing LPS and dexamethasone we were able to show that the inflammatory response in PCLS resemble the in vivo situation very closely. Repeated stimulation with LPS (intra- and inter-assay variances < 20 %) showed that human PCLS might also be suitable to characterize respiratory irritation and inflammation induced by chemicals. PCLS were exposed to 20 chemicals and IC 50 were calculated. We currently investigate cytokine patterns (e. g. IL- 1, TNF, IL- 8) for the differentiation between respiratory and contact allergens.

40|$|The finite {{nature of}} fossil fuels and their effect on the global climate, raised the need to find an {{alternative}} source of energy. This source should be environment compatible, cheap and abundant. The light coming from the Sun is a promising alternative. To be fruitful, the solar energy needs to be transformed in storable and transportable energy forms like electricityor fuels. Amongst the most studied techniques <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> devices offer the possibility to be designed for both the scopes: solar-to-electricity and solar-to-fuel conversions. In these applications a photocathode and a photoanode, constructed by mesoporous semisconductor films <b>sensitised</b> with <b>dyes,</b> are placed in series with one another. It follows that the photocurrent generated by one electrode should be sustained by the photocurrent produced by the other electrode. At the moment {{there is a substantial}} difference between the conversion efficiencies and the photocurrent produced by photoanodes and photocathodes. In this thesis the reasons for this discrepancy are investigated. The main responsible of the bad performance is identified in the semiconductor normally used in photocathodes, Nickel Oxide (NiO). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to elucidate the electrical properties of mesoporous NiO films. The study revealed that NiO films are able to carry a large enough current to establish that conductivity is not a limiting factor. The recombination reactions were then accused as the cause of the power losses. A time resolved spectroscopic study revealed that NiO can host two kinds of holes. One of these holes is responsible for a fast dye-NiO recombination (100 ns) and the other one for a slow recombination (10 ms). A cell featuring only the slow dye-NiO recombination would possibly reach high efficiency. The characterisation of the species associated with these two holes was performed by density-of-state assisted spectroelectrochemistry. The holes were found to be trapped by Ni 2 + and Ni 3 + sites located on the NiO surface forming respectively Ni 3 + and Ni 4 + states. A study by fs and ns transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that Ni 3 + sites can trap a hole in subpicosecond time scale and this hole relaxes into a Ni 2 + trap in ns timescale. The control of the Ni 2 +/Ni 3 +ratio on the NiO surface was found  to be crucial for a high cell photovoltage.

For the AR 24 dye we present evidence that iodine also binds to the amine moiety on this dye. With these binding coefficients we show that the dye–iodine complex will be present at much higher concentrations than free iodine in the pore structure of a DSSC. As we have recently shown that iodine (rather than tri-iodide) is the dominant acceptor in electron recombination, the concentration dye–iodine complexes could influence recombination rates and thus Voc. By comparison of recombination data on full cells, we show that AR 24 accelerates recombination by a factor of 7 over N 719, presumably due to the iodine binding to the amine group. We leave open the question why iodine binding to the amine group seems to have a stronger effect on the recombination than does binding to the thiocyanate...|$|R

40|$|Quantum dots (QDs) are {{excellent}} donors in Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based sensors {{because of their}} broad absorption and narrow symmetric emission. However, the strict requirement of a short donor-acceptor distance to achieve high FRET (hence sensitivity) has posed a significant challenge for QD- FRET based sensors due to challenges associated with the preparation of QD-conjugates that are both compact and highly stable. Consequently, most robust QD-FRET sensors are often too bulky to produce FRET efficiently, especially at low target to QD copy numbers (e. g. 1 : 1). They have largely relied on increasing the target:QD ratio to achieve high FRET, making them undesirable and inefficient in situations of low target:QD copy numbers. Here we report our recent work {{in the preparation of}} stable, compact and water-soluble QDs via ligand exchange and their subsequent conjugation to DNAs to make compact, functional QD-DNA conjugates based smart nanoparticle sensors for labelled and label-free DNA and protein detection. We have developed two strategies to prepare QD-DNA sensors: 1) via QD-thiolated DNA self-assembly, and 2) via covalent coupling between DNA and a QD surface ligand functional group. We show that a thiolated DNA (labelled with a fluorophore) can self-assemble onto a 3 -mercaptopropionic acid-capped, CdSe/ZnS core/shell QD to produce highly efficient FRET (~ 80 %) at a low DNA:QD ratio of 1 : 1 at single molecule level. However, this system suffers from strong, non-specific DNA adsorption and the self-assembled single-stranded (ss) DNA is unable to hybridise to its target complementary DNA. More recently, we found that a dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) -capped QD-ssDNA self-assembled system can hybridise to its labelled DNA target to produce very efficient FRET that can be exploited for labelled-DNA quantification. By incorporating an anti-thrombin DNA aptamer to the self-assembled QD-DNA system, the resulting QD-DNA aptamer sensor can detect specifically 10 nM unlabelled protein target (thrombin) in standard aqueous buffer. In strategy 2, we show that the non-specific DNA adsorption can be eliminated by introducing a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to the QD capping ligands or by capping the QD with a novel chelating dendritic ligand.

New phosphonium ionic liquids were synthesised for use as electrolytes in DSSCs. Different anions such as tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, dicyanamide, bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide, thiocyanate and bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide, combined with different asymmetric phosphonium cations, were used to prepare either ionic liquids, or solids that show plastic crystal behaviour. The chemical and physical properties of these phosphonium ionic liquids were measured and they all show relatively good thermal stability, except for the bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide series. They also exhibit good ionic conductivity and are considered to be “good” ionic liquids according to their position on the Walden plot. These new phosphonium ionic liquids were utilised as electrolytes in <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> solar cells using dithienothiophene organic dyes, and the results compared to those obtained using the common ruthenium-based dyes. The effect of film thickness, scattering layer and particle size were investigated with the organic sensitisers. With these new dithienothiophene sensitisers, a thin (2 μm) transparent TiO 2 layer with a scattering layer of ~ 6 μm is the optimum for the device to perform well. The addition of chenodeoxycholic acid in the dye bath showed an improvement in device efficiency. Addition of small amounts of solvent such as water, valeronitrile or tetraglyme are also discussed. These novel phosphonium ionic liquids show promising behaviour in these cells. The best device performance was achieved with the least viscous phosphonium ionic liquids containing the methoxy group on one of the alkyl chains. The power conversion efficiencies using these dithienothiophene dyes were all > 5 % under full sun and > 6 % at low sun intensity. In order to understand the behaviour of ionic liquids in <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> solar cells, the effect of this class of material in contact with the semiconductor was investigated by measurement of flatband potentials. Depending on the “acidity” or “basicity” of the neat ionic liquids, the position of the conduction band edge of the semiconductor is shifted. The purity of the ionic liquid is also a very important factor as it can affect the position of the flatband potential of the TiO 2 -ionic liquid junction. For example, C 2 mimBF 4 gives two different flatband potentials depending {{on the quality of the}} ionic liquid from the supplier. The effects of acid treatment and the addition of additives such as lithium iodide and N-methylbenzimidazole to the ionic liquid were also investigated. As expected, addition of small ions such as Li+ or H+ shift the flatband potential towards more positive values, whereas the presence of basic materials such as 4 -tert-butylpyridine or N-methylbenzimidazole gives more negative potentials. These additives as well as the ionic liquids play an important role in <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> solar cells, especially on the open circuit voltage. The use of imidazolium, ammonium and phosphonium based ionic liquid electrolytes was also investigated with porphyrin sensitisers and transient spectroscopy measurements were performed to elucidate the influence of the ionic liquid on the device performance. Another interesting class of materials, which are related to the family of ionic liquids studied here, are the organic ionic plastic crystals. These were investigated as potential solid electrolytes in <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> solar cells. It is the first time that these materials have been successfully used in DSSCs. Relatively good performance was obtained with an electrolyte based on the organic ionic plastic crystal, C 1 mpyrN(CN) 2. Performance of > 5 % was obtained with Ruthenium as the sensitiser under full sun intensity. Finally, the use of another type of solid electrolyte based on succinonitrile was investigated with both the porphyrin sensitiser (P 159) and with a ruthenium based sensitiser (N 719). Over 5 % efficiency was achieved at low sun intensity with the porphyrin dye. This is the first time that such a good performance has been obtained with a solid electrolyte in porphyrin based DSSCs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) use a {{mesoporous}} TiO 2 scaffold, typically assisted by an adsorbed dye, {{as the main}} active element, responsible for the photon absorption, exciton generation and charge separation functionality. The sintering process employed in the TiO 2 active layer fabrication {{plays a crucial role}} in the formation of the nanoparticle scaffold and hence the performance of a <b>dye</b> <b>sensitised</b> solar cell, as it allows the particles to form efficient inter-crystalline electric contacts to provide high electron conductivity. The sintering temperature, with typical values in the range of 450 – 600 °C, is of particular importance for the formation as it reduces the amount of unwanted organics between the individual crystallites and determines the formation of interfaces between the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the cell design requires a conductive transparent top electrode which is typically made of fluorinated tin oxide or indium tin oxide. Here we report on a highly spatially resolved scanning electron microscopy study including focussed ion beam (FIB) milling and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of the distribution of all relevant elements within a DSSC subsequent to a classical sintering process. We find that the above quoted temperatures cause the Sn of the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) to migrate into the TiO 2 scaffold, resulting in unwanted alterations in the composition of the complex scaffold which has a direct effect on the DSSC performance. One potential solution to this problem is the invention of novel concepts in the manufacturing of DSSCs using lower sintering temperatures...|$|R
