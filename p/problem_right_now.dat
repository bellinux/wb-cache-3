5000|$|The passed House {{version was}} criticised by U.S. senators, tech firms like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter, {{as well as}} civil liberties groups. Senator Sen. Patrick Leahy, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and lead Democratic author of the Freedom Act, criticized the House version by saying in a statement: [...] "Today's action in the House {{continues}} the bipartisan effort to restore Americans' civil liberties. But I was disappointed that the legislation passed today does not include some of the meaningful reforms contained in the original USA Freedom Act. I will continue to push for these important reforms when the Senate judiciary committee considers the USA Freedom Act next month." [...] And Senator Ron Wyden stated he was [...] "gravely concerned that {{the changes that have}} been made to the House version of this bill have watered it down so far that it fails to protect Americans from suspicionless mass surveillance." [...] Major U.S. tech firms like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter joined together in the Reform Government Surveillance coalition which called the House version a move in the wrong direction. The Reform Government Surveillance released a statement on June 5, stating: [...] "The latest draft opens up an unacceptable loophole that could enable the bulk collection of Internet users' data … While it makes important progress, we cannot support this bill as currently drafted and urge Congress to close this loophole to ensure meaningful reform." [...] Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: [...] "The bill is littered with loopholes. The <b>problem</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> especially after multiple revisions, is that it doesn't effectively end mass surveillance." [...] Zeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International USA's security and human rights program, accusing the House for failing to deliver serious surveillance reform said: [...] "People inside and outside the U.S. would remain at risk of dragnet surveillance. The Senate should pass much stronger reforms ensuring greater transparency, robust judicial review, equal rights for non-U.S. persons, and a clear, unambiguous ban on mass spying. President Obama need not wait. He can and should implement such safeguards today." [...] The White House however endorsed the bill. [...] "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3361, the USA Freedom Act. … The Administration applauds and appreciates the strong bipartisan effort that led to the formulation of this bill, which heeds the President's call on this important issue," [...] the White House said in a statement. [...] "The bill ensures our intelligence and law enforcement professionals have the authorities they need to protect the Nation, while further ensuring that individuals' privacy is appropriately protected when these authorities are employed. Among other provisions, the bill prohibits bulk collection through the use of Section 215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters." ...|$|E

40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{has become}} the first widely adopted {{protocol}} for managing IP-based telephony, video, and multimedia sessions. SIP advertises a contact point of an individual to the Web. This contact point, similar to an e-mail address, can be exploited for spam purposes. Spam over Internet Telephony, also called SPIT, in general denotes any bulk unsolicited information sent to any potential calling-end of a VoIP infrastructure. Even though SPIT is a new concept, it is more reasonable to address this <b>problem</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> rather than waiting until the problem prevails. To mitigate SPIT, adequate technical countermeasures are required. The solution space may expand to nontechnical ones, as well. In this paper, we propose the SPIDER (SPam over Internet telephony Detection sERvice) platform, a modular and efficient system for fighting SPIT. SPIDER orchestrates several discrete modules that parse, analyze, process, and classify incoming SIP call requests. We discuss technical design details of the individual modules, that this platform consists of; then, we present how these modules are combined to support accurate decisions for any incoming SIP call being legitimate or not. Furthermore, we include a comprehensive evaluation scenario, which refers to the tests performed on the individual modules and on the integrated platform. Evaluation {{results indicate that the}} overall architecture manages to identify SPIT calls with low false ratio by using reasonable processing resources and tolerable decision time...|$|E

40|$|Many modern {{enterprises}} are {{collecting data}} {{at the most}} detailed level possible, creating data repositories ranging from terabytes to petabytes in size. The ability to apply sophisticated statistical analysis methods to this data is becoming essential for marketplace competitiveness. This need to perform deep analysis over huge data repositories poses a significant challenge to existing statistical software and data management systems. On the one hand, statistical software provides rich functionality for data analysis and modeling, but can handle only limited amounts of data; e. g., popular packages like R and SPSS operate entirely in main memory. On the other hand, data management systems—such as MapReduce-based systems—can scale to petabytes of data, but provide insufficient analytical functionality. We report our experiences in building Ricardo, a scalable platform for deep analytics. Ricardo {{is part of the}} eXtreme Analytics Platform (XAP) project at the IBM Almaden Research Center, and rests on a decomposition of data-analysis algorithms into parts executed by the R statistical analysis system and parts handled by the Hadoop data management system. This decomposition attempts to minimize the transfer of data across system boundaries. Ricardo contrasts with previous approaches, which try to get along with only one type of system, and allows analysts to work on huge datasets from within a popular, well supported, and powerful analysis environment. Because our approach avoids the need to re-implement either statistical or data-management functionality, {{it can be used to}} solve complex <b>problems</b> <b>right</b> <b>now...</b>|$|R

Or, in other words: how do we ensure that resources are used in a way that ensures on the one hand that the needs of the present generation are met, whilst on the other ensuring that sufficient resources remain so that future generations are able to meet their needs. In defining the sustainability, the word “resources” has a subjective valuation for an individual. The earth is full of “matter” but not all matter is a resource (i. e. carbon dioxide in excess does a lot of damage to the planet). Hence in order for a resource exploitation to be effectively coordinated, there must even be coordination of the different criteria used to establish what a resource is.
