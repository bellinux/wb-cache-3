To {{reduce the need for}} small rolls <b>pack</b> <b>rolling</b> is used, which rolls multiple sheets together to increase the effective starting thickness. As the foil sheets come through the rollers, they are trimmed and slitted with circular or razor-like knives. Trimming refers to the edges of the foil, while slitting involves cutting it into several sheets. Aluminum foil is the most commonly produced product via <b>pack</b> <b>rolling.</b> This is evident from the two different surface finishes; the shiny side is on the roll side and the dull side is against the other sheet of foil.|$|E

SEM analysis for interfacial bonding and cell structures of AFS were carried out in detail. The results show that surface quality of the panel after <b>pack</b> <b>rolling</b> is obviously improved as compared to powder composite rolling using Al sheets. Macro-cracks of face sheets also completely disappear. The interfacial bonding in between Al tube and foamable precursor material have no micro-cracks {{and the existence of}} gap. Metallurgical bonding between Al face sheets and the core Al foams and uniform cell structures of AFS are achieved as the foaming temperature and foaming time are 700 °C and 2 minutes, respectively...|$|E

High silicon {{electrical}} steel prepared by EB-PVD {{was subjected to}} high temperature rapid thermal annealing and subsequent <b>pack</b> <b>rolling.</b> The phase composition and Fe configurations were characterized by X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The {{results show that the}} as-deposited, as-annealed and as-rolled samples mainly consist of DO 3 ordering phase and the as-deposited {{electrical steel}} is composed of six kinds of Fe sites corresponding to 333. 8 KOe...|$|E

In this letter, a new dropping and <b>rolling</b> <b>packing</b> algorithm is employed {{by means of}} analytical equations, to investigate the random packing of spherical particles.

50|$|In Europe, the United Kingdom {{and most}} Commonwealth nations, {{the term is}} often used more {{specifically}} {{to refer to a}} short tube, commonly torn from a <b>pack</b> of <b>rolling</b> papers, that may be present in the unlit end of a joint. This hollow mouthpiece, customarily made of thin cardboard, is termed a filter in North America. In {{other parts of the world}} other materials are also used, eg Steel. The Steel roach was invented to fill the gap of reusable product category and it also does not have as much Crystal deposits like paper filters. It is commonly set in position during the rolling process, or may be inserted later. When the use of a roach is employed, a joint can still be held securely after it has burnt down to a short length; thus, the entire length of the joint may be smoked, without the aid of a roach clip.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{model for}} space-filling <b>packing</b> of discs <b>rolling</b> sliplessly {{on each other}} is presented. This model is an {{extension}} of the model presented by Herrmann et al to a basic loop size of an arbitrary even number of discs. This model might have application in geophysics, dense granular flows and turbulence. We show the existence and uniqueness of such constructions, analytically, for loop size up to eight, and numerically for bigger basic loop sizes, and make precise the algorithm to construct them. A classification of the solution is also given and extensive studies of the fractal dimension are performed, showing that it varies considerably with the base loop size. 1...|$|R
30|$|In this work, the {{microstructural}} {{stability of}} nanocrystalline nickel during pack-rolling deformation was quantitatively investigated based on X-ray diffraction line profile analysis. The reliability of some relevant results was validated by {{transmission electron microscopy}} observation and microhardness measurement. The discrepancy in microstructural development between the metal/metal contact interface and the metal/roll contact interface was of particular concern. The {{results showed that the}} microstructures of the two interfaces underwent different evolution routes due to different imposed strains. From the statistical microstructural information such as crystal defect density and grain size, it can be concluded that the microstructure of the metal/metal contact interface exhibited more stable during <b>pack</b> <b>rolling</b> than that of the metal/roll interface.|$|E
40|$|A SiC {{reinforced}} Ti- 5 Al- 5 Mo- 5 V- 3 Cr matrix {{metal matrix}} composite is developed. Monolithic blocks of alloy are hot rolled via <b>pack</b> <b>rolling</b> to produce foils for MMC panel fabrication. These are consolidated using hot isostatic pressing and solution treated and aged for optimum strength. The panels exhibited a strength of 2 [*]GPa in tension and 3. 5 [*]GPa in compression, compared to the aerospace steel 300 M, which has a tensile strength of 1. 69 [*]GPa. The fatigue performance of the material exceeded that of MMCs developed using Ti- 21 S or Ti- 6 Al- 4 V matrices. Finally, the reaction zone between the SiC and matrix is examined, revealing the presence of TiC...|$|E
30|$|Microstructural {{stability}} {{is an important}} issue for nanocrystalline materials to be practically used in many fields. The present work shows how microstructure evolves with rolling strain in pre-annealed electrodeposited nanocrystalline nickel containing an initial strong fiber texture, on the basis of X-ray diffraction line profile analysis as well as transmission electron microscopy observation. The influence of shear strain on microstructural stability of the metal/roll contact interface is compared with that of the metal/metal contact interface; the latter would be closer to deformation in plane strain compression. From the statistical microstructural information, together with experimentally observed microstructure of deformed grains after the final rolling pass, it seems fair to conclude that the microstructure of the metal/metal contact interface is more stable during <b>pack</b> <b>rolling</b> than that of the metal/roll interface.|$|E
30|$|The {{original}} {{idea of using}} TENGs for water wave energy was proposed by the liquid–solid electrification-enabled process. During the submerging and surfacing process due to traveling water waves, current flows between the electrodes to screen the charges on the triboelectric layer of the TENG, thereby producing electric power [18, 19, 20]. However, the output performance decreases dramatically to almost zero at a high ion concentration in a real water environment owing to the streaming potential theory [21, 22, 23]. An additional strategy was put forward involving a freestanding, fully enclosed TENG that <b>packs</b> a <b>rolling</b> ball in its interior to form a rocking spherical shell [24, 25, 26, 27]. Later on, various designs based on the hybridization of TENGs and EMGs were developed [28, 29, 30, 31]. The magnet pairs of EMGs produce the noncontact attractive force that enables the fully enclosed packaging of the TENG part, protecting it from the ambient environment. Meanwhile, the complementary outputs can be hybridized and maximized in a broad frequency range. Nevertheless, these hybrid generators {{are still in the}} development stage for water flow energy collection, and more research is highly desired to optimize their structure and improve their performance toward practical applications.|$|R
60|$|Although she {{had some}} inkling of the course Stewart and his men were to pursue, she was {{not by any means}} {{prepared}} for the indifference she saw. Frank was asleep, or pretended to be. Three cowboys were lazily and unconcernedly attending to camp-fire duties, such as baking biscuits, watching the ovens, and washing tins and pots. The elaborate set of aluminum plates, cups, etc., together with the other camp fixtures that had done service for Madeline's party, had disappeared. Nick Steele sat with his back to a log, smoking his pipe. Another cowboy had just brought the horses closer into camp, where they stood waiting to be saddled. Nels appeared to be fussing over a <b>pack.</b> Stewart was <b>rolling</b> a cigarette. Monty had apparently nothing to do for the present except whistle, which he was doing much more loudly than melodiously. The whole ensemble gave an impression of careless indifference.|$|R
30|$|Results from {{comparison}} of microstructure development in deformed nc materials {{have shown that}} grain growth behavior was influenced by initial microstructures such as grain orientation, internal stress, and crystal defect density [6, 14 – 16]. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} compare the results of microstructure evolution from other literature. Two or more samples are expected to deform simultaneously under nominally the same deformation condition. Note that accumulative roll bonding is one of the powerful techniques to produce ultra-fine grain microstructures by introducing large strain and strain gradient [17, 18]. <b>Pack</b> <b>rolling</b> has been chosen as the deformation processing route in our previous study. Effects of pack-rolling deformation on the microstructure, texture, and hardness of nc Ni have been primarily explored [19, 20]. It has been revealed that deformed zones with different grain sizes undergo different strains. But nonetheless, little attention is paid to in-depth comparative analysis of microstructural evolution such as the changes in crystal defect density. Therefore, the present study aims to further investigate the microstructural stability of pack-rolled nc Ni.|$|E
