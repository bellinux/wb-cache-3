The estimated ΔE {{at the bottom}} of the GaN nanorod (D ≈ 35 nm) is larger than the ΔE at the top of GaN nanorod (D ≈ 85 nm) by 5.3 meV which is smaller than the experimental value of 15 meV. Based on Equation 3, we can estimate that if the effective diameters of the GaN nanorod at R 1 and R 5 are 21 nm and 51 nm, respectively, which are about 60 % of the measured values, the shifted energy will approach the experimental result of 15 meV. The reduction on the effective diameter of the GaN nanorod could be related to the band-bending effect caused by the Fermi level pinning of the GaN nanorod [28, 29]. Furthermore, the <b>peak</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>is</b> <b>strong</b> as the CL spectra are carried out {{at the bottom of}} the GaN nanorod, which is mainly due to the size effects. The size effects come from the increase of the surface state density of GaN due to the large surface-to-volume ratio and the variation of electronic states because of the diameter difference. However, in CL spectra measurements, the results cannot conclude which effect dominates the increased <b>intensity.</b> That can <b>be</b> further confirmed by other measurements or experimental setups in the future.|$|R

40|$|Identifying the {{dominant}} mechanisms controlling recharge in shallow sandy soils in tropical climates has received relatively little attention. Given {{the expansion of}} coastal fill using marine sands {{and the growth of}} coastal populations throughout the tropics, {{there is a need to}} better understand the nature of water balances in these settings. We use time series of field observations at a coastal landfill in Singapore coupled with numerical modeling using the Richards' equation to examine the impact of precipitation patterns on soil moisture dynamics, including percolation past the root zone and recharge, in such an environment. A threshold in total precipitation event depth, much more so than <b>peak</b> precipitation <b>intensity,</b> <b>is</b> the <b>strongest</b> event control on recharge. However, shallow antecedent moisture, and therefore the timing between events along with the seasonal depth to water table, also play significant roles in determining recharge amounts. For example, at our field site, precipitation events of less than 3 mm per event yield little to no direct recharge, but for larger events, moisture content changes below the root zone are linearly correlated to the product of the average antecedent moisture content and the total event precipitation. Therefore, water resources planners need to consider identifying threshold precipitation volumes, along with the multiple time scales that capture variability in event antecedent conditions and storm frequency in assessing the role of recharge in coastal water balances in tropical settings...|$|R

Late on September 1, PAGASA upgraded Tropical Depression Mameng (20W) to a tropical storm. Early the next morning, the JTWC relocated the circulation center 200 miles (320 km) to the north as the depression began to approach the island of Luzon. Soon after the storm began to move away from Luzon after its closest approach, the JTWC upgraded Tropical Depression 20W to a tropical storm and assigned it the name Wendy. At 0000 UTC on September 3, the JTWC, PAGASA, and the JMA, the official warning center for the region reported that Wendy (Mameng) had reached its <b>peak</b> <b>intensity</b> with PAGASA issuing its final advisory as it moved out of its area of responsibility.
