25|$|Tuna in {{particular}} are of major importance to commercial fisheries. Though tuna migrate across oceans, trying to find them {{there is not the}} usual approach. Tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant, along the boundaries of currents, around islands, near seamounts, and in some areas of upwelling along continental slopes. Tuna are captured by several methods: purse seine vessels enclose an entire surface school with special nets, <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>vessels</b> which use <b>poles</b> baited with other smaller pelagic fish as baitfish, and rafts called fish aggregating devices are set up, because tuna, as well as some other pelagic fish, tend to congregate under floating objects.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>vessels</b> â€“ {{are used}} mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} <b>and</b> fish with <b>poles</b> <b>and</b> <b>lines.</b> The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|R

25|$|However, an {{even more}} {{extensive}} and sustainable coastal resource is forage fish, such as anchovies and herring. This fishery {{is an integral part}} of the <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> tuna fishery, since tuna feed on the forage fish.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{methods of}} catching skipjack tuna, skipjack tuna {{throughout the world}} is the <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> fishing using live bait. The lack of adequate supplies of live bait is a major bottleneck for the development of <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> tuna fisheries in Lakshadweep which is the only place in India where <b>pole</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> fishing is practised for catching tuna. The results of the recent live bait resource surveys at Lakshadweep indicated that year to year fluctuations in the availability and abundance of live baits is a natural phenomenon which is caused mainly by the variability in the recruitment of the various species into the lagoon environment. The fishermen of different islands other than Minicoy need training for the rational exploitation of live bait fishes other than the currently fished S. delicatulus. Intensive culture of suitable live bait fish is another option for solving the bait fish scarcit...|$|R
