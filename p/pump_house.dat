5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the <b>pump</b> <b>house.</b> A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown.

After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the <b>pump</b> <b>house,</b> followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

40|$|A {{hydraulically}} operated pump is described for in-ground filtering and monitoring of wells or other fluid sources, including a hollow cylindrical <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> with an inlet and an outlet, filtering devices positioned in the inlet and the outlet, a piston that fits slidably within the <b>pump</b> <b>housing,</b> and an optical cell {{in fluid communication}} with the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> A conduit within the piston allows fluid communication between the exterior and {{one end of the}} piston. A pair of O-rings form a seal between the inside of the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> and the exterior of the piston. A flow valve positioned within the piston inside the conduit allows fluid to flow in a single direction. In operation, fluid enters the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> through the inlet, flows through the conduit and towards an end of the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> The piston then makes a downward stroke closing the valve, thus forcing the fluid out from the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> into the optical cell, which then takes spectrophotometric measurements of the fluid. A spring helps return the piston back to its starting position, so that a new supply of fluid may enter the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> and the downward stroke can begin again. The pump may be used independently of the optical cell, as a sample pump to transport a sample fluid from a source to a container for later analysis...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{prosperity}} the dock afforded the city, within 20 {{years of its}} construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000tonnes, {{by the start of}} the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained {{an integral part of the}} dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the <b>pump</b> <b>house</b> was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acu√±a. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the ditch is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of the ditch is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the ditch was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a <b>pump</b> <b>house.</b> After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant of the ditch.|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{application}} algorithm {{has been introduced}} to explore structural optimisation for a gear <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> In the study, experimental, theoretical (analytical and numerical) methods are utilised. A commercial external spur gear pump which has 17. 1 [L min- 1] volumetric flow rate with maximum pressure capacity of 250 [bar] has been considered for {{an application}} case study. In the experimental section of the study, four pressure sensors (emitters) were placed with angle intervals of 45 ¬∞, 90 ¬∞, 135 ¬∞ and 180 ¬∞ on the <b>pump‚Äôs</b> <b>housing</b> to measure operating pressure values at specific pressure regions of the housing from inlet to outlet. According to experimental results of the pressure measurements, a response surface analysis (RSA) was carried out and then an estimation model (empirical equation), {{which could be used}} to calculate pressure values at any specific region of the housing, was obtained. According to the RSA results gained, it appears that the estimation model has 99. 9 % R 2 value which can be used for adequately predicting accurate pressures at any region of the housing. Subsequently, this estimation model has been adapted for commercial finite element method (FEM) based engineering software and from which stress distributions on the housing were simulated three dimensionally. FEM based simulation outputs showed that there were no failure signatures on the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> As the main conclusion of the study, it is seen that an estimation model gives an adequate approach to predict pressure values at any specific pressure region of the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> and, especially, stress distribution results has highlighted that a structural optimisation study may be suitable for the <b>pump</b> <b>housing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tank 241 -AZ- 101 (AZ- 101) {{is one of}} 28 double-shell tanks {{located in}} the AZ farm in the Hanford Site`s 200 East Area. The tank {{contains}} a significant quantity of fissile materials, including an estimated 9. 782 kg of plutonium. Before beginning jet pump mixing for mitigative purposes, the operations must be evaluated to demonstrate {{that they will be}} subcritical under both normal and credible abnormal conditions. The main objective {{of this study was to}} address a concern about whether two 300 -hp pumps with four rotating 18. 3 -m/s (60 -ft/s) jets can concentrate plutonium in their pump housings during mixer pump operation and cause a criticality. The three-dimensional simulation was performed with the time-varying TEMPEST code to determine how much the pump jet mixing of Tank AZ- 101 will concentrate plutonium in the <b>pump</b> <b>housing.</b> The AZ- 101 model predicted that the total amount of plutonium within the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> peaks at 75 g at 10 simulation seconds and decreases to less than 10 g at four minutes. The plutonium concentration in the entire <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> peaks at 0. 60 g/L at 10 simulation seconds and is reduced to below 0. 1 g/L after four minutes. Since the minimum critical concentration of plutonium is 2. 6 g/L, and the minimum critical plutonium mass under idealized plutonium-water conditions is 520 g, these predicted maximums in the <b>pump</b> <b>housing</b> are much lower than the minimum plutonium conditions needed to reach a criticality level.
