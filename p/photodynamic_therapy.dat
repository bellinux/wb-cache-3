40|$|Introduction: Porous silicon (pSi) {{engineered}} by electrochemical etching {{has been used}} as a drug delivery vehicle to address the intrinsic limitations of traditional therapeutics. Biodegradability, biocompatibility, and optoelectronic properties make pSi a unique candidate for developing biomaterials for theranostics and <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapies.</b> This review presents an updated overview about the recent therapeutic systems based on pSi, with a critical analysis on the problems and opportunities that this technology faces as well as highlighting pSi's growing potential. Areas covered: Recent progress in pSi-based research includes drug delivery systems, including biocompatibility studies, drug delivery, theranostics, and clinical trials with the most relevant examples of pSi-based systems presented here. A critical analysis about the technical advantages and disadvantages of these systems is provided along with an assessment on the challenges that this technology faces, including clinical trials and investors' support. Expert opinion: pSi is an outstanding material that could improve existing drug delivery and <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapies</b> in different areas, paving the way for developing advanced theranostic nanomedicines and incorporating payloads of therapeutics with imaging capabilities. However, more extensive in-vivo studies are needed to assess the feasibility and reliability of this technology for clinical practice. The technical and commercial challenges that this technology face are still uncertain. Tushar Kumeria, Steven J. P. McInnes, Shaheer Maher and Abel Santo...|$|R
25|$|<b>Photodynamic</b> <b>therapy</b> (PDT) is {{generally}} a non-invasive treatment {{using a combination}} of light and a photosensitive drug, such as 5-ALA, Foscan, Metvix, Tookad, WST09, WST11, Photofrin, or Visudyne. The drug is triggered by light of a specific wavelength.|$|E
25|$|For {{low-risk}} disease, {{radiation therapy}} (external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate {{control of the}} disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapy,</b> topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage {{can be found in}} the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{therapy is}} the use of high-intensity light to destroy tumor cells while {{affecting}} only the treated area. This is typically done if the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help with pain and difficulty swallowing. <b>Photodynamic</b> <b>therapy,</b> a type of laser therapy, involves the use of drugs that are absorbed by cancer cells; when exposed to a special light, the drugs become active and destroy the cancer cells.|$|E

A search was conducted using the PubMed (Medline) database, which identified 36 articles including in vivo and in vitro studies, and reviews of different decontamination systems (chemical, mechanical, laser and <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapies).</b> There is sufficient consensus that, for the {{treatment of}} peri-implant infections, the mechanical removal of biofilm from the implant surface should be supplemented by chemical decontamination with surgical access.

These complications may be limited by the use of coated stents. Tumour ingrowth or overgrowth can be additionally palliated by the placement of a second stent through the lumen of the first, through electrocautery or argon plasma coagulation of the tumour tissue in the stent, or through the use of <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapy.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this review}} article, we {{highlight}} {{the importance of}} low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and its implications {{in the field of}} drug delivery to cancer cells. LDL is naturally occurring bionanoparticles (BNP) with a size of 18 – 25 nm. These BNPs specifically transport cholesterol to cells expressing the LDL receptors (LDLRs). Several tumors overexpress LDLRs, presumably to provide cholesterol for sustaining a high rate of membrane synthesis. LDL BNPs are biocompatible and biodegradable, favorably bind hydrophobic and amphiphilic drugs, are taken up by a receptor-mediated mechanism, have a half-life of 2 – 4 days, and can be rerouted. Drugs can be loaded onto LDL BNPs by surface loading, core loading, and apoprotein interaction.

40|$|Three major {{modes of}} cancer therapies, surgery, {{radiation}} and chemotherapy, {{have been the}} mainstay of modern oncologic therapy. To minimize side effects, molecular targeted cancer therapies including armed antibody therapy have been developed with limited success. In this study, we developed {{a new type of}} molecular targeted cancer therapy, photoimmunotherapy (PIT), employing a target-specific photosensitizer based on a near infrared (NIR) phthalocyanine dye, IR 700, conjugated to monoclonal antibodies (MAb) targeting epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). Cell death was induced immediately only upon irradiating, MAb-IR 700 bound, target cells with NIR light. In vivo tumor shrinkage after irradiation with NIR light was observed only in target EGFR-expressing cells. The MAb-IR 700 conjugates were most effective when bound to the cell membrane, producing no phototoxicity when not bound, suggesting a different mechanism for PIT compared with conventional <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapies.</b> Target selective PIT enables treatment of cancer based on MAb binding on the cell membrane.

500|$|Light {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths {{of light to}} an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. [...] When regular light is used immediately following {{the application of a}} sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapy</b> (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapies. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment {{is often referred to as}} laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with nonablative lasers, with examples being postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. [...] As of 2012, evidence for various light therapies was insufficient to recommend them for routine use. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. [...] Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and for outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E

The fact that bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics and antiseptics has lead to an increased interest {{in the field of}} developing new alternative eradication methods, such as PACT. Whereas gram-positive bacteria are generally sensitive to photoinactivation, gram-negative bacteria and fungi are usually less susceptible. Research of photosensitizers (PS) as well as development has been going on with the aim to find effective antimicrobial substances, which would have a broad-spectrum potency. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal effect of fifteen Pc derivatives. Methods: Fifteen different Pc were investigated. Their photokilling activity was tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. After treating of microbial cells with Pc in the concentrations: 1 mg/l, 2 mg/l, 4 mg/l, 8 mg/l for 30 minutes, the cultures were irradiated with low-power laser light wavelength of 670 nm (20 J/cm 2, 40 J/cm 2).

2500|$|Since {{prostate}} cancer is generally a multifocal disease, the traditional prostatectomy eliminates all local lesions {{by removing the}} entire prostate. However, it has been hypothesized that an [...] "index lesion" [...] might be responsible for disease progression. Therefore, focal therapy targeted towards the index lesion might effectively treat {{prostate cancer}} while preserving {{the remainder of the}} gland. Interventional radiologists have started to treat prostate cancer with minimally invasive therapies such as cryoablation, HIFU, radiofrequency ablation, and <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapy</b> that permit focal therapy by utilizing image guidance. [...] These therapies are still in beginning or experimental stages; however, because they preserve tissue, they can potentially reduce adverse treatment outcomes such as impotence and incontinence. [...] A small prospective study published in European Urology in February 2015 assessed the focal treatment of index lesions with HIFU in patients with multifocal prostate cancer and found that the majority of men returned to baseline genitourinary function and 86% of men were free of clinically significant prostate cancer at one year. Small, nonrandomized cohort studies with a median range follow-up 17–47 months have shown that cryoablation, HIFU, and phototherapy are associated with low rates of adverse effects and early disease control rates of 83%-100% based on negative biopsies.|$|E

Our observations demonstrated that ZnO nanoparticles exerted dose-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxicity for cancer cells like hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC- 7721 cells in vitro. Meanwhile, it was observed that UV irradiation could enhance the suppression ability of ZnO nanoparticles on cancer cells proliferation, and these effects were in the size-dependent manner.

Many treatments, such as laser <b>therapy</b> and <b>photodynamic</b> <b>therapies,</b> have been used but their efficacy is limited. Emerging anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies are now considered the standard of care.
