The decrease stemmed from poor performance in the construction sector combined with sluggish consumer spending and a global downturn in technology sectors.

Indeed, the empirical analysis {{has shown that the}} amount of DP does also vary over time at individual farm level because of several reasons. Because some DP are coupled to production, DP vary yearly according to production choices. <b>Payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> own by a farmer generate DP only if he/she declares an equivalent number of eligible hectares; thus, changes in land availability can push the amount of eligible land below the amount of own entitlements reducing the overall amount of DP received.

Farmers may receive part of the expected DP in the following year because of administrative or legal problems that delay the payment.

40|$|Current {{thoughts}} on CAP changes, e. g. the "Health Check", emphasize {{the necessity to}} move away from payments based on historical receipts towards a "flatter rate" system. The aim of current research is to simulate the impact of a flat rate system (equal payments per hectare of cultivated land) compared to the current historical system (payments based on individual historic entitlements). Impact on production and income of arable, dairy and cattle farms of two different flat rate scenario's, is assessed with a farm-based sector model for Flanders. The model maximizes income at farm level, calibrated to observed farming behavior in 2001 - 2003. Farm data can be selected by farm type, size and region, simulations could be run for specific sub sectors, size classes or regions.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) A {{significant}} new direction in Australian income support policy {{was introduced in}} 2002. Known as Australians Working Together, this development changed the basis of social security entitlement for parents. Throughout most of the twentieth century, low-income sole mothers, and later sole fathers and parents in couple families, could claim income support throughout most of their children’s school years. The primary grounds for their entitlement were low income and parenting responsibilities. Australians Working Together introduced compulsory employment-oriented activities to Parenting <b>Payment</b> <b>entitlement</b> for parents whose youngest child had turned 13. This thesis investigates mothers’ experience of this new welfare system. Using Dorothy Smith’s ‘everyday life’ approach to research, it draws upon qualitative and quantitative methods to analyse Australians Working Together. The research is grounded in a longitudinal interview survey of Australian mothers of teenage children who were subject to these changes. The analysis moves from their experience outwards through the four levels of analysis in Williams and Popay’s welfare research framework. The thesis examines mothers’ day-to-day worlds, the opportunities and constraints they navigate, the policies and institutions which shape their opportunities, the political framing of those policies, and wider social and economic transformations. In their negotiation {{of the social security}} system, mothers are striving for recognition of autonomy and care. They want their capacity to determine for themselves how to live their lives to be acknowledged. They would like the social contributions they make through employment, education and voluntary work to be recognised. They struggle for their unpaid work caring for their families to be valued. They wish that they had sufficient material resources to care well for their families. The thesis develops a theoretical framework to examine these struggles drawing on the work of Honneth, Fraser, Lister, Sennett, Fisher and Tronto, Daly and Lewis. This multi-level, everyday life analysis reveals the possibility of reframing the social security system around mutual respect...|$|R
40|$|The Agricultural Commissioner Franz Fischler {{outlined}} {{the findings of}} the recent impact assessment studies and the rationale behind the EU legislative proposals for further reform of the CAP to the European Parliament on January 22 nd 2003. He highlighted the fact that the proposals: would remove the structural imbalances in the rye, beef and rice markets; would not, through de-coupling, lead to farmers leaving the industry in droves, but would boost overall farm incomes, as farmers switched to more profitable products. He also highlighted two major changes in the proposed regulations compared to the July 2002 proposals, namely the adoption of a proposal for reform of the dairy regime and wholesale changes to the arrangements for dynamic modulation. Savings on the EU budget have no made it possible to bring forward dairy sector reform. The specific proposals put forward in the dairy sector involve: extending the quota system until 2014; a further reduction in the support price for milk and an increase in quotas of 1 % per annum in 2007 and 2008 in the EU- 25; a reduction in the intervention price for skimmed milk powder by 3. 5 % per year; a reduction in the intervention price for butter by 7 % per year; compensation of dairy producers for price reductions at an level equivalent to 58 % of the price cut. Commissioner Fischler expressed the view that these proposals would make the EU dairy sector more competitive and increase the EU's room for manoeuvre of at the WTO. The proposals for dynamic modulation now consist of the following elements: no reduction in payments to farmers receiving up to € 5, 000 in payments; a 12. 5 % reduction in payments to farmers receiving between € 5, 000 and € 50, 000; a 19 % reduction in the payments to farmers receiving more than € 50, 000. Some 6 % of the total amount saved would be re-deployed to rural development, with the remainder being used to finance further reform and being directed to farmers in greatest need. The Commissioner took the trouble to explain in simple terms how de-coupling will work: 'For every holding, the direct payments to which they are currently entitled would be bundled into a single payment, the level of which would be based on the amounts they received in the 2000 - 02 period {{as a result of their}} full entitlements under the present scheme. All the criteria on which this support was based during the reference period would be taken into account (area payments, head of livestock, per tonne payments etc). ' These payments would be conditional upon compliance with binding standards in environmental protection, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Holdings would have their support cut for non-compliance. To facilitate the transfer of <b>payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> from one holding to another, <b>payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> would be worked out by dividing the level of payment per holding by the size of the area on which payments were based. Thus areas of pasture, cereals and oilseeds would be included but those used for growing sugar beet or potatoes would not. ' Member states would be allowed to implement the scheme according to regional circumstances providing the principles of cross compliance were adhered to. He pointed out that the Commission's proposals would not entail de-coupling in all sectors, since this could lead to unacceptable reductions in the production of some products. As a consequence certain aids would continue to be tied to production, for example, durum wheat, potato starch, rice and feed proteins. Indeed, de-coupling would only be introduced to the extent that it was necessary to meet EU goals, including securing international recognition and acceptance of the EU system of support. With reference to the WTO, Commissioner Fischler argued that if the EU was proactive it would make it easier to protect the European model of agriculture and secure international acceptance of EU positions on non-trade issues. Comment: It should be noted that the use of savings on the EU budget to bring forward dairy-sector reform means that sugar-sector reform may well be further deferred. By highlighting that de-coupling would be introduced only as far as necessary to meet EU goals such as securing international acceptance of the EU support scheme, the Commissioner made clear that he would not allow reform to in any way threaten continued production of any CAP-covered products in the EU. This suggest some very real limits to the extent of reform of the CAP and the extent to which the EU will reduce public aid to the agricultural sector.

40|$|In {{presenting}} {{the outcome of}} the final round of negotiations on CAP reform at a press conference on June 26 th 2003, the EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler claimed that the EU had 'largely said goodbye to an old system of support which distorted trade' and he maintained that the new system would be more 'trade friendly', and would put the EU 'on the offensive at the WTO negotiations in Cancun in September', with the EU looking for 'something in return' for the concessions they will now be able to make. He acknowledged that the reform was a compromise but maintained that it was 'an acceptable one', and claimed that the new system would no longer promote overproduction so that the trade-distorting effects of EU policies would be substantially reduced. In a speech to the European Parliament on July 9 th 2003, Commissioner Fischler sought to evaluate the final agreement on CAP reform. He began by reiterating the objectives of reform, namely to: make a substantial contribution to stabilising farmers' incomes {{and at the same time}} to diversifying their farming activities; promote healthy and better quality foods, produced under environmentally sound production methods, which respected animal welfare; improve the public image of agricultural-support programmes. He then set out the reforms agreed, namely: a multiple-choice system for the introduction of the single farm payment scheme from January 2005 (with exceptions upon justified request until 2007); the introduction of flexibility without distorting competition; the linkage of the single farm payments scheme to compliance with a range of standards (cross compliance); the use of the 2000 - 2002 <b>payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> as the basis for calculating the single decoupled farm payment. The introduction of decoupling alongside specific sector reforms will it is argued 'strengthen the EU's negotiating hand in the WTO Ministerial conference in Cancun in September'. Commissioner Fischler maintained that the EU is now well placed to reach agreement in Cancun and that it is now up to other countries to match the EU's concessions. Comment: The claim that the reform will lead to less trade distortion is only justified in a highly relative context, as the reference point for the claim is the level which EU production would have attained by 2009 were existing policies to be pursued until then. If this reference point is used then EU production levels post-reform in most major commodities subject to reform will be lower than in the scenario without reform. However, if the point of reference is current levels of EU production then post-reform EU production will be higher, but at prices that will be much lower than those currently prevailing. This will enable the EU to clear its markets more easily without recourse to WTO-restricted trade instruments. EU claims to the effect that the new policy will be less trade distorting thus need to be subjected to close and critical scrutiny.

40|$|The European Commission's {{proposed}} {{regulations for}} further {{reform of the}} cereals, rice, dried fodder, and dairy sectors have been published. The regulations cover: direct aid schemes; support for rural development; the common organisation {{of the market in}} cereals; the common organisation of the market in rice; the common organisation of the market in dried fodder; the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products; the levy on milk and milk products. In addition to reiterating the general concept behind the process of CAP reform, the explanatory memorandum sets out the impact of the proposed reforms. The Commission claims that the 'adjustments proposed will complement the EU's international objective of ensuring that developing countries fully benefit from the expansion of world trade, while maintaining food security'. This will be achieved through reducing export availability, 'thereby contributing to stronger world market prices, which {{is in the interest of}} the agricultural sector in developing countries'. The reform process will also 'provide a sustainable and predictable policy framework for the European Model of Agriculture'. The Commission also emphasises that the reform process will require additional budgetary expenditures since farmers' incomes will need to be maintained. With regard to individual products the cereals-sector proposal would result in: a 5 % reduction in the cereals intervention price to € 95. 30 /tonnee from 2004 / 05; the abolition of seasonal corrections; and the end of intervention for rye. Area payments will be increased from € 63 to € 66 /tonne with these payments being included in the single farm payment. For protein crops the current support payment will be maintained and converted into a crop specific area payment of € 55. 57 /ha. For rice a one-step reduction in the intervention price by 50 % to an effective support price of € 150 /tonne, in line with world prices, is proposed, with direct aid being increased from € 52 /tonnee to € 177 /tonne. € 102 of this will be part of the single-farm payment, paid on the basis of historical rights, while € 75 /tonne multiplied by a specified yield will be paid as crop-specific aid. A private storage scheme will be introduced, to be triggered when the market price falls below the effective support price. In addition special measures will be triggered when market prices fall below € 120 /tonne. Proposals are also put forward for durum wheat, dairy products, starch, potatoes, dried fodder, seeds and nuts. Against this background a single farm payment will replace most of the premia under different common organisations of the market. This will cover arable crops, beef and veal, milk and dairy, sheep and goats, starch potatoes, grain legumes, rice, seeds, dried fodder. As the Commission explains it 'this single farm payment will be broken down into <b>payment</b> <b>entitlements</b> in order to facilitate their transfer. Each entitlement will be calculated by dividing the reference amount by the number of hectares, which gave rise to this amount in the reference years'. The new payment system will be linked to cross compliance with EU standards in the fields of environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Accompanying these measures the EU will strengthen the rural-development pillar of the CAP. Comment: The development of the most immediate significance to the ACP concerns the rice sector, where the reduction in the EU price is likely to lead to dramatic income losses for Guyana and Surinam. According to the FAPRI study (see last edition) rice-sector reform will also lead to a 20 % expansion in EU rice production, despite an estimated 41 % decline in the EU market price of rice. With such an increase in production, EU exports are likely to rise substantially. These predicted developments sit uneasily with the European Commission's assertion that reform will reduce export availability. The sustainability of the European Model of Agriculture will be achieved by reducing the attractiveness of the EU market to below that of the world market, thereby doing away with the need for both tariff protection and export refunds. It should be noted that when the European Commission asserts a reduction in production as a result of reform, this is in comparison with production levels which would have been attained without the introduction of reform and is not with reference to current production levels. With reference to current production levels, The FAPRI study suggests that post reform production levels will be higher in all major products except barley and beef. It should be borne in mind that with the budgetary ceiling fixed, further reform is likely to be more difficult to secure agreement on, since new expenditures will need to be financed from saving elsewhere in the CAP budget. This will require hard negotiations in the EU Council and this could well slow down the pace of reform, particularly if the US$/euro exchange rate makes export refunds more expensive.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer the {{research}} question: is the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees in Australia consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice? The analysis of the research question comprises two components: first, the allocation of resources to insolvent company employees that is required by Rawlsian distributive justice and second, whether Australian law is consistent with that allocation. This thesis focuses on four particular areas of Australian law: the priority regime that is applicable when an insolvent company’s assets are distributed to creditors, director and related company liability for employee entitlements, the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and the procedure for corporate and business rescue contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Employees are among the least advantaged persons {{in the event of}} corporate insolvency. According to Rawlsian distributive justice, resources must therefore be reallocated to ensure greater equality between employees and other persons ‘affected’ by corporate insolvency, including secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors, consumers, shareholders, insolvency practitioners, directors and taxpayers. However, Rawls’s ‘difference principle’ permits inequalities between employees and other persons affected by corporate insolvency if those inequalities contribute to achieving the greatest benefit of employees, for example as a result of job maintenance or the <b>payment</b> of employee <b>entitlements.</b> The priority regime is broadly consistent with the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of the least advantaged employees. Although employee entitlements receive only partial priority over the claims of secured creditors and are subordinated to the claims of quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners, the better prospects of secured creditors, quasi-secured creditors and insolvency practitioners satisfy Rawls’s difference principle because they are likely to preserve employment and the <b>payment</b> of employee <b>entitlements</b> in the ordinary course of business, thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Director and related company liability for employee entitlements is likely to be beneficial for employees only in circumstances where directors and related companies engage in improper behaviour in relation to the <b>payment</b> of <b>entitlements.</b> Liability outside those circumstances is likely to jeopardise employment and the <b>payment</b> of employee <b>entitlements.</b> However, existing Australian law does not adequately provide for director and related company liability in circumstances of improper behaviour. Amendments to director and related company liability for employee entitlements in Part 5. 8 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), including the replacement of the test of subjective intention with an objective test, are likely to contribute to the greatest benefit of employees, thus ensuring greater consistency with the Rawlsian framework. In certain respects, GEERS is consistent with Rawlsian distributive justice. For example, GEERS reduces inequalities between employees and taxpayers; operates in conjunction with the employee priority regime and director and related company for employee entitlements, thus facilitating the equal sharing of resources among claimants; and effectively differentiates between the relative levels of disadvantage faced by individual employees in the event of corporate insolvency. However, the limitation of GEERS to liquidation and the restriction on claimable wages pursuant to GEERS compromise the Rawlsian objective of ensuring the greatest benefit of employees. The corporate and business rescue procedure contained in Part 5. 3 A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) facilitates sustained employment and the preservation of employee entitlements, thus contributing to the greatest benefit of employees. Additionally, Part 5. 3 A does not encourage ‘hopeless’ rescue attempts and does not override the interests of secured and quasi-secured creditors, thus avoiding outcomes that may otherwise compromise the greatest benefit of employees. However, the ability of substantial charge holders to remain outside a Part 5. 3 A corporate or business rescue attempt is likely to adversely affect the interests of employees, thus implementing greater protection for secured creditors than is required to satisfy Rawls’s difference principle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of tradable and non-tradable single farm <b>payment</b> (SFP) <b>entitlements</b> for farm successors on structural change and the lease market. Using the example of Swiss agriculture, the effects on rental-price trends and farm-exit rates are investigated. An ex-ante normative impact analysis is performed with the agent-based agricultural-sector model SWISSland, which simulates structural change processes and income trends in Swiss agriculture {{over a period of}} up to 15 years. A land market implemented at municipality level simulates the plot-by-plot leasing of land to surrounding neighbouring agents that is common in Switzerland. Allocation of plots to tenants as well as lease pricing is modelled taking into account the farm-specific land rents. The results show that personalised SFP entitlements which could not be transferred to a farm successor not only cause an intensification of structural change, but would also thus lead to a substantial reduction in rental prices. SFP entitlements which were successfully transferred to farm successors have only a slight impact on structural change and the rental prices of arable land. Only for grassland in the mountain region does a stronger shift result in a significant reduction in rental prices...|$|R
40|$|Little {{work has}} {{considered}} explicitly {{the role of}} farm tenancy in influencing the uptake (or not) of diversification activities. The need to examine this link has been heightened because of the 2003 CAP reforms and the decision to tie Single Farm <b>Payment</b> (SFP) <b>entitlement</b> to the land rather than what is produced on that land. The main objective of this paper, therefore, {{is to examine the}} nature of diversification activities on tenant farms in England, which includes a consideration of how the introduction of the SFP and other CAP reforms may influence such restructuring processes. Results from a national postal survey, supported by tenant farmer/landlord interviews and a workshop, reveal high rates of farm diversification on farms with tenanted land. However, if one takes away contract/hire services the rate of diversification on tenant farms is much less. Tenant farms appear to favour more ‘traditional’ diversification activities and the results also demonstrate an increasing need to move towards more ‘encultured’ definitions of farm diversification. The second key finding to emerge from the research relates to the high levels of uncertainty and negativity surrounding the potential impacts of the CAP reforms, and SFP in particular, on farm business behaviour. Tenant farmers were more concerned about levels of SFP and entitlement than future investment decisions, including diversification...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe JUMPS/MMS system was {{implemented by the}} Marine Corps in 1973. The performance of JUMPS/MMS is considered unsatisfactory because the time delays in entering information into the system result in computed amounts that {{do not reflect the}} individual Marine's current entitlements. Since the Marine Corps considers <b>payment</b> of all <b>entitlements</b> to date as important to morale, the use of the current JUMPS/MMS system necessitates the parallel operation of the old manual system. This thesis explores the use of On-Line Real-Time systems {{to solve the problem of}} time delays and allow the phasing out of the manual system. The study particularly investigates internal controls in manual and On-Line Real-Time systems. The study concludes that an OLRT system would serve to reduce time delays, and that ADPE-FMF equipment could serve as the vehicle for implementing an OLRT system.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of <b>payment</b> responsibilities and <b>entitlements</b> resulting from these responsibilities to benefits for employees and self-employed persons in the long term period. The main aim of this thesis is to determine the overall net position of a model employee and self-employed person towards public budgets. The thesis is divided into two parts, theoretical and practical one. In the theoretical part there are analyzed tax burden of model subjects and their benefits arising from participation in the subsystems of the social security. In the beginning of the practical part there are determined assumptions of the model. Based on the assumptions a comparison of tax burden and received benefits of model subjects has been made and consequently the net position of the model subjects in the researched subsystem has been calculated. The last subchapter of practical part summarizes the total net position of model employee and self-employed person towards public budgets...|$|R
