50|$|Developable bottom antireflective {{coatings}} (DBARC) {{and bottom}} antireflectant coatings (BARCs) {{are made of}} cross-linkable polymers that can minimize back-reflection of light {{during the process of}} etching the wafer surface. The technology is based on polystyrene derivatives that effectively absorb light at the wavelengths used in the <b>photomasking</b> technology. DBARC technology places the anti-reflective coating on the substrate and removes it from the substrate as the novolak resin is dissolved off after photoimaging.By creating polymers that are easy to remove once the pattern transfer step is finished, damage to the pattern and unevenness in the resist film thickness are minimized, improving electrical performance and reducing waste. The DBARC and BARC processes afford similar control of substrate reflectivity, but the DBARC process also offers process simplification by eliminating the need for a BARC open etch step.|$|E
50|$|The thiol-ene {{functionalization}} {{of surface}} has widespread applications in material science and biotechnology. The attachment of a molecule with a sterically accessible alkene or thiol group to a solid surface enables {{the construction of}} polymers on the surface through subsequent thiol-ene reactions. Given that in aqueous solutions thiol-ene reactions can be initiated by UV light (λ = 365-405 nm), the attachment of a given functional group to the exposed thiol or alkene can be controlled spatially through <b>photomasking.</b> More specifically, a photomask, enables the selective exposure of a surface to a UV light source, controlling {{the location of a}} given thiol-ene reaction, whereas the identity of the attached molecule is determined by the composition of the aqueous phase placed above the surface at the time of UV exposure. Thus, the manipulation of the shape of the photomask and the composition of the aqueous layer results in the creation of heterogeneous surface, whose properties depend on identity of the attached molecule at a given location.|$|E
50|$|Printed {{circuit board}} milling (also: {{isolation}} milling) {{is the process}} of removing areas of copper from a sheet of printed circuit board material to recreate the pads, signal traces and structures according to patterns from a digital circuit board plan known as a layout file. Similar to the more common and well known chemical PCB etch process, the PCB milling process is subtractive: material is removed to create the electrical isolation and ground planes required. However, unlike the chemical etch process, PCB milling is typically a non-chemical process and as such it can be completed in a typical office or lab environment without exposure to hazardous chemicals. High quality circuit boards can be produced using either process. In the case of PCB milling, the quality of a circuit board is chiefly determined by the system's true, or weighted, milling accuracy and control as well as the condition (sharpness, temper) of the milling bits and their respective feed/rotational speeds. By contrast, in the chemical etch process, the quality of a circuit board depends on the accuracy and/or quality of the <b>photomasking</b> and the state of the etching chemicals.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{two-phase}} nanolayered composites (also {{referred to}} as nanolaminated or nanoscale multilayers) with individual layer thicknesses varying from 200 –– 300 nm down to 1 – 2 nm {{have been the subject}} of intensive study because of their unusual physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. For instance, with decreasing layer thicknesses (down to nanometer length scales), the mechanical response of these nanocomposites becomes increasingly interface dominated, and they exhibit ultrahigh strengths approaching the theoretical limit for ideal crystals. Moreover, if the constituent phases present large differences in strength, elastic modulus, and ductility, these multilayers give rise to new possibilities for the deformation mechanisms and properties of the composite as a whole. In this study we explore the possibility of synthesizing multilayered composites where one constituent phase has a low ductility, with a final goal of enhancing both the strength and ductility of the system. Using physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques we synthesized two multilayered systems: a metal–ceramic Cu–TiN nanocomposite (where the ceramic is the brittle phase) and a hitherto unstudied hexagonal close-packed (HCP) – body-centered cubic (BCC) Mg–Nb system (where twinning in Mg leads to its lack of ductility), over a range of layer thicknesses ranging from 5 nm to 200 nm. Testing of such miniaturized systems poses significant challenges. We demonstrate the utility of both nanoindentation and compression testing of micropillars containing these multilayered nanocomposites to evaluate their deformation mechanisms. We utilize a novel lithographic polymer <b>photomasking</b> technique during the PVD synthesis of these multilayers to enable faster fabrication of the micropillars using focused ion beam technique. Micropillars were fabricated for three different orientations, with the interfaces oriented normal, parallel, and oblique (45 °) to the compression axis, to explore the anisotropy in the mechanical response of the multilayer system. In the metal–ceramic system compression tests normal and parallel to the interface allow a complete understanding of the co-deformation response of the ceramic with its metallic counterpart, which is critical to the ductility of the system. The tests with the interfaces loaded obliquely provide a unique measure of interfacial shear strength. For the HCP–BCC system, these three orientations allow a detailed exploration of the propensity for twin formations in Mg as a function of their interface orientation. These results are compared for varying layer thicknesses and the results analyzed using the concepts of dislocation motion and interactions within the confined nanoscale layers...|$|E
40|$|The {{inorganic}} {{antireflection coating}} (AR 3 -chromium oxide) commonly used on <b>photomask</b> blanks {{was designed to}} minimize flare in h-line (405 nm) lithography steppers. The reflection of light (flare) off this coating (air-photomask) increases with shorter exposure wavelengths. High levels of flare occur in 248 nm and 193 nm IC steppers due to reflections off of the <b>photomask</b> surface. The reflections (standing waves) in <b>photomask</b> resists also increase during exposure using lower wavelengths of light. Lithography simulations and <b>photomask</b> manufacturing trials have led to resist processes that can generate sub- 0. 30 micron resist features on <b>photomasks</b> with I-line optical pattern generators (ALTA 3500). Lower developer concentration, higher exposure doses and the minimization of standing waves by incorporating a post-exposure bake and / or organic antireflection coatings (ARC) maximizes resolution. High resolution photoresists show standing waves on <b>photomasks</b> fabricated with optical pattern generators. Low contrast resist processes show only small standing waves or in certain cases resist “footing. ” The use of organic antireflection coatings can minimize standing waves and allow the use of high contrast resist processes. ARCs reduce the swing ratio, which improves linewidth uniformity. ARCs also improve the adhesion of the resist to the <b>photomask</b> surface. Simulations reveal that the optimal ARC coating thickness is around 46 nm for typical I-line systems and around 50 nm for 257 nm non-chemically amplified <b>photomask</b> resists.

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) microstructures is of increasing importance in the miniaturization of mechanical or fluidic devices, optical elements, self-assembling components, and tissue-engineering scaffolds, among others. Traditional photolithography, {{the most widely used}} process for microdevice fabrication, is ill-suited for 3 D fabrication, because {{it is based on the}} illumination of a photosensitive layer through a “photomask” (a transparent plate that contains opaque, unalterable solid-state features), which inevitably results in features of uniform height.
