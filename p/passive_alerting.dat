40|$|This report {{describes}} both {{a general}} methodology and some specific examples of passive radio receivers. A passive radio receiver uses no direct electrical power but makes sole {{use of the}} power available in the radio spectrum. These radio receivers are suitable as low data-rate receivers or <b>passive</b> <b>alerting</b> devices for standard, high power radio receivers. Some zero-power radio architectures exhibit significant improvements in range {{with the addition of}} very low power amplifiers or signal processing electronics. These ultra-low power radios are also discussed and compared to the purely zero-power approaches...|$|E

40|$|AbstractClinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are {{considered}} essential tools of evidence-based medicine. These systems provide physicians, caregivers and also patients with clinical knowledge needed and patient or disease specific {{information to help}} them make effective decisions that would enhance patient care and improve clinical outcomes. The lack of well-described success factors is the main challenge facing design, {{development and implementation of}} CDSS. We need {{to learn more about the}} factors that can help in increasing usability and acceptance. The medical informatics department at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia worked on identifying and describing best strategies and requirements for success of CDSS building a detailed plan for development and implementation. The explored recommendations were categorized into ten main topics that should be addressed. These include the right content of CDSS, delivering valid and reliable information, delivering simple messages, providing users with references, saving users’ time, integrating with clinical workflow, improving system response and speed, adopting active and <b>passive</b> <b>alert</b> mechanisms, integrating with other hospital information systems (HIS) and proper management of CDSS knowledge...|$|R
30|$|Collection {{elements}} {{are divided into}} two groups: passive and active. <b>Passive</b> elements gather <b>alerts</b> by the simple observation of evidences, events or element states. Examples of passive collection are the parsing of systems logs or the receival of SNMP traps. Active elements, on the other hand, interact with the managed objects in order to sinthetize alerts. Examples are ICMP probes or SNMP pollers.|$|R
40|$|It’s {{five years}} since Canberra’s {{innovative}} Alexander Maconochie Centre admitted its first group of prisoners. Is the facility living up to its aim of being Australia’s first “human rights compliant” prison? MEMBERS of the visiting media pack are lined up in the reception area of the Alexander Maconochie Centre {{to be subjected to}} a sniff check by the K 9 security unit. I resist the urge to pat the attractive tan-and-white dog as it makes a first pass at our shoes. Our mobile phones, wallets and other possessions are secured in lockers, and an officer in blue overalls has warned us that it is a serious offence to take any banned items into the prison. As the PAD (<b>Passive</b> <b>Alert</b> Detection) dog makes another sweep, this time lifting up its nose to sniff our pockets, a woman in front of me is struggling with the IrisAccess™ 4000, a wall-mounted scanner used to capture an image of her eyes. The eye scan is a prerequisite for first-time entry into the prison and, in theory at least, reduces the time needed for security checks on subsequent visits. “Try standing back a bit further,” the officer on the reception desk suggests. Thankfully, we journalists are not required to submit to this process; as the happy pooch makes its third and final pass of the media pack, the scanner, the visitor and the officer are still struggling to capture a satisfactory image. “No, sorry, try again. This time it doesn’t like the angle of your head…” Read the full articl...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{intensive}} care environments, technology is omnipresent whereby ensuring constant monitoring {{and the administration}} of critical drugs to unstable patients. A {{clinical decision support system}} (CDSS), with its widespread possibilities, can be a valuable tool in supporting adequate patient care. However, it is still unclear how decision support alerts should be presented to physicians and other medical staff to ensure that they are used most effectively. Objective: To determine the effect of four different alert presentation methods on alert compliance after the implementation of an advanced CDSS on the {{intensive care}} unit (ICU) in our hospital. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was executed from August 2010 till December 2011, which included all patients admitted to the ICU of our hospital. The CDSS applied contained a set of thirteen locally developed clinical rules. The percentage of alert compliance was compared for four alert presentation methods: pharmacy intervention, physician alert list, electronic health record (EHR) section and pop-up alerts. Additionally, surveys were held to determine the method most preferred by users of the CDSS. Results: In the study period, the CDSS generated 902 unique alerts, primarily due to drug dosing during decreased renal function and potassium disturbances. Alert compliance was highest for recommendations offered in pop-up alerts (41 %, n = 68 / 166), followed by pharmacy intervention (33 %, n = 80 / 244), the physician alert list (20 %, n = 40 / 199) and the EHR section (19 %, n = 55 / 293). The method most preferred by clinicians was pharmacy intervention, and pop-up alerts were found suitable as well if applied correctly. The physician alert list and EHR section were not considered suitable for CDSSs in the process of this study. Conclusion: The alert presentation method used for CDSSs is crucial for the compliance with alerts for the clinical rules and, consequently, for the efficacy of these systems. Active alerts such as pop-ups and pharmacy intervention were more effective than <b>passive</b> <b>alerts,</b> which do not automatically appear within the clinical workflow. In this pilot study, ICU clinicians also preferred pharmacy intervention and pop-up alerts. More research is required to expand these results to other departments and other hospitals, as well as to other types of CDSSs and different alert presentation methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

5000|$|Bumblebees (Bombus spp.), {{like the}} {{honeybee}} (Apis spp.) collect nectar and pollen from flowers and store them for food. Many individuals must be recruited to forage for food {{to provide the}} hive. Some bee species have highly developed ways of communicating with each other about the location and quality of food resources ranging from physical to chemical displays. Honey bees {{are known for their}} specialized dances, such as the waggle dance which recruit other bees to the precise location of the food source. Bumblebees are not capable of transmitting this type of detailed information. Instead, the nest serves as a hub where bees receive information about the foraging bouts of her conspecifics. Differences between the communication methods of honeybees and bumblebees are mainly due to differences in colony size and nest structure. [...] Bumblebees are distinct from honeybees because they lack receiver bees (bees in the nest which receive pollen and nectar from incoming foragers during unloading) and are not capable of trophallaxis (the transfer of nectar from one bee to another). They deposit collected nectar directly into the honey pots and don’t share information {{of the quality of the}} resource with other bees through nectar transfer. Another bee may sample the nectar brought into the nest, and if the colony is in need of food or the nectar is high quality she will likely go out foraging herself. Other means of <b>alerting</b> <b>passive</b> bees to a potentially rewarding resource include releasing pheromone signals and increasing physical activity. For information on communication methods in Honey Bees see Bee learning and communication.|$|R
40|$|Delay to {{antibiotic}} {{treatment of}} community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) greater than 4 hours following hospital admission {{is associated with}} a 15 % increase in mortality. Paper-based guidelines have been widely introduced to improve CAP care, but these interventions have under-performed due to poor compliance in complex clinical workflows. Unlike <b>passive</b> paper-based guidelines, <b>alerting</b> systems based on computer-based decision support systems (CDSS) have the capacity to actively draw attention to delayed clinical processes. Formal consideration of local workflow is key to the design and successful implementation of CDSS. I used workflow analysis techniques to develop an evidence-based alerting system designed to reduce the delay to treatment of CAP in the emergency department (ED) of an Australian tertiary hospital. A sample of 6 CAP patients were observed during October 2001 to derive a structural process flow model, which was refined via stakeholder interview. A deterministic process flow model was then developed using an existing retrospectively compiled CAP database, consisting of 246 patients admitted June-December 1998 and 146 patients admitted May-December 2000. A stratified control sample presenting with respiratory symptoms (n= 74, January-December 2003) was collected for the assessment of diagnosis and chest x-ray (CXR) accuracy. Treatment delay greater than 4 hours was associated with failure to diagnose CAP in the ED, the absence of CXR evidence, low triage score, delayed CXR, and failure to treat in the ED. ED physicians only identified 54 - 57 % of those discharged with CAP. Radiologists only reported CAP features in 47 % - 67 % of initial CXRs for these patients. I hypothesised that a CDSS-based alerting system, composed of a CAP early diagnosis model (EDM) and a simple risk model (CRB- 65), would identify enough CAP patients to reduce the percentage treated after 4 hours. I constructed an evidence-based naïve Bayesian EDM (sensitivity = 36 %, specificity = 93 %). It was able to identify 24 % of CAP patients that died in hospital, 38 % of those with antibiotics delayed greater than 4 hours, and 26 % of those with CXR delayed greater than 4 hours. CAP-specific risk models were equivalent to the Australasian Triage Score (ATS) in predicting mortality. I simulated alerting policy by combining the CDSS with the deterministic process flow model. Alerting for treatment at triage or initial physician assessment, when the EDM was positive, approximately halved the median treatment time of 5. 53 hours, and decreased the number treated after 4 hours (62 %) by 1 / 3. Treating EDM-positive patients as ATS category 2 produced a similar effect. Current triage practices, embodied mainly by the disease-independent, sign and symptom based ATS are too coarse to deal with conditions such as CAP, where there is high diagnostic uncertainty and delays in diagnosis and treatment are critical determinants of outcomes. Better outcomes may be achieved with quicker diagnostic and treatment workflows via: analysis of current diagnosis and treatment workflows, analysis and correlation of a comprehensive set of patient symptoms, signs and risk factors for the specific disease, and improving triaging and subsequent workflow through a disease-specific CDSS based on early diagnostic models derived from the previous analyses.
