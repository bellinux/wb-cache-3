After a brief talk with the audience, the singer began a performance of the song, jumping into a triangular cage which was wheeled around by her dancers across the stage. A <b>parallel</b> <b>bar</b> then dropped out of the ceiling, and Spears performed [...] choreography similar to the choreography in song's music video. For Billboards Keith Caulfield, the song [...] "served as the sexiest jungle gym in Vegas, as Spears and her dancers undulated their way across and around the bar". Girls' Generation member Sunny performed a cover version of the song during the Girls' Generation Tour that took place in 2011 and 2012. A studio version was also released online alongside the live version featuring on the tour album.|$|E
