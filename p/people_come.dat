5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that <b>people</b> <b>come</b> into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry about it, because it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E
5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if <b>people</b> <b>come</b> close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{rumination}} in {{otherwise healthy}} adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in the}} 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise. While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more <b>people</b> <b>come</b> forward with their symptoms, awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited.|$|E

5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the <b>people</b> <b>come</b> together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|When Queen Beatrix succeeded {{her mother}} Juliana on the latter's abdication on 30 April 1980, the new queen {{decided to keep}} the holiday on 30 April {{as a tribute to}} her mother. (If 30 April fell on a Sunday, Koninginnedag was {{observed}} the previous day—this occurred most recently in 2006.) The reason was practical as well—Beatrix's actual birthday on 31 January would have been less conducive to the traditional outdoor activities. Rather than remaining at the palace and letting the Dutch <b>people</b> <b>come</b> to her, Beatrix instead usually visited two towns each year for Koninginnedag celebrations. Local crafts and customs were demonstrated for the royal family, who had the opportunity to join in.|$|E
