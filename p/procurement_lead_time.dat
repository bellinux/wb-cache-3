Certain customers place a high premium on shorter order lead times, while {{others may be}} willing to trade a longer lead time for a lower price. This paper studies a problem in which a supplier wishes to determine the best positioning of a product with respect to order lead time and price. We consider a continuous review inventory replenishment system, where the difference between the <b>procurement</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> and promised sales order lead time influences both cycle stock and safety stock costs, and procurement costs may increase as a result of investment in <b>procurement</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> reduction. We provide models and methods for determining the best combination of price and sales lead time for systems with high economies of scale when demand depends on both sales lead time and price. Our results indicate that for a broad range of practical settings, such systems employ a pure make-to-stock policy or a policy that sets sales lead time equal to the <b>procurement</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> at optimality.

40|$|We {{consider}} a problem faced by a contract assembler that both assembles finished goods and procures the associated component parts {{for one of}} its major customers. Because of rapid changes in technology and ongoing engineering changes, all parts subject to obsolescence are purchased only for the current customer order.

Moreover, although the order for the finished product has a defined due date, the contract allows the customer to change the order quantity. Consequently, the assembler also faces a random demand. The assembler must determine how much to order and when to order each component part. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, including the cost of holding components prior to their assembly, penalties for tardiness visa-vis the assembly due date, and overage and underage costs in satisfying the demand quantity. We present some structural results and discuss insights regarding optimal policies. We also present several simple heuristic policies and compare them to optimal policies.

In this regard, the present paper focuses on a single-level multi-component inventory control problem for the assembly systems replenishment under stochastic component <b>procurement</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> In order {{to be closer to}} the common assumption of MRP software tools, the case of discrete distributions of component <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> is considered, these latter being thus expressed as a number of periods. Since the finished product is assembled by using several types of component at the same time, the assembly process is stopped even if only a type of component is delayed. The assembly stopping forced by a components delay or stock-out is penalised by backlogging costs. Hence, the problem objective aims to minimize the total cost composed of holding and backlog ones. To address this problem, a joint chance constrained model is proposed and solved via an equivalent linear reformulation, the special structure of which is also deeply discussed. Apart from the effectiveness of the provided equivalent linear reformulation, the practical advantage of the proposed approach resides in its release from backlogging costs, which are often difficult to be quantified in real-life industrial applications...|$|R

40|$|A pragmatic {{approach}} is taken at analyzing and improving Sales and Operations Planning {{in a project}} based, engineer-to-order product line. Variability of product and components configurations and long lead times of the sales process and of material procurement during project execution place additional planning challenges in comparison with a standardized high volume product business. The study focuses on improving the visibility on future customer orders and on reducing the <b>procurement</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> of project material. Due {{to the nature of}} the market and the customers of the studied product line, incoming orders timing is very uncertain when viewed on a project by project basis. However, there is a specific dynamic when the sales pipeline is analyzed on aggregate: Tenders that end up converting into a customer order will do so sooner rather than later. Historical data and observations are used to develop and propose a probabilistic model that connects today's open tenders to the expected new business out of those tenders. The organization is able to use this model to estimate what the current activity of the sales force can produce in terms of new business. The expected benefit is that the organization can act proactively if there is an expected reduction in incoming business from a specific region or major customer; it can also make targeted efforts to increase sales activity towards that region or customer. To increase its competitiveness when bidding for new projects, the organization has embarked on an effort to reduce the overall project execution lead time. A significant portion of this lead time is waiting time for project specific material (which comprises the biggest part of the BOM in money terms). A supplier flexibility scheme is proposed, under which a material order is placed in two phases: first the desired delivery time and the component rough specification are specified, and later on the exact specs are given to the supplier. An optimization model that utilizes the above concept is developed and offers the organization an optimal way to plan the project material procurement, given a desired reduction in <b>procurement</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time.</b> The expected benefit is that there is a justified and optimal method to reduce procurement time without building excessive material stock; it also sheds light to the "constraints" (specific materials or suppliers) that need to be lifted for further lead time reduction. by Andreas Christogiannis.
