50|$|Tablet {{formulations}} {{are designed}} and tested using a laboratory machine called a Tablet Compaction Simulator or Powder Compaction Simulator. This {{is a computer}} controlled device that can measure the <b>punch</b> <b>positions,</b> <b>punch</b> pressures, friction forces, die wall pressures, and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event. Numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation.Mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production tablet press. Initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce, and using a Compaction Simulator reduces the amount of powder required for product development.|$|R
40|$|Sheet Incremental Forming (IF) is a forming {{technology}} {{which consists}} of a sheet clamped along its edges by a suitable blank-holder while an hemispherical head punch is moved along a defined path and locally deforms the sheet. To improve the part geometrical accuracy, a die (which can be positive or negative) is placed behind the sheet {{with respect to the}} <b>punch</b> <b>position.</b> In this case, the process is called Two Point Incremental Forming (TPIF). In the present paper TPIF with positive die was studied through an experimental tests campaign using deep drawing steel sheets. The die geometry used in this research was chosen so to be representative of the process and it was tested using different tool paths. Forming forces were measured using self designed instrumented punch and table while the final workpiece geometry was detected using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The collected data allowed to study the effects of the different tool paths on the maximum forming forces, the geometry errors, the maximum reachable wall angle and the drawing depth during forming and after springback. The results were also compared with a previously performed experimental campaign where similar tests with negative die were conducted...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Multi-point forming (MPF) is an {{advanced}} flexible manufacturing technology for three-dimensional sheet metal forming. The substance of MPF is replacing the conventional solid dies {{by a set}} of discrete punches called ‘‘punch group’’. Because the reconfigurable discrete punches are used, part manufacturing costs are reduced and manufacturing time is shortened. However due to the discrete contacts between the workpiece and punches, the dimple defects occurred, which are inevitable and particular for MPF. For thick plate, the surface defect is the mainly dimple defect during its MPF process. In this study, elastic cushion was proposed to prevent these surface defects. The dynamic explicit finite element method was chosen to implement the simulation of MPF process. The Hill’s anisotropic yield criterion was used to describe the workpiece material behavior, and the elastic cushion was described with using the hyperelastic material model. The method to determine each <b>punch</b> <b>position</b> to construct forming surface was introduced. The MPF process with and without using elastic cushion was simulated to study the effect of the elastic cushion on preventing the surface defects. The relevant experiment was implemented, and it verified that the elastic cushion is effective method to suppress the surface defects during the thick plate MPF process. 1...|$|E
40|$|Dried {{blood spot}} (DBS) {{sampling}} and quantitative analyses of many current therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) -guided drugs are advantageous {{because of the}} minimal invasive sampling strategy. Here, a fast and robust LC-MS/MS method was developed and analytically validated for simultaneous determination of venlafaxine (VEN) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) in DBS. Six-millimeter circles were punched out from DBS collected on Whatman DMPK-C paper, and the DBS was extracted with acetonitrile/methanol at 1 : 3. The total run time was 4. 8 min. The assay was linear {{in the range of}} 20 - 1, 000 μg/L for both VEN and ODV. Assay accuracy and precision was well within limits of acceptance (LLOQ[*]=[*] 20 μg/L). Normal hematocrit concentrations (0. 30 - 0. 50) did not influence the results neither did a normal spot volume (40 - 80 μL). <b>Punch</b> <b>position</b> at the perimeter instead of the center of the blood spot gave a bias ranging from 2. 4 to 10. 4 %. Correlation between plasma and spiked DBS samples was high. The concentrations found in spiked DBS samples were higher than those in plasma, indicating that a conversion factor for translation of DBS to plasma values is needed. This analytically validated method is suitable for determination of VEN and ODV in DBS and applicable for TDM. The method will be used for TDM of VEN in the Dutch CYSCE multicenter trial (NCT 01778907) ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of Tricyclic Antidepressants (TADs) is {{considered}} useful {{in patients with}} major depressive disorders, since these drugs display large individual differences in clearance and therapeutic windows of these drugs are relatively small. We developed an assay for determination of amitriptyline (AMI), nortriptyline (NOR), imipramine (IMI) desipramine (DESI), clomipramine (CLOM) and desmethylclomipramine (DES-CLOM) in dried blood spots (DBS). Methods: A fast and robust LC-MS/MS method was developed and fully validated for simultaneous determination of AMI/NOR, IMI/DESI, or CLOM/ DES-CLOM in DBS. Nine millimetre circles were punched out from DBS collected on Whatman DMK-C paper and mixed with acetonitril:methanol 1 : 3 containing the internal standard. The extract was analyzed by LC-MS/MS Results: The assay {{was found to be}} linear in the range 20 - 500 mcg/L for all compounds. The Inter-assay variability (VC) and bias values are displayed below: The influence of <b>punch</b> <b>position</b> and blood volume per spot did not influence the results, but a low hematocrit (10 % negative bias for all compounds.

The method will be used to determine NOR in the Dutch CYSCE multicenter trial (ClincialTrail. gov Identifier NCT 01778907) in which the effect of CYP 2 D 6 genotyping combined with TDM on time to reach adequate blood drug levels will be investigated in depressed elderly patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Venlafaxine (VEN) is an {{antidepressant}} which exerts both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. The drug {{is mainly}} metabolized by CYP 2 D 6 to its active metabolite O-desmetylvenlafaxine (ODMV). Due to large interindividual differences in clearance in which genetic variance in CYP 2 D 6 activity {{plays a major}} role, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is considered useful in patients treated with VEN. We developed an assay for combined determination of VEN and ODMV in dried blood spots (DBS). Methods: A fast and robust LC-MS/MS method was developed and fully validated for simultaneous determination of VEN and ODMV in DBS. 9 mm circles were punched out from DBS collected on Whatman DMPK-C paper and mixed with acetonitril:methanol 1 : 3 containing the internal standard. The extract was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Results: The assay {{was found to be}} linear in the range 20 - 1000 mcg/L for both VEN and ODMV. Inter-assay variability at LLQ (20 mcg/L), Low (L, 80 mcg/L), Medium (M, 300 mcg/L) and High (H, 750 mcg/L) levels was 12. 0 %, 6. 1 %, 7. 0 %, and 4. 9 % for VEN and 10. 8 %, 6. 8 %, 5. 4 %, and 6. 3 % respectively for ODMV. Bias at LLQ, L, M and H was 7. 2 %, 1. 3 %, 0. 2 %, and 20. 4 % for VEN and 5. 6 %, 1. 7 %, 0. 4 %, and 0 % for ODMV. The influence of <b>punch</b> <b>position</b> and blood volume per spot did not influence the results, but a low hematocrit (10 % negative bias. Comparison of venous blood samples with DBS samples revealed a linear correlation with a R 2 of > 0. 98 and a DBS/plasma ratio of 1. 11 for VEN and 1. 28 for ODMV. Conclusions: This fully validated method is suitable for determination of VEN and its metabolite ODMV in DBS and applicable for TDM.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1880s Herman Hollerith, {{inspired}} by conductors using holes <b>punched</b> in different <b>positions</b> on a railway ticket to record traveler {{details such as}} gender and approximate age, invented the recording of data on a machine readable medium. Prior uses of machine readable media had been for lists of instructions (not data) to drive programmed machines such as Jacquard looms. [...] "After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on punched cards..." [...] Hollerith used punched cards with round holes, 12 rows and 24 columns. His tabulator used electromechanical relays (and solenoids) to increment mechanical counters. A set of spring-loaded wires were suspended over the card reader. The card sat over pools of mercury, pools corresponding to the possible hole positions in the card. When the wires were pressed onto the card, punched holes allowed wires to dip into the mercury pools, making an electrical contact {{that could be used}} for counting, sorting, and setting off a bell to let the operator know the card had been read. The tabulator had 40 counters, each with a dial divided into 100 divisions, with two indicator hands; one which stepped one unit with each counting pulse, the other which advanced one unit every time the other dial made a complete revolution. This arrangement allowed a count up to 10,000. During a given tabulating run, counters could be assigned a specific hole or, using relay logic, a combination of holes, e.g. to count married females. If the card was to be sorted a compartment lid of the sorting box would open for storage of the card, the choice of compartment depending on the data in the card.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the prognostic significance of S 100 A 4 expression in colorectal cancer and its correlation with expression of E-cadherin and p 53. METHODS: A cohort of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens was selected from 127 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgical resection between April 2000 and March 2004 at the Department of Surgery, Korea University Guro Hospital. The expression of protein S 100 A 4 was evaluated {{according to the}} proportion of positively stained cancer cells. In each case, three core biopsies with a diameter of 2 mm were <b>punched</b> out and <b>positioned</b> in a recipient paraffin array block. Four-μm sections of these tissue array blocks were used for immunohistochemical analysis of protein S 100 A 4, E-cadherin, and p 53. Clinicopathological data {{were based on the}} original histopathologic reports and clinical records of patients. RESULTS: In normal colorectal mucosa, protein S 100 A 4 immunoreactivity was clearly absent in both cytoplasm and nucleus. However, positive immunoreactivity of protein S 100 A 4 was detected in 45 (35. 4 %) of the tumor cases. There was no significant association between positive immunoreactivity of protein S 100 A 4 and clinicopathological parameters such as tumor differentiation or TNM stage, and also no correlation between the reactivity and E-cadherin or p 53 expression. However, positive immunoreactivity of protein S 100 A 4 was found to be associated with tumor recurrence (P = 0. 004), and was also associated with significantly worse overall survival in the Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis (P = 0. 044). After adjustment for tumor differentiation, tumor depth and nodal status, however, it failed to achieve statistical significance (P = 0. 067). CONCLUSION: The expression of protein S 100 A 4 is associated with tumor recurrence and poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer...|$|R
