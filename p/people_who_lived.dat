5|$|Native Americans in {{northern}} California suffered greatly {{at the hands}} of European-Americans in {{the last half of the}} 19th century, and their population decline is often characterized as genocide. The Wiyot <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> around Humboldt Bay, were particularly hard hit. Their population declined from about 1,500-2,000 in 1850 to about 200 in 1860.|$|E

50|$|Table For Two Korea (TFT) is {{a project}} that aims {{to solve the problem}} about {{unbalanced}} food distribution between developed countries and developing countries with one meal. In the world, about one billion <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in developed countries have problem with hyper nutrition and about one billion other <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>live</b> in developing countries are suffering from starvation and malnutrition. TFT suggests one solution to solve these two problems with only one meal.

5|$|The Creoles are a {{community}} with varied non-Anglo ancestry, mostly descendant of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in Louisiana before its purchase by the U.S. The Cajuns are {{a group of}} Francophones who arrived in Louisiana after leaving Acadia in Canada. The city of New Orleans, Louisiana, being a major port, has acted as a melting pot for {{people from all over}} the Caribbean basin. The result is a diverse and syncretic set of styles of Cajun music and Creole music.|$|E
5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves.

5|$|In {{the city}} of Rome, most people lived in {{multistory}} apartment buildings (insulae) that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (thermae), toilets that were flushed with running water (latrinae), conveniently located basins or elaborate fountains (nymphea) delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat—were aimed primarily at the common <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in the insulae. Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, {{and some of the}} best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{also has}} some overlap with archaeology, which {{primarily}} works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists {{are interested in the}} characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site, to discover what the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.|$|E
5|$|The Brezhnev generation— the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> {{and worked}} during the Brezhnev Era— owed their rise to {{prominence}} to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge {{in the late}} 1930s. In the purge, Stalin ordered the execution or exile of nearly all Soviet bureaucrats {{over the age of}} 35, thereby opening up posts and offices for a younger generation of Soviets. This generation would rule the country from the aftermath of Stalin's purge up to Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in 1985. The majority of these appointees were of either peasant or working class origin. Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kosygin, and Brezhnev are prime examples of men appointed in the aftermath of Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|The tablets {{were written}} in Akkadian, and they give {{information}} about the kingdom, its customs, {{and the names of}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> during that time. More than 3000 are letters, the remainder includes administrative, economic, and judicial texts. Almost all the tablets found were dated to the last 50years of Mari's independence (c. 1800 – 1750BC), and most have now been published. The language of the texts is official Akkadian but proper names and hints in syntax show that the common language of Mari's inhabitants was Northwest Semitic.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers were <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> near California {{or people who}} heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|In 1226, Duke Konrad I of Masovia {{invited the}} Teutonic Knights {{to help him}} fight the pagan Baltic Prussian <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in a {{territory}} adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the Old Prussians themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including Northern Crusades sponsored by the papacy. The Teutonic Order soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad (Chełmno Land or Kulmerland). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the Baltic Sea coast and established their own monastic state. As {{virtually all of the}} Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and Lithuania, then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a fief and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E

5|$|Local {{residents}} were evicted, including 1,200 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim {{were brought in}} to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered expulsions of Poles from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy to the General Government. German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Project {{was started}} by Ryô's father, Dr. Shirogane, five years before Tokyo Mew Mew is set. The manga never {{explains}} why the project was started or how they knew about Chimera Animas and the aliens, but Dr. Shirogane does mention that they must learn how to inject animal genes into human DNA in order to fight the aliens. In the anime adaptation, Dr. Shirogane discovered the fossilized remains of an ancient civilization called the Chimera during an archaeological dig and began researching the race of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there with his assistant Keiichirô Akasaka. This would eventually become the Mew Project. A laboratory explosion and a fire that kills Dr. Shirogane and his wife, leaving then 10-year-old Ryô orphaned. He moved back to Japan, with Keiichirô, to continue the Mew Project. According to the anime, the lab explosion {{was caused by a}} Chimera fossil that woke up setting the house on fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{explorer}} Hernán Cortés and his {{men were}} familiar with the book; Cortés quoted it in 1524. As governor of Mexico he sent out an expedition of two ships, one guided by the famous pilot Fortún Ximénez who led a mutiny, killing the expedition's leader, Diego Becerra, and a number of sailors faithful to Becerra. After the mutiny, Ximénez continued sailing north by northwest and, in early 1534, landed at what is known today as La Paz, Baja California Sur. Ximénez, who reported pearls found, believed the land was a large island. He and his escort of sailors were killed by natives when they went ashore for water. The few remaining sailors brought the ship and its story back to Cortés. There is some dispute whether the land was named at this time—no record exists of Ximénez giving it a name. In 1535, Cortés led an expedition back to the land, arriving on May 1, 1535, a day known as Santa Cruz de Mayo, and in keeping with methods of contemporary discoverers, he named it Santa Cruz. It is not known who first named the area California but between 1550 and 1556, the name appears three times in reports about Cortés written by Giovanni Battista Ramusio. However, the name California also appears in a 1542 journal kept by explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who used it casually, as if it were already popular. In 1921, California historian Charles E. Chapman theorized that Ximénez named the new land California but the name was not accepted by Cortés because Ximénez was a mutineer who killed Becerra, a kinsman of Cortés. Despite this, the name became the one used popularly by Spaniards, the only name used by non-Spaniards, and by 1770, the entire Pacific coast controlled by Spain was officially known as California. The Spanish speaking <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>lived</b> there were called Californios.|$|E
