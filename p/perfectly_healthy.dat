40|$|Objective. Pelvic {{lymph node}} metastases {{are the main}} {{prognostic}} factor for survival in early stage cervical cancer, yet accurate detection methods before surgery are lacking. In this study, we examined whether gene expression profiling can predict the presence of lymph node metastasis in early stage squamous cell cervical cancer before treatment. In addition, we examined gene expression in cervical cancer compared to normal cervical tissue. Methods. Tumour samples of 35 patients with early stage cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, 16 with and 19 without lymph node metastasis, were analysed. Also five normal cervical tissues samples were analysed. We investigated differential expression and prediction of patient status for lymph node positive versus lymph node negative tumours and for healthy versus cancer tissue. Classifiers were built by using a multiple validation strategy, enabling the assessment of both classifier accuracy and variability. Results. Five genes (BAAF 1, LARP 7, SCAMP 1, CUEDC 1 and PEBP 1) showed differential expression between tumour samples from patients with and without lymph node metastasis. Mean accuracy of class prediction is 64. 5 % with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 40 - 90 %. For healthy cervical tissue versus early stage cervical cancer, the mean accuracy of class prediction is 99. 5 % (95 % CI of 90 - 100 %). A subset of genes involved in cervical cancer was identified. Conclusion. No accurate class prediction for lymph node status in early stage cervical cancer was obtained. Replication {{studies are needed to}} determine the relevance of the differentially expressed genes according to lymph node status. Early stage cervical cancer can be <b>perfectly</b> differentiated from <b>healthy</b> cervical tissue by means of gene expression profiling. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} role of {{the thyroid}} gland is to ensure the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones whose primary role during embryonic development {{and the maintenance of}} homeostasis after birth is well known. The challenge here is double, as the hormone synthesis depends on both potentially toxic biochemical processes, {{as long as they are}} not fully contained, and the availability of a trace element, iodine, whose uptake may be extremely variable depending on the geographical location and the physiological status of individuals. The squaring of the circle has been resolved by the thyroid gland during its phylogenetic maturation by setting up angiofollicular units, morphological entities whose the perfect functional coherence between the different compartments within them (epithelial, endothelial and interstitial) results from a high level three-dimensional assemblage. This morphological and functional integration warrants adequate supplies of thyroid hormones whose mobilization must be triggered at any time when necessary. This functional requirement finds its expression in the morphological heterogeneity that ultimately culminates in the formation of nodules. Each angiofollicular unit is an individualized entity with its own genotypic and phenotypic asset that runs on the extrinsic control of TSH and a host of autocrine and paracrine factors. But subtle intrinsic mechanisms of self-regulation, operating out of any outside influences, constantly adjust the availability of players involved in the hormonal synthesis (iodine, thyroglobulin) within a biochemical entity (the thyroxisome) that is perfectly suited for this synthesis taking place without prejudice to the thyrocyte. The hormonal synthesis generates oxygen-derived substances as oxidative load or stress, though <b>perfectly</b> controlled in <b>healthy</b> thyrocytes. Any injury related to the nature, the amount, or where in the cell oxygen-derived substances are produced, may lead to morphological and functional breakdowns responsible for various disease processes, including those of autoimmune or even neoplastic nature...|$|R

Introduction: It {{has come to}} be known as a {{universal}} fact that bacteria are present and can live, thrive and grow in almost any climate in which man and animals can live except in the far north. When conditions become unfavorable for their growth they form spores which resist the action of heat and cold to a far greater extent than do bacteria. Bacteria are not found in the blood of the normal healthy animal but how many of our domestic, animals are found to be <b>perfectly</b> sound and <b>healthy.</b> Out of almost every herd of cattle there will be found some animals which are diseased. I mention cattle not because they are the only animals which are subject to the infection of path - genic bacteria, for they are not, all animals are more or less subject to their action, but because cattle are such a universal source of seat for food. It is on account of the fact that people are thrown so at the mercy of ignorant and sometimes even dishonest butchers that they (the people) should be extremely careful from wham they purchase meat d also in the preparation, of the meat for the table. Most people think that by going through a process which is termed cooking bacteria will be killed. But in a majority of cases the meat is not thoroughly cooked and the organisms are not destroyed. Animals may become infected either by inhalation of contaminated air or by ingestion of any fluid or solid containing pathogenic bacteria. A great many people have the mistaken idea that anything which an animal will eat is good enough for them, and consequently all of the kitchen refuse is thrown into a common receptacle and often allowed to collect there for a day or two when it is taken and fed to the animals...|$|R

6000|$|At {{this time}} the doctor was {{approaching}} the house. He was still a good distance away, however. He was a good doctor and a good man, {{and he had a}} good heart, but one had to know him a year to get over hating him, two years to learn to endure him, three to learn to like him, and four and five to learn to love him. It was a slow and trying education, but it paid. He was of great stature; he had a leonine head, a leonine face, a rough voice, and an eye which was sometimes a pirate's and sometimes a woman's, according to the mood. He knew nothing about etiquette, and cared nothing about it; in speech, manner, carriage, and conduct he was the reverse of conventional. He was frank, to the limit; he had opinions on all subjects; they were always on tap and ready for delivery, and he cared not a farthing whether his listener liked them or didn't. Whom he loved he loved, and manifested it; whom he didn't love he hated, and published it from the housetops. In his young days he had been a sailor, and the salt-airs of all the seas blew from him yet. He was a sturdy and loyal Christian, and believed he was the best one in the land, and the only one whose Christianity was <b>perfectly</b> sound, <b>healthy,</b> full-charged with common sense, and had no decayed places in it. People who had an ax to grind, or people who for any reason wanted wanted to get on the soft side of him, called him The Christian--a phrase whose delicate flattery was music to his ears, and whose capital T was such an enchanting and vivid object to him that he could SEE it when it fell out of a person's mouth even in the dark. Many who were fond of him stood on their consciences with both feet and brazenly called him by that large title habitually, because it was a pleasure to them to do anything that would please him; and with eager and cordial malice his extensive and diligently cultivated crop of enemies gilded it, beflowered it, expanded it to [...] "The ONLY Christian." [...] Of these two titles, the latter had the wider currency; the enemy, being greatly in the majority, attended to that. Whatever the doctor believed, he believed with all his heart, and would fight for it whenever he got the chance; and if the intervals between chances grew to be irksomely wide, he would invent ways of shortening them himself. He was severely conscientious, according to his rather independent lights, and whatever he took to be a duty he performed, no matter whether the judgment of the professional moralists agreed with his own or not. At sea, in his young days, he had used profanity freely, but {{as soon as he was}} converted he made a rule, which he rigidly stuck to ever afterward, never to use it except on the rarest occasions, and then only when duty commanded. He had been a hard drinker at sea, but after his conversion he became a firm and outspoken teetotaler, in order to be an example to the young, and from that time forth he seldom drank; never, indeed, except when it seemed to him to be a duty--a condition which sometimes occurred a couple of times a year, but never as many as five times.|$|R
