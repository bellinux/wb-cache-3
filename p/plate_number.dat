Keith is busy with other projects, and Veronica takes it upon herself to follow Jake. Veronica takes photos of him at the Camelot hotel as he meets with an unseen woman after midnight. Once Keith sees the license <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> of the woman's car, he stops the investigation and files the photograph. Puzzled by his actions, Veronica finds the file and learns that Keith has continued his own personal investigation of Lilly's murder. Veronica discovers that the car belongs to her missing mother, Lianne, and begins to investigate the murder herself.|$|E
5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E

25|$|At {{an auction}} of the Green estate in 1944, the unique <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> block of eight stamps was sold for $27,000 to the {{collector}} Amos Eno, who had four stamps removed from it. The reduced block fetched only $18,250 when Eno’s estate was sold off ten years later. By 1971, however, its price {{had risen to}} $150,000. Eventually, in late October 2005 this <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> block of four stamps was purchased by a then-anonymous buyer for $2,970,000. The purchaser was revealed to be U.S. financier Bill Gross. Shortly after purchasing the Inverted Jennys he proceeded to trade them with Donald Sundman, president of the Mystic Stamp Company, a stamp dealer, for {{one of only two}} known examples of the USA 1c Z Grill.

40|$|Now-a-day, the {{importance}} of automatic traffic monitoring has drawn the attention to the intelligent transport systems. A <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> is the unique identification of a vehicle. Automatic <b>Number</b> <b>Plate</b> Recognition (ANPR) is designed to locate and recognize the <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> of a moving vehicle automatically. For Bangladeshi Vehicles there are no fixed rules for <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> like other countries. Because {{of the variety of}} conditions and patterns, the recognition process of <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> for Bangladeshi vehicles is so difficult. We develop a ANPR system which is divided into three part such as <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> Localization, Extraction and Recognition. After successfully complete localization and extraction of <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> we send that portion to a Bangla OCR to fetch the text of the <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> for further processing. In this paper we present a complete ANPR system for Bangladesh Vehicles using standard algorithms with some customization and with our own algorithm for <b>Number</b> <b>Plate</b> extraction which can detect <b>Number</b> <b>Plate</b> region and successfully extract detected region and then able to recognize that <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> text...|$|R

Peaks that are tall, sharp, and relatively narrow indicate that separation method efficiently removed a component from a mixture; high efficiency. Efficiency is very dependent upon the HPLC column and the HPLC method used. Efficiency factor is synonymous with <b>plate</b> <b>number,</b> and the 'number of theoretical plates'.|$|E
