40|$|The {{multi-stage}} Collins-type cryocooler uses {{a floating}} piston {{design for the}} working fluid expansion in each stage. The piston floats between a cold volume, where the working fluid is expanded, and a warm volume. The piston's motion is controlled by opening and closing valves connecting several <b>reservoirs</b> at various <b>pressures</b> to the warm volume. Ideally, these pressures should be distributed between {{the high and low}} system pressure to gain good control of the piston motion. In past prototypes, helium flow through the piston-cylinder gap resulted in a loss of <b>pressure</b> in the <b>reservoirs</b> causing the piston to become immobile. A more complex control algorithm is required to maintain a net zero helium flow through this gap to allow for steady expander operation. A numerical quasi-steady thermodynamic model is developed for the piston cycle. The model determines the steady state pressure distribution of the reservoirs for an ideal expander with no helium flow through the piston-cylinder gap. This pressure distribution is dependent on the total mass of helium in <b>pressure</b> <b>reservoirs</b> as well as the points at which the warm helium intake as well as the cold helium exhaust end.

30|$|The {{assumption}} that at high <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> {{the results from}} compressible and incompressible gas behaviour are similar, {{while there is a}} significant difference for lower <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> is frequently made looking expectable and trivial.

30|$|When the {{incompressible}} gas is considered, its {{density is}} held constant. If the average or maximum <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is used for}} density estimation, the saturation profile depends on {{the distance between the}} production and injection wells. As this distance increments, the maximum and average <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressures</b> raise accordingly. Thus, as the first gas reached the bottom hole of the injection well, the density value for the incompressible case was fixed at the initial <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure.</b> Such approach is also suitable as the <b>reservoir</b> <b>pressure</b> is constant around the production well in accordance with the Buckley–Leverett analytical model.|$|R

50|$|Pumping brakes {{are often}} used where a pump is already part of the machinery.

Pumping brakes can dump energy as heat, or can be regenerative brakes that recharge a <b>pressure</b> <b>reservoir</b> called a hydraulic accumulator.|$|E
40|$|Exploitation of ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> oil <b>reservoirs</b> {{is always}} {{associated}} with numerous risks, challenges, and obstacles. One {{of the most}} pronounced constraints in development of such fields {{is the number of}} wells, which is imposed by massively high cost of drilling. Low number of wells may lead to high pressure isolation regions left after primary production (pressure depletion) of the reservoir. Ultradeep <b>reservoirs</b> with high <b>pressure</b> are more prone to such leftover high pressure isolation regions due to their low permeable characteristic. These high pressure isolation regions can, subsequently, deteriorate the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as the injected fluid cannot access the residual oil in these regions. Therefore, well placement and inter-well spacing optimizations is of greater importance in ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> oil <b>reservoirs</b> to ensure higher ultimate oil recovery at lower costs. Furthermore, due to high cost of development of ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> oil <b>reservoirs,</b> the EOR strategy and commencement time for the selected EOR strategy are very critical. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how optimization of well placement, well spacing, and startup time for miscible CO 2 flooding can enhance the incremental and ultimate oil recoveries in an ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> oil <b>reservoir.</b> To do this, a synthetic grid model was made to run different simulation scenarios on it. The model was initialized with rock and fluid properties within the range of those in the ultradeep, high pressure Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that it mimics an ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> oil <b>reservoir.</b> The obtained results showed that optimization of well placement, well spacing, and commencement time for any EOR strategy such as miscible CO 2 flooding is very critical in the course of making a Field Development Plan (FDP) for an ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> oil <b>reservoir.</b> The results, discussions, and conclusions were finally used by the author to shed light on potential further work on each of the aforementioned challenges in ultradeep, high <b>pressure</b> oil <b>reservoirs</b> such as Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} West Hackberry Tertiary Project is to {{demonstrate}} the technical and economic feasibility of combining air injection with the Double Displacement Process for tertiary oil recovery. The Double Displacement Process is the gas displacement of a water invaded oil column {{for the purpose of}} recovering oil through gravity drainage. The novel aspect of this project is the use of air as the injection fluid. The target reservoirs for the project are in the Oligocene Age sands located on the west and north flanks of West hackberry Field in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. If successful, this project will demonstrate that the use of air injection in the Double Displacement Process can economically recover oil in reservoirs where tertiary oil recovery is presently uneconomic. By the end of the fourth year of Budget period 1, air injection has been under way at West Hackberry since November of 1994 on the west flank and since July of 1996 on the north flank.

50|$|The {{evacuator}} is {{a simple}} passive device. It consists of a ring of holes drilled into the barrel, surrounded by a cylindrical <b>pressure</b> <b>reservoir.</b> As the shell moves down the barrel during firing, it creates a high pressure {{in front of the}} projectile and the evacuator is filled with high pressure air, it reaches a point where the base of the shell passes the set of holes. The high-pressure is then released through these holes. As the shell continues down the barrel the pressure begins to drop, and then suddenly returns to near atmospheric pressure as the shell leaves the barrel. During this process the high-pressure air in the reservoir begins to blow back into the barrel towards the front of the gun tube. By aiming these holes forward, their exhaust causes the pressurized air to be blown forward and out of the barrel extracting fumes from the barrel.|$|E

Certainly, all but possibly Hardenberg, must have seen that it would give more room for optimization than the Street engine did.

40|$|Drilling wells {{throughout}} depleted or low <b>pressure</b> <b>reservoirs</b> requires low density drilling fluids, {{often with}} density less than water. Methods {{to reduce the}} density of drilling fluids have included mixing-in air or nitrogen. However, problems with these approaches include instability of gas bubbles (bubbles collapse or expand) and increased costs. Recently, the use of micro bubbles named aphrons in drilling, completion and workover fluids has proven success in solving many problems related to low <b>pressure</b> <b>reservoirs</b> such as fluid loss control, formation damage, stabilization of multipressure sequences with one fluid and possible differential sticking. Aphrons represent bubble with uniquely structure stabilized with surfactant. Against conventional micro bubbles, aphrons are more stable in downhole conditions and they are generated using standard mixing equipment. Owing to their properties and overpressure in wellbore aphrons penetrate into low pressure layers and set up inner bridging. Depleted wells which are very expensive to drill underbalanced or with other remediation techniques can now be drilled overbalanced.
