5|$|Parts of {{the pain}} {{sensation}} and processing system may not function properly; creating the feeling of pain when no outside cause exists, signaling too much <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> a particular cause, or signaling <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> a normally non-painful event. Additionally, the pain modulation mechanisms may not function properly. These phenomena are involved in chronic pain.|$|E
5|$|Blood is {{supplied}} to the cervix by the descending {{branch of the}} uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. The pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2S3, transmit the sensation of <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> the cervix to the brain. These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior sacrum.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the pulp}} and {{periodontal}} ligament have nociceptors (pain receptors), but the pulp lacks proprioceptors (motion or position receptors) and mechanoreceptors (mechanical pressure receptors). Consequently, pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex {{tends to be}} poorly localized, whereas <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> the periodontal ligament will typically be well localized, although not always.|$|E

5|$|<b>Pain</b> <b>from</b> {{cancer of}} the organs, such as the stomach or liver (visceral pain), is diffuse and {{difficult}} to locate, and {{is often referred to}} more distant, usually superficial, sites. Invasion of soft tissue by a tumor can cause pain by inflammatory or mechanical stimulation of pain sensors, or destruction of mobile structures such as ligaments, tendons and skeletal muscles.|$|E

5|$|Women {{may have}} acute low back <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> medical {{conditions}} affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids. Nearly {{half of all}} pregnant women report pain in the lower back or sacral area during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain.|$|E
5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships. Unless the person has asked for such psychosocial intervention – or at least freely consented to such questioning – {{this would be an}} ethically unjustifiable intrusion into the patient's personal affairs (analogous to providing drugs without the patient's informed consent).|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.|$|E

Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> the sting.|$|E

5|$|Agharta is a 1975 live double album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. By {{the time}} he {{recorded}} the album, Davis was 48 {{years old and had}} alienated many in the jazz community while attracting younger rock audiences with his radical electric fusion music. After experimenting with different line-ups, he established a stable live band in 1973 and toured constantly for the next two years, despite physical <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> worsening health and emotional instability brought on by substance abuse. During a three-week tour of Japan in 1975, the trumpeter performed two concerts at the Festival Hall in Osaka on February 1; the afternoon show produced Agharta and the evening show was released as Pangaea the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E

5|$|Janice Dickinson {{describes}} her early life where she suffered {{child abuse and}} physical abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. She writes that her three sisters and mother also experienced abuse from her father. She recounts her ups and downs during her career while finding success in the fashion industry. She emphasizes how bravery is important to success, and explains how she remained firm on her request for US$20,000 for a modeling position when the market figure at the time was only $5,000. Throughout the process she experiences emotional <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> relationships that lack depth, and learns for herself about the harms of substance dependence. Incidents related to her drug addiction problems include ingesting heroin from Gia Carangi prior to a photography session in Italy, and an experience in a state of alcohol intoxication falling off a fashion runway for Valentino Garavani and landing upon Sophia Loren.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1951, Medical Corpsman Serrano {{was serving}} with the 3rd Battalion, Seventh Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), in Korea. The Battalion came under heavy enemy attack and fearlessly dashed through the heavy enemy fire {{to reach a}} wounded Marine, he accidentally tripped the wire of a hidden anti-personnel mine. Hearing the snap of the fuse primer, and realizing that his wounded comrade lay {{helpless}} beside the deadly explosive, he courageously and with complete disregard for his own personal safety threw himself on the man to shield him from the explosion. Although he was seriously wounded {{in the back and}} legs by fragments, and was blown several feet by the concussion, he crawled back to his comrade and administered first aid to him. Although suffering severe <b>pain</b> <b>from</b> his multiple wounds, he refused to seek medical aid for himself until he had completed treatment of his comrade, and then, refusing a stretcher, crawled part of the way to the aid station.|$|E

Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") left the White House for the hospital.|$|E
