The <b>physical</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and trams are owned by Bybanen AS, a limited company wholly owned by Hordaland County. This company is responsible for maintenance of the right-of-way and the vehicles, and for extensions. Light rail operations are based on contracts granted after public tender competitions held by Skyss, a county agency that administers all public transport in Hordaland, including buses, boats and ferries. From 2010 to 2017, with the possibility for a two-year extension, the line will be operated by Keolis Norge AS. Stadler has the responsibility for maintenance of the trams for the first seven years, as part of the purchase contract.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Physical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are {{a set of}} {{interconnected}} {{structural elements}} whose function is to participate in attracting capital flows {{in order for the}} economy to function efficiently. They transfer capital flows that are able to ensure growth and stability. They also constitute a major challenge for growth and development. We have attempted in this paper to study the influence of <b>physical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and financial development on foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the context of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries by combining two theoretical approaches (the Paradox of Lucas and the external-internal factors), and by integrating the correlation between the components of capital flows. Our regressions show the importance of non-linear effects in the explanation of the determinants of private capital. This analysis also emphasizes the more important role <b>physical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> play in attracting FDIs despite perverse effects...|$|R
