50|$|Classified as a metalloexopeptidase, {{carboxypeptidase}} A {{consists of}} a single polypeptide chain bound to a zinc ion. This characteristic metal ion is located within the active site of the enzyme, along with five amino acid residues {{that are involved in}} substrate binding: Arg-71, Arg-127, Asn-144, Arg-145, Tyr-248, and Glu-270. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed five subsites on the protein. These allosteric sites are involved in creating the ligand-enzyme specificity seen in most bioactive enzymes. One of these subsites induces a conformational change at Tyr-248 upon binding of a substrate molecule at the primary active site. The phenolic hydroxyl of tyrosine forms a hydrogen bond with the terminal carboxylate of the ligand. In addition, a second hydrogen bond is formed between the tyrosine and a <b>peptide</b> <b>linkage</b> of longer peptide substrates. These changes make the bond between the enzyme and ligand, whether it is substrate or inhibitor, much stronger. This property of carboxypeptidase A led to the first clause of Daniel E.

50|$|Affinity tags {{have been}} widely used to purify {{recombinant}} proteins, as they allow the accumulation of recombinant protein with little impurities. However, the affinity tag must be removed by proteases in the final purification step. The extra proteolysis step raises the problems of protease specificity in removing affinity tags from recombinant protein, and the removal of the digestion product. This problem can be avoided by fusing an affinity tag to self-cleavable inteins in a controlled environment. The first generation of expression vectors of this kind used modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae VMA (Sce VMA) intein. Chong et al. used a chitin binding domain (CBD) from Bacillus circulans as an affinity tag, and fused this tag with a modified Sce VMA intein. The modified intein undergoes a self-cleavage reaction at its N-terminal <b>peptide</b> <b>linkage</b> with 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), or cystine at low temperatures over a broad pH range. After expressing the recombinant protein, the cell homogenate is passed through the column containing chitin. This allows the CBD of the chimeric protein to bind to the column. Furthermore, when the temperature is lowered and the molecules described above pass through the column, the chimeric protein undergoes self-splicing and only the target protein is eluted. This novel technique eliminates the need for a proteolysis step, and modified Sce VMA stays in column attached to chitin through CBD.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{the past}} decade, {{numerous}} investigations {{have demonstrated that}} {{the rate at which}} amide hydrogens located at <b>peptide</b> <b>linkages</b> undergo isotopic exchange is a sensitive probe of the high order structure and dynamics of proteins. The present investigation demonstrates that microbore high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) continuous-flow fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) can be used to accurately quantify deuterium located at <b>peptide</b> <b>linkages</b> in short segments of large proteins. This result is important because it demonstrates the feasibility of using mass spectrometry as a tool for studying the high order structure and dynamics of large proteins. Following a period of deuterium exchange-in, a protein was placed into slow-exchange conditions and fragmented into peptides with pepsin. The digest was analyzed by continuous-flow HPLC FABMS to determine the molecular weights of the peptides, from which the number of deuterons located at the <b>peptide</b> <b>linkages</b> could be deduced. The HPLC step was used both to fractionate the peptides according to their hydrophobicities and to remove through back-exchange all deuterium except that located at <b>peptide</b> amide <b>linkages.</b> This approach has been applied to α-crystallin, a lens protein composed of two gene products with monomer molecular weights of 20 kDa and an aggregate molecular weight approaching 1000 kDa. Results from this study show that some of the peptide amide hydrogens in α A-crystallin exchange very rapidly (k > 10 h− 1) while others exchange very slowly (k < 10 − 3 h− 1). The ability not only to detect that a conformational change has occurred, but also to identify the specific regions within the protein where the change occurred, was demonstrated by measuring changes in the exchange rates within these regions as the deuterium exchange-in temperature was increased from 10 to 80 °C...|$|R

40|$|There {{exists a}} linear {{correlation}} between {{the effect of a}} salt on the rate of an enzymic reaction and its effect on the activation volume (delta V++) of the reaction. Salts that increase delta V++ invariably decrease the rate of the reaction, and vice versa. The salt effects on reaction rate are, however, much larger than would be predicted {{solely on the basis of}} pressure-volume work changes deriving from the observed alterations in delta V++. Different inorganic salts affect reaction rates and activation volumes in a manner that reflects the salts' positions in the Hofmeister series. These observations, taken in conjunction with data on the effects of salts on protein functional group (aminoacid side-chains and <b>peptide</b> <b>linkages)</b> hydration, lead us to propose the following hypothesis to account for salt activation and inhibition of catalysis. Aminoacid side-chains and <b>peptide</b> <b>linkages</b> located on or near the protein surface change their exposure to water during conformational events in catalysis. These protein group transfers are accompanied by large volume and energy changes that are due largely to changes in the organization of water around these groups. When these transfer processes occur during the rate-limiting step in catalysis, these energy and volume changes can contribute to the free energy of activation (delta G++) and the activation volume of the reaction. By influencing the degree to which water can organize around transferred protein groups, salts can modify both the delta G++ (rate) and the delta V++ of a reaction...|$|R
