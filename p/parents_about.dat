5|$|Heins recounts how the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{advocated}} for its associated organizations to add Parental Advisory warnings on labels of music albums {{as a way}} to advise <b>parents</b> <b>about</b> possible offensive content. She describes how the Parents Music Resource Center, co-founded by Tipper Gore, and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, which included Senator Al Gore, led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins suggests that this subsequently led to the industry's self-regulation, which the author sees as self-censorship, and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores.|$|E

5|$|The law was {{a second}} attempt by Senator Yee to enact {{restrictions}} for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a child psychologist led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed {{that the government had}} strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works. In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to <b>parents</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the <b>parents</b> <b>about</b> the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E

40|$|Aim The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the quality of life of {{children}} when one of their parents has cancer. Relationships between children’s quality of life and positive parenting were explored. It was predicted that positive parenting would be a significant predictor of quality of life. Furthermore, the {{purpose of this}} study was to examine differences in positive parenting between mothers and fathers. It was predicted that children would report higher levels of positive <b>parenting</b> <b>about</b> their mother. Method This study evaluated the quality of life of nine children and their perception of positive parenting, separately for father and mother, using a cross-sectional design. The children were between the ages of eight and fifteen. Each child completed for this study a questionnaire consisting of four scales. Results Multiple regression analyses showed that positive parenting did not significantly explain variance in quality of life. Contrary to the expectation, it appeared that there were no differences in children’s perception of positive <b>parenting</b> <b>about</b> father and mother. Conclusion There are no clear conclusions based on these results for the relation between positive parenting and quality of life. The importance of examining determinants and explanations of quality of life are discussed, as well as the importance of a large sample...|$|R
