50|$|Governments request {{competitive}} contract proposals {{when they}} {{believe there are}} more issues than initial cost in buying a needed <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. In addition to cost, governments often consider issues such as risk (i.e., Will the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service meet the government need?), schedule (i.e., Will the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service be delivered or finished in time?), quality (i.e., Will the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service meet the need each time it is delivered or needed?), long-term cost (i.e., What is {{the total cost of}} a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service over its lifetime?). Most governments use proposals to buy any product that is not a commodity or to buy services that are not routine.|$|R
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} sections of the feasibility study as it examines the marketability of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> services and convinces readers that there is a potential market for the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> services.

Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, {{which may not be}} exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.|$|E

The scheme is generally considered one of various internet scams. Michael later reveals having also fallen for a Nigerian 419 scam.|$|E
50|$|A {{potential}} customer of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> {{service would}} {{have an interest in}} viewing information on how a particular <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service stands in terms of subjective or objective quality before making a purchasing decision.

50|$|A value {{proposition}} {{is a statement}} which identifies clear, measurable and demonstrable benefits consumers get when buying a particular <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service.

5|$|The derived {{units in}} the SI are formed by powers, <b>products</b> <b>or</b> quotients of the base units and are {{unlimited}} in number. Derived units are associated with derived quantities, for example velocity is a quantity that {{is derived from the}} base quantities of time and length, so in SI the derived unit is metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through agricultural service rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of the lower classes still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain <b>products</b> <b>or</b> wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E
5|$|When the {{predecessor}} of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu {{by adding the}} Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded {{both inside and outside}} the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its <b>products,</b> <b>or</b> brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.|$|E

50|$|Perceptions are the {{foundation}} of brand value and marketing effectiveness. Marketing communications are conceived and executed with the explicit intention of engaging with consumers to influence and shape their perceptions of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> brand. This is done to build a positive image, meaning behind, or experience associated with a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> brand for continued future transactions between retailer and consumer. If a customer understands and identifies with the meaning behind a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> brand, {{they are more likely}} to see value in the offering and perceive that <b>product</b> <b>or</b> brand as aligning with their ideals, wants, needs, beliefs, and attitudes.|$|R
50|$|Customers of {{products}} and services are a primary party {{in the process of}} reviewing. Customers are closely connected to the process as they would have first-hand experience with a product and service. Their primary role would be detailing their experiences with the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. A customer’s interest in crowdreviewing would stem from an interest in showing their appreciation towards the quality of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service or in voicing their concerns or disappointment in a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service.|$|R

40|$|The classic {{definition}} of quality is “the {{ability of a}} <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service to consistently meet or exceed a customer’s expectations. ” An important element of the definition, customer’s expectations, requires further defining since cus-tomers value certain aspects of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service and they therefore associate those aspects with its quality. <b>Product</b> <b>or</b> service quality has many facets. Quality might include the following elements: • Performance or the main characteristic of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. • Aesthetics, which include the “look and feel ” of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. • Special features of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. • Conformance or how well the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service aligns with the customer’s expectations. • Safety, which includes the element of risk of injury or harm. • Reliability {{or the ability to}} consistently deliver the intended results. • Durability or the useful life of the prod-uct or service. • Reputation of the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service. Different customers will have differ-ent expectations of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service based on the relative value they place on these components at a given moment in time. To make a determination of the quality of an educational program, one must identify the customers and their expectations of the program as they relate to the facets they deem most important. This is particularly true when a program, such as technology education, purports a significant change in it focus, content, and importance. In essence, the perceived quality of the new program will be influ-enced by the reputation of the program it has replaced, its academic home, and the faculty associated with the program...|$|R
50|$|Consumer to {{consumer}} (C2C) marketing {{is the creation}} of a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service with the specific promotional strategy being for consumers to share that <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service with others as brand advocates based on the value of the product. The investment into concepting and developing a top of the line <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service that consumers are actively looking for is equitable to a retail pre-launch product awareness marketing.|$|R

In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.|$|E

25|$|Specialized {{types of}} {{trademark}} include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark which is popularly {{used to describe}} a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service (rather than to distinguish the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> services from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service {{to the extent that}} the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.|$|R
50|$|Perception is {{a mental}} process that people undergo {{in which they}} choose, arrange and {{interpret}} information {{in order to create}} a personalised and coherent understanding of what they are experiencing or witnessing. In a consumer’s purchase journey the consumer will assign meaning to a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> brand upon their initial contact with the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> brand, and this meaning will be based upon their experiences, beliefs and attitudes towards the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> brand.|$|R
5000|$|A notable {{characteristic}} of B2B marketing {{is that it}} is rarely 'product first' or 'service first'. Marketing messages lead with significant context that acknowledges the customer's need or problem first and then establishes the relevance of the vendor's <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service to the customer's situation. In B2C marketing, the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service features and benefits are called out up front. The customer is expected to already know why they need the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> service.|$|R
