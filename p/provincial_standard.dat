40|$|This study empirically {{assessed}} {{the relationship between}} school size and academic achievement of elementary school students in Ontario, Canada. Utilizing data from the Ontario provincial standardized test, the Educational Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO), the results of 541 schools from ten school boards, were studied. A One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) indicated that overall, there was no statistically significant correlation between school size and student achievement. However, there were significant correlations with respect to levels of performance in both Grades three and six in some curricular areas. Also, further analysis at each independent achievement level revealed that the mean percentage of students achieving at stipulated <b>provincial</b> <b>standards</b> in Grade three writing and in Grade six reading, writing and mathematics were highest in large-sized schools (schools with more than 420 students). Results further indicated that the mean percentage of students performing above <b>provincial</b> <b>standards</b> in Grade six reading and writing was also highest in large schools. Students in me-dium-sized schools (between 246 and 420 students) also had the highest mean percentage of students performing above <b>provincial</b> <b>standards</b> in Grade three writing and in Grade six mathematics.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} state of {{agricultural}} housing accommodation in Abbotsford, British Columbia for migrant seasonal workers entering Canada under the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP). The study examines whether enough quality housing exists for Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) using data collected from Citizenship and Immigration Canada and the City of Abbotsford.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop and}} {{implement}} a quality assessment instrument to evaluate cost estimates in economic evaluation studies. Design and setting: The assessment instrument was devised through a consensus process. The instrument {{was developed in the}} process of estimating a national set of <b>provincial</b> <b>standard</b> costs for healthcare services in Canada. Participants: All healthcare providers for a variety of services including public health, inpatient acute care, ambulatory care, physicians, pharmaceuticals, blood and ambulance services, and workers' lost productivity. Main outcome measures: An assessment form which evaluated estimates for the full cost of resources; the appropriate inclusion of resources and resource prices; the degree of detail in the unit of measurement; basis of evidence; and the sample of providers from which cost estimates were generated. Results: When applied to existing cost estimates, a wide variation in quality was observed between service categories and provinces. Inpatient hospital, physician services, and drugs had high quality estimates; public health, nursing home, and home care had lower quality estimates. Conclusions: This quality assessment instrument can be used to target deficiencies in cost estimates and to identify administrative units which are leaders in the field, and hence which can serve as role models for further development of these data.

40|$|In {{urbanized}} {{regions of}} Ontario, the road construction industry faces {{a number of}} challenges due to the growing scarcity of locally-sourced natural aggregate materials and increased restrictions on the approval and development of new aggregate extraction sites. In an effort to maintain sustainable and economical sources of construction aggregates, companies are increasingly seeking to supplement or replace natural aggregates with available artificial materials such as crushed reclaimed concrete aggregate (RCA), and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). Currently, Ontario <b>Provincial</b> <b>Standard</b> Specification (OPSS) 1010 permits the use of processed reclaimed construction materials {{in a variety of}} road base, subbase and asphaltic concrete layers, with the exception of Granular B Type II, which is a higher-performance subbase specification that solely allows primary materials produced from crushed bedrock. Consequently, {{there is a need to}} better understand the performance of reclaimed materials as alternative aggregates in Granular B Type II. This paper focuses on a field testing program carried out at two job sites in Ontario. This testing program assessed five different aggregate blends conforming to Granular B Type II gradation requirements which vary in composition from 100 % natural crushed rock to 100 % processed RCA. Test pads were constructed from each blended material to assess field compactibility using a nuclear density gauge and to determine the in-situ moduli of the compacted materials using a portable lightweight deflectometer (LWD). The field testing results indicate that RCA and RAP can be successfully utilized as aggregate materials in Granular B Type II subbase applications...|$|E
