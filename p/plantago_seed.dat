40|$|Plant oils rich in oxygenated {{fatty acids}} (FAs) are of {{interest}} as renewable raw materials for industry. Previous studies reported unusual oxygenated FAs in the seed lipids of Plantago major and P. ovata. To determine if oxygenated FAs are a common component of <b>Plantago</b> <b>seed</b> oils, seed fatty acyl quality and quantity were determined for 23 Plantago species. Fatty acyl content, {{as a percentage of}} dry weight, ranged from 4. 9 % in P. sempervirens to 18. 8 % in P. coronopus. Oxygenated FAs were a frequent, but not ubiquitous component of <b>Plantago</b> <b>seed</b> lipids, reaching a level of almost 15 % in the seeds of P. nivalis. The oxygenated FAs were identified as isoricinoleic acid (9 -hydroxy-cis- 12 -octadecenoic acid, IR) and 9 -oxo-cis- 12 -octadecenoic acid (OX). When present, most species contained both IR and OX. FAs containing oxo groups have not been reported as components of the seed oil of other plant species that synthesize IR or ricinoleic acid (12 -hydroxy-cis- 9 -octadecenoic acid), suggesting unique aspects to the pathway of oxygenated FA biosynthesis in Plantago. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) demonstrated that IR and OX are components of triacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol estolides are a minor component of the seed oil of P. lanceolata with secondary acylation by oxygenated FAs.

The current study was undertaken to evaluate efficacy of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) methanolic, aqueous and oil extracts and Plantago ovata (Plantago) seeds-supplemented diet in management of obesity in high fat diet-fed rats. Adult female sprague Dawley rats were classified into six groups. The first group was kept on standard rodent chow for 24 weeks (lean control). The other groups received high fat diet for 24 weeks. These animals were assigned as obese control group, fennel methanolic extract-treated group, fennel aqueous extract-treated group, fennel oil extract-treated group and Plantago seeds-treated group. The results revealed significant increase in thoracic (TC) and abdominal (AC) circumferences and Body Mass Index (BMI) in obese rats. Dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and hyperleptinemia have been demonstrated in obese rats. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level significantly increased in obese rats compared with control rats.

In the phytochemical composition of Plantago, there is an abundance of biologically active substances (among others, glycosides, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and vitamins) exhibiting beneficial effects and, simultaneously, there is a low content of compounds that may exert a toxic effect. Scientific research has confirmed that Plantago plants have antioxidative, apoptosis-inhibiting, protective, healing-enhancing, spasmolytic, anthelmintic, and antimicrobial properties; they inhibit the development of some tumours, reduce the level of lipids in blood and inhibit tissue glycation. In phytotherapy, leaves, stems, and/or seeds of different plantain species are used. <b>Plantago</b> leaves and <b>seeds</b> are also used to manufacture creams, lotions, and face masks.

They also exhibit distinct rheological properties in aqueous solution, despite analytical techniques including NMR showing little difference between them.

The measured values of adhesive and frictional properties differed significantly {{in comparison to the}} previously studied pectic mucilage of Linum usitatissimum. Also, the water loss from the cellulose mucilage was more rapid. The obtained different values can result from the presence of cellulose fibrils and their interaction with pectins in the mucilage.

In traditional Iranian medicine (TIM), several medicinal plants are thought to be effective for the treatment of IBD. In this study, information on all of these remedies were derived from all available old sources such as documents or notes and books and were added to the information derived from modern medical databases covering all in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. For some of these plants, only one or two mechanisms of action have been found such as in Cassia fistula, Lepidium sativum, and Bunium persicum. However, for some plants various mechanisms of action are known. For example, Commiphora mukul is effective in IBD due to its immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties and it decreases NF-κB, NO and Cox- 2. Another herb, Plantago ovata, has immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound healing activities and decreases NO and LB 4. Considering the mechanisms of action of these plants, the combination of some of them may be useful because of their many mechanisms of action such as Pistacia lentiscus, Bunium persicum, Solanum nigrum, Plantago ovata, Boswellia, Solanum nigrum, Plantago ovata and Commiphora mukul.

Plantago has been used traditionally to treat many diseases including colds, hepatitis, skin diseases, infectious diseases, problems related to the digestive organs, respiratory organs, reproduction, and circulation (Beara et al. 2009 and 2010; Chiang et al. 2003; Samuelsen 2000). <b>Plantago</b> ovata leaves, <b>seeds,</b> and husks contain about 76, 78, 58 % polyunsaturated, 21, 15, 20 % saturated, and 3, 7, 22 % monounsaturated fatty acids, respectively. In addition, the seeds contain mucilaginous compounds which are used as a thickening agent in the pharmaceutical industry for manufacturing tablets (Patel et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Psyllium is {{the common}} name used for {{several members of the}} plant genus <b>Plantago,</b> whose <b>seeds</b> are commercially used for {{mucilage}} production. Owing to its considerable fiber amount it has been used as dietary fiber supplement. Psyllium has a strong gelling ability, even at low temperature, enabling its use as a gelling agent in the food industry. This work is part of a project to developing jellies enriched with fiber, honey and propolis, aiming to increase these products intake, with evident health benefits. The chemical characterization of psyllium was performed, with the following results (in dry matter) : total ash 2. 5 %, fat content 3. 4 % and total protein 1. 4 %. After qualitative acid hydrolysis polymeric sugars were quantified (in dry matter) : glucan 7. 3 %, xylan 61. 1 % and arabinan 22. 9 %. This means that total fiber content is about 90 %, being soluble fiber predominant, and allows classifying psyllium hemicellulose as an arabinoxylan. Psyllium functional properties were evaluated by water-binding capacity and swelling determination: 27. 1 g/g and 36. 9 ml/g, respectively. These properties are important in the food industry, but under certain circumstances may limit the food type that can be enriched with this fiber. An important part of the research consisted on the characterization of gels viscoelastic behavior and texture, which were prepared with different psyllium particle dimension (raw and ground) and concentration (2. 0 %, 2. 5 % and 3. 0 %). The Response Surface Methodology was used to study the effect of process conditions (time and temperature) on texture and color characteristics of gels. Texture properties of gels were evaluated by Texture Profile Analysis. Gels dynamic behaviour was studied by a sequence of oscillatory measurements of temperature, time and frequency sweeps. Psyllium gelling properties were improved with the reduction of the fiber particle dimension. Gels revealed potential viscoelastic properties that might be interesting in the industrial purpose of honey jelly production...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims The rising {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration ([CO 2]) is a ubiquitous selective {{force that}} may strongly impact species distribution and vegetation functioning. Plant–plant interactions could mediate {{the trajectory of}} vegetation responses to elevated [CO 2], because some plants may benefit more from [CO 2] elevation than others. The relative contribution of plastic (within the plant’s lifetime) and genotypic (over several generations) responses to elevated [CO 2] on plant performance was investigated and how these patterns are modified by plant–plant interactions was analysed. Methods <b>Plantago</b> asiatica <b>seeds</b> originating from natural CO 2 springs and from ambient [CO 2] sites were grown in mono stands of {{each one of the}} two origins as well as mixtures of both origins. In total, 1944 plants were grown in [CO 2]-controlled walk-in climate rooms, under a [CO 2] of 270, 450 and 750 [*]ppm. A model was used for upscaling from leaf to whole-plant photosynthesis and for quantifying the influence of plastic and genotypic responses. Key Results It was shown that changes in canopy photosynthesis, specific leaf area (SLA) and stomatal conductance in response to changes in growth [CO 2] were mainly determined by plastic and not by genotypic responses. We further found that plants originating from high [CO 2] habitats performed better in terms of whole-plant photosynthesis, biomass and leaf area, than those from ambient [CO 2] habitats at elevated [CO 2] only when both genotypes competed. Similarly, plants from ambient [CO 2] habitats performed better at low [CO 2], also only when both genotypes competed. No difference in performance was found in mono stands. Conclusion The results indicate that natural selection under increasing [CO 2] will be mainly driven by competitive interactions. This supports the notion that plant–plant interactions have an important influence on future vegetation functioning and species distribution. Furthermore, plant performance was mainly driven by plastic and not by genotypic responses to changes in atmospheric [CO 2]...|$|R
40|$|Psyllium (<b>Plantago</b> ovata Forsk) <b>seed</b> husk (PSH) is {{very rich}} in {{arabinoxylan}} (AX). However, its high gelling capacity and {{the complex nature}} of the AX {{make it difficult to}} process. In this study, ball milling was investigated as a tool for enhancing PSH AX water extractability and molecular mass (MM). A 48 h laboratory-scale ball mill treatment under standardized optimal conditions reduced the PSH average particle size from 161 mu m for the untreated sample to 6 mu m. Concurrently, it increased the water-extractable AX (WE-AX) level from 13 (untreated PSH) to 90 % of the total PSH AX While the WE-AX of the untreated PSH had a peak MM of 216 kDa and an arabinose to xylose (A/X) ratio of 0. 20, WE-AX fragments from ball mill-pretreated PSH had a peak MM of 22 kDa and an A/X ratio of 0. 31. Ball milling further drastically reduced the intrinsic viscosity of PSH extracts and their water-holding capacity. Prolonged treatment brought almost all AX (98 %) in solution and yielded WE-AX fragments with an even higher A/X ratio (0. 42) and a lower peak MM (11 kDa). While impact and jet milling of PSH equally led to significant reductions in particle size, these technologies only marginally affected the water extractability of PSH AX This implies that ball milling affects PSH particles and their constituent molecules differently than impact and jet milling. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Garlic {{is one of}} the {{important}} medicinal plants that it's plants in many origins. The intercropping of plants is a view of sustainable agriculture that it's very useful. To evaluate the potential of Garlic in intercropping with medicinal plants, this study was conducted as a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications at the Ramin Agriculture and Natural Resources University in 2011 - 2012. Treatments were includingGarlic intercropping with Psyllium (<b>Plantago</b> ovata), Black <b>Seeds</b> (Nigella sativa), Ajowan (Carum copticum), Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), Marigold (Callendula officinalis) and Dill (Aniethum graveolens) that planted withthe 50 : 50 proportion inan interstitial cultureand also, pure culture of above plants. Relative advantage of Garlic intercropping with medicinal plants in terms of Relative Value Total (RVT) was only shown in Garlic intercropping with Black Seeds with 2. 04. The most of the amount of increasing actual yield was related to intercropping of Garlic with Psyllium with 1. 78. The pure yield of Garlic (7330 kg/ha) and intercropping of Garlic with Ajowan (2300 kg/ha) were the highest and lowest yield, respectively. There was a high significant difference with high correlation between intercrop treatments {{in terms of the number}} of bolblet in Garlic. When the number of irrigation (water required plant) increased, Garlic yield was reduced. However, a direct relationship was found between total relative value and number of irrigation. Finally, intercropping of Garlic with Psyllium and Marigold because of the high amount of Actual Yield Total (AYT) is proposed in this region...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between vegetation cover and soil seed banks was studied in five different ungulate herbivoreprairie dog treatment combinations at three northern mixed-grass prairie sites in Badlands National Park, South Dakota. There were distinct differences {{in both the}} seed bank composition and the aboveground vegetation between the off-prairie dog colony treatments and the on-colony treatments. The three on-colony treatments were similar to each other at all three sites with vegetation dominated by the forbs Dyssodia papposa, Hedeoma spp., Sphaeralcea coccinea, Conyza canadensis, and <b>Plantago</b> patagonica and <b>seed</b> banks dominated by the forbs Verbena bracteata and Dyssodia papposa. The two off-colony treatments were also similar to each other at all three sites. Vegetation at these sites was dominated by the grasses Pascopyrum smithii, Bromus tectorum and Bouteloua gracilis and the seed banks were dominated by several grasses including Bromus tectorum, Monroa squarrosa, Panicum capillare, Sporobolus cryptandra and Stipa viridula. A total of 146 seedlings representing 21 species germinated and emerged from off-colony treatments while 3069 seedlings comprising 33 species germinated from on-colony treatments. Fifteen of the forty species found in soil seed banks were not present in the vegetation, and 57 of the 82 species represented in the vegetation were {{not found in the}} seed banks. Few dominant species typical of mixed-grass prairie vegetation germinated and emerged from seed banks collected from prairie dog colony treatments suggesting that removal of prairie dogs will not result in the rapid reestablishment of representative mixed-grass prairie unless steps are taken to restore the soil seed bank...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} improving seedling emergence, stand establishment and yield of late sown ribwort plantain (<b>Plantago</b> lanceolata) by <b>seed</b> priming pot and field experiments were conducted at the Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran during 2013. The ribwort plantain seeds were differently treated by ultrasonication, laser, magnetic field, gamma and beta irradiations all for 3. 5 and 5 min. and were sown on 5 th and 20 th of May. All of the seed priming treatments reduced seedling emergence time, 50 % of seedling emergence and mean emergence time as compared with control. Highest seedling dry weight (0. 49 g. plant- 1) resulted from magnetic field treatment for 5 min. followed by magnetic field for 3. 5 min. and ultrasonic treatments (0. 40 g. plant- 1). A further reduction in exposure time of magnetic field from 5 to 3. 5 min. decreased seedling vigor index. When seeds were sown in 5 th and 20 th May, maturity period of plots treated with magnetic field and ultrasonic happened to range between 112. 2 and 99. 7 days after sowing, respectively. Leaf area index remained statistically unaffected due to a delay of 15 days in sowing date. Under field conditions, there was not significant difference between seed yields from sowing dates, and the yield ranged from 176 kg. ha- 1 in control, gamma and beta irradiations up to 211 kg. ha- 1 in magnetic field and ultrasonic treatments. It can be concluded that priming ribwort plantain seeds by magnetic field and ultrasonic waves would effectively {{be used to improve}} the crop performance and yield especially in late sown plants...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} of arabinoxylan (AX) -rich psyllium (<b>Plantago</b> ovato Forsk) <b>seed</b> husk (PSH) {{as a source for}} production of arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides (AXOS), the parameters determining PSH AX extraction yield and the chemical and enzymic hydrolysis of PSH AX were investigated. The seed husk material had a high content of AX (62. 5 %) with an arabinose to xylose ratio of 0. 41. The water extractability of PSH AX was affected by suspension concentration rather than by temperature. Maximally, 27 % of all AX could be extracted, even when using very dilute suspensions (0. 1 % w/v). When subjected to alkaline conditions, a pH of at least 12 was needed to significantly increase extractability (up to 77 % of all AX). The extractability-increasing effect of alkali was, however, reversible, as extractability decreased again when lowering the pH. Acid hydrolysis at high temperature drastically increased AX extraction yields (up to 97 % of all AX), released monomeric arabinose (up to 38 %), and lowered the average degree of polymerisation (DPavg) of the AX (down to 31). The presence of substituents (arabinose, xylose, rhamnose and galacturonic acid) on the xylan backbone was an important factor limiting degradation by xylanases. Enzyme preparations containing substituent-removing enzymes were far better for enhancing the extractability of {{a large portion of the}} AX population (up to 82 %) and for degrading the extracted fragments (down to DPavg 14) than preparations lacking such activities. The above results show that PSH is a good source for the production of AXOS, since both chemical and enzymic treatments significantly increase the extractability of PSH AX and convert PSH AX molecules into small fragments.
