We simulate {{the performance of}} (i) a collaborative <b>power</b> <b>addition</b> scheme, where the relay boosts the received power (P-CPA) at the mobile locations, and (ii) a CPA scheme with power control (PC-CPA) at the base station and relays. Evaluations are done {{in the context of}} a 19 -cell, 57 -sector set-up in which each of the served users must be delivered a message. The user messages are taken to have the same size and 90 % of users in the network must be served. Improvements over the baseline due to relay deployments are measured in terms of increase in common rate of users as well as power savings in terms of reduction in peak or average power transmitted by base stations. In the CPA schemes with base stations and relays transmitting at full power, the peak power saving is 1. 46 dB, alternately, the throughput improvement over a 1 bit/sec/Hz baseline rate is 21 %. In the PC-CPA scheme, the peak power saving is 2. 6 dB and the average total power in the system can be reduced by 3 dB.

In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we study benefits of deploying inexpensive half-duplex relays in interference-limited cellular system. We study two relaying schemes in a downlink system, users sharing the same frequency band. In the first collaborative relaying scheme, relays help users after they decode the message intended for the user by a collaborative <b>power</b> <b>addition</b> scheme. We evaluate power savings and rate improvement for delivering a common rate for 90 % of users in the system. We then consider power control at the base stations and relays in order to manage the interference. In both cases, the ability of relays to reduce the peak base station transmit power while delivering the baseline rate or alternately to increase the user rate is computed. When power control is employed, the peak power saving is 2. 6 dB and the average total power in the system can be reduced by 3 dB. We also observe a 34 % improvement over the baseline in the users common rate. In the second orthogonal relaying scheme, we study a simple scheme where the base station and relays transmit in orthogonal time slots.

40|$|In {{many of the}} {{continuum}} processes typically found in chemical engineering, the functional dependency of the dependent variable is only known for large and small values of the independent variable. Exact solutions in the transitional regime are often obscure for various reasons (e. g. narrow band within which the transition from one regime to the other occurs, inadequate knowledge of the physics in this area, etc.). An established method for the matching of limiting solutions is reviewed and subsequently applied. The method regards the known solutions as asymptotes and proposes addition to a power of such asymptotes. It yields a single, adjustable correlating equation that is applicable over the entire domain. This procedure circumvents the introduction of ad hoc curve fitting measures for the different regions and subsequent, unwanted discontinuities in piece-wise fitted correlative equations for the dependent variables. Experimental data of two diverse processes, namely flow in a straight-through diaphragm valve and the fluidisation of a packed bed, are analysed as case studies.

Investigations of its carbohydrate binding specificity reveal that among monosaccharides, mannose is preferred over glucose. Among mannooligosaccharides, mannotriose (Man alpha 1 - 3 [Man alpha 1 - 6]Man) and mannopentaose are the strongest ligands followed by Man alpha 1 - 3 Man. Extension of these ligands by GlcNAc at the reducing ends of mannooligosaccharides tested remarkably improves their inhibitory potencies, while substitution of both the alpha 1 - 3 and alpha 1 - 6 mannosyl residues of mannotriose and the core pentasaccharide of N-linked glycans (Man alpha 1 - 3 [Man alpha 1 - 6]Man beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc beta 1 - 4 GlcNAc) by GlcNAc or N-acetyllactosamine in beta 1 - 2 linkage diminishes their inhibitory potencies.

40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} the modifications of the air-flow around an NACA 0015 airfoil when the flow was perturbed with electrohydrodynamic forces. The actuation was produced with a plasma sheet device (PSD) consisting in two bare electrodes flush moun-ted {{on the surface}} of the wing profile operated to obtain a discharge contouring the body in the inter-electrode space. We analyze the influence of different parameters of the actuation (frequency, input power, electrodes position) on the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil, basing our study on measurements of the surface pressure distribution and of the flow fields with particle image velocimetry technique. The experiments indicated that at moderate Reynolds numbers (150, 000 < Re < 333, 000) and at high angles of attack, steady or periodic actuations enabled large improvement of the lift and drag/lift aerodynamic coefficients by reattaching the flow along the extra-dos. However, to attain the same results steady actuations required larger power consumption. When exciting the flow with a moderate value of non-dimensional power coefficient (ratio of electric power flow with the kinetic power flow), a frequency of excitation produced a peak on the coefficients that evaluate the airfoil performance. This peak in terms of a non-dimensional frequency was close to 0. 4 and can be associated to an optimal frequency of excita-tion. However, our work indicates that this peak is not constant for all stalled flow conditions and should be analyzed considering scale factors that take into account the ratio of the length where the forcing acts and the cord length.

40|$|A fluid freely {{expanding}} {{through a}} high-pressure ratio nozzle {{has a large}} density gradient which suggests possible use as a gas target. For example, by using high-energy tritium ions and a deuterium-free expansion jet, {{it is hoped that}} neutrons can be produced at higher flux densities than was possible before. For interestingly high tri-tium ion currents, large amounts of power are delivered to the deuterium while it is undergoing its free expansion. The effect of this <b>power</b> <b>addition</b> to the fluid flow is of interest because if the flow rate of the fluid is decreased or if the density gradient is reduced, the attractiveness of this neutron source is diminished. Colombant has com-puted the effect of the energy absorption at high power levels on the deuterium jet. The purpose of this work is to determine experimentally the effects of high-power absorption on a free expanding jet and therefore give some experimental basis to judge the validity of the theoretical calculation. Because the expanding fluid ' s mass flow rate is of particular interest, the possibility of thermal choking has been investigated. To simulate a 1 -A, 250 -keV tritium ion beam impinging on an MW deuterium-free expansion gas target, a 35 -W CO laser is focused on an ethylene-free expansion jet with a 0. 9 mm nozzle orifice. The CO 2 laser is used as the means of adding power, because just as with the tritium ion beam, the power absorbed is dependent on density. The ratio of absorption length to nozzle orifice diameter is 4. 2, as compared with 0. 5 for the tritium-deuterium system. Figure XII- 1 shows a highly schematic diagram of the experiment; there are 3 sub-systems. The first creates the free jet expansion by expanding ethylene through a large pressure ratio. For the flow rates used (150 cc-atm/sec) and pumped volumes indicated in the figure, the useful operating time was approximately 2. 5 sec. The second major subsystem is the 10. 6.

40|$|To {{cater to}} the growing demand of power in Sri Lanka, {{establishing}} a power transmission interconnection between India and Sri Lanka has become very important at present. The objective {{of this study is}} to do a technically pre-feasibility analysis of such an interconnection with the power system in 2008 and to propose a new interconnection option for the transmission of power. Capability of the power transmission and the capacity of the link are decided by analyzing the present and future generation capacity in both countries. The locations for the potential terminus points for the interconnection are decided by examining the transmission systems. The most suitable power transmission method is selected by considering the technical and economic aspects. Finally the power transmission system of Sri Lanka is modeled with the selected interconnections and the power flow studies are carried out to analyze the performance of the system and to find the most suitable interconnection. According to the present and future generation and transmission capacity in both countries there is enough opportunity to justify a transmission interconnection between India and Sri Lanka. The capacity of the link has been decided for 500 MW in short term and for 1000 MW in medium term. Since there are many advantages of using HYDC over HVAC, HYDC technology has been chosen and for the reliability the bipolar configuration was selected. And the selected voltage was HYDC 400 kV. As for the forecasted loads of the grid substations and the locations (nearness to the major load centers) of them Veyangoda grid substation was taken as the terminus point for the power interconnection in Sri Lanka. The decided route for the interconnection is via Mannar. Transmission system analyses were done for two cases as 500 MW connected to Veyangoda and to New Anuradhapura. The observed low voltages at 220 kV AC busses in both cases highlighted the requirement of reactive <b>power</b> <b>addition</b> to the system. The results of the studies confirmed that the transmission system around New' Anuradhapura is fairly weak compared to the transmission system around Veyangoda. Also the losses of the system were high in New Anuradhapura case. Therefore Veyangoda grid substation was selected as the terminus point of the India - Sri Lanka power interconnection...|$|E
40|$|Power system operators/planners {{are always}} {{faced with the}} problem of how to {{minimize}} the transmission loss. There are a number of ways to achieve this goal. In this thesis, new methods for optimal capacitor placement for transmission loss minimization are proposed. Proposed methods are based on the optimal power flow formulations, which enable the costbenefit analysis and multi-objective optimization assessment of reactive power support investment. For better illustration of proposed methods, they are applied to a real and test transmission networks. In the cost-benefit analysis, reactive power supports are applied to the power system for transmission loss minimization. The candidate places for reactive power support allocation are defined in advance according to where the highest reactive power flow is observed. The benefits after application of reactive power supports are calculated. Benefits considered are the benefits from recovered transmission losses due to the reactive <b>power</b> <b>addition.</b> The benefits are then compared with investments, which would be required for the addition of reactive power supports and in this way the economical justification in reactive power support addition can be made. This method is applied to the real transmission network of a Georgian regional grid. After analyzing the obtained results, we can observe that in some cases even though the losses are minimized up to the minimal level, economically it is not optimal since in such cases, high investment costs are involved. The optimal cases are those where the losses are a bit higher than possible minimum and the investments are minimal also compared to what is required for achieving of minimal transmission losses. Only these optimal cases can justify the investments, made for loss minimization. In the multi-objective optimization several objective functions are proposed in one overall objective function. The optimized functions are minimization of total investment in reactive power support, average voltage deviation, minimization of total system loss and total system cost. At the beginning, optimum values for each objective function is found one by one separately and these optimal values are included while solving for overall objective function. During optimization of all these objectives within one overall objective, we have opportunity to optimize each objective according to what is our interest in it compared to other optimized objectives. This is done using the priority order multipliers, which has each of the objective functions. CIGRE 32 bus test system is used for illustration of this method. Three cases with different values of priority order multipliers are solved and discussed. In the obtained results we can observe how the values of optimized objective functions are changed to reflect their priority orders assigned in the overall objective function...|$|E
