The two pH measures showed opposite genetic relationships with color measures. Genetic correlations of DL and CL were positive with L* and b* and negative with a*. Genetic correlations between carcass traits and MQ suggest that animals with superior growth potential tend to exhibit reduced EUS scores and pale meat with lower tenderness and water holding capacity.

40|$|Abstract [...] In recent years, {{there have}} been many methods {{developed}} to synthesize Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. Nevertheless, a simple yet cheap method to prepare single crystal with high purity nano ZnO was still yet to be established. In this research, nano Zinc oxide (ZnO) was prepared by sol-gel method. The pH variation effect to the resulting ZnO product was also observed. (CH 3 COOH) 2 Zn. 2 H 2 O powder and NaOH solution were used as precursors. NaOH solution was added to (CH 3 COOH) 2 Zn. 2 H 2 O solution by titration until colloids with different pH were obtained, then precipitates of nano ZnO were formed. From the precipitation profile, it can be observed that increasing pH led to shortened precipitation time, which also means increasing particle size. It was also further confirmed that particle size at pH 7 and pH 12 was 1. 3 nm and 73. 8 nm, respectively. XRD profile showed that increasing pH led to increasing purity of nano ZnO: 42. 9 %, 62. 2 %, 64. 7 %, and 100 % at pH 7, pH 8, <b>pH</b> 10, an <b>d</b> <b>pH</b> 12, respectively.
