30|$|As a first example, the {{geological}} {{conditions of the}} Shaqu coal mine in Shanxi province are very complex {{and it is one}} of the highest gas-emitting mines in China. The gas content is 29  m 3 /t, the pressure is up to 2.4  MPa, and the absolute gas gushing quantity is 473  m 3 /min. In 2008, the gas concentration exceeded the statutory limit in 3635 incidents, in each incident exceeding a concentration of 2.5  % (Yuan 2008 c). In the 6  years prior to 2012, coal production was about 200 Mt (design capacity was 300 Mt), and production capacity was seriously restricted by this gas problem. Integrated extraction of coal and gas was implemented in 2011, with comprehensive gas-control measures, such as <b>protective</b> <b>mining,</b> progressive drainage, Y-type ventilation, expansion of the gas extraction system, underground gas drainage from retained roadways, surface well drainage, and gas use. By the end of 2012, the number of gas incidents had dropped to five, and none occurred in 2013.|$|E
40|$|An {{outburst}} of coal and gas {{is a key}} safety risk in coal mining and a worldwide phenomenon. It {{could be described as}} sudden ejection of gas and coal from a coal face. In multiple-seam mining, a seam with less outburst proneness is often extracted first prior to extract overlying or underlying seams with high outburst risks in order to mitigate the risks. A large number of engineering practices show that this <b>protective</b> <b>mining</b> sequence, aided by pressure relief gas drainage, is quite effective. Gas pressure in coal seams is often measured and used to assess the de-gassing effect and define outburst-free zones in a degassed seam, often practiced in Chinese coal mines. However, this method has its shortfalls. Firstly, site measurement of seam gas pressure is quite time-consuming as it normally takes a few weeks to complete. Secondly, it can also be problematic due to damages to measurement boreholes and their sealing, resulting in inaccurate pressure readings. To address these issues associated with seam gas pressure measurements, gas content in coal was tried to replace gas pressure to define outburst-free zones in a degassed seam. The field trial was successfully implemented at the 1492 (1) panel mining # 11 - 2 coal seam in Pansan Mine, Huainan, China. The trial results showed that the gas content of the overlying # 13 - 1 seam was reduced from 8. 4 m 3 /t to about 2 - 4 m 3 /t following mining the # 11 - 2 seam, this was well below the outburst threshold value of 6 m 3 /t set for the 13 - 1 seam. The outburst risk of mining the # 13 - 1 seam in the area directly above the 1492 (1) panel was completely eliminated. The gas content measurements were carried out using the direct desorption method as described in the Australian Standard AS 3980 - 1999. The results also indicated that the de-outburst zone extended 12 m outside the panel return gateroad and 24 m outside the panel start line. It should be mentioned that the extent of the de-outburst zone is somewhat different from conventional understanding in China that the zone lies about 19 m inside the panel return gateroad and 30 m inside the panel start line under the panel condition while the others are 12 m outside the panel return and 24 m inside the panel start line. As the extent of the de-outburst zone is of fundamental importance in integrated coal production and methane extraction in multi-seam mining environment, more investigations are required to evaluate exact boundaries of de-outburst zones...|$|E

Owing to irregular piling of rocks in caved zones, this zone is ring shaped. A vertical fracture zone also forms between the caved zone and fractured zone above the gob.

40|$|A thin {{coal seam}} <b>mined</b> as a <b>protective</b> coal seam above a gas {{outburst}} coal seam plays {{a central role}} in decreasing the degree of stress placed on a protected seam, thus increasing gas permeability levels and desorption capacities to dramatically eliminate gas outburst risk for the protected seam. However, when multiple layers of coal seams are present, stress-relieved gas from adjacent coal seams can cause a gas explosion. Thus, the post-drainage of gas from fractured and de-stressed strata should be applied. Comprehensive studies of gas permeability evolution mechanisms and gas seepage rules of protected seams close to protective seams that occur during <b>protective</b> seam <b>mining</b> must be carried out. Based on the case of the LongWall (LW) 23209 working face in the Hancheng coal mine, Shaanxi Province, this paper presents a seepage model developed through the FLAC 3 D software program (version 5. 0, Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., Minneapolis, MI, USA) from which gas flow characteristics can be reflected by changes in rock mass permeability. A method involving theoretical analysis and numerical simulation was used to analyze stress relief and gas permeability evolution mechanisms present during broken rock mass compaction in a goaf. This process occurs over a reasonable amount of extraction time and in appropriate locations for comprehensive gas extraction technologies. In using this comprehensive gas drainage technological tool, the safe and efficient co-extraction of thin coal seams and gas resources can be realized, thus creating a favorable environment for the safe mining of coal and gas outburst seams...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to address problems pertaining to the effectiveness of hostel representative structures within the mining industry. As part of the study, it was thought pertinent to interview hostel representatives themselves, in order to establish areas in which improvement could be made. The actual approach was to determine the roles and responsibilities of the hostel representatives and gain suggestions from hostel representatives themselves on the causes of inefficiencies of hostel representative structures. In addition, hostel accommodation preferences were determined; by identifying major functions of the hostel representatives, problems reducing their effectiveness, hostel structures which are more effective, and the reasons of their effectiveness. Views of management and representative structures were also determined; this was done by identifying the degree of trust in both mine and hostel management to look after the interests of the hostel representatives. In addition, effectiveness of various hostel representative groupings was determined. Different forms of worker representative structures on the mine were identified and discussed. The theoretical model of forms of worker participation was discussed to further assist in conceptually clarifying the wide field of worker participation. The actual results reported from this study seem to indicate that: hostel representatives' major functions are; disciplinary, communication, domestic, legal, dispute resolution and hostel management deputising functions. Problems that reduce the effectiveness of the hostel representatives were hostel intruders and undisciplined residents, lack of maintenance in the hostel, lack of <b>protective</b> clothing, <b>mine</b> management undermining of the hostel representatives, hostel committee's failure to follow constitution, a lack of promotional opportunities, power struggle union and management structures. In addition, having to consult with other representative structures caused delays in case settlement. Lack of remuneration of the hostel representatives reduced the effectiveness of the hostel representatives. Role conflict between underground work and representative role was also a hindrance to the hostel representatives. Failure of the hostel representatives to attend meetings was also a cause which reduced the effectiveness of the hostel representatives.

40|$|Many Chinese {{coal mines}} are highly gassy with {{abundant}} coal mine methane occurring in complex geological conditions and emitted as a greenhouse gas {{into the atmosphere}} during mining operations. Major accidents due to coal and gas outbursts and gas explosions also frequently occur leading to fatalities and financial losses. Conventional technologies using specialized roadways and extensive short drilling holes are unable {{to meet the demand}} of today 2 ̆ 7 s high production mines with strict safety requirements and environmental regulations such as high carbon emissions. Longhole directional drilling technology has been widely employed in gassy mines due to its obvious advantages such as the high proportion of in-seam boreholes, high efficiency of gas drainage for gas mitigation and reduced cost associated with production down time. The effects were analysed and evaluated based on the application of introduced directional drilling equipment and techniques in Chinese coal mines. These results indicate that the complicated conditions involving soft broken coal, high in situ stress and the presence of faults and folds, present ongoing difficulties and challenges. Longhole directional drilling technology has been successfully applied in some Chinese coal mines for gas exploitation and coal mine gas emission mitigation. Daning Coal Mine (located in the southern Qinshui coalfields) and Baijigou Coal Mine are respectively extracting a thick coal seam. Both coal mines have deployed underground longhole in-seam directional drilling technology for seam gas extraction prior to mining operations. This technology has successfully achieved a high rate of gas recovery therefore reducing mine exhaust ventilation air methane (VAM). However there are still several limitations with the application of longholedirectional drilling technology. These include drilling difficulties in complex conditions, insufficient drill rod strength, poor gas drainage efficiency in low permeability coal seams and the inconsistency of the local Chinese-made equipment. Further studies include systematic evaluation of the drilling applicability within different geological conditions, improving equipment reliability, enhancing the permeability through <b>protective</b> seam <b>mining,</b> hydraulic fracturing and longhole pre-splitting blasting. Applications of directional drilling technology in Chinese gassy mines will make a significant contribution to the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the coal mining industr...|$|R

50|$|After it {{was found}} that the {{commander}} and cargo hatch positions were extremely exposed, and hence the commander and troops were vulnerable to enemy fire, South Vietnamese engineers thought out a simple and cheap remedy to this problem: Initially, field expedient shields and mounts were made from sunken ships, but this was soft metal and could be penetrated by small arms fire. Then armor plate from scrapped armored vehicles was used; this worked well, and by the end of 1964 all ARVN ACAVs were equipped with gun shields. For the U.S. Army, ACAV sets were produced industrially in Okinawa for the 0.50 in machine gun, and rear aft and starboard M60 machine gun positions. Finally, the ARVN's ACAV modifications were adopted by the U.S. Army in Vietnam, and by 1965 the full ACAV set was mass-produced in the U.S. The kit included shields and circular turret armor for the commander's M2 12.7 mm machine gun, and two additional 7.62 mm M60 machine guns, again with shields, fitted on either side of the top cargo hatch. This kit could be retrofitted to any M113. ACAV sets were sometimes fitted to the M106 mortar carrier, but the different rear hatch found on this vehicle required the left M60 machine gun to be fitted to the extreme rear instead of the side. Many kits were added in the field, but at least in the case of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the vehicles had their ACAV sets installed in the U.S. prior to their deployment to Vietnam in 1966 from Fort Meade, Maryland. Additional armor in the form of a <b>mine</b> <b>protective</b> kit under the hull was also frequently fitted.|$|R
40|$|The talk {{presented}} {{an approach to}} define crisis response research in terms of relevant categories (aspects, dimensions, properties) for such research, including e. g. types of threats (hazard sources, crisis triggering events), crisis management steps which are supported, hardware technologies employed, disciplines involved or software technologies used. If existing crisis research is sorted into such a categorization scheme, foci of on-going research efforts can be identified as well as missing combinations. Such definition by examples and attribute ranges also avoids exclusions and is open for a truly interdisciplinary (trans-disciplinary) approach. Besides this top level approach, examples of emerging application tools were given that implement risk management or analysis steps. All tools are currently developed within EU FP 7 research projects and at least parts of their functionalities are relevant for crisis management. In BESECURE we apply risk management to structure an urban security enhancement process. It gives access to best practice methods for enhancing security, urban attractiveness and performance. In a similar way in cases of crisis methods can be selected in a systematic way and employed for achieving user-defined objectives. In VITRUV we show how urban planning for countering terrorism can be supported by empirical (data-base driven) and quantitative analysis. Taking measures for susceptibility, vulnerability and risk into account the software supports urban planning at plan and detail level. This allows countering crisis by preventive urban design with focus on non-physical measures, in particular rearrangement of geometries and urban space design. In ENCOUNTER risk analysis of explosive improvised (home-made) devices in urban environments is conducted taking into account organizational and physical counter measures including neutralization and removal options. This provides scenario assessment input for crisis management. In D-BOX we contribute to a toolbox for improving humanitarian demining worldwide. In particular quantitative hazard and damage analysis is applied to this domain.

40|$|During armed {{conflicts}} many casualties can {{be attributed}} to incidents involving vehicles and landmines. As a result <b>mine</b> <b>protective</b> features are now a pre-requisite on all armoured vehicles. Recent and current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that there is a requirement for vehicles that not only provide suitable protection against explosive devices but are also lightweight so that they may travel off-road and avoid the major routes where these devices are usually planted. This project aims to address the following two topics in relation to mine protected vehicles. 1. Could composite materials be used to replace conventional steels for the blast deflector plates located on the belly of the vehicle, and 2. How effective and realistic is numerical analysis in predicting the material response of these blast deflectors. It also looks into the acquisition and support of new equipment into the armed services, where the equipment itself is but one small element of the system involved. The first topic has been addressed by conducting a number of experimental tests using third scale V-shaped hulls manufactured from steel and two types of composite, S 2 glass and E glass. These experiments found that, on a weight-for-weight equivalency, the S 2 glass was by far the superior material, with very little damage to the outside shape of the hull. The steel was significantly deformed after testing and the E glass, although also did not deform as such, did experience a severe amount of matrix cracking leading to significant loss of structural integrity in that the hull could be easily flexed by hand after the tests. One S 2 glass hull was also subjected to a further two explosive tests and although the amount of delamination was severe {{at the base of the}} hull there was very little geometry lost to the outside of the shape. The numerical modelling work consisted of the modelling of the mine blast phenomenon in autodyn and comparisons with published experimental and numerical work, with the results in reasonably good agreement. The second part consisted of comparing flat S 2 glass plates subjected to varying charge sizes both experimentally and numerically in order to validate the material model, with good agreement. The final stage involved using the validated material model and re-creating the tests done on the V-shaped hulls. The results here at first were not in agreement, but with development of the model and the limitations from the experimental data collection methods applied a model that, when viewed with the experimental results, gave a reasonable representation of the experimental work was created. The management section of the thesis considers previous equipment purchases and what went wrong during their implementation. The Through Life Capability Management model is assessed in relation to an all composite vehicle and identifies some key questions and areas of concern, such as how the management of the DLOD trade-off process should be conducted...|$|R
