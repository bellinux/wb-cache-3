5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer {{to sell out}} three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the <b>primary</b> <b>market,</b> the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the secondary market. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the secondary market, tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most expensive in the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the <b>primary</b> <b>market.</b> The only tickets left for those shows were available on the secondary market for a lower price than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Borislow founded Tel-Save {{when he was}} in his 20s to resell {{access to}} AT long-distance lines. The company was based in New Hope, Pennsylvania, and its <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> was toward small and {{medium-sized}} businesses. Borislow took the company public in 1995 and had an initial public offering of three million shares. He then invested in his own long distance network by deploying five Lucent 5ESS-2000 switches throughout the United States. By 1997, Tel-Save was making $20 million a year.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught the Classics and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and as a work of beauty in its own right.|$|E
50|$|The {{capital markets}} {{may also be}} divided into <b>primary</b> <b>markets</b> and {{secondary}} markets.

The transactions in <b>primary</b> <b>markets</b> exist between issuers and investors, while secondary market transactions exist among investors.|$|R

5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|The port officially started {{operating}} on July 15, 1945, handling imports of coal and cereal and exports of bauxite and timber. The railway was rebuilt to standard gauge in 1966, and electric traction {{was installed in}} 1969 to increase the port's throughput, which reached one million tonnes within a few years. Development of the port was sustained until 1991, when the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War brought about a five-year decline, affecting not only the port's accessibility but also its <b>primary</b> <b>market.</b> In 1996, Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Ploče Agreement, regulating unhindered passage of goods between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Port of Ploče and stipulating that such cargo should be duty-free. Enforcement of the agreement {{is related to the}} duration of the Neum Agreement.|$|E

25|$|The 1933 Act {{regulates the}} <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> in securities, where purchasers buy {{directly}} from the issuing entities.

25|$|The {{initial public}} {{offering}} of stocks and bonds to investors is by definition done in the <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> and subsequent trading {{is done in the}} secondary market.

40|$|Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s {{commercial}} corn {{represents only}} 15 {{percent of the}} total crop, yet that 15 percent returns from 9 to 12 percent of Iowa’s farm income. Three-fourths of the 63 million bushels of commercial corn originate in 35 of the 99 counties. Over 50 percent of the commercial corn leaves the state on first billing, of which 42 percent goes direct to terminal markets. Of the reshipments from Iowa’s <b>primary</b> <b>markets</b> 85 percent goes outside the state— 23 percent reaches terminal markets. Grain handling agencies located at Iowa’s <b>primary</b> <b>markets</b> place a larger percentage of total shipments {{into the hands of the}} ultimate consumer than does the country shipper. This is true because the agencies at the <b>primary</b> <b>markets</b> have far-reaching contacts with both the surplus and deficit areas and they are able to merchandise grain enroute to the ultimate consumer...|$|R
25|$|No merger ever happened, and {{the stock}} did not {{appreciate}} as Swan had predicted. Left holding the bag, Wilko sold the shares at a loss two weeks later.

25|$|Prior to the {{economic}} shock created by Britain's decision to join the EEC in 1973, removing it as New Zealand's <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> for exports, unemployment in New Zealand was very low. The official number of people unemployed in 1959 was only 21. A year later it was 22.

Ålesund had by far the most traffic, about three times that of Molde and Kristiansund. Because they had to operate to three airports in close vicinity, they were unable to operate profitably from any of them. The services were cross-subsidized by the airline being granted monopolies on other routes with higher ridership and profitable operations.|$|E

25|$|The Civil War {{at first}} {{appeared}} disastrous for Baldwin. According to John K. Brown in The Baldwin Locomotive Works, 1831-1915: A Study in American Industrial Practice, {{at the start}} of the conflict Baldwin had a great dependence on Southern railways as its <b>primary</b> <b>market.</b> In 1860, nearly 80 percent of Baldwin's output went to carriers in states that would soon secede from the Union. As a result, Baldwin's production in 1861 fell more than 50 percent compared to the previous year. However, the loss in Southern sales was counterbalanced by purchases by the U.S. Military Railroads and the Pennsylvania Railroad, which saw its traffic soar, as Baldwin produced more than 100 engines for carriers during the 1861–1865 war.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{the way was}} Gary Wachs, son of Coney Island {{president}} Ralph Wachs, {{who with}} friends and family owned a majority of stock. He {{decided it was time to}} relocate the park to stay competitive. After years of research and traveling abroad, he presented ideas for a new theme park to the company's board of directors. Some board members opposed relocating, including significant stockholder Charles Sawyer. It wasn't taken seriously until 1968, when actor Fess Parker announced plans to build a theme park in Northern Kentucky– well within Coney Island's <b>primary</b> <b>market</b> that extended as far south as Louisville. The announcement highlighted the need for change and gave Wachs' proposal credibility within the organization.|$|E
