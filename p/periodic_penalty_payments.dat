40|$|Competition {{authorities}} {{are known for}} imposing enormous fines on companies that have infringed the law. However, most {{authorities are}} equally active – {{if not more so}} – in educating, deliberating, influencing or preventing, to which end they have different enforcement instruments at their disposal. Imposing a fine (or issuing an order, or imposing a <b>periodic</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>payment)</b> through a fully adversarial procedure can be characterised as formal, based on a vertical relationship between companies and competition authorities, deterrence-based, punitive, reactive and case-specific. Alternative enforcement – by contrast – entails a deviation from command-and-control style enforcement by using enforcement instruments and it can be characterised as informal, horizontal, compliance-based, restorative, preventative or efficient, or a combination of {{one or more of the}} above. This research analyses and compares the use of certain alternative enforcement instruments (negotiated procedures, markets work, individual guidance and compliance programmes) by the Dutch Autoriteit Consument en Markt, the UK Competition and Markets Authority and the French Autorité de la Concurrence. These instruments are evaluated in the light of procedural safeguards as well as requirements for instrumentality. In this evaluation, the relationship with the European level is touched upon as well. In doing this research, the author performed an extensive case analysis, as well as research internships within the first two authorities...|$|R

40|$|The subject. This paper {{deals with}} {{problems}} related to tax law with a special focus on legal regulation of the tax procedure contained in the Czech Tax Procedure Code. Attention is paid in particular to tax <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> and the “non bis in idem” principle. The purpose to identify ratio between <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> in tax procedure and in criminal procedure in context of “non bis in idem” principle. The methodological basis of the article is analysis of legislation and court practice of Czech republic, Austria, European Union, including formal legal analysis, comparative analysis, synthesis, systematic approach. The results and scope of application. The existing case law of the Czech criminal courts and of the Supreme Court {{was based on the}} legal opinion that a <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> imposed by the tax administration in a tax procedure constitutes no punishment, i. e. it is no sanction of criminal nature, so that even the final (enforceable) decision of the tax administration does not create a “ne bis in idem” 1 barrier in relation to criminal sanctions for the same taxesrelated non-compliant action (tax evasion) in respect of the <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> imposed by the tax administration. Conclusions. It would probably be advisable for the legislation to amend the relevant provisions of the Tax Procedure Code {{in a way that the}} tax authorities concentrate within the limits of their powers on proper tax collection and that the law enforcement authorities are authorized to punishments for deliberate tax evasion. A suggested amendment may therefore be the removal of the <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> from the Tax Procedure Code as the default interest itself is sufficient instrument enough to penalize the taxpayers. Another option is to keep the tax <b>penalty</b> <b>payment</b> in the Tax Procedure Code, but its imposition would only be considered after making sure that the result of any criminal proceedings does not constitute a “ne bis in idem” prohibition within the meaning of Art. 40 (5) of the Charter and Art. 4 (1) of the Protocol No. 7 to the Convention, Section 11 (1) f), g), h), (2) and Section 11 a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} the surplus of a non-life insurance company and assume that it follows either the classical Cramér-Lundberg model or its diffusion approximation. That is, we consider a continuous time model, where premiums are cashed at a constant rate and claims occur randomly with random sizes modelled by a compound Poisson process. In actuarial mathematics the risk of an insurance company is traditionally measured by the probability of ruin, where the time of ruin {{is defined as the}} first time when the surplus becomes negative. Using the ruin probability as a risk measure has been criticised because it is unrealistic to assume that an insurance company is ruined as soon as the surplus becomes negative. In this thesis, we assume that the insurer is not ruined although the surplus becomes negative. In order to avoid ruin, <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> occur, depending on the level of the surplus. For example, <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> occur if the insurance company needs to borrow money. In {{the first part of this}} thesis {{we consider the}} diffusion approximation to the Cramér-Lundberg model and we aim to determine a dividend strategy that maximises the difference between the expected discounted dividend and <b>penalty</b> <b>payments,</b> where <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> are either modelled by an exponential, linear or quadratic function. We show that the optimal strategy is a so-called barrier strategy and calculate the optimal barrier. The second part studies the analogous problem where the surplus process of an insurance company is given by a Cramér-Lundberg model. Here, similar results are obtained. In conclusion, we consider the problem where we have to determine an optimal investment and reinsurance strategy and the surplus follows the diffusion approximation. The insurance company can invest in several risky assets and reduce the insurance risk either by excess of loss or proportional reinsurance. The aim is to find a strategy which minimises the <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> that are necessary to avoid ruin. Various penalty functions are considered and closed form solutions are derived...|$|R

40|$|When {{making a}} {{contract}} about a project, {{there can be}} a condition of finishing the project in a certain time and if this time is passed, paying a penalty. If the duration agreed on is shorter than the normal finishing duration, {{in order to meet the}} time condition, some activities may have to be finished in a shorter time; hence some extra costs may have to be paid. The most important point when making a time-cost analysis for such a project is “the optimal project duration and activity plan that makes the extra costs to finish the project before the normal time and the <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> minimum”. In this study, by expressing these extra costs and <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> with respect to time, optimal project duration is determined analytically...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{locating}} locally unfriendly but socially beneficial facilities such as landfills and power stations {{is an important}} public policy concern in many countries. Local residents {{in the area where}} such facilities are to be located tend to exhibit strong opposition, no doubt due to the asymmetric distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} such not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) facilities. A potentially useful mechanism for the siting of such facilities is by compensation auctions, which attempt to incorporate the market mechanism into the decision making process. In such auctions, communities name the compensation they require to host such facilities, and the community demanding the least amount of compensation gets to host the facility. This research attempts to evaluate the performance of such compensation auctions using laboratory exepriments. Four popular auction formats are evaluated: first- and second-price and all-pay first-and second-price sealed-bid auctions. The latter two formats correspond to the compensation auctions with <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> proposed by Kunreuther and Kleindorfer (1986) and Quah and Tan (1998), who claim that these auctions are more efficient as they restrains strategic (or over) bidding. Our results, however, contradict this claim. We show that the first-and second-price auctions without <b>penalty</b> <b>payments</b> are in fact more efficient, in that they tend to minimize social costs, and truthful bidding is more likely. ...|$|R
