40|$|Background/Aim. Chronic {{sinusitis}} is {{a disease}} characterized with mucosal inflammatoion of nasal and paranasal sinuses for at least 12 weeks. In order to assess the extent and severity of inflammatory changes <b>in</b> paranasal sinuses <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> according to Lund-Mackay is the most commonly used. Recent studies show the possibility of existing different subtipes of chronic rhinosinusitis, pointing out the presence of nasal polyps and their influence on the severity of chronic rhinosinusitis. The aim {{of this research was}} to examine the influence of sinonasal polyposis on the extensity of inflammatory changes on computerized tomography (CT), evaluated by the Lund-Mackay <b>CT</b> <b>score.</b> Methods. A prospective study compared the Lund-Mackay <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> values between the patients with chronic rhinosinusitis associated with nasal polyps and those without them. We determined mean values of the total <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> <b>in</b> both groups of the patients, as well as mean values of <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> for each group of sinuses and ostiomeatal complexes. Results. The study included 90 patients, 47 males and 43 females, 45 -year old on average, diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis on the basis of diagnostic algorithm. The group with uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis (without nasal polyps) consisted of 30 patients and the group with complicated chronic rhinosinusitis (with nasal polyps) of 60 patients. Observing these two groups of patients revealed statistically highly important intergroup difference <b>in</b> <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> for each group of sinuses and ostiomeatal complexes. The mean value of total <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> <b>in</b> the group with uncomplicated chronic rhinosinusitis was 4. 37 while in the group with complicated chronic rhinosinusitis it was 16. 05 (p < 0. 01).

Associations of polymorphisms in the genes coding for IL- 18 (IL 18 /G- 656 T, C- 607 A, G- 137 C, T 113 G, C 127 T) and its receptor (IL 18 R 1 /C- 69 T) with coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP) were studied in 200 miners who were examined in 1990, 1994 and 1999. Coal-dust exposure was assessed according to job history and ambient measures. The main health outcome was lung computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>score</b> <b>in</b> 1990.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{analyzes}} <b>CT</b> examinations <b>in</b> Switzerland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using {{different sources}} (administrative {{data on the}} equipment, a 1998 nationwide inquiry into practices, and data provided by the Swiss University Hospitals of Basel, Zurich, and Lausanne), we determined the frequency of CT examinations (hospitals and private radiologists) in 1998 according to different descriptive variables and studied the <b>progression</b> <b>in</b> <b>CT</b> use over time. RESULTS: CT scanners increased by 7 % between 1998 and 2004. The average annual number of <b>CT</b> examinations <b>in</b> 1998 was 46. 3 / 1000 population, 3. 4 % of all radiological examinations in Switzerland in 1997 - 1998. The most frequent examination was CT of the skull (24 %), while private radiology institutes perform more CTs of the spine. More CT examinations were performed for men than for women (sex ratio M/F= 1. 17). The average annual increase <b>in</b> <b>CT</b> <b>in</b> Swiss hospitals varied from 8 % for Basel to 18 % for Lausanne. Finally, the proportion of pediatric examinations was 5 %; their numbers appear to be stabilizing. CONCLUSION: There is a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>CT</b> examinations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of our study}} {{was to assess the}} accuracy {{of one of the most}} used scoring systems, the Bhalla scoring system, in the detection of lung impairment in patients with cystic fibrosis and in the prediction of cystic fibrosis progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From the database of our center, 300 CT examinations performed between 1991 and 2001 were reviewed. Pulmonary function tests performed the same day as radiologic assessment were available. Of this group, 145 examinations were retrospectively included, referring to 87 patients with confirmed cystic fibrosis and a mean age (± SD) of 15. 6 ± 8. 4 years (range, 9 months- 38 years). Thirty patients underwent one CT examination, 56 underwent two examinations, and one patient underwent three examinations. The mean interval between two examinations was 36. 5 months. The 145 examinations were independently reviewed by three radiologists who were blinded to the clinical and pulmonary function test results. The CT examinations were assessed using the scoring system proposed by Bhalla and colleagues. RESULTS. CT assessed using the Bhalla scoring system is mildly correlated with functional pulmonary test results and has high interobserver reproducibility. The <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> significantly changed between scans obtained in a mean interval of 36. 5 months, whereas functional pulmonary test results did not, suggesting that CT is more sensitive than function tests for detecting small changes. However, the variation <b>in</b> <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> did not predict progression of functional pulmonary test results or progression of CT findings between scans. CONCLUSION. CT assessment based on the Bhalla scoring system is more sensitive than pulmonary function tests in detecting initial morphologic changes. However, we found no evidence of the predictive value of CT...|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} review, the term “increased lung volume” {{has been used}} in place of the not exactly {{interchangeable}} terms “overinflation” and “air trapping”. Air trapping can only be evaluated on expiratory CT scans, and overinflation would in most cases be the more appropriate term, when expiratory images are not used. Bronchial wall thickening and increased lung volume are commonly seen in cystic fibrosis but are non-specific abnormalities that can often be seen in, for example, children with asthma and bronchiolitis, and in most scoring systems these components are consequently given quite low weightings in percentage of the total score (Table  7, Fig.  2). Consolidations and atelectasis of the parenchyma are also non-specific and are in most scoring systems given a weighting of about 20 % of the total <b>score.</b> However, <b>in</b> the <b>CT</b> <b>scoring</b> systems of Santamaria [28], Robinson [32] and Brody [34] expiratory images are included, as air trapping in these scoring systems is thought to reflect small airway disease in early cystic fibrosis [40, 42].|$|R
30|$|The {{range of}} the weightings, {{expressed}} as the component score in {{percentage of the total}} score, is wide (Table  7, Fig.  2), indicating disagreement between research groups on which abnormalities are the most indicative of changes in disease status. Bronchiectasis and mucus plugging are the most specific pulmonary abnormalities for cystic fibrosis [15, 40] and some authors have even suggested that selective scoring of mucus plugging and bronchiectasis might be as sensitive as more complicated <b>CT</b> <b>scoring</b> systems <b>in</b> observing the course of disease in patients with cystic fibrosis [23, 35, 40, 41]. It is therefore logical to give them a high score compared with other findings, and most scoring systems give bronchiectasis alone, or in combination with mucus plugging, the highest weightings. Bronchiectasis is generally given higher weightings <b>in</b> <b>CT</b> and MRI <b>scoring</b> systems (when combined with scores for abscess and sacculation), {{as well as in the}} tomosynthesis scoring system, compared with radiographic scoring systems (Table  7, Fig.  2), probably due to the fact that bronchiectasis is more clearly visualised. The mean scores for mucus plugging (17 %) are the same for radiography, <b>CT</b> and MRI <b>scoring</b> systems, even though CT and MRI depict these changes better than radiography, but is higher in the tomosynthesis scoring system (32 %), where the sum of the scores for mucus plugging together with bronchiectasis contribute to 64 % of the total score.|$|R

This study assessed the impact of CFTR modulation on multiple modalities of patient assessment. Methods: Thirty-three patients with the G 551 D mutation were assessed at baseline and prospectively every 3 months for 1 year after initiation of ivacaftor. Change <b>in</b> ultra-low-dose chest <b>CT</b> scans, blood inflammatory mediators, and the sputum microbiome were assessed. Results: Significant improvements in FEV 1, BMI, and sweat chloride levels were observed post-ivacaftor treatment.

40|$|The Gram-negative, {{intracellular}} bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis causes {{acute and}} chronic urogenital tract infection, potentially leading to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The only partially characterized cytotoxin CT 166 of serovar D exhibits a DXD motif, {{which is important}} for the enzymatic activity of many bacterial and mammalian type A glycosyltransferases, leading to the hypothesis that CT 166 possess glycosyltransferase activity. CT 166 -expressing HeLa cells exhibit actin reorganization, including cell rounding, which has been attributed to the inhibition of the Rho-GTPases Rac/Cdc 42. Exploiting the glycosylation-sensitive Ras(27 H 5) antibody, we here show that CT 166 induces an epitope change in Ras, resulting in inhibited ERK and PI 3 K signaling and delayed cell cycle progression. Consistent with the hypothesis that these effects strictly depend on the DXD motif, CT 166 with the mutated DXD motif causes neither Ras-ERK inhibition nor delayed cell cycle <b>progression.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, <b>CT</b> 166 with the mutated DXD motif is still capable of inhibiting cell migration, suggesting that CT 166 with the mutated DXD motif cannot be regarded as inactive in any case.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} the prognostic value of quantitative computed tomographic (<b>CT)</b> <b>scoring</b> for {{the extent of}} fibrosis or emphysema {{in the context of}} a clinical model that includes the gender, age, and physiology (GAP model) of the patient. Materials and Methods Study cohorts were approved by local institutional review boards, and all patients provided written consent. This was a retrospective cohort study that included 348 patients (246 men, 102 women; mean age, 69 years ± 9) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from two institutions. Fibrosis and emphysema visual scores were independently determined by two radiologists. Models were based on competing risks regression for death and were evaluated by using the C index and reclassification improvement. Results The CT-GAP model (a modification of the original GAP model that replaces diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide with <b>CT</b> fibrosis <b>score)</b> had accuracy comparable to that of the original GAP model, with a C index of 70. 3 (95 % confidence interval: 66. 4, 74. 0); difference in C index compared with the GAP model of - 0. 4 (95 % confidence interval: - 2. 2, 3. 4). The performance of the original GAP model did not change significantly with the simple addition of fibrosis score, with a change in C index of 0. 0 (95 % confidence interval: - 1. 8, 0. 5) or of emphysema score, with a change in C index of 0. 0 [95 % confidence interval: - 1. 3, 0. 4]). Conclusion <b>CT</b> fibrosis <b>score</b> can replace diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide test results in a modified GAP model (the CT-GAP model) with comparable performance. This may be a useful alternative model <b>in</b> situations where <b>CT</b> <b>scoring</b> is more reliable and available than diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. © RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Pulmonary {{changes in}} {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) with CFTR I 1234 V mutation have not been extensively documented. Impact of geographic influence on phenotypical expression is largely unknown. This descriptive clinical study presents the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) pulmonary findings and computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scoring</b> with respect to pulmonary function tests (PFT) in a small subset of CF group. Materials and Methods: We examined 29 patients between 2 and 31 years of age with CFTR I 1234 V mutation. HRCT and PFT were performed within 2 weeks of each other. Imaging abnormalities on HRCT were documented and analyzed by utilizing the scoring system described by Bhalla et al., Brody et al., Helbich et al.,and Santamaria et al. Efficacy of the scoring system with respect to PFT was compared. Statistical Analysis: Inter-observer reliability of the scoring systems was tested using intraclass correlation (ICC) between the two observers. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the scoring systems and between the scoring systems and PFT results. Results: In our study, right upper and middle lobes were the most frequently involved sites of involvement. Bronchiectasis and peribronchial thickening were the most frequent imaging findings. Scores with all four scoring systems were reproducible, with good ICC coefficient of 0. 69. There was good agreement between senior radiologists in all scoring systems. Conclusion: We noted pulmonary imaging abnormalities in a large majority (96 %) of our CF patients. There {{was no significant difference}} <b>in</b> the <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> observed from various systems. The CT evaluation system by Broody is detailed and time consuming, and is ideal for research and academic setup.

40|$|AbstractPurposeIn the {{intensive}} care unit (ICU), prognosticating patients who are comatose or defining brain death can be challenging. Currently, the criteria for brain death are clinical supported by paraclinical tests. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) shows diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation consistent with infarction. We hypothesize that the extent of hypodensity is predictive of poor neurologic outcome or brain death. Materials and MethodsA total of 235 consecutive adult patients with cardiac arrest or with serious trauma admitted to ICU in 1 year were studied. Seventy met inclusion criteria. CT images were reviewed by multiple observers blinded to final outcome who assessed for loss of grey-white conspicuity. A modification of the validated Alberta Stroke Program Early <b>CT</b> <b>Score</b> (ASPECTS) was used to include non–middle cerebral artery territories. Primary outcome was death or functional disability at 3 months. Dichotomized <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> were correlated with poor clinical status (Glasgow Coma Score 19) and poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale > 2). ResultsThe <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> was ≤ 10 in 7 patients and > 10 in 63 patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{evaluates the}} {{correlation}} between preoperative symptoms, quality-of-life questionnaires (chronic sinusitis survey and 20 -Item Sinonasal Outcome Test [SNOT- 20]), and staging on computer tomography (CT). It consisted of a prospective cohort study of all consecutive patients undergoing surgery for medically nonresponsive chronic sinusitis, which took place at a tertiary care center. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-one patients completed the Chronic Sinusitis Survey (CSS) questionnaire and the SNOT- 20. A visual analog scale (VAS) symptom score was completed also. The {{average age of the}} patients was 44. 5 years and the male/female ratio was 1. 3 : 1. The symptom scores of all three questionnaires were compared with the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan <b>score</b> of the sinuses. RESULTS: The median Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> was 12 (mean +/- SD, 12. 7 +/- 5. 7). There was no significant correlation between the SNOT- 20 questionnaire and the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> (p = 0. 026; p = 0. 764) and between the CSS and the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> (p = - 0. 158; p = 0. 058). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between a single VAS symptom score relating to overall sinonasal symptom severity and the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan <b>score</b> (p = 0. 135; p = 0. 121). However, a weak but statistically significant correlation was found between the VAS score based on the sum of five sinonasal symptoms and the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan <b>score</b> (p = 0. 197; p = 0. 020). CONCLUSION: The score, based on the sum of five sinonasal VAS symptoms, correlates to the disease severity as measured by the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan <b>score.</b> The SNOT- 20 questionnaire and the CSS symptom score do not correlate to the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> scan <b>score,</b> although a correlation was found between the CSS score and the Lund-MacKay <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> <b>in</b> various sub-groups of our patient population...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Diagnosis of {{encapsulating}} peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) {{is based}} on clinical symptoms, radiologic findings, and macroscopic or histological criteria. Two diagnostic scores for radiologic findings <b>in</b> computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> scans of patients with EPS have been established in the past (by Tarzi et al and Vlijm et al). The macroscopic appearance of EPS has previously been separated into three types. The use of CT scan {{as a tool to}} predict different macroscopic phenotypes, leading to specific surgical techniques and different medical treatment, has not yet been investigated. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with late-stage EPS who underwent major surgery with peritonectomy and enterolysis. The preoperative <b>CT</b> scans were <b>scored</b> according to the two aforementioned established diagnostic <b>CT</b> <b>scores.</b> The macroscopic phenotype, surgical procedure, and laboratory values at the time of surgery were evaluated. <b>CT</b> findings <b>in</b> the different macroscopic phenotypes were analyzed. RESULTS All patients had highly predictive <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> for EPS. The macroscopic Type III had significantly higher <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> compared with the other macroscopic phenotypes. Patients with macroscopic Type I had significantly higher C-reactive protein values compared to EPS Type III. Operation time was significantly longer, and repeated surgery and intraoperative complications were more frequent in EPS Type I compared with EPS Type III (P< 0. 05). Using the <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> and CRP level, the sensitivities for prediction of EPS I and III were 78 % and 87 % with corresponding specificities of 67 % and 93 %.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} lung abnormalities on serial thin-section computed tomographic (<b>CT)</b> scans <b>in</b> {{patients with}} {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) during acute and convalescent periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial thin-section <b>CT</b> scans <b>in</b> 30 patients (17 men, aged 42. 5 years ± 12. 2 [SD]) with SARS were reviewed by two radiologists together for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities: ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with superimposed linear opacities, consolidation, reticular pattern, and mixed pattern (consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and reticular pattern). Scans were classified according to duration in weeks after symptom onset. Longitudinal changes of specific abnormalities were documented in 17 patients with serial scans obtained during 3 weeks. Each lung {{was divided into}} three zones; each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement. Summation of scores from all six lung zones provided overall <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> (maximal <b>CT</b> <b>score,</b> 24). RESULTS: Median <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> increased from 1 in the 1 st week to 12. 5 in the 2 nd week. Ground-glass opacities with or without smooth interlobular septal thickening and consolidation were predominant patterns found during the 1 st week. Ground-glass opacities with superimposed irregular reticular opacities, mixed pattern, and reticular opacities were noted from the 2 nd week and peaked at or after the 4 th week. After the 4 th week, 12 (55 %) of 22 patients had irregular linear opacities with or without associated ground-glass opacities and <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> greater than 5; five of these patients had bronchial dilatation. When specific opacities were analyzed in 17 patients, consolidation generally resolved completely (n = 4) or to minimal residual opacities; six (55 %) of 11 patients with ground-glass opacities had substantial residual disease (<b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> > 5) on final scans. CONCLUSION: There is a temporal pattern of lung abnormalities at thin-section <b>CT</b> <b>in</b> SARS. Predominant findings at presentation are ground-glass opacities and consolidation.

40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether HRCT criteria for Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP), possible UIP or no-UIP pattern recommended by ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines 2011 are able to predict progression and prognosis of the disease in a group of patients with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). Materials and methods This was a retrospective study conducted with the approval of the ethics committee. Two radiologists at baseline HRCT distributed 70 patients with fibrotic IIP into three groups on the basis of the 2011 guidelines: UIP pattern (group 1), possible UIP pattern (group 2), inconsistent with UIP pattern (group 3). The different abnormalities (honeycombing, reticulation, groundglass and traction bronchiectasis), fibrotic score (reticulation + honeycombing) and overall <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> were visually scored at baseline and during the follow-up (total HRCT 178). The mortality rate of the three groups was compared. The baseline abnormalities were then correlated with the mortality rate in the UIP group. Results The inter-observer agreement in the classification of the abnormalities in the three groups was almost perfect (k = 0. 92). After consensus, 44 patients were classified into group 1, 13 into group 2 and 13 into group 3.

40|$|Intracranial {{internal}} {{carotid artery}} (iICA) calcification is associated with stroke and is often seen as a proxy of atherosclerosis of the intima. However, it was recently shown that these calcifications are predominantly located in the tunica media and internal elastic lamina (medial calcification). Intimal and medial calcifications {{are thought to have}} a different pathogenesis and clinical consequences and can only be distinguished through ex vivo histological analysis. Therefore, our aim was to develop <b>CT</b> <b>scoring</b> method to distinguish intimal and medial iICA calcification in vivo. First, in both iICAs of 16 cerebral autopsy patients the intimal and/or medial calcification area was histologically assessed (142 slides). Brain CT images of these patients were matched to the corresponding histological slides to develop a <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> that determines intimal or medial calcification dominance. Second, performance of the <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> was assessed <b>in</b> these 16 patients. Third, reproducibility was tested in a separate cohort. First, CT features of the score were circularity (absent, dot(s), < 90 °, 90 - 270 ° or 270 - 360 °), thickness (absent, ≥ 1. 5 mm, or < 1. 5 mm), and morphology (indistinguishable, irregular/patchy or continuous). A high sum of features represented medial and a lower sum intimal calcifications. Second, in the 16 patients the concordance between the <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> and the dominant calcification type was reasonable. Third, the score showed good reproducibility (kappa: 0. 72 proportion of agreement: 0. 82) between the categories intimal, medial or absent/indistinguishable. The developed <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> shows good reproducibility and can differentiate reasonably well between intimal and medial calcification dominance in the iICA, allowing for further (epidemiological) studies on iICA calcification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of global mortality, yet its early {{detection}} remains a vexing problem of modern medicine. Although the computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> calcium <b>score</b> predicts cardiovascular risk, relatively high cost ($ 250 – 400) and radiation dose (1 – 3 mSv) limit its universal utility as a screening tool. Dual-energy digital subtraction radiography (DE; <$ 60, 0. 07 mSv) enables detection of calcified structures with high sensitivity. In this pilot study, we examined DE radiography’s ability to quantify coronary artery calcifica-tion (CAC). We identified 25 patients who underwent non-contrast CT and DE chest imaging performed within 12 months using documented CAC as the major inclusion criteria. A DE calcium score was developed based on pixel intensity multiplied by the area of the calcified plaque. DE scores were plotted against <b>CT</b> <b>scores.</b> Subsequently, a validation cohort of 14 additional patients was indepen-dently evaluated to confirm the accuracy and precision of CAC quantification, yielding a total of 39 subjects. Among all subjects (n= 39), the DE score demonstrated a correla-tion coefficient of 0. 87 (p< 0. 0001) when compared with the <b>CT</b> <b>score.</b> For the 13 patients with <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> of < 400, the correlation coefficient was − 0. 26. For the 26 patients with <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> of ≥ 400, the correlation coefficient yielded 0. 86. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of DE radiography to identify patients at the highest cardiovascu-lar risk. DE radiography’s accuracy at lower scores remains unclear. Further evaluation of DE radiography as an inexpensive and low-radiation imaging tool to diagnose cardiovascular disease appears warranted...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a public}} health problem. It is a {{pathology}} that causes significant mortality and disability in Colombia. Different calculators and prognostic models {{have been developed to}} predict the neurological outcomes of these patients. The Rotterdam computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>score</b> was developed for prognostic purposes in TBI. We aimed to examine the accuracy of the prognostic discrimination and prediction of mortality of the Rotterdam <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> <b>in</b> a cohort of trauma patients with severe TBI in a university hospital in Colombia. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 127 patients with severe TBI treated in a regional trauma center in Colombia over a 2 -year period. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used. The discriminatory power of the score, its accuracy, and precision were assessed by logistic regression and as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Shapiro–Wilk, Chi-square, and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the real outcomes in the cohort against the predicted outcomes. Results: The median age of the patient cohort was 33 years, and 84. 25 % were male. The median injury severity score was 25, the median Glasgow Coma Scale motor score was 3, the basal cisterns were closed in 46. 46 % of the patients, and a midline shift of > 5 mm was seen in 50. 39 %. The 6 -month mortality was 29. 13 %, and the Rotterdam <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> predicted a mortality of 26 % (P < 0. 0001) (area under the curve: 0. 825; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 745 – 0. 903).

We show that mean CD 4 cell counts declined significantly after the third cycle of CT (187 +/- 117 /microliters before CT versus 92. 4 +/- 60 /microliters; p = 0. 04) and remained significantly reduced 4 months after completion of CT. Modifications of CD 8 cell counts were not statistically significant. The effects of CT on plasma viremia, as measured by a competitive polymerase chain reaction technique, were delayed until the fourth cycle, when an increase of viral load ranging from 0. 6 to 2 logs (p = 0. 027) was observed. After this point, viremia returned to baseline levels, with the exception of two patients who later developed opportunistic infections and one who underwent disease progression.

40|$|Background: To {{reduce the}} {{mortality}} and morbidity rates of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, {{and to have}} an effective clinical management, {{it is important to}} monitor the progression of the disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the progression of lung disease in CF patients by means of assessing the correlation of the <b>CT</b> <b>scoring</b> system with clinical status and pulmonary function test at the Pediatric Pulmonary Ward of Masih Daneshvari Hospital in 2008. Methods: Pulmonary high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in 23 CF patients using the Brody's scoring system. Morphologic signs as well as the extent and severity of each sign were scored, and the total score was calculated. The correlation of HRCT scores (total score as well as the score for each parameter) with Shwachman Kuczycki scoring system and pulmonary function test were examined. Results: The study included 9 female and 14 male patients with an age range of 5 - 23 years (mean: 13. 42 years). Bronchiectasis (100 %) and peribronchial wall thickening (100 %) were the most frequent CT abnormalities. Mucus plugging, air trapping and parenchymal involvements were respectively seen in 95. 7 %, 91. 3 % and 47. 8 % of patients. The overall <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> for all patients was 57. 6 ± 24. 2 (means±SD). The results of pulmonary function test showed a restrictive pattern; however, in 5. 3 % of the patients PFT was normal. The overall Shwachman-Kulczycki score was 53. 48 ± 13. 8.

This study aimed to clarify its radiological patterns and the association with smoking. MethodsThe subjects underwent low-dose computed tomography to screen lung cancer. The selected subjects with interstitial changes were monitored for the precise morphology of interstitial changes using a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan. The subjects were classified into normal and abnormal HRCT subjects. The radiological findings on the HRCT scan, serum Klebs von der Lungen- 6 (KL- 6), surfactant protein (SP) -A, SP-D, pulmonary function, and computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scores</b> were analyzed. Abnormal HRCT subjects were classified based on the radiological patterns, and were followed-up over a 4 -year period. ResultsHRCT abnormalities suggesting interstitial changes were identified in 80 of 3079 subjects. Seven subjects with honeycombing and 14 with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) were identified. The frequencies of sex (male) and smoking in the subjects with honeycombing was {{higher than that of}} other patterns.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether there is a clinical-radiological correlation in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), to compare operative findings with those of computed tomography (CT) imaging, and to determine the importance of a <b>CT</b> <b>score</b> and staging <b>in</b> management of CRS. Methods: This study is a prospective study. Adult patients meeting diagnostic criteria for CRS were prospectively studied using the Lund–Mackay (LM) symptom <b>score</b> and sinus <b>CT</b> scan. The symptom scores were correlated with CT stage according to the Kennedy and LM staging systems. Similarly, the intraoperative findings were correlated with the Kennedy staging system. The spectrum of anatomical variations in our study population was compared with the findings of symptomatic patients in various other studies. Results: Thirty-four adult patients (13 females, 21 males, mean age: 33 years) met our inclusion criteria. Most of the patients presented with nasal obstruction, headache, and hyposmia. Nasal polyposis was the most common finding <b>in</b> <b>CT</b> scans, with many cases of retention cysts reported as polyps. In total, 50 % of patients had a deviated septum. Concha bullosa was the most common finding among the various anatomical variations encroaching the ostiomeatal complex (OMC). In 60 %– 70 % of cases, the CT scan grading correlated with operative findings. LM symptoms scores showed a poor correlation with both LM <b>CT</b> <b>scores</b> and the Kennedy stage. Conclusions: Although CT provided detailed information on sinus involvement; its relation with symptom severity is not reliable. The Kennedy CT staging system correlated better with CRS symptoms.
