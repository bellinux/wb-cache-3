50|$|Among {{healthcare}} consumers—i.e., patients—satisfaction is {{best understood}} as a multi-attribute model with different aspects of care determining overall satisfaction. Importantly, lower <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> attribute creates much more dissatisfaction than the satisfaction generated by higher <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> attribute; in other words, negative performance is more consequential than positive performance. Thus, ensuring overall patient satisfaction, {{it is more important}} reduce negative <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> the patient-care dimension with the worst perceived performance than to maximize positive <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> another dimension. <b>A</b> fruitful solution can be measuring patient dissatisfaction instead of satisfaction.|$|R

5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full {{power of his}} genius. This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to evoke a literary theme in <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in {{a stand of}} 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, {{so he had to}} make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E

5|$|Sleight of hand during stage magic {{performances}} is not common, as most magic {{events and}} stunts are performed with objects visible {{to a much}} larger audience, but is nevertheless done occasionally by many stage performers. The most common magic tricks performed with sleight of hand on stage are rope manipulations and card tricks, with the first typically being done {{with a member of}} the audience to rule out the possibility of stooges and the latter primarily being done on a table while a camera is live-recording, allowing the rest of audience to see the <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> big screen. Worldwide acclaimed stage magician David Copperfield often include illusions featuring sleight of hand in his stage shows.|$|E

25|$|Research {{into the}} exact {{function}} of the visuo-spatial sketchpad has indicated that both spatial short-term memory and working memory are dependent on executive resources and are not entirely distinct. For instance, <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> working memory but not on a short-term memory task was affected by articulatory suppression suggesting that impairment on the spatial task {{was caused by the}} concurrent <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> task that had extensive use of executive resources. Results have also found that performances were impaired on STM and WM tasks with executive suppression. This illustrates how, within the visuo-spatial domain, both STM and WM require similar utility of the central executive.|$|E

The following invariance properties have been established for CMA-ES.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs {{continued}} to play Test matches until 1930; another assured <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rain-affected pitch in 1928–29 was followed by his final Test century. However, {{the last years of}} his career were affected by injury, and he missed a lot of cricket. He announced his retirement from Tests in 1930 but continued for Surrey until 1934 and took his total of centuries to 199—although two of these were not recognised as first-class during his career.|$|E
25|$|Ambrose {{returned}} to Richard Petty Motorsports for 2012. In February he almost won the Budweiser Shootout with bump-drafting help from Keselowski; but lost the lead {{just as he}} took the white flag to Tony Stewart and eventual race winner Kyle Busch. Ambrose said after the race that despite losing the Shootout the race was his best <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> restrictor plate track (although he also had several top-tens at previous plate races, such as a 4th-place finish at Talladega in the spring 2009 race).|$|E

25|$|In a {{study of}} Richards and Gross (1999) and Tiwari (2013), {{participants}} viewed slides of injured men that produced increases in negative emotions, while information concerning each man was presented orally with his slide. The participants were assigned to either an expressive suppression group (where {{they were asked to}} refrain from showing emotion while watching the slides) or to a control group (where they were not given regulatory instructions at all). As predicted by the researchers, suppressors showed significantly worse <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> memory test for the orally presented information.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Lewis was {{stripped}} of the WBA belt for failing to meet lightly regarded Don King fighter John Ruiz, having fought Ruiz's conqueror David Tua, and the WBA ordered Holyfield and Ruiz to meet for that organization's world title belt. Holyfield and Ruiz began their trilogy in August of that year, with Holyfield making history by winning on a controversial, but unanimous 12-round decision {{to become the first}} boxer in history to be the World Heavyweight Champion four times. Holyfield blamed his lackluster <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> perforated (broken) eardrum.|$|E
25|$|After {{researchers}} provoked {{volunteers to}} disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs {{has found that}} those whose belief in free will had been eroded {{were more likely to}} cheat. In a study conducted by Roy Baumeister, after participants read an article arguing against free will, {{they were more likely to}} lie about their <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> test where they would be rewarded with cash. Provoking a rejection of free will has also been associated with increased aggression and less helpful behaviour as well as mindless conformity. Disbelief in free will can even cause people to feel less guilt about transgressions against others.|$|E

25|$|After war ended, 1919 saw Tyldesley {{jump into}} the ranks of the top English batsmen with some solid batting, which {{resulted}} in his nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. Though 1920 was uneven despite a score of 244 against Warwickshire, Tyldesley was already among a large crop of top-class professional batsmen. 1921 saw Tyldesley make his debut in Test cricket; though he was dropped after a poor <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> damp pitch at Trent Bridge. 1922 saw him reach 2,000 runs for the first time. Tyldesley continued until injury kept him out of the last half of 1925. 1926, however, saw Tyldesley scoring 50 or better in 10 consecutive innings.|$|E
25|$|Gerard {{worked his}} way into Trinity College Dublin on the {{strength}} of his <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> correspondence course. In 1970 he was admitted to Trinity College and read for a degree in Pure Mathematics. His brilliant undergraduate career in Trinity College meant that he was awarded a Foundation Scholarship to support his studies. In 1974 he graduated with a First Class Honours BA, and he won the Berkeley Gold Medal. His success at Trinity marked him out as something special and he was soon after awarded the Gulbenkian Scholarship to enable him to study for a PhD in Cambridge University. He acquired this in 1977 and won the Knight Prize for the quality of his research.|$|E
25|$|Johansson {{finished}} a fine third for the struggling Onyx team (a result that meant {{they did not}} have to go through pre-qualifying in the first half of 1990), marveling at the car's <b>performance</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> low-grip track and speaking of optimism for Spain. Nannini finished in fourth, while Pierluigi Martini qualified fifth and finished in that position, also leading for one lap; the only time in the Minardi team's 21-year history that it led a Grand Prix. Tyrrell racing finished in sixth for the 2nd consecutive race, although it was Jonathan Palmer that earned the point for them in Portugal. The new Williamses, however, suffered near-simultaneous and identical motor blow-outs. Up until then they looked promising.|$|E
