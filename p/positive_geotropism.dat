30|$|For seeds with {{medium and}} large morphology, {{it was easier}} for roots to emerge and grow if the {{micropyle}} is directed downward, following <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism.</b> When the micropyle is oriented downward, the roots of the seed grew easily and directly downward, with no need for bending. Therefore, the observed higher speed of germination, mean germination time, mean daily germination, peak value, germination value, and germination percent for seeds sown by positioning the micropyle downward is related to the ease for the radicle to emerge and grow downward in the normal direction. In general, plant roots grow downward for as they are positively geotropic and hydrotropic. Exploration of nutrients from soil and increasing the framework for anchorage are also advantage of the correctly growing roots.|$|E
40|$|A new anatomically {{preserved}} fern, discovered {{from the}} basalmost Carboniferous of Australia, shows a unique combination of very primitive anatomical characters (solid centrarch cauline protostele) with {{the elaboration of}} an original model of the arborescent habit. This plant possessed a false trunk composed of a repetitive branching system of very small stems, which established it as the oldest tree-fern known to date. The potential of this primitive zygopterid fern to produce such an unusual growth form-without real equivalent among living plants-is related to the possession of two kinds of roots that have complementary functional roles: (i) large roots produced by stems with immediate <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism,</b> strongly adapted to mechanical support and water uptake from the soil; and (ii) small roots borne either on large roots or on petiole bases for absorbing humidity inside the false trunk...|$|E
40|$|Rhizophora mangle L., one of {{the most}} common {{mangrove}} species, has an aerial structure system that gives it stability in permanently swampy soils. In fact, these structures, known as "aerial roots" or "stilt roots", have proven to be peculiar branches with <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism,</b> which form a large number of roots when in contact with swampy soils. These organs have a sympodial branching system, wide pith, slightly thickened cortex, collateral vascular bundles, polyarch stele and endarch protoxylem, as in the stem, and a periderm produced by a phellogen at the apex similar to a root cap. They also have the same type of trichosclereid that occurs in the stem, with negative geotropism, unlike true Rhizophora roots, which do not form trichosclereids at all. On the other hand, these branches do not form leaves and in this respect they are similar to roots. These peculiar branches are rhizophores or special root-bearing branches, analogous to those found in Lepidodendrales and other Carboniferous tree ferns that grew in swampy soils...|$|E
30|$|Obviously, with seed germination, {{growth of}} a plant begins. The first root, called the radicle, will grow out of the seed through the {{micropyle}}, and the micropyle {{is part of the}} seed where water imbibes into the seed and enhances germination. Naturally, the shoot of the germinating seed has a negative geotropism, and the radicle has a <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism.</b> In managing seed sowing processes, the orientation of micropyle is related with supporting the upcoming response of the seedling to the stimulus (gravity). The downward curvature of the root tipped toward the center of gravity is influenced by biochemical and environmental factors and is considered as an essential characteristic for plant survival (He and South 2006). According to Coutts (1989), if the root is displaced from its vertical position or the seeds oriented vertically upward with respect to micropyle, the tip of the root bends downward. Similarly, the roots of the seed sown by positioning the micropyle vertically upright have to curve over the seed itself in order to grow in their normal (downward) direction (Fig.  1).|$|E
40|$|Brazilians {{have been}} using the {{underground}} organs of Smilax species in alternative medicine since the 19 th century because of their anti-rheumatic qualities. However, even nowadays, these species are explored only by extractivism. Studies on seed germination and development of these organs could be useful to preserve these plants. After germination, seedling development of Smilax polyantha was analyzed to understand underground stem formation. Furthermore, to analyze the ontogenesis of the underground system, seedlings aged from one to twelve months were sectioned. One {{of the most striking}} features of this species is the presence of two stem branching systems. The plumule gives rise to the first stem branching system with negative geotropism. Its first underground axillary bud sprouted into the other caulinar axis with <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism.</b> The horizontal growth and the subsequent thickening of this underground organ depended on the development of axillary buds from basal nodes of the previous branches. The cotyledonary bud did not {{play a role in the}} underground formation, as previously described in the literature for this genus, but the buds of the basal cataphylls built the second stem branching system. In this study we discuss the terminology and suggest calling this second stem branching system a rhizophore...|$|E
40|$|Flooding stress {{has many}} {{important}} morphological and biochemical effects on plants. Because {{of the importance}} of determination the effects of flooding on the plants and understanding of the tolerance mechanisms, in this research Four-days-old maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings (cv. single cross 704) were exposed to 4, 7 and 10 days flooding stress. At the end of each treatment the roots and shoots of the seedlings were harvested separately. To show the some anatomical, morphological and biochemical changings of the flooding on plants, cross sections of the roots and shoots were studied with light microscope. There was no clear changing in the tissue structures` of leaves and stems of different treatments in comparison with controls, but in the roots of plants aerenchyma had been developed under stress condition especially in the mesocotyl region. The roots of flooded plants grow towards the soil surface despite <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism</b> of control roots. The chlorophyll a and b content and the ratio of chlorophylls a/b have been decreased but the amounts of soluble sugars have been increased in both the roots and shoots of seedlings. We conclude that flooding influences plants growth and life and development of the aerenchyma and vegetative roots help to plants to adapt itself to stress condition. So {{it is very important to}} know which plants are sensitive or tolerant and what are the tolerance mechanisms in the different plants to succeed in agricultural efforts...|$|E
40|$|As plantas do gênero Cordyline possuem estruturas caulinares peculiares geralmente chamadas de rizoma. Um autor do início do século XX sugeriu que havia uma relação entre esse órgão de Cordyline e o órgão formador de raiz de Selaginella. O termo rizóforo foi originalmente cunhado para Selaginella e significa ó̈rgão portador de raízesë também passou a ser aplicado aos órgãos caulinares subterrâneos de Vernonia, Dioscorea e Smilax e ao que tradicionalmente era chamado de raiz aérea em Rhizophora mangle. Recentemente admitiu-se que as estruturas de Cordyline fruticosa são rízóforos, mas nenhum estudo de desenvolvimento foi apresentado a fim de confirmar tal hipótese. Rizóforo é um caule com geotropismo positivo não originário da plúmula do embrião, presente em plantas com sistema caulinar bipolar de ramificação, isto é, a planta possui ramos aéreos, as quais tem geotropismo negativo e formam folhas, e ramos basais, os quais tem geotropismo positivo e formam raízes. Em Cordyline, os rizóforos se desenvolvem a partir de gemas laterais e possuem crescimento secundário do mesmo modo que o eixo aéreo. O espessamento do caule de Cordyline já foi amplamente analisado em sua porção aérea, mas trabalhos a respeito da porção caulinar subterrânea são mais escassos. Esse espessamento é resultado direto e indireto da atuação do periciclo. No corpo primário, o periciclo produz tecido {{vascular}} adicional aumentando o diâmetro do caule concomitante com a atividade meristemática da endoderme. O periciclo ainda é o responsável pela formação do MES, o qual proporciona o espessamento secundário e atua de maneira semelhante na porção aérea e no rizóforo, com pequena variação. A vascularização das raízes adventícias conecta-se à vascularização do caule pelo periciclo durante o crescimento primário e pelo MES durante o crescimento secundário. As características morfológicas e anatômicas do rizóforo estão diretamente relacionadas com uma maior produção de raízes, assim, sua principal função é o aumento da rizosfera. Outras funções importantes dessa estrutura é o acúmulo de reservas e a reprodução vegetativa. O presente estudo averiguou a natureza dos órgãos subterrâneos de Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis e C, spectabilis, através de estudos anatômicos e observações do desenvolvimento ontogenético. Plants of {{the genus}} Cordyline possess distinctive caulinar structures usually known as rhizomes. An author from {{the early twentieth century}} suggested that there was a relationship between this organ in Cordyline and the root-generating organ in Selaginella. The term rhizophore - meaning r̈oot-bearing organ-̈ was coined originally for Selaginella and was later applied to the subterranean stem organs of Vernonia, Dioscorea and Smilax and to the structures traditionally known as aerial roots in Rhizophora mangle. Recently, these structures in Cordyline fruticosa have been categorized as rhizophores, but this hypothesis has not previously been confirmed by any published developmental study. A rhizophore is a stem with <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism</b> which does not arise from the plumule of the embryo, and is present in plants with a stem system having bipolar branching, i. e. with aerial branches, which have negative geotropism and form leaves, and basal branches, which have <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism</b> and form roots. The rhizophores of Cordyline develop from lateral buds and have secondary growth of the same type as in the aerial axis. The stem thickening of Cordyline has already been extensively studied in its aerial parts, but there are few such studies regarding the subterranean part of the stem. This thickening is the direct and indirect result of the activity of the pericycle. In the primary body, the pericycle produces additional vascular tissue, which increases the diameter of the stem concomitant with the meristematic activity of the endodermis. The pericycle is also responsible for the generation of the STM, which provides the secondary thickening and functions in a similar way in the aerial stem and the rhizophore, with little variation. The adventitious roots vascular tissue are connected to the vascular system of the stem by the pericycle during primary growth and by the STM during secondary growth. The morphological and anatomical features of the rhizophore are directly related to an increased production of roots, and thus its main function is the rhizosphere expansion. Beside that, the rhizophore is important as a storage organ and vegetative reproduction. The present study investigated the structure of the subterranean organs of Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis and C. spectabilis by anatomical techniques and observations of their ontogenetic development...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo objetivou verificar a existência de um padrão do desenvolvimento pós-seminal em Poaceae. Para tanto, foram estudadas as seguintes espécies: Olyra humilis Nees (Bambusoideae); Axonopus aureus P. Beauv. e Paspalum polyphyllum Nees ex Trin. (Panicoideae); Chloris elata Nees e Eragrostis solida Desv. (Chloridoideae). Procurou-se também comparar as estruturas da plântula de Poaceae com as demais monocotiledôneas. As espécies estudadas são plantas perenes, rizomatosas, cespitosas e apresentam cariopses de tamanhos diferentes. Apresentam sementes albuminosas; embrião lateral, diferenciado, com raiz endógena (adventícia); cotilédone dividido em hiperfilo (escutelo), bainha reduzida e hipofilo (coleóptilo); coleorriza (raiz primária reduzida) e mesocótilo (eixo localizado entre o escutelo e coleóptilo). A presença de epiblasto (folha embrionária) foi observada em Olyra humilis, Chloris elata e Eragrostis solida. O desenvolvimento pós-seminal é semelhante nas espécies estudadas e forma um padrão em Poaceae. Primeiramente, observa-se a emissão da coleorriza, que cresce no sentido geotrópico positivo, seguida do coleóptilo e plúmula que crescem em sentido contrário, a partir do desenvolvimento do mesocótilo. As primeiras folhas são semelhantes às folhas definitivas (metafilos) das espécies, exceto em Olyra humilis, que são modificadas em catafilos e podem ser interpretadas como caráter basal em Bambusoideae. Raiz primária reduzida (coleorriza) e hipofilo modificado em coleóptilo são considerados caracteres derivados em Poaceae, quando comparados com as demais monocotiledôneas. This {{work has}} aimed {{to verify the}} {{existence}} of a pattern of the post-seminal development in Poaceae. Thus, Olyra humilis Nees (Bambusoideae); Axonopus aureus P. Beauv. e Paspalum polyphyllum Nees ex Trin. (Panicoideae); Chloris elata Nees e Eragrostis solida Desv. (Chloridoideae) have been studied. Besides, it was compared the structures of Poaceae seedlings with those of other monocotyledons. All are perennial, rhizomatous, and cespitous species whose caryopses differ in size. They all present albuminous seeds, lateral and differentiated embryos, with endogenous embryonic (adventitious) root, cotyledons divided into hyperphyll (scutellum), reduced sheath and hypophyll (coleoptile); coleorhiza (reduced primary root); and mesocotyl (axis between the scutellum and the coleoptile). The presence of epiblasts (embryonic leaves) was noticed in Olyra humilis, Chloris elata and Eragrostis solida. Since the post-seminal developmental of all the studied species is similar, it represents a pattern in Poeaceae. The coleorhiza, which shows <b>positive</b> <b>geotropism,</b> grows first, followed by the coleoptile and the plumule, in the opposite direction, which form from the mesocotyl development. In all species, the first leaves are similar to the definitive ones (metaphyll) except Olyra humilis, where they are converted into a cataphyll - probably interpreted as a basal character in Bambusoideae. The reduced primary root (coleorhiza) and the hypophyll, which is modified into a coleoptile, are considered derived features in Poaceae, when compared with the other monocotyledons...|$|E
