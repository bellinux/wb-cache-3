5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth <b>pathogens</b> or invasive life forms {{that do not}} harm its own biosphere. Alien <b>pathogens</b> could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent <b>pathogens</b> from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of <b>pathogens</b> by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of <b>pathogens</b> by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill <b>pathogens.</b> In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested <b>pathogens.</b>|$|E

5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate <b>pathogens,</b> either by attacking larger <b>pathogens</b> through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If <b>pathogens</b> breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy <b>pathogens.</b> Specific defenses respond to particular <b>pathogens</b> recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
30|$|This review {{examines}} {{studies from}} various disciplines to understand <b>pathogen</b> contamination in ambient water bodies. The worldwide prevalence of <b>pathogen</b> contamination {{is a serious}} concern, and enhancing the understanding of major <b>pathogen</b> sources and their significant impacts on water resources is crucial. A considerable number of studies on <b>pathogen</b> contamination have been conducted on a laboratory-scale; more emphasis {{should be given to}} field-scale studies for enhancing the understanding of <b>pathogen</b> interactions in the environment. Developing new models, and improving existing modeling approaches commonly used for predicting water-borne <b>pathogen</b> levels will likely to help in assessing <b>pathogen</b> contamination at watershed-scale. Considering the limited ability of existing models to predict <b>pathogen</b> contamination, improvement and development of new models are needed so that <b>pathogen</b> levels can be predicted more accurately. Integrating knowledge from multiple fields (e.g., hydrology, microbiology, and ecology) would increase the understanding of pollution levels and potential causes of pollution, and can also help devise long-term strategies to improve water quality.|$|R

5|$|Many fungi are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} fungi. Serious <b>pathogens</b> of many {{cultivated}} plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree <b>pathogens</b> such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant <b>pathogens</b> in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous fungi, like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pathogens</b> can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize <b>pathogens.</b> Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific <b>pathogens</b> more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, <b>pathogens</b> or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for <b>pathogens,</b> but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of <b>pathogens</b> as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E

40|$|Strains of the <b>pathogen</b> causing {{bacterial}} blight of kiwifruit in New Zealand, previously {{identified as}} Pseudomonas viridiflava, were examined using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Percentage DNA-DNA reassociation values for {{strains of the}} <b>pathogen,</b> with the type strains representing P. viridiflava and P. savastanoi, and representative strains within P. syringae, were obtained using the S 1 endonuclease method. Strains of the <b>pathogen</b> were most similar to the type strain of P. savastanoi. This similarity was supported by examination of the Delta T-m between representative strains. It is concluded that the <b>pathogen</b> {{can be considered as}} a member of the P. savastanoi genomic species. The <b>pathogen</b> from kiwifruit in New Zealand was also differentiated in genomic terms from P. syringae pv. actinidiae.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} variabilities {{of the effects}} of cold <b>pathogen</b> and cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> on the fractalkine (FKN) mRNA {{expression}} in lung tissues of rats. Methods: Twenty-four Wistar rats of SPF grade were randomly divided into 3 groups: normal temperature group, cold <b>pathogen</b> group and cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> group. There were 8 rats in each group. Rats in normal temperature group were bred at (20 ± 2) ℃ and under normal humidity (50 ％- 55 ％) for 2 h. Rats in cold <b>pathogen</b> group were bred at － 10 ℃ and under normal humidity (50 ％- 55 ％) for 2 h, and the rats in cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> group were bred at － 10 ℃ and under high humidity (90 ％- 100 ％) for 2 h. Rats in the three groups were bred in thermostats under the corresponding conditions {{on the first day of}} experiment, and then the rats in different groups were all bred at normal temperature. Lung specimens in 3 groups were gathered four days later. The behavior and the pathological changes in the lung tissues of rats in different groups were observed. The content of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in lung homogenate was detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. Expression of FKN mRNA in lung homogenate was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The lung tissues of rats in both cold <b>pathogen</b> group and cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> group had various degrees of pathological changes. Compared with normal temperature group, the content of IL- 6 and TNF-α was increased obviously in lung homogenate of rats in both cold <b>pathogen</b> group and cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> group (P< 0. 01). The content of IL- 6 and TNF-α in lung homogenate of rats in cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> group was obviously higher than that in cold <b>pathogen</b> group (P< 0. 01). The RT-PCR results showed a low expression of FKN mRNA in lung tissues of rats in normal temperature group. If the injured lung tissues were aggravated, the expression of FKN mRNA in the lung tissues was elevated. Compared with normal temperature group, FKN mRNA expressions in both cold <b>pathogen</b> group and cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> group were increased obviously (P< 0. 01). FKN mRNA expression in lung homogenate of rats in cold-dampness <b>pathogen</b> group was also obviously higher than that in cold <b>pathogen</b> group (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Cold <b>pathogen</b> can induce lung injury and up-regulate the FKN mRNA expression in lung tissue. Dampness <b>pathogen</b> can up-regulate the FKN mRNA expression through aggravating the injury of lung tissues caused by cold <b>pathogen.</b> FKN has a close relationship with the lung injury...|$|R

5|$|To combat <b>pathogens</b> that {{replicate}} outside cells, antibodies bind to <b>pathogens</b> to link them together, {{causing them}} to agglutinate. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E
5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} <b>pathogens</b> when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to <b>pathogens</b> expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
