5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book.

5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.|$|E

5|$|The stolen {{works were}} {{originally}} purchased by art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924) and {{intended to be}} left on permanent display at the museum {{with the rest of}} her collection. Since the collection and its layout are permanent, empty frames remain hanging both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. Experts are <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> choice of paintings that were stolen, especially since more valuable artwork was untouched. Among the stolen works was The Concert, one of only 34 known works by Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $200 million. Also missing is The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, Rembrandt's only known seascape. Other works by Rembrandt, Degas, Manet, and Flinck were also stolen.|$|E

25|$|Alex {{gradually}} learns more of {{the history}} of the Resistance and is <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that during the war Sim’s forces, and especially Sim himself, appear to have been present and in action at widely separated locations virtually simultaneously.

Alex meets S’Kalian and experiences mind-to-mind contact for the first time. He learns that the Ashiyyur are aware of the “problem” of Sim’s nearly simultaneous appearances in distant places and account for it as human scholars have done, by assuming that Sim’s fleet included as many as three other Dellacondan vessels disguised as the Corsarius, Sim's ship, as a form of psychological warfare.|$|E

500|$|After {{a year in}} existence, {{the band}} had earned a total of $600. They now faced two options: divide the money among the members, or press the {{recordings}} they had made with Zientara at Inner Ear. Choosing the latter, Nelson, Strejcek and MacKaye formed Dischord Records with Groff's help, to release the recordings. The band sent the tapes to a pressing plant in Nashville, Tennessee that specialized in pressing country music records. Initially <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> request to put eight songs on a 7" [...] record, they pressed 1,000 copies.

Released in December 1980, Minor Disturbance was a local success, receiving radio airplay and reviews from fanzines such as Touch and Go, which meant that Dischord now had enough money to release records by other bands.|$|E
500|$|Although Evanescence was {{originally}} promoted in Christian stores, the band later {{made it clear}} that they did not want to be associated with Christian rock.

[...] Meltzer also wrote that even the label [...] "strongly feels that [...] no longer belong in Christian markets." [...] Soon after receiving the letter, many Christian radio stations pulled Fallen songs from their playlists. Terry Hemmings, CEO of the Christian music distributor Provident, was <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> band's about-face: [...] "They clearly understood the album would be sold in these [...] channels."

500|$|Hirokazu Hamamura of Famitsu commended Mischief Makers gameplay, which {{balanced}} its poor character design. Other Famitsu reviewers admired Treasure's signature robot {{designs and}} were <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> company's choice to use buttons {{instead of the}} 3D analog stick. Nintendo Life Jamie O'Neill praised the game's characters and disliked the controls. He compared the Calina character {{to the role of}} Shadow Mario in Super Mario Sunshine. O'Neill wrote that the intricate controls were [...] "the antithesis of a friendly, approachable, and intuitive platformer" [...] because the game used every button on the controller (including the directional pad), though he felt that players who persevered through the difficult controls would find them [...] "inventive and unique". He added that the complex controls allowed for experimentation that led to new and fun gameplay, and though the throwing enemies mechanic seemed to follow from Gunstar Heroes, the Clanball platforming was unintuitive. John Harris of Gamasutra wrote that the game borrowed other elements from Gunstar Heroes, as the games were similar in protagonists, collectible gems, and bosses. As the game took time to learn and understand, O'Neill left the reader to decide whether the game was [...] "ultimately convoluted or bordering on sophistication and genius".|$|E
500|$|In {{pursuit of}} his plans, Jardine took advice on fielding {{positions}} from Frank Foster, who had bowled {{a form of}} medium-fast leg theory during the 1911–12 series in Australia with much success, taking 32 wickets at 21.63. Larwood did not at the time consider Jardine's proposed tactics as either novel or controversial. His priority was to contain Bradman, so [...] "any scheme that would keep him in check appealed to me a great deal". In county matches following the Piccadilly Hotel dinner, Larwood and Voce tried the tactics out, with mixed results. Two Essex batsmen sustained injuries as their side struggled with the unfamiliar bowling, at one stage losing 8 wickets for 52 runs. However, Glamorgan, reckoned to be a weak batting side, scored more than 500 against the experimental attack; spectators, including the future cricket writer and commentator John Arlott, were <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ineffectiveness of the bowling. Arlott later reasoned that what appeared weak bowling on English pitches would be a different proposition on the much faster Australian pitches. Hostile fast bowling was not confined to Larwood and Voce; in Yorkshire's match against Surrey at The Oval, Bill Bowes bowled a series of bouncers, bringing protests from Hobbs and press criticism from Warner.|$|E
500|$|Sifton's {{first foray}} into {{politics}} was in 1878, when he campaigned for the introduction of prohibition {{under the auspices of}} the Canada Temperance Act in the Manitoba electoral districts of Lisgar and Marquette. [...] His first bid for elected office took place in 1882, when he was elected to Brandon's first city council. [...] He was re-elected in 1883, and did not seek re-election at the conclusion of this second term, though he did briefly consider running for mayor before concluding that he had insufficient support to be elected. [...] He also served on the local school board. [...] When his brother Clifford became Wilfrid Laurier's Minister of the Interior in November 1896, Sifton advised him on Liberal Party affairs in western Canada. [...] This advice included suggested patronage appointments, one of which was an unimplemented proposal that Arthur himself be appointed chief justice of the Northwest Territories (a position that did not at the time exist). [...] In 1898, Sifton re-entered politics—Hall speculates to increase his chances at a judgeship—by challenging Robert Brett, the long-time Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories for Banff, in the 1898 territorial election. [...] Election day returns showed Sifton with a plurality of thirty-six votes, but by the time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for Brett. [...] Sifton successfully challenged this result in court, and in the ensuing by-election he defeated Brett by a comfortable margin. [...] One oft-repeated anecdote from the campaign involved a campaign forum for which Brett was late. [...] After giving his own speech, Sifton offered to give the still-absent Brett's speech as well, since he had heard it so many times. [...] He did so, and when Brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to the one Sifton had given on his behalf he was <b>puzzled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> audience's amusement.|$|E

And then, the connection relationships are calculated according to the piece boundary shape matching and image merging. Finally, the connection relationships among the pieces are recovered. This paper, as the first part, is limited to describe the jigsaw piece extraction, the jigsaw piece model construction, the corner point detection, and the piece classification and recognition...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{test the}} {{momentum}} {{effect in the}} Spanish stock market during the 1990 s. Though {{there is evidence of}} momentum, it disappears after the 1997 crisis.
