40|$|The rapid {{intravenous}} administration to mice of <b>pirbenicillin,</b> carbenicillin, and ampicillin produced biexponential blood concentration-time curves when assessed by frequent blood samplings at short intervals. The pharmacokinetic behavior of <b>pirbenicillin</b> {{and the other}} penicillins was analyzed by the two-compartment open model. This {{is thought to be}} the first study giving detailed pharmacokinetic values of penicillins in mice. Some significant differences were noted between the pharmacokinetic values of <b>pirbenicillin,</b> ampicillin, and carbenicillin. These values suggest that the interchange of <b>pirbenicillin</b> between the central and peripheral body compartments of the mouse was slower than that of either carbenicillin or ampicillin and indicated that a greater fraction of the <b>pirbenicillin</b> than the ampicillin dose reached the peripheral compartment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirbenicillin</b> { 6 -[d- 2 -phenyl- 2 (N- 4 -pyridylformimidoylaminoacetamido) -acetamido]-penicillanic acid} showed broad-spectrum {{antibacterial}} activity in vitro {{and also in}} the treatment of experimental infections after parenteral administration to mice. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a three- to fourfold potency advantage over carbenicillin was seen both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of <b>pirbenicillin</b> includes Escherichia coli, Serratia, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter isolates, against which it exhibited minimal inhibitory concentration values comparable to those of carbenicillin. However, mice infected with E. coli and Serratia were protected at doses of <b>pirbenicillin</b> that were two to four times lower than those required of carbenicillin. <b>Pirbenicillin</b> was more active than carbenicillin against gram-positive bacteria, especially Streptococcus faecalis. It was less active than carbenicillin against Proteus spp. and was inactive against ampicillin-resistant E. coli strains. <b>Pirbenicillin</b> was bactericidal at concentrations generally equal to or only two-fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration. With appropriately buffered media, <b>pirbenicillin</b> demonstrated eight- and fourfold better minimal bactericidal concentration values towards Pseudomonas isolates than those of carbenicillin and ticarcillin, respectively...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirbenicillin</b> {{is a new}} semisynthetic {{penicillin}} which inhibited 67 % of isolates of Proteus aeruginosa {{tested in}} our laboratory, 93 % of P. mirabilis, 31 % of Enterobacter spp., 41 % of Serratia spp., and 58 % of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 6. 25 μg/ml. Its activity appeared to be inoculum dependent and it was virtually inactive against 107 inocula of P. aeruginosa. It was more active than carbenicillin or ticarcillin, but less active than BL-P 1654 against P. aeruginosa. Carbenicillin and ticarcillin appeared to be more active than <b>pirbenicillin</b> against Proteus spp., but <b>pirbenicillin</b> was active against some isolates of Klebsiella spp...|$|E
40|$|The new penicillin, <b>pirbenicillin,</b> {{was found}} to be 8 to 16 times more active than {{carbenicillin}} against many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was uniformly less active against indole-positive Proteus spp. The intrinsic activity of the new anti-biotic against ampicillin-sensitive Escherichia coli was intermediate between those of ampicillin and carbenicillin. No unusual activity of <b>pirbenicillin</b> was detected amongst a group of enterobacteria previously shown to exhibit distinct patterns of resistance to ft-lactam antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirbenicillin,</b> a semi-synthetic penicillin, {{structurally}} {{related to}} ampicillin, was investigated {{as to its}} in vitro activity. The drug was found to exhibit {{a higher degree of}} activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, being approximately eight times more active than carbenicillin and four times more active than ticarcillin. The new drug was about fourfold more active than carbenicillin against other Entero-bacteriaceae with the exception of Proteus spp. The drug is somewhat more stable in serum than carbenicillin. <b>Pirbenicillin</b> does not appear to inactivate gentamicin as rapidly as carbenicillin...|$|E
40|$|Minimum {{inhibitory}} concentrations (MIC) of <b>pirbenicillin</b> against 135 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were {{one-fourth of}} those required for carbenicillin but two {{times higher than}} those for BL-P 1654. Increasing the inoculum size produced an adverse effect on the bactericidal activity for all three antibiotics. This was more apparent for <b>pirbenicillin</b> than for carbenicillin, but less than the effect on BL-P 1654. When concentrations of antibiotics likely to be achieved clinically were used, gentamicin increased the inhibitory and bactericidal effects of all three semisynthetic penicillins {{for the majority of}} isolates. Strains highly resistant to the aminoglycoside antibiotic, however, were inhibited no more by the penicillin-gentamicin combinations than by the most effective of the antibiotics alone...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirbenicillin,</b> a semisynthetic penicillin, showed {{greater in}} vitro {{activity}} against 68 recent isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa than did ticarcillin or carbenicillin. The median {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} {{of each of these}} three compounds, respectively, was 3. 1, 12. 5, and 25 μg/ml when a 10 − 4 dilution of an overnight culture (about 105 colony-forming units [CFU]/ml) was used as inoculum, but these differences were less striking when larger inocula were used: at 107 CFU/ml these values were 6. 25, 12. 5, and 50 μg/ml, and at 108 to 109 CFU/ml these values were 50, 50, and 100 μg/ml. All three compounds showed greater inhibitory activity at pH 6 than at pH 8. This pH effect was greatest with <b>pirbenicillin,</b> for 6. 25 μg of <b>pirbenicillin</b> per ml inhibited 7, 11, and 57 % of the strains at pH 6, 7, and 8, respectively; these values were 4, 4, and 11 % with ticarcillin and 0, 0, and 7 % with carbenicillin. At sufficient inhibitory concentrations, the rates of bacterial killing of the three compounds were similar. The observed differences in anti-pseudomonad activity were not due to differences in stability to pseudomonad β-lactamases, but all three compounds were more stable than were cefazolin, cephaloridine, and benzylpenicillin...|$|E
40|$|To {{measure the}} {{susceptibility}} of penicillin-resistant pneumococci to newer beta-lactam agents, we evaluated 54 selected strains recovered from patients with bacteremia or meningitis. Three groups of pneumococci were tested: penicillin-susceptible strains, strains with intermediate penicillin resistance, and penicillin-resistant strains. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of benzyl penicillin, oxacillin, cephalothin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, moxalactam (LY 127935), cefotaxime (HR 756), piperacillin, <b>pirbenicillin,</b> N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK 0787), cefoperazone (T 1551), mezlocillin, azlocillin, and mecillinam were determined. For all groups of pneumococci tested, cefotaxime, and particularly thienamycin, {{had the greatest}} activity. Piperacillin, mezlocillin, and azlocillin had activity {{similar to that of}} benzyl penicillin. Cefoperazone had less activity than penicillin against strains with penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than 1 microgram/ml but greater activity than penicillin against strains with greater resistance. Oxacillin, cephalothin, cefamandole, and <b>pirbenicillin</b> all had less activity for each group of pneumococci tested; moxalactam, cefoxitin, and mecillinam had the least activity. The relative differences in susceptibility to penicillin of each group of pneumococci tested were similar for each of the beta-lactam agents tested. The clinical effectiveness of cefotaxime and thienamycin for therapy of disease due to penicillin-resistant pneumococci needs further evaluation, and of particular interest will be the levels of these drugs which can be achieved in cerebrospinal fluid...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of azlocillin and mezlocillin {{were compared with}} those of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and <b>pirbenicillin</b> against a wide range of gram-negative organisms. The two new drugs were considerably more active than carbenicillin against Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli. Carbenicillin was twice as active against Proteus mirabilis as mezlocillin and four times as active as azlocillin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, azlocillin was eight times as active as carbenicillin. Azlocillin and mezlocillin were twice as active as carbenicillin against Bacteroides fragilis, and these drugs showed a high degree of activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae...|$|E
40|$|Peptidoglycan {{transpeptidase}} {{activity has}} been studied in cells of Escherichia coli 146 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56 made permeable to exogenous, nucleotide-sugar peptidoglycan precursors by ether treatment. Transpeptidase activity was inhibited, in both organisms, by a range of penicillins and cephalosporins, the Pseudomonas enzyme being more sensitive to inhibition in each case. Conversely, growth of E. coli 146 was more susceptible to these antibiotics than growth of P. aeruginosa 56. Furthermore, similar transpeptidase inhibition values were ob-obtained for the four penicillins examined against the Pseudomonas enzyme, although only two of these (carbenicillin and <b>pirbenicillin)</b> inhibited the growth of this organism. We therefore conclude that the high resistance of P. aeruginosa 56 to growth inhibition by most β-lactam antibiotics cannot be due to an insensitive peptidoglycan transpeptidase...|$|E
