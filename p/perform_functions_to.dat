50|$|IDEF8, or {{integrated}} {{definition for}} human-system interaction design, {{is a method}} for producing high-quality designs of interactions between users and the systems they operate. Systems are characterized {{as a collection of}} objects that <b>perform</b> <b>functions</b> <b>to</b> accomplish a particular goal. The system with which the user interacts can be any system, not necessarily a computer program. Human-system interactions are designed at three levels of specification within the IDEF8 method. The first level defines the philosophy of system operation and produces a set of models and textual descriptions of overall system processes. The second level of design specifies role-centered scenarios of system use. The third level of IDEF8 design is for human-system design detailing. At this level of design, IDEF8 provides a library of metaphors to help users and designers specify the desired behavior in terms of other objects whose behavior is more familiar. Metaphors provide a model of abstract concepts in terms of familiar, concrete objects and experiences.|$|E
40|$|Intelligent {{software}} agents can {{exchange information}} and knowledge {{in a way}} similar to humans by using different methods of communication. This paper shows how different agent communication languages provide varying amounts of information richness similar to different media providing various amounts of information richness for humans. Agents, by definition, may <b>perform</b> <b>functions</b> <b>to</b> assist humans or other agents. Thus, {{it is imperative to}} have sufficient information richness between agents, between humans, and between humans and agents. Information richness theory and media richness theory provide the theoretic foundation of this paper. In the last decade, researchers have based most agent development upon highly complex artificial intelligence, rather than on simpler information system theories. I propose that the Extensible Markup Language (XML) ensemble provides sufficient information richness as an agent communication language to be the catalyst for secure business-to-business electronic commerce (B 2 BEC) on the Web...|$|E
