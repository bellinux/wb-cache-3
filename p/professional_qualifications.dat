Members of the IC must minimally possess <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications</b> or accounting/auditing work experience, and cannot be related to members of the ownership or executive bodies.

25|$|Institutionalized {{cultural}} capital comprises an institution's formal {{recognition of a}} person's {{cultural capital}}, usually academic credentials or <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications.</b> The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is {{in the labor market}} (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as qualitative and quantitative measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into economic capital, by serving as a heuristic (practical solution) with which the seller can describe his or her cultural capital to the buyer.|$|E

25|$|Homeopathy {{is fairly}} common in some {{countries}} while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated {{in some countries}} and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications</b> and licences are needed in most countries. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training programme, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.|$|E
25|$|The second {{main feature}} was for rights of audience. Mackay {{proposed}} that all lawyers, whether barristers or solicitors, should require {{a certificate of}} competence {{to work in the}} higher courts, while their initial <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications</b> would allow them to practice in the lower courts. This proposal allowed solicitors to gain full rights of audience up to the House of Lords with the appropriate certification, and was widely disliked by barristers and judges. The idea that barristers would not automatically have rights of audience also irritated them, and the idea that the Lord Chancellor would be responsible for defining which bodies could grant these certificates undermined the principle that the legal profession should be independent from the Government.|$|E
25|$|Women outnumbered men {{in every}} age group besides 15 and under; the {{imbalance}} was most severe in the 25-39 age group, with only 71 men for every 100 women. This gender gap is mainly {{the result of}} the so-called astronaut family phenomenon, also seen among Chinese New Zealanders and Koreans in other countries, in which male heads of households who found their earning power decreased after emigration returned to their country of origin while their wives and children remained in the destination country. Although many heads of households qualified for New Zealand immigration due to their <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications,</b> they find only unskilled work is available to them due to their poor English skills. The high levels of unemployment among Koreans in New Zealand mean that their median personal income was only NZ$5,700, according to Department of Labour statistics.|$|E

500|$|In a {{newspaper}} interview {{shortly before his}} retirement, Raw identified the 1953 London-to-Christchurch air race as being a highlight of his career.

Raw further stated that there was a need to improve the defences of northern Australia on the grounds that [...] "political situations can change overnight". On 15 July 1988 Raw died of lymphoma at Richmond in Melbourne. He was subsequently cremated. Raw's Australian Dictionary of Biography entry summarises his career by noting that he was [...] "considered to be genial, exuberant, popular and efficient" [...] and [...] "proved to be the type of officer who worked best under pressure".|$|E
500|$|Mather, {{who wanted}} someone to help {{publicize}} {{the need for an}} independent agency to oversee the national parks movement, personally paid Yard's salary from his independent income. [...] The United States had authorized 14 parks and 22 monuments over the previous forty years (1872–1915), but there was no single agency to provide unified management of the resources. [...] In addition, some resources were managed by political appointees without <b>professional</b> <b>qualifications.</b> [...] Together Mather and Yard ran a national parks publicity campaign for the Department of the Interior, writing numerous articles that praised the scenic qualities of the parks and their possibilities for educational, inspirational and recreational benefits. [...] The unprecedented press coverage persuaded influential Americans about the importance of national parks, and encouraged Congress to create an independent parks agency.|$|E
