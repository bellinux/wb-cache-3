5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity <b>portfolio</b> is quite close to the {{tangency}} <b>portfolio,</b> as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity <b>portfolio</b> on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity <b>portfolio</b> is near the tangency <b>portfolio</b> but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity <b>portfolio</b> has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
30|$|Similar to FF {{three factors}} that are {{constructed}} using the 6 value-weighted <b>portfolios</b> formed on size and B/M equity ratio 4, the FF five factors are constructed on Chinese A-share stock market using the 6 value-weighted <b>portfolios</b> formed on size and book-to-price (Size-B/P <b>portfolios),</b> the 6 value-weighted <b>portfolios</b> formed on size and operating profitability (Size-OP <b>portfolios),</b> and the 6 value-weighted <b>portfolios</b> formed on size and investment (Size-Inv <b>portfolios).</b> The Size-OP <b>portfolios</b> and Size-Inv <b>portfolios</b> are formed {{in the same way}} as the Size-B/M <b>portfolios,</b> except that the second sort variable is operating profitability or investment. At the end of each June, the intersections of two <b>portfolios</b> formed on size, small (S) and big (B), and three <b>portfolios</b> formed on profitability, weak profitability (W), neutral profitability (N), and robust profitability (R), are constructed into six “Size-OP” portfolios: SW, SN, SR, BW, BN, and BR 5. Similarly, the “Size-Inv” <b>portfolios,</b> which are also constructed at the end of each June, are the intersections of two <b>portfolios</b> formed on size and three <b>portfolios</b> formed on investment, conservative investment (C), neutral investment (N), and aggressive investment (A). Thus, the six Size-Inv <b>portfolios</b> are constructed: SC, SN, SA, BC, BN, and BA 6.|$|R
40|$|We {{test for}} {{lead-lag}} {{effects in the}} mean and variance among size-sorted <b>portfolios</b> for the UK stock market. We construct three sets of <b>portfolios,</b> namely a set of size-sorted equally-weighted <b>portfolios</b> of different capitalization size, a set of size-sorted value-weighted <b>portfolios</b> of different capitalization size, and a third set of <b>portfolios</b> of the same capitalization size. The recently proposed Cross Correlation Function test is employed. For both sets of <b>portfolios</b> with different capitalization size, we find evidence of a lead effect in both the mean and the variance from large-firm <b>portfolios</b> to small-firm <b>portfolios.</b> This result {{does not depend on}} the weighting scheme used to construct <b>portfolios,</b> and indicates that contrarian trading strategies on large-firm <b>portfolios</b> are profitable. For <b>portfolios</b> of equal capitalization size, there is hardly any evidence of a lead-lag effect in either the mean or the variance. This suggests that the lead-lag effect is due to the difference in the capitalization size among <b>portfolios.</b> Â© Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} provide a {{framework}} for separation <b>portfolios</b> when they are used not only as synthetics of a matching security but also as building blocks of arbitrage <b>portfolios,</b> in a background provided by the CAPM world. Firstly, synthetics are defined by means of a vectorial framework that maps <b>portfolios</b> onto their risk-return profiles. Separation <b>portfolios</b> are extensively analyzed afterwards, establishing three propositions that lay the groundwork for using them as synthetics. Next, a distinction is brought about between plain separation <b>portfolios</b> (which are located on the Capital Market Line) and enlarged separation <b>portfolios</b> (which lie outside the CML). Furthermore, it is shown that simple separation <b>portfolios</b> become synthetics in few cases only, whereas enlarged <b>portfolios</b> allow for synthetics in much wider contexts. Later, arbitrage <b>portfolios</b> are designed by means of simple separation <b>portfolios</b> {{in the context of the}} Security Market Line, and also by resorting to the enlarged ones without requiring the SML as a benchmark. Finally, the discussion extends over bond <b>portfolios</b> in the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) environment, to embody their risky features into the viewpoint set forth in the paper...|$|R

5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional <b>portfolio</b> allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the <b>portfolio</b> (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity <b>portfolio</b> are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, and passive management.|$|E
