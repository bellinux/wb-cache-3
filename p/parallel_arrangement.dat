5|$|Suillus intermedius, {{found in}} northeastern and {{northern}} North America, {{is similar in}} appearance to S.salmonicolor. It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a ring that is neither as thick nor as wide as S.salmonicolor. It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to , and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised. Although {{it has not been}} definitively established whether S.cothurnatus is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from S.salmonicolor: a thinner, less rubbery veil that usually lacks a thickened cottony roll at the base; glandular dots on the stem that consist of bundles of multiseptate hyphae in a <b>parallel</b> <b>arrangement</b> ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60–140μm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases. Other Suillus species with which S.salmonicolor might be confused include S.acidus and S.subalutaceus. Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.|$|E

25|$|In a <b>parallel</b> <b>arrangement,</b> {{all of the}} N-termini of {{successive}} strands are oriented in {{the same}} direction; this orientation may be slightly less stable because it introduces nonplanarity in the inter-strand hydrogen bonding pattern. The dihedral angles (φ,ψ) are about (–120°,115°) in parallel sheets. It is rare to find less than five interacting parallel strands in a motif, suggesting that {{a smaller number of}} strands may be unstable, however it is also fundamentally more difficult for parallel β-sheets to form because strands with N and C termini aligned necessarily must be very distant in sequence. There is also evidence that parallel β-sheet may be more stable since small amyloidogenic sequences appear to generally aggregate into β-sheet fibrils composed of primarily parallel β-sheet strands, where one would expect anti-parallel fibrils if anti-parallel were more stable.|$|E

Thus a diverter valve must be employed to vent turbocharger air until it has reached the pressure in the intake manifold. Complex or expensive electronic controls are usually necessary to ensure smooth power delivery.|$|R
