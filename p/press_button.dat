50|$|The implicit-association test (IAT) {{measures}} differential {{associations of}} two target concepts.Subjects are instructed to {{press a button}} when they see an item (an image or word) that represents a particular concept, and a different button for items that represent another concept. For instance, a subject may <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for words related to weakness and button B for words related to strength. Then subjects may be instructed to <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for male words (he, boy) and button B for female words (she, girl). To test differential association between these two concepts (in this example, strength/weakness and gender), these two tasks would be combined. First, subjects would <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for strength or male, and button B for weakness and female; then they would <b>press</b> <b>button</b> A for strength and female, and button B for weakness and male. Differential reaction time to each task may reveal implicit endorsement of that stereotype. For example, if a subject's reaction time is faster when male is paired with science and female is paired with arts, this suggests the subject more strongly associates males with science than females.|$|E

50|$|This game uses basic shooter mechanics. <b>Press</b> <b>button</b> 1 to fire normal weapons; {{this can}} be {{upgraded}} by collecting P or the rare F items, though the maximum power level has a hidden ammo count, after which you {{will return to the}} previous power level. <b>Press</b> <b>button</b> 2 to use a powerful special attack; uses are limited to how many B items you've collected (every life starts with two). Some ground enemies will drop score items when destroyed; interestingly, they appear as the currency of the selected character's nation.

He lands in a cornfield in Seattle. He decided to kill Tharn. Moments later Tharn appears and, when Kelvin <b>pressed</b> the <b>button,</b> he died. Kelvin <b>pressed</b> the <b>button</b> again and returned to the lab with the bald scientist who informed him that he was now a millionaire.

50|$|Schrade Cutlery Company had {{its roots}} in the New York <b>Press</b> <b>Button</b> Knife Company, formed in 1892 by George Schrade, an {{inventor}} from Sheffield, England. Unable to raise sufficient capital to begin knife production, Schrade sold a partial interest in the company to the Walden Knife Company. The company's unusual name arose from its first knife design, a switchblade or automatic-opening pocket knife with an operating button mounted in the knife bolster. First patented by Schrade in 1892, the knife was eventually produced with a unique style of clip point blade. In 1903, Schrade sold all of his interest in the New York <b>Press</b> <b>Button</b> Knife Co. to Walden Knife Company. The following year, Schrade formed the Schrade Cutlery Company in Walden.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{commercial}} {{development of the}} switchblade knife was primarily dominated by the inventions of George Schrade and his New York <b>Press</b> <b>Button</b> Knife Company, though W.R. Case, Union Cutlery, Camillus Cutlery, and other U.S. knife manufacturers also marketed automatic knives of their own design. Most of Schrade's switchblade patterns were automatic versions of utilitarian jackknives and pocket knives, as well as smaller penknife models designed to appeal to women buyers. In 1903, Schrade sold {{his interest in the}} New York <b>Press</b> <b>Button</b> Knife Co. to the Walden Knife Co., and moved to Walden, New York, where he opened a new factory. There Schrade became the company's production superintendent, establishing a production line to manufacture several patterns of Schrade-designed switchblade knives, ranging from a large folding hunter to a small pocket knife. Walden Knife Co. would go on to sell thousands of copies of Schrade's original bolster button design.|$|E
5000|$|Sifa {{is short}} for Sicherheitsfahrschaltung, German for [...] "safety driving switch". It is usually a pedal and/or large <b>press</b> <b>button,</b> which {{monitors}} the alertness of the driver. The driver has to repeatedly press a button after a fixed interval; if he fails to do so, the train will carry out an emergency-stop. It complements the external train safety systems: PZB, LZB and ETCS.|$|E
50|$|The FW15C used a semi {{automatic}} transmission {{very similar to}} the FW14B, but with changes to the hydraulic activation system. A <b>press</b> <b>button</b> starting device by means of which the clutch comes under automatic control, attracted the drivers unreserved approval during a succession of tests, but they did not use it in races, preferring the notional, psychological reassurance of controlling the clutch pedal at the start.|$|E

50|$|In 1892, George Schrade, a {{toolmaker}} and machinist from New York {{developed and}} patented {{the first of}} several practical automatic knife designs. The following year, Schrade founded the New York <b>Press</b> <b>Button</b> Knife Company to manufacture his switchblade knife pattern, which had a unique release button mounted in the knife bolster. Schrade's company operated out of a small workshop in New York City and employed about a dozen workmen.|$|E

50|$|The former {{entrance}} {{building was}} built in 1848 and 1849 in the Neoclassical style. It was expanded in 1896. There is a memorial stone dedicated to the House of Wittelsbach on the station forecourt. It consists of an iron plate and was erected in 1880. The entrance building and the memorial stone are both classified as historical monuments. The station itself was previously controlled by a Siemens <b>press</b> <b>button</b> relay interlocking without automatic route-setting, which is now out of operation.|$|E

50|$|The game {{contains}} {{very similar}} gameplay {{to the previous}} games, with the similar 'point and click' approach. However, it has fewer hotkeys compared to the previous instalment, and the user has to <b>press</b> <b>buttons</b> {{at the bottom of}} the screen on the action bar.|$|R
50|$|You {{take control}} of a little car that must avoid the other cars, as {{they will try to}} take you out of the road. You must be careful with the slopes too, as they might be {{dangerous}} at a high speed. Additionally, the car can jump to avoid the cars and to finish the course, as the finish is after a roadless zone. If you manage to time your jump, <b>press</b> <b>button</b> two to free the parachute and land safely. After you finish the four courses, the game will start again with increased difficulty.|$|E
50|$|The game {{consists}} of 5 championships {{with their own}} stages. The first stage type is a wrestling ring where the opponents can bounce from the edges and can be out of bounds. The second stage type is street wrestling, where there are objects to destroy and weapons to wield. The last stage is the electrictity stage where the borders are harmful and weapons are used. Press the A button to punch. Press the B button to kick. Press the C button to jump. Press the A and B buttons simultaneously for a quick moving retreat. Pull the joystick twice in a direction to rush that way. If the player rushes {{in the direction of}} a boxing ring edge, they can bounce back. If the player is down, repeatedly press the A button and pull the joystick left and right to get up. Press the C button to body drop on a downed opponent. Press the A button many times rapidly to use a special attack. <b>Press</b> <b>Button</b> A or B on a downed opponent to grab and wrestle. When the player and opponent clash in a wrestle, press the A and B buttons as fast as possible to push back. <b>Press</b> <b>Button</b> D to pin down a downed opponent and hold him for 3 seconds to win.Alternatively, some fighters have holds which can force an opponent with low stamina to submit.|$|E
50|$|One {{variation}} was the <b>press</b> <b>button</b> can, {{which featured}} two pre-cut buttons—one small and one large—in {{the top of}} the can sealed with a plastic membrane. These buttons were held closed by the outward pressure of the carbonated beverage. The consumer would open the can by depressing both buttons, which would result in two holes. The small hole would act as a vent to relieve internal pressure so the larger button could then be pressed down to create the hole used for drinking the beverage. Consumers could also easily cut themselves on the edges of the holes or get their fingers stuck.|$|E
