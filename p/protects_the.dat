5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is a {{de facto}} condominium, governed by parties to the Antarctic Treaty System that have {{consulting}} status.

5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Copper, a bloodhound crossbred, {{was once}} the {{favorite}} among his Master's pack of hunting dogs in a rural country area. However, he now feels threatened by Chief, a younger, faster Black and Tan Coonhound. Copper hates Chief, who is taking Copper's place as pack leader. During a bear hunt, Chief <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> Master when the bear turns on him, while Copper is too afraid of the bear to confront him. The Master ignores Copper to heap praise on Chief and Copper's hatred and jealousy grow.|$|E
5|$|Factors that {{increase}} the risk of polio infection or affect the severity of the disease include immune deficiency, malnutrition, physical activity immediately following the onset of paralysis, skeletal muscle injury due to injection of vaccines or therapeutic agents, and pregnancy. Although the virus can cross the maternal-fetal barrier during pregnancy, the fetus {{does not appear to be}} affected by either maternal infection or polio vaccination. Maternal antibodies also cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> infant from polio infection during the first few months of life.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> weaker limestone underneath.|$|E

5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from {{others of the}} same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories <b>protects</b> <b>the</b> food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E
