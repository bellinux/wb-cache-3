40|$|This {{research}} work is {{an investigation of}} active and passive methods to reduce rollover tendency of a three wheeled platform. This configuration is common in small to medium aircraft landing gears, mobile robots, and fuel efficient futuristic concept vehicles. In developing countries three wheeled vehicles (TWV) have a significant share in point to point public transport. Such vehicles have a higher rollover risk resulting in significant single vehicle fatal crashes, and thus are {{the main focus of}} the current research. In Delta configuration the front single wheel offers no roll resistance, hence no lateral load transfer takes place during cornering at the front axle. The effect on directional behaviour is evaluated for this unique lateral load transfer setup. Dynamics of the vehicle are studied in the state space spanned by the yaw rate and side slip angle. These states encompass the directional behaviour of the vehicle fairly well. The effect on roll over and directional behaviour is assessed. For aircraft tricycle landing gears limit handling behaviour in the form of over-steering behaviour appears much before an un-tripped rollover. This is also observed for existing commercial three wheeled vehicles used for public transport when operated on low friction surfaces. This results in immediate loss of control resulting in collision with other vehicles or road sides resulting in tripped rollovers. Factor effecting passive rollover propensity are related to possible changes in directional response of the vehicle. For delta configuration vehicles, braking unloads the rear axle, reducing the lateral load transfer required for rollover. Due relatively low yaw inertia the vehicle response to steering inputs is also better for three wheeled platforms. Based on these observations an active front steering based sliding mode controller is presented for rollover prevention. A vehicle model for direct control of roll angle using steering as an input is developed. An adapting reference based on roll angle at steady state conditions corresponding to a threshold lateral load transfer ratio, is used for sliding surface design. The robustness of the controller is demonstrated using a nonlinear model of CarSim software. The yaw rate error introduced by increasing the turn radius by the controller is than compensated using a brake based system. Both differential braking based Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and <b>proportional</b> <b>braking</b> are evaluated for efficacy. Giving a higher priority to rollover mitigation, the active front steering is always activated after a threshold lateral load transfer value. The brake based systems are also evaluated for directional control of the vehicle on low friction surfaces. A rule based integration scheme based upon performance of the steering and brake based controllers is proposed. Standard critical driving maneuvers are used to gauge efficacy of the integrated controller...|$|E
5000|$|Before ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) came to {{trucks in}} the 1980s, most TBCs were {{activated}} by the trucks' brake hydraulic action. In an emergency {{situation with the}} trucks ABS activated, Ford's TowCommand can automatically reduce the trailer brake pressure (gain) as it communicates with the truck's computer for faster reaction time with <b>proportional</b> trailer <b>brake</b> control, to prevent the trailer brakes from locking up even though trailers do not have ABS sensors. TowCommand will also inform the driver with an audible alarm and in the digital readout if the trailer wires and/or trailer disconnects from the truck. Next to the TowCommand is an empty storage tray or the $85 optional 4 AUX (auxiliary) toggle switches for winches, snow plow, off-road lights, etc.|$|R
50|$|Gordon Murray {{attempted}} to utilise carbon brakes for the F1, but found the technology not mature enough at the time; {{with one of}} the major culprits being that of a <b>proportional</b> relationship between <b>brake</b> disc temperature and friction—i.e. stopping power—thus resulting in relatively poor brake performance without an initial warm-up of the brakes before use.Since carbon brakes have a more simplified application envelope in pure racing environments, this allows for the racing edition of the machine, the F1 GTR, to feature ceramic carbon brakes.|$|R
40|$|Prediction {{of vehicle}} disc brake {{roughness}} noise is a non-trivial challenge. In fact, neither the source mechanisms, nor the transfer paths {{are so far}} well understood. Traditionally, disc brake noise problems are studied {{as part of the}} friction-induced noise field, where the source {{is considered to be a}} more or less local phenomenon related to the brake disc and brake pad. However, for the roughness noise of interest here this viewpoint is not adequate when attempting to solve the interior noise problem since the transfer of vibro-energy from the brake into the vehicle body is a crucial aspect and plays an important role in the understanding and solution to the problem. The vibroacoustic energy transfer associated with the brake roughness noise is a problem where geometrical complexity and material combinations, including rubber bushings, pose an intricate modelling problem. Additionally, system altering effects from moving parts and loadings are important, e. g. due to the steering or brake systems. In addition, the source mechanisms themselves must also be understood to be able to solve the problem. The current work constitutes a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, aiming at an increased understanding of the source, the transfer paths and how they are a affected by change in the operational state. The experimental study of the vehicle disc brake roughness noise, is based on measurements conducted in a laboratory using a complete passenger car. It is found that the interior noise is a structural-borne broadband noise event well correlated to vehicle speed and brake pressure. The results suggest that the friction source may be divided into vibrations created in the sliding direction and vibrations created normal to the contact plane, where the sliding direction levels appear to be <b>proportional</b> to <b>brake</b> pressure according to Coulomb’s friction law; the vibration level in the normal direction of the contact plane on the other hand has behaviour proportional to Hertz contact theory. The measurements also indicate that the brake force created carried by the suspension system when braking will also alter the vibro-acoustic response of the system. To facilitate the theoretical simulations, an approach for modelling of the suspension system is developed. The vibro-acoustic transfer path model developed is using a modal based on the Craig-Bampton method where a restriction on the coupling modes is suggested. The approach suggested uses undeformed coupling interfaces, to couple structures of fundamentally different stiffness such as may be the case in a vehicle suspension system where for instance rubber bushings are combined with steel linking arms. The approach show great potential inreducing computational cost compared to the classical Craig-Bampton method. QC 2011091...|$|R
