40|$|Abstract – This paper {{discusses}} the electricity market price simulation by considering transmission congestion and <b>prohibited</b> operating <b>zones</b> of units. Units with prohib-ited zones are prevented from operating in certain trajec-tories between their minimum and maximum heat rate capacities. Accordingly cost curve of these units are non-convex. The non-convexity could cause numerical difficul-ties when applying conventional methods for generation dispatch such as iteration methods. In this paper, a solu-tion method is {{proposed for the}} generation dispatch prob-lem by considering <b>prohibited</b> <b>zones.</b> The effect of prohib-ited zones on transmission congestion and locational mar-ginal prices (LMPs) is discussed. It is shown that prohib-ited zones could aggravate transmission constraints and result in higher LMPS at critical buses. Furthermore <b>prohibited</b> <b>zones</b> could affect the competitive cost of oper-ating power systems and lead to more conservative pre-ventive actions such as load shedding to enhance the secu-rity of power systems.

40|$|The {{efficient}} and optimum economic operations of {{electric power generation}} systems have always occupied an important position in the electric power industry. This involves allocation of the total load between the available generating units {{in such a way}} that the total cost of operation is kept at a minimum. Network constrained economic dispatch have been applied to obtain optimal fuel cost while satisfying transmission line power flow limits. Similarly generator constrained economic dispatch schedules the outputs of generating units to meet the demand at minimum cost considering the <b>prohibited</b> <b>zones.</b> This paper proposes different types of Genetic Algorithms such as Binary Coded GA, Real Coded GA and Directional Search GA for solving the classical economic dispatch problem. The purpose of Network Constrained Economic Dispatch (NC-ED) and Generator Constrained Economic Dispatch is to minimize the operating fuel cost while satisfying load demand and operational constraints. As such, a Heuristic Algorithm is developed in this paper to adjust the generation output of a unit in order to avoid unit operation in the <b>prohibited</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{longitudinal}} {{study was conducted}} during the 2014 spring eastern oyster harvesting season in Prince Edward Island. The concentrations of Cryptosporidium oocysts were assessed in seawater and oyster samples taken from three commercial shellfish zones (Approved, Restricted, and Prohibited) one day before a rain event (of at least 15 mm), and on days 1, 3, and 7 after the rain event. Two rain events were recorded during the study period. The first event (rain event 1) was characterized by precipitation of 15 mm over 14 h (low intensity) and the second event had 40 mm in 14 h (high intensity). Oocysts in 20 L of seawater ranged from 0 to 10, 0 to 7, and 1 to 15 in Approved, Restricted, and <b>Prohibited</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively, and in oysters, ranged from 0 to 30, 0 to 48, and 0 to 25 in Approved, Restricted, and <b>Prohibited</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. A significant increase in Cryptosporidium spp. oocyst counts was observed in seawater samples after an intense rain event. Oocyst counts in seawater were almost two times higher after a high intensity rain event than after a low intensity event, but no effect was observed in oysters. However, positive samples (seawater and oysters) were still present seven days after a rain event. These findings suggest that authorities should consider monitoring for Cryptosporidium spp. in shellfish and their associated waters, especially after heavy rain events...|$|R

In addition, the three main steps of hunting: searching for prey, encircling prey and attacking prey are implemented. In this paper, GWO was demonstrated and tested on two well-known test systems with practical constraints. A comparison of simulation results is carried out with those published in the recent literatures.
