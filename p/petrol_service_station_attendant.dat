40|$|Mechanical efficiency, {{a measure}} of {{friction}} losses in the engine, is thus an important topic in engine development and therefore engine testing. This study focuses {{on the performance of}} motor vehicle engines with the use of petrol fuel from Electrical Operated Pump <b>Petrol</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Stations</b> (EOPSS) against the base petrol fuel from the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) using a test engine in the laboratory. Specifically, the study is to identify the quality of both the petrol fuel from Electrically Operated Pump Stations (EOPSS) against the base petrol fuel from the Tema Oil Refinery. To measure and compare the mechanical efficiency and frictional losses of an engine using petrol fuel from these different sources. A comparative study of an engine mechanical efficiency and frictional losses with the use of these two petrol fuels was done using engine dynamometer. A Morse test was carried out to establish how properties of these petrol fuels influence the internal combustion engine performance characteristics such as mechanical efficiency and frictional losses. The results of the tests showed that petrol fuel from the Electrically operated pump <b>petrol</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> compared with the base petrol fuel from Tema Oil Refinery gave different engine mechanical efficiency and frictional loss power. It concluded that the quality of petrol fuel sold from the electrically operated pump <b>petrol</b> <b>service</b> <b>station...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{system to}} monitor and to control {{contamination}} in the soil, {{as well as in}} the aquifer is presented. Specifically, the system is suitable to monitor continuously, remotely, and in real-time the soil surrounding underground storage tank (UST) systems, such as in <b>petrol</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations.</b> The system has also functions for remediation, due to the possibility to be configured as a soil venting system. A prototype has been running for more than three years in a <b>petrol</b> <b>service</b> <b>station</b> in Genova, Italy. Results show that, in daily work, frequent small-medium leakages may occur, which may be related to several events, the most frequent of which is the delivery of petrol products to the USTs. In these cases, the system can diagnose the leakage and start remediation by a specific soil venting process. Some considerations on the cost/benefit evaluation of this technology and on the utility to insert it as an important step to assure zero emissions to the soil in connection with petrol product storage and manufacturing are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Headspace (HS) gas {{chromatography}} with flame ionisation detection (HS-GC-FID) and purge and trap (P) {{gas chromatography}}-mass spectrometry (P) {{were used for}} the determination of methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTEX) in groundwater. In this work, we present the first data on the levels of MTBE and BTEX in different groundwater wells in the area of Catalonia (northeast Spain). This monitoring campaign corresponded to 28 groundwater wells that were located near <b>petrol</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations,</b> oil refinery storage tanks, and/or chemical industry at different locations of Catalonia during the period of 1998 / 1999. The levels of MTBE detected varied between 4 — 300 μg/l, but two sites had MTBE levels up to 3 and 13 mg/l. In many cases, the BTEX levels were below 1 μg/l, whereas 7 sites had levels varying from 19 μg/l up to 3 mg/l. Most of them were related to leakage from underground tanks in <b>petrol</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations,</b> while the remaining three corresponded respectively to chemical industrial pollution of undetermined origin and to a leak from high-ground petrol tanks in petrochemical refinery factories. The aquifers involved were constituted by detritus coarse materials, sands, and conglomerates. Piezometric levels were roughly comprised between 3 and 40 m, and permeability (K) and transmissivity (T) values were estimated from field measurements...|$|R
40|$|During refuelling, {{people may}} easily {{be exposed to}} {{extremely}} high levels of gasoline vapour for a short time, although such exposure takes on more importance {{in the case of}} <b>service</b> <b>station</b> <b>attendants.</b> The volume of gasoline sold in refuelling operations and the ambient temperature can significantly increase the environmental level of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) vapours and, subsequently, the occupational risk of <b>service</b> <b>station</b> <b>attendants.</b> This is especially true in the case of benzene, the most important component of gasoline vapours from a toxicological point of view. The European Directive 98 / 70 /EC, limiting the benzene composition of gasoline, and 94 / 63 /EC, concerning the use of vapour recovery systems in the delivery of gasoline to <b>services</b> <b>stations,</b> were applied in Spain from January 2000 and 2002, respectively. In addition, a new limit value for occupational exposure of 3. 25 mg/m 3 was fixed for benzene in Directive 97 / 42 /EC, applied from June 2003. However, recent years have seen the growing use of diesel as well as of unleaded and reformulated gasoline. In this study, we analyse the differences found between air concentration levels of BTXs in 2000 and 2003, analysing samples taken from the personal breathing-zone of occupationally exposed workers in <b>service</b> <b>stations.</b> The results are compared with those obtained in a similar study carried out in 1995 (before the new regulation...|$|R
