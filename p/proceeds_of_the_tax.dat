40|$|If the Barnett {{formula is}} rigorously applied to {{determine}} {{the budget of the}} Welsh Assembly Government, this will ultimately adversely affect the economy of Wales by limiting the growth in aggregate demand. This effect is reinforced now that population weights determining rises in expenditure in Wales (and Scotland and Northern Ireland) are regularly up-dated. There is some controversy in Wales about whether some form of needs-assessment exercise would favour Wales relative to its current position. What is clear is that the outcome of a rigorous, long term application of the Barnett formula would be a share of UK public expenditures in Wales (and Scotland and Northern Ireland) that was almost certainly below the level that would be dictated by any conventional understanding of 'needs'. The impact of the tax-varying power favoured by the Richard Commission is ambiguous, with the direction of effects dependent on the reaction of the current labour force and potential migrants. If workers insist on full compensation for loss of income to tax through a rise in gross wages a tax rise would lead to an economic contraction.

40|$|Twice a year, in June and December, the National Bank of Belgium {{publishes the}} {{macroeconomic}} projections for the Belgian economy {{for the current}} and the following year. The current projections cover the years 2005 and 2006. These projections make up the national component of the broad macroeconomic projection exercise conducted within the Eurosystem; the ECB publishes the aggregated results of this exercise for the euro area economy in its Monthly Bulletin. At the current juncture, the international environment is expected to remain supportive in 2005 and 2006, although real world GDP growth would be somewhat weaker compared to the impressive growth in 2004. Following the slowdown which hit the euro area since the summer of 2004, the Eurosystem expects, for the euro area, a gradual recovery from mid- 2005 onwards and a deceleration of inflation from a higher level in {{the first months of}} 2005, due to receding pressure from energy prices, while domestic cost pressures should remain contained. In Belgium, GDP growth slowed down markedly at the end of 2004. During the first quarter of 2005, the level of activity even stabilised and business confidence further dropped. Compared to the projections of December, GDP growth for 2005 has thus been revised downwards by more than 1 percentage point towards 1. 4 p. c. In line with the Eurosystem’s assumptions, the slowdown would be temporarily and activity should increase by 2. 4 p. c. in 2006. A gradual strengthening of real household disposable income is expected in 2005, stemming mainly from financial income, and further in 2006, due to the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> reform. However, private consumption growth should be weak in the beginning of 2005, due to the high oil price level and the increased uncertainty of consumers regarding the economic situation. Domestic demand would nevertheless show some resilience in 2005 due to increasing investment. Also, towards 2006 exports would strengthen, supported by an improving international environment. Although employment growth is likely to slacken somewhat in the course of 2005, there would be a net creation of 62, 000 jobs over the period 2005 - 2006. Still, the unemployment rate is likely to rise somewhat further, to 7. 9 and 8 p. c. in 2005 and 2006 respectively, as the increase of the working population would slightly outpace the number of new jobs. Inflation is expected to increase to 2. 2 p. c. in 2005, largely as a consequence of high energy prices, before decreasing to 1. 9 p. c. in 2006. The underlying trend in inflation should however stay limited, at 1. 3 and 1. 6 p. c. in 2005 and 2006 respectively, as domestic cost developments should remain contained. Only taking into account the measures which have already been taken upon in the 2005 budget, the general government balance is expected to show a deficit of 0. 5 p. c. of GDP in 2005 and of 1. 4 p. c. in 2006.

40|$|This paper {{represents}} a {{first attempt at}} a tractable analysis of how monetary policy influences the income distribution in an economy. It presents a monetary growth model in which inflation affects credit market efficiency, and via this link, influences capital accumulation, and the income distribution. In the model, a fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population is capitalists, {{who have access to}} a risky but high return capital production technology. Capital investment must be partially externally financed via workers 2 ̆ 7 savings, and is subject to a costly state verification (CSV) problem. Successful capitalists leave bequests to their offspring which serve as internal finance, more of which promotes credit market efficiency and capital formation. Inflation acts as an unavoidable <b>tax</b> on <b>the</b> capital incomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capitalists thereby reducing their bequests and worsening the CSV friction. Computational experiments reveal that in the model economy, irrespective <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> government rebates <b>the</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inflation <b>tax</b> to capitalists or workers, inflation decreases the steady-state capital stock, although the capital stock is highest when all transfers go to workers.

40|$|This report {{examines}} the fears some Australians {{have about the}} potential adverse consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10 -year mining boom. OverviewThe biggest mining boom in Australian history since <b>the</b> gold rush <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1850 s {{is about to change}} shape. <b>The</b> investment phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom, which has seen $ 400 billion invested in the last decade, is tapering off. The elevated prices paid for Australian mineral exports since 2003 are falling, and with them, the huge boost they provided to national income and government revenue. As these changes begin to transform the economy once more, this report assesses the benefits and costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom, and points to what policymakers should and should not do next. Overall, the boom has been good for Australia. It helped the country weather the global financial crisis. It helped fund major government initiatives. Most Australians have prospered. But the boom has also provoked fears. Some worry that it has benefited mining states, companies and workers, but left <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country worse off. Some believe that the high dollar caused permanent damage to trade-exposed industries such as manufacturing, tourism and international education. Some believe the boom will end in a severe recession. Others believe the Commonwealth Government mishandled the boom by failing to save much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windfall it has generated. This report shows that the first two concerns are largely unfounded. Certainly the boom has boosted incomes more in <b>the</b> mining states <b>of</b> Western Australia and Queensland and the Northern Territory. But in the past decade, incomes have increased faster across the country than in the decade before. Regions have grown at different rates but few are left worse off. Benefits have been spread across the country as the boom helped to offset <b>the</b> impacts <b>of</b> globalisation and technological change on lower-skilled workers. The boom has made life difficult for industries that compete internationally. Yet history suggests that manufacturing and other trade-exposed industries will bounce back quickly after the boom. The concern about a possible recession is less easy to assess. There is a risk of a downturn: resources investment will decline, and falls in resource prices elsewhere were often followed by slower growth. But a recession is far from inevitable, and Australia has avoided the big traps in mining booms, such as high inflation. The fourth community concern is well-founded. The Commonwealth Government has not saved enough <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boom. <b>Tax</b> decreases and spending increases have been larger than Australia can afford in the long run. Some spending was justified by the response to the global financial crisis, and some has been invested, but underlying budget deficits now need to be repaired in more difficult times. Australian governments need to do more to tighten their budgets, which will permit them to respond strongly if the outlook darkens. Governments should resist temptations to protect industries, but continue to invest in skills and education to help workers and citizens respond to the changing risks and opportunities of a globalised economy. These will be even more important as the longest and largest mining boom in 150 years winds down...|$|R
40|$|Throughout <b>the</b> {{successive}} phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian state reform, {{powers were}} increasingly devolved from federal {{level to the}} communities and regions.

The article also contains an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes in the financing balance and debt level. Finally, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> projections regarding the movement in community and regional finances are also highlighted. The analysis concerns both the communities and regions as a whole, and the individual federated entities. In order to eliminate <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> institutional differences and compare more uniform entities, a distinction is also made {{between the north and}} south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. The past decade has seen a systematic improvement in <b>the</b> financing balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communities and regions. The explanation for this improving trend {{lies in the fact that}} <b>the</b> real rate <b>of</b> growth in their primary expenditure was lower than <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> their revenues. Revenues in fact increased sharply. During the so-called transitional period which ended in 1999, the special mechanisms provided under the Finance Act indeed contributed towards a very steep increase in the funds allocated in respect of personal income <b>tax.</b> As regards <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> personal income <b>tax</b> allocated to <b>the</b> communities and regions, the gradual switch to an allocation formula based on <b>the</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal income <b>tax</b> collected in each entity caused the Finance Act funding to rise faster in the north than in the south. Since revenues have grown faster than expenditure over the past ten years in each entity – with expenditure rising by more in the north than in <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country – all the communities and regions succeeded in achieving an improvement in their financing balance. In order to achieve <b>the</b> target <b>of</b> a balanced budget in 2010, set by <b>the</b> High Council <b>of</b> Finance, <b>the</b> increase in expenditure for the communities and regions as a whole must not outpace GDP growth. The permissible expenditure growth will probably not be the same for each individual entity.
