50|$|An {{infusion}} set is used with an insulin pump {{as part of}} intensive insulin therapy. The purpose of an {{infusion set}} is to deliver insulin under the skin. It is a complete tubing system to connect an insulin pump to the pump user: it includes a subcutaneous cannula, adhesive mount, quick-disconnect, and a <b>pump</b> <b>cartridge</b> connector.|$|E
25|$|Insulin <b>pumps,</b> <b>cartridges,</b> and {{infusion}} sets may be {{far more}} expensive than syringes used for insulin injection with several insulin pumps costing more than $6,000; necessary supplies can cost over $300. Another disadvantage of insulin pump use is {{a higher risk of}} developing diabetic ketoacidosis if the pump malfunctions. This can happen if the pump battery is discharged, if the insulin is inactivated by heat exposure, if the insulin reservoir runs empty, the tubing becomes loose and insulin leaks rather than being injected, or if the cannula becomes bent or kinked in the body, preventing delivery. Therefore, pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} insulin delivery.|$|R

50|$|Consumers can refill ink {{cartridges}} {{themselves with a}} kit, or they can take the cartridge to a refiller or remanufacturer where ink is <b>pumped</b> back into <b>cartridges</b> made up of components from previously used cartridge products. PC World reports that refilled cartridges have higher failure rates, print fewer pages than new cartridges, and demonstrate more on-page problems like streaking, curling, and color bleed.|$|R
30|$|For preconcentration and cleanup, Oasis HLB (60 mg, 3 mL) and Thermo HyperSep Retain PEP (60 mg, 3 mL) SPE cartridges, each {{conditioned}} with 5 mL methanol and equilibrated with 5 mL Milli-Q water, were used. For sample extraction, 10 mL of treated {{waste water}} were mixed with 15 mL Milli-Q water and forced via peristaltic <b>pump</b> through the <b>cartridges</b> with 1 ml min- 1. Drying, elution, evaporation, resolving, and filtration were performed as described above.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Existing {{process for}} a {{detergent}} factory of de-mineralized water system was {{as the main}} research object. According to its water quality characteristics and the investigation for original desalting process, desalting process design was made. Then test experiment was proceeded at 1. 2 m 3 /h scale, and the system was divided into three subsystems: Pretreatment, Reverse osmosis desalting system and Electrodeionization treatment system. And stability of new craft was investigated at pilot scale, Results showed that in this craft, SID of ultra filtration effluent was less than 2, desalting ground water completely served as boiler water, and Electrodeionization meet the requirement for processes pure water after secondary treatment. But Electrodeionization effluent quality deteriorated occasionally, so Sodium hydroxide was added by metering <b>pump</b> before <b>cartridge</b> filter or was added into middle tank.

30|$|Biofilm {{formation}} of S. mutans in a flow cell system was observed {{as reported in}} a previous experiment with some modifications (Kim et al. 2008). The flow cells and the bubble traps were purchased from the Center for Biomedical Microbiology (Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark). The flow cells were covered with microscope coverslips made from polyvinyl chloride. Media were fed using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S Digital Drive EW- 07523 - 90, Masterflex L/S 12 -channel, 8 -roller <b>cartridge</b> <b>pump</b> head EW- 07519 - 25, Masterflex L/S small cartridges EW- 07519 - 85, Cole-Parmer Instrument Company, LLC., Vernon Hills, IL USA).|$|R
5000|$|Each {{branch of}} the United States armed forces has their own series of reverse osmosis water {{purification}} unit models, but they are all similar. The water is pumped from its raw source into the reverse osmosis water purification unit module, where it is treated with a polymer to initiate coagulation. Next, it is run through a multi-media filter where it undergoes primary treatment by removing turbidity. It is then <b>pumped</b> through a <b>cartridge</b> filter which is usually spiral-wound cotton. This process clarifies the water of any particles larger than 5 µm in and eliminates almost all turbidity.|$|R
25|$|In 1978, W. Clark Still {{introduced}} {{a modified version}} of column chromatography called flash column chromatography (flash). The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is <b>pumped</b> through the <b>cartridge.</b> Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.|$|R
50|$|Neither {{chlorine}} (e.g., bleach) nor iodine {{alone is}} considered completely effective against Cryptosporidium, {{although they are}} partially effective against Giardia. Chlorine is considered slightly better against the latter. A more complete field solution that includes chemical disinfectants is to first filter the water, using a 0.2 µm ceramic <b>cartridge</b> <b>pumped</b> filter, followed by treatment with iodine or chlorine, thereby filtering out cryptosporidium, Giardia, and most bacteria, along with the larger viruses, while also using chemical disinfectant to address smaller viruses and bacteria that the filter cannot remove. This combination is also potentially more effective in some cases than even using portable electronic disinfection based on UV treatment.|$|R
5000|$|Condensed steam {{was taken}} from the turbine {{condenser}} and pumped back into the boiler feed system, via the unit evaporator, low and high pressure water tube heaters (after being subjected to bled steam heat from turbine cylinders) into a de-aerator. The de-aerated water was taken by the main feed <b>pump</b> (multi stage <b>cartridge</b> design <b>pump</b> or a smaller start up pump) and discharged at [...] into the boiler water feed system through feed regulating valves. Both feed pump types were electric motor driven. Additional station boiler feed water supply could also be made up by the station water treatment plant and fed into the de-aerator, this was operated and controlled by the station chemistry department.|$|R

30|$|To {{allow the}} {{assessment}} of a possible biological degradation of antiepileptic drugs during MBR treatment, raw waste water and biologically treated waste water were analyzed for these substances. For preconcentration and cleanup, Oasis HLB (60 mg, 3 mL) SPE cartridges conditioned with 5 mL methanol and equilibrated with 5 mL Milli-Q (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) water were used. The samples of raw waste water (stored at - 32 °C) were thawed; the treated waste water (stored at 4 °C) was brought to room temperature. Twenty-five milliliters of decanted, unfiltrated samples were spiked with 50 -μL solution of 10, 11 -dihydrocarbamazepine (12.5 mg L- 1) for internal standardization and forced, via peristaltic <b>pump,</b> through the <b>cartridges</b> with 1 ml min- 1. For identification and calibration of the analytes, ClinCal® serum calibrators 15013 and 15213 (Recipe, Germany) were diluted, mixed together, spiked with internal standard, and prepared as waste water samples to get a 2 -point calibration with preconcentration factors of 0.6 and 0.3 for 15013 and 0.4 and 0.2 for 15213.|$|R
50|$|The {{documents}} {{describe a}} non-destructive method {{of determining the}} remaining service life of used and new gas cartridges. Polluted air was <b>pumped</b> through the <b>cartridge.</b> The degree of purification of air {{depends on how much}} unsaturated sorbent is in the cartridge. Therefore, accurate measurement of gas concentration in the cleaned air allows one to estimate the amount of the unsaturated sorbent. Polluted air (1-bromobutane) was pumped for a very short time, and therefore, such tests do not reduce the service life considerably. The sorption capacity decreased due to absorption of this gas by the amount of about 0.5% of the sorption capacity of a new cartridge. The method was also used for 100% quality control of cartridges, manufactured by the English firm Martindale Protection Co (10 microliters 1-bromobutane injected into the air stream), and to check the cartridges issued to workers in firms Waring Ltd and Rentokil Ltd. This method was used in the Chemical Defence Establishment in the early 1970s. The experts who developed this method, received a patent.|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} inhibitor affinity extraction {{method for}} the activity-based enrichment of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is presented. Samples containing purified MMP- 12 were first extracted at different flow rates in a syringe <b>pump</b> setup, using <b>cartridges</b> packed with an MMP inhibitor affinity sorbent {{based on an}} immobilized hydroxamic acid containing peptide (PLG-NHOH) with mu mol/L MMP affinity. Faster extractions, a reduced number of manual manipulations, and higher extraction yields (98. 9 %- 99. 3 %) were obtained over the whole flow rate range compared to batch extractions. Application of the method to synovial fluid from a rheumatoid arthritis patient followed by gelatin-zymography revealed a strong enrichment of distinct MMPs from this biological sample that were not clearly visible in the original sample. The use of an auto-sampler and a solid-phase extraction (SPE) workstation allowed full automation of the extraction procedure {{with the potential for}} on-line coupling to further sample preparation and analytical steps. MMP- 12 extractions were optimized showing that ligand density is an important factor with a clear extraction yield optimum around 5 to 7. 5 mmol/L. Conditioning of the stationary phase for 1 week prior to use resulted in a further slight increase in extraction yield. Under optimal conditions, an extraction yield of 99. 5 % was reached with a cartridge contact time of only 13 s for MMP- 12. The efficacy of the extraction method for activity-based MMP profiling was further improved by the use of a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor with nmol/L affinity (TAPI- 2). This resulted in an increased extraction yield for all tested MMPs. For MMP- 1, - 7, - 8, - 10, - 12, and - 13 extraction yields of at least 98. 8 % were obtained, while for MMP- 9 (full length and catalytic domain) an extraction yield of at least 96. 1 % was reached...|$|R
