50|$|Maza {{qualified}} for the Ecuadorian squad in the women's half-middleweight class (63 kg) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by placing fifth and receiving a berth from the Pan American Championships in Margarita Island, Venezuela. She lost her opening match to Japanese judoka and eventual Olympic champion Ayumi Tanimoto by an ippon and an uchi mata (inner thigh throw) at an immediate span of fifteen seconds. In the repechage, Maza gave herself a chance for an Olympic bronze medal, but slipped it away in a defeat to Tunisia's Saida Dhahri, who <b>pinned</b> and <b>clutched</b> her with a yoko shiho gatame (side four-quarter) hold three minutes and seventeen seconds into their first playoff of the draft.|$|R
25|$|Custom Fine Jewelry (CFJ) {{took over}} the {{contract}} in 1999 and has currently created three types. The initial versions {{were based on the}} last Stange version but with the ribbon attached through the <b>clutch</b> <b>pins</b> instead of a bar (this led to damage of the ribbon). A small number of sterling silver versions were made, marked with 925. In later 1999, the dies were laser engraved, giving a much sharper look and the ribbon mount was improved to eliminate wear. The knot went from wire to a molded version in 2001.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two {{fractured}} pins {{of impact}} wrench {{were evaluated by}} fractography using scanning electron microscopy. This pneumatic wrench is used to the fabrication of automotive components being characterized by its power and tightening capacity. The {{important part of the}} wrench is the <b>pin</b> <b>clutch</b> impact mechanism used to generate high torque. An original pin manufactured with AISI E 52100 steel adjusted 2, 580 nuts before fracture and a substitute pin of E 52100 modified steel with S adjusted 7, 095 nuts before failure. Fractographic analysis in both fracture surfaces indicated a ductile-brittle mixed fracture mode. Original pin surface exhibited a granular appearance while substitute pin surface showed fibrous and rough morphology. Precipitation of nearly rounded, elliptical and elongate second – phase particles containing Cr, C and Mn measured as intergranular and transgranular particle density was observed, promoting some brittle failure zones and ductile fracture measured as the volume fraction of grain boundaries and microvoids, respectively. A larger amount of intergranular medium precipitates was found on the original pin which favored the brittle failure among the grain boundaries compared to that of the substitute pin. The ductile fracture by larger transgranular fine particle density which acted as nucleation sites of higher volume fraction of microvoids was found in the substitute pin...|$|E
50|$|Name tags may be {{attached}} to garments with adhesive or worn {{with the assistance of}} a magnet or pin. Plastic or metal name tags can {{be attached}} to various backings used to attach to the clothing of the wearer. There are many types of name tag backings, including magnetic backings, locking pins, swivel clips, military <b>clutch</b> <b>pins,</b> alligator clips, and cell phone attachments. Magnetic backings, because they do not puncture clothing with pins, have recently become more popular for name tags. Some name tags are worn around the neck using a lanyard or necklace.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{common design}} uses a hammer fixed {{directly}} onto the input shaft, {{with a pair of}} <b>pins</b> acting as <b>clutches.</b> When the hammer rotates past the anvil, a ball ramp pushes the pins outwards against a spring, extending them to where they will hit the anvil and deliver the impact, then release and spring back into the hammer, usually by having the balls [...] "fall off" [...] {{the other side of the}} ramp at the instant the hammer hits. Since the ramp need only have one peak around the shaft, and the engagement of the hammer with the anvil is not based on a number of teeth between them, this design allows the hammer to accelerate for a full revolution before contacting the anvil, giving it more time to accelerate and delivering a stronger impact. The disadvantages are that the sliding pins must handle very high impacts, and often cause the early failure of tool.|$|R
40|$|The {{digitally}} reconfigurable {{surface is}} a pin based mechanism for creating physical threedimensional contoured surfaces {{from a computer}} aided design (CAD) input. When the digital design is properly downloaded into the device, a pin array is collectively actuated to the desired geometry. A rubber interpolation layer is held onto {{the tops of the}} pins by vacuum pressure to prevent undesired dimpling of the surface caused by the discrete nature of the pin array. Prior art in this field of reconfigurable pin tooling (RPT) surfaces have mostly involved using large diameter pins with conventional linear actuators behind each pin. Such devices have rarely been commercially viable as the surface area and resolution of the surface scales poorly with the number of actuators and cost. The digitally reconfigurable surface developed theoretically only requires a single mechanically actuated plate, regardless of scale or resolution (number of pins or diameter of pins). The device works by pulling all of the closely packed steel pins simultaneously in one direction via a magnetic moving plate, and as they move, <b>pins</b> are individually <b>clutched</b> and held in position by a novel fusible alloy clutch array, integrated with input circuitry. When the magnetic plate reaches the end of its stroke, all pins are in the proper configuration. The simplicity of this actuation method allows for improved scalability (resolution and area) and low manufacturing cost for the device. In addition, the phase changing clutch array, when coupled with notched or threaded pins, has an excellent holding strength allowing for many possible high pressure molding applications on surfaces generated. It is my hope that this research will one day pave the way for a practical, commercially available, reconfigurable pin-based forming tool. by Benjamin J. Peters. Thesis (S. B.)
