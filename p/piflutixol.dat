40|$|This {{study was}} done to obtain direct in vitro {{evidence}} for the possible existence {{of more than one}} type of dopaminergic binding site in homogenates of the caudate nucleus from calf brain. Five radioligands for dopaminergic sites were tested. The inhibitions of two agonist radioligands ([3 H]dopamine, [3 H]apomorphine) by haloperidol, chlorpromazine, or <b>piflutixol</b> were biphasic. The inhibitions of [3 H]haloperidol, [3 H]spiroperidol, and [3 H]dihydroergocryptine binding by dopamine and (-) -norepinephrine were also biphasic. Thus, both 3 H-labeled agonists and 3 H-labeled antagonists were possibly binding to two high-affinity sites...|$|E
