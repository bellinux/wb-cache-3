5|$|Within {{the genus}} Entoloma, the fungus is {{classified}} in the subgenus Leptonia, section Cyanula because of its overall habit, clampless hyphae, and abundant granules of pigment. Noordeloos and Gates <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the stirps (a grouping of related species within a genus) Austroprunicolor, characterized by mushrooms with a violaceous pink or blue cap that contrasts with a pallid, whitish, polished stipe.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist Charles M. Schwab {{bought the}} Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and {{invested}} heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town {{as well as the}} mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907–08.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} sporangia of Hsua robusta <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> {{the traditional}} family Cooksoniaceae (order Rhyniales).

5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the 1st century BC. Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile {{looking down at the}} left-hand figure below. Stela2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace5.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of chromospheric activity, strong {{magnetic}} field, and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star. Most estimates {{of the age of}} Epsilon Eridani <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the range from 200 million to 800 million years. The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the interstellar medium (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might be caused by a diffusion process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's convection zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by American botanist William Chambers Coker in 1917, in his monograph of Amanitas {{of the eastern}} United States. Coker's description was based on several specimens he had collected from various locations in North Carolina in September and October 1914. The specific name honors George Atkinson, a Cornell University mycologist who collected and described mushrooms in the southern and eastern United States in the late 19th century. In 1952, Marcel Locquin chose to <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the genus Armillaria as Armillaria atkinsoniana, but this change was not adopted by later authors.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Argentinean {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{suggested that}} Winge's Hesperomys simplex {{and the living}} Pseudoryzomys wavrini are in fact the same species. In a 1991 study, American zoologists Voss and Myers confirmed this suggestion after re-examining Winge's material, finding no appreciable differences among specimens of H. simplex and P. wavrini. Since then, the species has been known as Pseudoryzomys simplex (Winge, 1887), because simplex is the oldest specific name for the animal; Oryzomys wavrini Thomas, 1921, and Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi Pine and Wetzel, 1975, are junior synonyms. Voss and Myers also re-evaluated the relationships of Pseudoryzomys; they considered it closer to oryzomyines than to phyllotines, but declined to formally <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Oryzomyini {{in the absence of}} explicit phylogenetic justification for such a placement.|$|E
5|$|In Barden and Grimaldi's article, {{the authors}} could not {{sufficiently}} identify the ant with enough confidence to <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a subfamily. Instead, it was incertae sedis within the Formicidae. Although a recent published morphological study provided useful {{information on the}} mouthparts of basal ants, placing Cretaceous taxa is still difficult. However, synapomorphies (key diagnostic traits) {{could have been used}} to attempt to place Zigrasimecia. Key synapomorphies for Sphecomyrmine ants include scape (the base segment of the antenna) length; petiole (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen); and the metapleural gland (secretory glands), as indicated by Barry Bolton's diagnosis. The morphology of Z. tonsora shows a variety of autapomorphies (derived traits) not seen in any other ant species, particularly the structure of the mandibles and mesosomal sculpturing. Another issue in placing Z. tonsora is that the status of Sphecomyrminae had rarely ever been evaluated (perhaps once) via phylogenetic methodology. Due to this, it was possible that the subfamily was not monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Trachypithecus should be considered only a subgenus of Semnopithecus. If maintaining the two as separate monophyletic genera, the purple-faced langur and Nilgiri langur belong in Semnopithecus instead of the usual Trachypithecus. At present it is unclear where the T. pileatus species group (consisting of the capped langur, Shortridge's langur and Gee's golden langur) belongs, as available mtDNA data <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Semnopithecus, while Y chromosome data <b>place</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Trachypithecus.|$|E
