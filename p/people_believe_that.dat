5|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> {{for various}} reasons, large cities cannot {{be struck by}} tornadoes. More than 100tornadoes have been {{reported}} to strike downtown areas of large cities. Many cities have been struck twice or more, and a fewincluding Lubbock, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; Topeka, Kansas; and London, Englandhave been struck by violent tornadoes (F4 or stronger).|$|E
5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to keep doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena relieves itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{important}} issue {{during the campaign}} {{was that of the}} languages in the country. The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot-button issue. A growing number of <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Swedish language should be abolished as the country's second official language, as {{only a small percentage of}} the country use Swedish as their first language and that a large number of government officials do not use Swedish. A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language's status as Finland's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language. However, the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools. At the time, Swedish was spoken by 5.42% of the population as their mother tongue, with Russian spoken by 1.01% and the Sami languages spoken by 0.03%.|$|E

25|$|Some web-oriented marketing-research {{organizations}} may {{use this}} practice legitimately, for example: {{in order to}} construct profiles of 'typical Internet users'.

25|$|The current T-score system grades {{students}} very finely. It {{is unnecessary}} {{at the young}} age to make such fine distinctions between children.

25|$|Some {{newspapers}} {{have dealt with}} the criticism by moving the strip from the comics page to the editorial page, because many <b>people</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a politically based comic strip like Doonesbury does not belong in a traditionally child-friendly comics section.

In some papers (such as the Tulsa World and Orlando Sentinel) Doonesbury appears on the opinions page alongside Mallard Fillmore, a politically conservative comic strip.|$|E
