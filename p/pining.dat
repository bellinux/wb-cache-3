5|$|Giovanni Verga's 1871 novel Storia di una capinera, {{according}} to its author, {{was inspired by a}} story of a blackcap trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and <b>pining</b> for its lost freedom, eventually dies.

The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and its English-language version was retitled as Sparrow. In Saint François d'Assise, an opera by Messiaen, the orchestration is based on bird song. St Francis himself is represented by the blackcap.|$|E

5|$|Tracking west-{{northwest}} {{and later}} northwest around the southwestern {{edge of a}} subtropical ridge, steady intensification of the cyclone ensued. Early on August27, a reconnaissance plane measured a central pressure of 994mbar (hPa; 29.36inHg) and flight-level winds of , indicating the system had become a tropical storm. In light of this, the JTWC assigned the name Agnes to the storm. Additionally due to its proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration dubbed the system with the local name <b>Pining.</b> Strengthening occurred at a climatological rate, with Agnes attaining typhoon-status on August29. A large, banding eye-feature developed within the core of Agnes as it approached the Ryukyu Islands of southwestern Japan. The storm passed 170km (105mi) south of Okinawa around 06:00UTC on August30 and emerged over the East China Sea. Early on August31, Agnes achieved its peak strength with winds of 175km/h (110mph) and an estimated central pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). This ranked it as a Category2-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The JMA estimated the system to have been slightly weaker, with ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E

25|$|<b>Pines</b> grow well in acid soils, {{some also}} on {{calcareous}} soils; most require good soil drainage, preferring sandy soils, {{but a few}} (e.g. lodgepole <b>pine)</b> will tolerate poorly drained wet soils. A few are able to sprout after forest fires (e.g. Canary Island <b>pine).</b> Some species of <b>pines</b> (e.g. bishop <b>pine)</b> need fire to regenerate, and their populations slowly decline under fire suppression regimes. Several species are adapted to extreme conditions imposed by elevation and latitude (e.g. Siberian dwarf <b>pine,</b> mountain <b>pine,</b> whitebark <b>pine</b> and the bristlecone <b>pines).</b> The pinyon <b>pines</b> {{and a number of}} others, notably Turkish <b>pine</b> and gray <b>pine,</b> are particularly well adapted to growth in hot, dry semi-desert climates.|$|R
