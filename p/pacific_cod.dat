40|$|ABSTRACT-Pharyngeal tumors at {{the locus}} of the pseudo-branch (parabranchial body) were found at a mean {{frequency}} of 4. 2 % in 2, 096 <b>Pacific</b> gray <b>cod</b> (Gadus macrocephalus) taken from the Bering Sea. The tumors, invariably bilateral and symmetrical, generally surrounded remnants of normal pseudobranch but did not invade nearby or distant organs. Cells comprising {{the bulk of the}} tumor tissue were identical to the "X-cells " previously observed in skin papillomas of pleuronectids from North American Pacific coastal waters and in skin papillomas of pleuronectids and gobies from Japanese waters. However, no papillomas were present in cod with pseudobranch tumors. In these pseudobranch tumors of cod as in skin papillomas of pleuronectids, X-cells were mostly held within meshworks of fine, electron-dense cytoplasmic processes belonging to another cell type, "envelope " (or satellite) cells...|$|R
25|$|Cod {{fisheries}} are fisheries for cod. Cod is {{the common}} name for fish of the genus Gadus, belonging to the family Gadidae, and this article is confined to the three species that belong to this genus: the Atlantic cod, the <b>Pacific</b> <b>cod</b> and the Greenland cod.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 {{northwest}} Atlantic cod quota is 23,000 tons, representing {{half the}} available stocks, while the northeast Atlantic quota is 473,000 tons. <b>Pacific</b> <b>cod</b> is currently enjoying strong global demand. The 2006 {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) for the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands was 260,000 tons.|$|E
25|$|Deep sea corals {{together}} with other habitat-forming organisms host a rich fauna of associated organisms. Lophelia reefs can host up to 1,300 species of fish and invertebrates. Various fish aggregate on deep sea reefs. Deep sea corals, sponges and other habitat-forming animals provide protection from currents and predators, nurseries for young fish, and feeding, breeding and spawning areas for numerous fish and shellfish species. Rockfish, Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, <b>Pacific</b> <b>cod,</b> Pacific halibut, sablefish, flatfish, crabs, and other economically important species in the North Pacific inhabit these areas. Eighty-three percent of the rockfish found in one study were associated with red tree coral. Flatfish, walleye pollock and <b>Pacific</b> <b>cod</b> {{appear to be more}} commonly caught around soft corals. Dense schools of female redfish heavy with young have been observed on Lophelia reefs off Norway, suggesting the reefs are breeding or nursery areas for some species. Oculina reefs are important spawning habitat for several grouper species, as well as other fishes.|$|E
25|$|Cod-like fishes are {{a number}} of round benthopelagic species {{belonging}} to the order Gadiformes, such as Atlantic and <b>Pacific</b> <b>cod,</b> morid cod, haddock and pollock, including the highly commercial Alaska pollock. Cod-like fishes are often found in large schools over sandy or muddy bottoms. They have a barbel (fleshy filament) on their lower jaw which they use to detect prey buried in the sand or mud. Some migrate to warm water in winter to spawn.|$|E
25|$|Steller {{sea lions}} are skilled and {{opportunistic}} marine predators, feeding {{on a wide}} range of fish and cephalopod species. Important diet components include walleye pollock, Atka mackerel, halibut, herring, capelin, flatfish <b>Pacific</b> <b>cod,</b> rockfish, sculpins, and cephalopods. They seem to prefer schooling fish and remain primarily between intertidal zones and continental shelves. They are also known to enter estuarine environments and feed on some brackishwater fish such as sturgeon. Very occasionally, they have been known to prey on northern fur seals, harbor seals, and sea otter pups. They are near the top of the marine food chain, but are susceptible to predation by killer whales and great white sharks.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of public}} {{concerns}} about radioactive contamination of food, Aeon, a Japanese supermarket chain, decided {{to publish the}} results of voluntary radiation tests performed on food of Japanese origin in their stores. The information was available on the website, and on posters in stores. Fish, vegetables, rice, beef and more were controlled by the shops since March 2011. All products with 50 becquerels per kilogram, one-tenth of the government's provisional limit, were rejected and not offered in stores. In {{the first week of}} November 2011 radioactive cesium was found in <b>Pacific</b> <b>cod</b> and rice from Fukushima, in tuna from Miyagi, and in bonito from Iwate. The customers were offered a list of all contaminated food that was found, its radioactivity levels and production areas.|$|E
