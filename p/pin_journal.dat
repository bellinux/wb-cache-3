40|$|In this study, failure {{analysis}} of a crankshaft was carried out. The crankshaft made of nodular graphite cast iron was used in a gasoline engine. The cracks propagated axially on surface of the 4 th <b>pin</b> <b>journal.</b> Microscopic observation {{was conducted on the}} surface of journals. Mechanical and metallurgical properties of the crankshaft including chemical composition, micro-hardness, tensile properties and roughness were studied and compared with the specified properties of the crankshaft materials. As a result of the analyses, the main reason of failure was determined as thermal fatigue because of contact of journal and bearing surface. This condition leads to the formation and growth of fatigue cracks. The contact is probably resulted from defective lubrication or high operating oil temperature. In addition, the contact caused scratches on surface of the 4 th <b>pin</b> <b>journal</b> and 5 th main journal...|$|E

40|$|As the {{key part}} of {{internal}} combustion engines, crankshaft with high efficiency and accuracy processing {{has always been the}} target of the engine manufacturer’s pursuit. Grinding is used to obtain the ultimate dimensional accuracy and surface finish in the crankshaft machining. Grinding of the main <b>journals</b> and the <b>pin</b> <b>journals</b> can be accomplished in a single clamping operation by CNC Tangential Point Tracing grinding technology. However, the chatter in the grinding process is harmful to the precision and surface quality. In this paper, stability lobe diagram is developed to predict the grinding chatter. First the dynamic model of Tangential Point Tracing grinding system is established. Then the limit formula of the critical grinding depth is calculated and the stability lobe diagram of the grinding system is presented. Finally, the validation experiments are carried out on the crankshaft grinding machine and the results are consistent with the calculation...|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, Buick {{redesigned}} the crankshaft to a [...] "split-pin" [...] configuration {{to create}} an [...] "even-firing" [...] version. The crank pins associated with the opposing cylinders were offset from each other by 30°. The relatively small offset did not require flying arms to be incorporated, however a 3.0 mm thick flange was built in between the offset crank pins to prevent the connecting rod big-ends from [...] "walking" [...] off the crank <b>pin</b> bearing <b>journal</b> and interfering with the adjacent big end. The 3.0 mm thick flange effectively caused the connecting rods on the left-hand bank of cylinders (forward bank for FWD applications) to move 3.0 mm forward relative to the right-hand bank, but the engine block remained unchanged compared to the odd-fire engine. Since the cylinders center-lines were no longer centralized over the crank <b>pin</b> bearing <b>journals,</b> the connecting rods were re-designed with the big-ends offset from the piston pin ends by 1.5 mm. The engine in this configuration became known to have [...] "off-centre bore spacing".|$|R
50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon <b>pin</b> <b>journals</b> in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R
50|$|Most of his papers, {{as well as}} manuscripts of the (recently published) Civil War {{diary of}} his {{daughter}} Josie (Johanna Louisa) and memoir of her sister Juliete Blanche Western Long (whose husband served in the Confederate army) are held by Western Kentucky University. Josie never was reconciled to the decline in her lifestyle, since her husband eventually moved to Ballston Spa, New York and held an office job paying only about $100/month, i.e. far less than her affluent upbringing. After his death (and that of their daughter Edith) in California, she returned to Bowling Green in 1912 and lived {{with one of her}} sons in a small house. She also prepared a brief history of the town, and eventually bequeathed her DAR <b>pin</b> and <b>journal</b> to a granddaughter in Texas.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fully}} {{floating}} configuration, {{a bearing surface}} is created both between the small end eye and gudgeon <b>pin</b> and the <b>journal</b> in the piston. The gudgeon pins are usually secured with circlips. No interference fit is used in any instance and the pin 'floats' entirely on bearing surfaces. The average rubbing speed {{of each of the}} three bearings is halved and the load is shared across a bearing that is usually about three times the length of the semi-floating design with an interference fit with the piston.|$|R
50|$|The 4.3L V6 has a 4.00-inch bore and a 3.48-inch stroke (101.6mm x 88.39mm), {{identical}} to the 350 cid Chevrolet V8 engine. To create a true even fire engine, Chevrolet produced a crankshaft with 30-degree offsets between each rod <b>pin.</b> Consequentially, rod <b>journals</b> were increased to a larger 2.25 inches. The connecting rods used on the 4.3L are therefore unique to this engine, being 5.7 inches in length, but having the larger 2.25-inch journals. The 4.3L also used larger valves than the 229 cid V6, with a 1.94-inch intake valve and a 1.50-inch exhaust valve (also shared with the 350).|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of photon flux from an X-ray source, a parameter required {{to calculate the}} dose absorbed by the sample, is not yet routinely available at macromolecular crystallography beamlines. The development of a model for determining the photon flux incident on pin diodes is described here, and has been tested on the macromolecular crystallography beamlines at both the Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland, and the Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, USA, at energies between 4 and 18 keV. These experiments have shown that a simple model based on energy deposition in silicon is sufficient for determining the flux incident on high-quality silicon pin diodes. The derivation and validation of this model is presented, and a web-based tool {{for the use of}} the macromolecular crystallography and wider synchrotron community is introduced. Citation: Owen, R.

40|$|In engines, {{the crank}} <b>pins</b> are the <b>journals</b> of the off-centre {{bearings}} of the crank shaft. Crank pin {{is a high}} precision metallic cylindrical rod. Crank pins are heat treated and cured. After that three holes are drilled on the crank pin. Cross hole is {{the one in which}} the oil flows from the crank case to the 2 mm hole. The 2 mm hole is tangential to the bearing such that oil surrounds the bearing. The main purpose of this hole is to cool down the bearing which runs at very high speed nearly 10000 rpm. The dimension of the hole plays a crucial role. At present, the dimensions are measured manually leading to inaccuracy, gross error and time consuming.
