Using random {{instances of}} up to 1, 500 cities, we show that many properties of the problem, including the backbone and optimal tour cost, experience sharp transitions as the precision of intercity distances increases across a critical value. We also show that the average computational cost of the well-known branch-and-bound subtour elimination algorithm for the problem also exhibits a threshold behavior, transitioning from easy to difficult as the distance precision increases. These results provide strong <b>positive</b> <b>evidences</b> to a decade-long open question regarding the existence of phase transitions of the Traveling Salesman. ...|$|R

Here is proposed a human face focus of attention technique and a {{facial expressions}} classi er (a Dynamic Bayesian Network) to incorporate in an autonomous mobile agent whose hardware is composed by a robotic platform and a robotic head. The focus of attention technique is based in the symmetry presented by human faces. Using the output of this module the autonomous agent keeps always targeting the human face frontally. To do that, the robot platform performs an arc centred in the human and the robotic head, when necessary, moves synchronized. In the proposed probabilistic classi er the information is propagated, from the previous instant, in {{a low level of}} the network.

25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some <b>positive</b> <b>evidence,</b> suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Concerns about outcome measures, such as their inconsistent use, most greatly affect how the results of scientific studies are interpreted. A 2009 Minnesota study found that parents follow behavioral treatment recommendations significantly less often than they follow medical recommendations, and that they adhere more often to reinforcement than to punishment recommendations. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to learning user interests is presented that borrows from findings {{in the area of}} human-computer interaction, user modeling and information retrieval. It relies on <b>positive</b> <b>evidences</b> only, in consideration of the fact that users rarely supply the ratings needed by traditional learning algorithms, specifically not negative examples. Learning results are explicitly represented to account for {{the fact that in the}} area of user modeling explicit representations are known to be considerably more useful than purely implicit representations. A content-based recommendation approach is complemented by recommendation based on community membership, thus avoiding getting trapped in possible "local optima" of the content-based approaches. Finally, gradual forgetting of older observations has been introduced to better account for drifting user interests. The described framework has been extensively tested in a web-based information system for research funding opportunities. [...] ...|$|R

Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children with ASD acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often can improve functioning, and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.|$|E
