40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel chip fabrication technique called “brick and mortar”, in which chips {{are made from}} small, pre-fabricated ASIC bricks and bonded in a designer-specified arrangement to an interbrick communication backbone chip. The goal of <b>brick</b> and mortar <b>assembly</b> {{is to provide a}} low-overhead method to produce custom chips, yet with performance that tracks an ASIC more closely than an FPGA. This paper examines the architectural design choices in this chip-design system. These choices include the definition of reasonable bricks, both in functionality and size, as well as the communication interconnect that the I/O cap provides. To do this we synthesize candidate bricks, analyze their area and bandwidth demands, and present an architectural design for the inter-brick communication network. We discuss a sample chip design, a 16 -way CMP, and analyze {{the costs and benefits of}} designing chips with brick and mortar. We find that this method of producing chips incurs only a small performance loss (8 %) compared to a fully custom ASIC, which is significantly less than the degradation seen from other low-overhead chip options, such as FPGAs.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} brick [...] (extra) ordinary brick [...] and its metaphysics. How can a brick, {{a material}} object, have a metaphysics? The singular 2 ̆ 7 brick 2 ̆ 7 {{is arguably the}} most ubiquitous of construction materials, modest in its earth and fire roots, fitted to the hand, a utilitarian artifact habitually assembled into a myriad of constructions. Yet embedded, presupposed, potentially, within each brick are: a technological society with labor organization; conceptions of fabricating structure, skin, and illusion; temporality; and the creation of place, transparency, and motion. Louis I. Kahn, when discussing architectural materials, specifically brick and arches, speaks in Platonic terms of material construction giving presence to the pre-existent forms of <b>brick</b> <b>assemblies</b> and arches. He says this is 2 ̆ 2 the order of brick. 2 ̆ 2 This paper, though it shares the poetic notion of brick, postulates an Aristotelian model. It is through the human practices of making and construction, the relational aspects of brick bonded to brick, and the purposeful intents of those assemblies that there arises a metaphysics of brick. To build in brick is not to create inert objects, but to build existential presences. An analogy to the elemental letters of alphabets and their use in language representation and a brick-built garden wall are used to examine the metaphysical nature of brick...|$|R
30|$|These {{results are}} {{consistent}} with other studies comparing wood and different building materials which found wood to be among the most environmentally sustainable building material. It is remarkable though that most studies on this topic compare steel or concrete instead of brick to wooden walls or houses. Among the studies which compare timber and bricks, both Goverse et al. [21] and Monteiro and Freire [49] found a possible reduction in CO 2 of almost 50  % when using wood. In an application of value-focused thinking, Hassan [50] investigated three exterior wall types: masonry, concrete and timber. The functional unit the author chose for the LCA is 1  m 2 of wall with U value 0.2  W m− 2  K− 1. Although the brick and timber wall designs are different from those here analyzed, the wooden wall was proven to be the best option from an environmental perspective. In a case study of life-cycle CO 2 emissions of a 137 -m 2 single family house built in Austria either with a brick or wood frame, Kram et al. [51] determined in 2001 emissions of 18 t CO 2 for the wood version and 27 t CO 2 for the brick version. In this case, the wooden house emissions were one-third lower than those attributed to the brick house. However, specifications about the boundaries and sections of the walls were not given. On the other hand, Marcea and Lau [52] calculated the energy and CO 2 cost of similarly performing residential buildings, finding that the <b>brick</b> <b>assembly</b> emitted 1.9 times more than the wooden assembly.|$|R

Retrofit A is a two bedroom bungalow {{with the addition}} of internal plasterboard and air cavity and Retrofit B is a 5 bedroom house with sheep wool, phenolic and plasterboard insulation. To evaluate the long term performance of the retrofit measures, the testing is carried out 7 and 8 years respectively after completion. The first part of the work investigates whole building hygrothermal performance, ventilation and internal conditions. It was found that both retrofits are operating below specification in regards to their ventilation performance. An in-situ performance based specification for mechanical ventilation via CO 2 monitoring is proposed. The second part focuses on the hygrothermal behaviour of the clay <b>brick</b> wall <b>assembly.</b> Both presented high relative humidity within critical layers of the wall make up.

The purpose of the neutron reflector was to reduce the mass required for the plutonium core to attain criticality. He was moving the final <b>brick</b> over the <b>assembly,</b> but neutron counters alerted Daghlian {{to the fact that}} the addition of that brick would render the system supercritical. As he withdrew his hand, he inadvertently dropped the brick onto the center of the assembly. Since the assembly was nearly in the critical state, the accidental addition of that brick caused the reaction to go immediately into the prompt critical region of neutronic behavior. This resulted in a criticality accident.|$|R

We use spatial-econometric modeling to predict the four unique hazard variables and a composite hazard variable using socio-demographic variables at the neighborhood level. Lower class and higher percentages of children and migrants were statistically significant predictors of composite hazard density. These results align with previous studies in the North. However, disaggregating these results by hazard type reveals important and counterintuitive differences in groups at risk based on the market-orientation of the hazard (i. e., domestic vs. transnational) and its location within the urban structure. Ciudad Juárez is a growing and industrializing city on Mexico's northern border.

40|$|This Closure Report (CR) {{presents}} information {{supporting the}} closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 117 : Area 26 Pluto Disassembly Facility, Nevada Test Site, Nevada. This CR complies {{with the requirements of}} the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order that was agreed to by the State of Nevada; U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Management; U. S. Department of Defense; and DOE, Legacy Management. Corrective Action Unit 117 comprises Corrective Action Site (CAS) 26 - 41 - 01, Pluto Disassembly Facility, located in Area 26 of the Nevada Test Site. The purpose of this CR is to provide documentation supporting the completed corrective actions and provide data confirming that the closure objectives for CAU 117 were met. To achieve this, the following actions were performed: • Review the current site conditions, including the concentration and extent of contamination. • Implement any corrective actions necessary to protect human health and the environment. • Properly dispose of corrective action and investigation wastes. • Document Notice of Completion and closure of CAU 117 issued by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. From May 2008 through February 2009, closure activities were performed as set forth in the Streamlined Approach for Environmental Restoration Plan for Corrective Action Unit 117, Area 26 Pluto Disassembly Facility, Nevada Test Site, Nevada. The purpose of the activities as defined during the data quality objectives process were: • Determine whether contaminants of concern (COCs) are present. • If COCs are present, determine their nature and extent, implement appropriate corrective actions, and properly dispose of wastes. Analytes detected during the closure activities were evaluated against final action levels to determine COCs for CAU 117. Assessment of the data generated from closure activities indicated that the final action levels were exceeded for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) reported as total Aroclor and radium- 226. A corrective action was implemented to remove approximately 50 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated soil, approximately 1 cubic foot of radium- 226 contaminated soil (and scabbled asphalt), and a high-efficiency particulate air filter that was determined to meet the criteria of a potential source material (PSM). Electrical and lighting components (i. e., PCB-containing ballasts and capacitors) and other materials (e. g., mercury-containing thermostats and switches, lead <b>plugs</b> and <b>bricks)</b> assumed to be PSM were also removed from Building 2201, as practical, without the need for sampling. Because the COC contamination and PSMs have been removed, clean closure of CAS 26 - 41 - 01 is recommended, and no use restrictions are required to be placed on this CAU. No further action is necessary because no other contaminants of potential concern were found above preliminary action levels. The physical end state for Building 2201 is expected to be eventual demolition to slab. The DOE, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office provides the following recommendations: • Clean closure is the recommended corrective action for CAS 26 - 41 - 01 in CAU 117. • A Notice of Completion to the DOE, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office is requested from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for closure of CAU 117. • Corrective Action Unit 117 should be moved from Appendix III to Appendix IV of the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order...|$|R
