25|$|Champions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray {{have each}} offered fairly precise tales of a {{contrivance}} whereby Bell actively stole {{the invention of}} the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a <b>patent</b> <b>examiner,</b> Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing a look at his rival's designs before final submission.|$|E

Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money.|$|E
25|$|A {{breakaway}} rim is {{a basketball}} hoop that can bend slightly when a player dunks a basketball, and then instantly snap {{back into its}} original shape when the player releases it. It allows players to dunk the ball without shattering the backboard, and it reduces the possibility of wrist injuries. According to the Lemelson Center, an affiliation of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the breakaway rim was invented by Arthur Ehrat. After six years, from July 1976 to December 1982, Ehrat received a patent (U.S. Patent No. 4,365,802). His application was rejected twice, with <b>patent</b> <b>examiner</b> Paul Shapiro noting that Frederick C. Tyner held a patent for a similar device (U.S. Patent No. 4,111,420). However, a court appeal finally {{ruled in favor of}} Ehrat, as he proved through notarized copies of canceled checks and a rough sketch of his invention, that he was working on his breakaway basketball goal in 1975 before Frederick Tyner conceived of his.|$|E

40|$|Building on {{insights}} {{gained from}} interviewing administrators and <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), we collect and analyze a novel dataset on <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> and <b>patent</b> outcomes. This dataset {{is based on}} 182 patents for which the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) ruled on validity between 1997 and 2000. For each patent, we identify a USPTO primary examiner, and collect historical statistics derived from their entire patent examination history. These data are used to explore a number of hypotheses about {{the connection between the}} patent examination process and the strength of ensuing patent rights. Our main findings are as follows. (i) <b>Patent</b> <b>examiners</b> and the <b>patent</b> examination process are not homogeneous. There is substantial variation in observable characteristics of <b>patent</b> <b>examiners,</b> such as their tenure at the USPTO, the number of patents they have examined {{and the degree to which}} the patents that they examine are later cited by other patents. (ii) There is no evidence that examiner experience or workload at the time a patent is issued affects the probability that the CAFC finds a <b>patent</b> invalid. (iii) <b>Examiners</b> whose <b>patents</b> tend to be more frequently cited tend to have a higher probability of a CAFC invalidity ruling. The results suggest that all <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> are not equal, and that one of the roles of the CAFC is to review the exercise of discretion in the paten...|$|R
40|$|The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) {{receives}} more {{prior art}} submissions by patent applicants than its <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> {{have the capacity}} to process. Although applicant prior art submissions are highly likely to contain references material to prosecution, evidence suggests that overburdened examiners often fail to utilize references submitted by applicants in their examination of patent applications. The information overload suffered by <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> has deleterious effects on <b>patent</b> quality, since <b>examiners</b> fail to identify and apply the references most relevant to the examination ofpatent applications. The vision of <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> as perfect filters of patentability and of information as always benefiting the public good is both idealistic and unrealistic.

Failing to address these problems will likely result in frustrated applicants, overburdened <b>patent</b> <b>examiners,</b> and reduced <b>patent</b> quality. This Article proposes to solve both the plague of inequitable conduct allegations in litigation and the administrative burdens of complying with the duty of disclosure by reframing disclosure obligations for the information age.

2500|$|Baer is {{considered}} {{to have been the}} inventor of video games, specifically of the concept of the home video game console. In 1966, while an employee at Sanders Associates, Baer started to explore the possibility of playing games on television screens. He first got the idea while working at Loral in 1951, another electronics company, however, they {{wanted nothing to do with}} it at the time. In a 2007 interview, Baer said that he recognized that the price reduction of owning a television set at the time had opened a large potential market for other applications, considering that various military groups had identified ways of using television for their purposes. Upon coming up with the idea of creating a game using the television screen, he wrote a four-page proposal with which he was able to convince one of his supervisors to allow him to proceed. He was given US$2,500 and the time of two other engineers, Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch. They developed the [...] "Brown Box" [...] console video game system, so named because of the brown tape in which they wrapped the units to simulate wood veneer. Baer recounted that in an early meeting with a <b>patent</b> <b>examiner</b> and his attorney to patent one of the prototypes, he had set up the prototype on a television in the examiner's office and [...] "within 15 minutes, every examiner on the floor of that building was in that office wanting to play the game".|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} patent {{applications}} {{has been growing}} rapidly: in 2010 the patent application requests increased with 11 % at the European Patent Office. It is important that <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> can efficiently compare new applications with published <b>patents.</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>examiners</b> review the list of relevant patents, returned by a search query, {{one at a time}} using the current tools. There is no overview of the patents and time is wasted when the best document is the last in the list. An overview of the patent collection can provide insights into which patents can be skipped and which should be read in detail. This work proposes an Organization Viewer for reviewing a collection of patents. It is based on the research prototype TouchPat which uses multi-touch interaction and displays the patents in a static 2 D grid. In the Organizational Viewer, the patents can be organized manually in a spatial layout using a new multi-touch gesture set and Stacks. In addition, this work examines how automatic organization using the Local Affine Multidimensional Projection (LAMP) technique can also support the user. These new organization techniques are evaluated with twelve <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> at the European Patent Office using the think-aloud protocol. The results of these evaluation show that an overview is a valuable addition to the work of <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> and that the value of an overview for <b>patent</b> <b>examiners</b> depends on personal preferences as well as their domain of expertise. The TouchPat prototype and the evaluation transcripts give insight into the features that can improve the process of reviewing relevant patents.
