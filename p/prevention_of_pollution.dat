Discharges of potentially harmful substances, in particular the residual oil content of treated bilge water and air emissions, are monitored regularly to ensure compliance with environmental standards. [...] In areas where air pollution from sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, is a concern, the ship switches to low-sulfur fuel to minimise air pollution.|$|E

500|$|A major {{component}} of tanker architecture is {{the design of the}} hull or outer structure. A tanker with a single outer shell between the product and the ocean is said to be [...] "single-hulled". [...] Most newer tankers are [...] "double hulled", with an extra space between the hull and the storage tanks. Hybrid designs such as [...] "double-bottom" [...] and [...] "double-sided" [...] combine aspects of single and double-hull designs. All single-hulled tankers around the world will be phased out by 2026, in accordance with the International Convention for the <b>Prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pollution</b> from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL).

500|$|The {{environmental}} disaster {{caused by the}} 1978 sinking of the , which flew the Liberian flag, spurred {{the creation of a}} new type of maritime enforcement. Resulting from strong political and public outcry over the Amoco Cadiz sinking, fourteen European nations signed the 1982 Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control or Paris MOU. Under port state control, ships in international trade became subject to inspection by the states they visit. In addition to shipboard living and working conditions, these inspections cover items concerning the safety of life at sea and the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> by ships. In cases when a port state inspection uncovers problems with a ship, the port state may take actions including detaining the ship. In 2015, member states of the Paris MOU conducted 17,858 inspections with deficiencies, which resulted in 595 detained vessels and 11 banned. Member states of the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding conducted 17,269 ship inspections in 2015, recording 83,606 deficiencies which resulted in 1,153 detentions.|$|E
500|$|Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA) and Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) were {{byproducts}} produced {{through the}} burning of coal in the station. Bottom ash was removed from ash hoppers {{at the bottom of}} the boilers by high pressure water jets. It then travelled to ash settling ponds via sluiceways. For much of the station's life, the station was served by a series of barges, which took the ash to dump [...] out into the North Sea. Two barges provided this service over the years; Sir Fon and MVA. The barges were loaded by silos situated at a special dock to the east of the stations. However, dumping in the sea stopped in 1992 when the International Convention for the <b>Prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pollution</b> from Ships prevented further dumping in the North Sea. From then on FBA was sold to the construction industry, while PFA was either dried for sale, or was disposed of at a licensed landfill on-site.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} China’s {{role in the}} <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> vessel-source <b>pollution</b> in the South China Sea. The article argues that, although the South China Sea is a disputed sea area, China {{has the potential to}} play a leading role to improve the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> vessel-source <b>pollution</b> in this area. By playing a key role in addressing the issue <b>of</b> vessel-source <b>pollution</b> China also has the opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to co-operate to protect the marine environment of the South China Sea without inflaming the thorny sovereignty disputes in the area. First, the sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea area are introduced. The legal options under international law for states to deal with vessel-source pollution are described. China’s practice on the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> vessel-source <b>pollution</b> in the South China Sea as a flag state, coastal state and port state is discussed. Finally, the article suggests that China may promote a strengthened port state control system in the South China Sea area to improve the <b>prevention</b> <b>of</b> vessel-source <b>pollution</b> without stirring up sovereign disputes.

2500|$|Richmond was {{appointed}} as Commandant of the Coast Guard by President Dwight D. Eisenhower 13 May 1954 {{as a vice}} admiral and took office 1 June, succeeding Vice Admiral Merlin O'Neill. One of his first concerns upon taking office was a proposal by Eisenhower to merge the Coast Guard Academy with the Department of Commerce Merchant Marine Academy. Again, Richmond was able to convince proponents of the move {{that there were no}} gains in economy and several impractical features to proposal by citing the differences in the military and commercial aspects of the academies. In 1956 Richmond's staff helped {{in the formation of the}} National Search and Rescue Plan which defined the Coast Guard's role and justified further developments in search and rescue (SAR) techniques by used by cutters and aircraft. Other developments during his first term as Commandant included the coordinated use of non Coast Guard resources in oceanic SAR cases and the adoption of Loran-C used for navigation. Because of Richmond's rapport with members of Congress and a desire of the Eisenhower administration to continue improving SAR programs, he {{was appointed}} to a second term as Commandant and took office 1 June 1958. Richmond was particularly active with international maritime conferences, representing the United States at the first assembly of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) in January 1959 and four other occasions as head of the Maritime Safety Committee of IMCO. In 1960 he was head of the delegation to the Safety of Life at Sea Convention in London, for which services he was awarded the newly inaugurated Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal. On 1 June 1960, he was promoted to admiral under the authority of Public Law 86-474, which required the Commandant to hold the rank of admiral. [...] In 1960 he was chosen to preside at the sixth International Lighthouse Conference and as president of the executive committee of the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities. In 1961, Richmond was again a delegate to the second assembly of IMCO as well as chairman of the National Committee for <b>Prevention</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pollution</b> of Seas by Oil.|$|E
