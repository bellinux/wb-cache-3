5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice {{care is not}} seen as the true <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine.</b> Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E

The Medical museum features collections, individual specimens, artifacts, equipment log books/autopsy journals/paper materials and medical instruments and apparati, 25 wax models, 200 mostly skeletal dry specimens; and 400 lantern slides of anatomic specimens. There is a special emphasis on pathology; there are 2000 fluid filled-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens. The Osler collection, for example consists of 60 wet specimens while The Abbott collection consists of 80 wet specimens, mostly examples of congenital cardiac disease.|$|E

40|$|Background The Model <b>of</b> the Clinical <b>Practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine</b> is {{the basis}} for the content {{specifications}} of all American Board <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine</b> (ABEM) examinations. This study describes the frequency with which ABEM diplomates diagnose and manage the conditions and components listed in the Model <b>of</b> the Clinical <b>Practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine.</b> Objectives The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency with which ABEM diplomates diagnose and manage the conditions and components described in the Model <b>of</b> the Clinical <b>Practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine.</b> Methods The listing of conditions and components of the Model <b>of</b> the Clinical <b>Practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine</b> were sent to 16, 230 randomly selected ABEM diplomates. One of five surveys was sent to each diplomate. Each condition and component was assessed by participants for the frequency that emergency physicians diagnose (D) and manage (M) that condition, as seen in their <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine.</b> Results <b>Of</b> the 16, 230 surveys sent, 5006 were returned (30. 8 % response rate). The genders of the respondents were 75 % male and 24 % female. The ages of the respondents were primarily in the age 40 – 49 years, and 30 – 39 years age groups. All categories of the listing of conditions and components of the Model <b>of</b> the Clinical <b>Practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine</b> were encountered frequently in the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine,</b> as indicated by study participants. Conclusions A survey <b>of</b> <b>practicing</b> ABEM diplomates was useful in defining the frequency with which specific conditions and components are diagnosed and managed in the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> Emergency <b>Medicine...</b>|$|R
5|$|Eli Todd {{was born}} in 1769 in New Haven, Connecticut. He had two sisters, named Polly and Eunice. His mother was Mary Rowe, and his father, a New Haven merchant, died in 1776, {{a few months before}} his 7th birthday. He was then sent to live with his great uncle, Reverend Dr. Todd, who resided in East Guilford, in the same state. He {{remained}} with Reverend Dr. Todd until he was ten, when he was then under the care and instruction of Reverend Dr. Goodrich, of Durham, Connecticut, during which time he was introduced to the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine.</b> He began to attend Yale University at the age of fourteen in 1783, and graduated with honors at the age of eighteen in 1787. His graduation was a significant milestone in his medical career. He studied medicine as an apprentice under Dr. Ebenezer Beardsley of New Haven, and began his own medical practice in Farmington at the age of 21. He soon became the favorite practitioner of the wealthy class in the community. He used gentle treatment methods as opposed to the harsh remedies commonly used at that time. Todd was 23 years old when he established Hospital Rock on Rattlesnake Mountain. He helped found the Hartford County and Connecticut Medical Societies, and was later a member of the Conversation Club. He also founded the Society of Medical Friends in Farmington, where doctors from around Connecticut could share treatments and discuss opinions.|$|E

25|$|The <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> {{in medieval}} Europe was longstanding. A {{classical}} pagan view {{of medicine in}} which the main focus was on treating and curing disease survived as the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> evolved through the Middle Ages. People in medieval Europe had long been practicing folk medicine {{as evidenced by the}} tradition of the herb garden. The continued practice of gardening in monasteries later on and the practicality and accessibility of the works of Hildegard of Bingen and others, as mentioned previously, illustrated a longstanding precedent of medical practice. The roots of medieval medicine in the pagan and folk medicine that preceded it illustrate a development of medical practice that took place in Europe {{over a long period of}} time.|$|E

25|$|To {{a certain}} extent, medical {{practitioners}} {{have always been}} specialized. According to Galen, specialization was common among Roman physicians.

The particular subdivision of the <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> into various specialities varies from country to country, and is somewhat arbitrary.|$|E
