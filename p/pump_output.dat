50|$|Since the {{hydraulic}} pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is {{directly proportional to}} {{the speed of the}} engine. This means that at high engine speeds the steering would naturally operate faster than at low engine speeds. Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and flow-control valve direct some of the <b>pump's</b> <b>output</b> back to {{the hydraulic}} reservoir at high engine speeds.

40|$|In recent experiments, 80 -mW CW {{power in}} a single mode has been {{achieved}} from a neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser with only 1 W of electrical power input to a single semiconductor laser array pump. This corresponds to an overall efficiency of 8 percent, the highest reported CW efficiency for a Nd:YAG laser. A tightly focused semiconductor laser end pump configuration is used to achieve high pumping intensities (on the order of 1 kW/sq cm), which in turn causes the photon to photon conversion efficiency to approach the quantum efficiency (76 percent for Nd:YAG at 1. 06 microns pumped at 0. 810 micron). This is achieved despite the dual-lobed nature of the pump. Through the use of simple beam-combining schemes (e. g., polarization coupling and multireflection point <b>pumping),</b> <b>output</b> powers over 1 W and overall electrical to optical efficiencies as high as 10 percent are expected...|$|R
50|$|Factors {{including}} late {{intake valve}} closure (relatively speaking for camshaft profiles outside of typical production-car range, {{but not necessarily}} {{into the realm of}} competition engines) can produce a misleadingly low figure from this test. Excessive connecting rod clearance, combined with extremely high oil <b>pump</b> <b>output</b> (rare but not impossible) can sling enough oil to coat the cylinder walls with sufficient oil to facilitate reasonable piston ring sealing. In engines with compromised ring seals, this can artificially give a misleadingly high compression figure.|$|E
50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the swash plate angle is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous <b>pump</b> <b>output</b> flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the swash plate angle to increase <b>pump</b> <b>output</b> flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the swash plate is driven towards zero angle (piston stroke nearly zero) and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the swash plate is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The swash plate angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid gasoline, being denser than air, is {{slower than}} air {{to react to}} a force applied to it. When the {{throttle}} is rapidly opened, airflow through the carburetor increases immediately, faster than the fuel flow rate can increase. This transient oversupply of air causes a lean mixture, which makes the engine misfire (or [...] "stumble")—an effect opposite to that which was demanded by opening the throttle. This is remedied {{by the use of}} a small piston or diaphragm pump which, when actuated by the throttle linkage, forces a small amount of gasoline through a jet into the carburetor throat. This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip-in. Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume or duration by some means. Eventually, the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that <b>pump</b> <b>output</b> is reduced; this reduction of the accelerator pump shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed.|$|E
40|$|The idler is {{separated}} from the co-propagating pump in a degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) with a symmetrical parametric loop mirror (PALM), which is composed of two identical SOAs and a 70 m highly-nonlinear photonic crystal fiber (HN-PCF). The signal and pump are coupled into the symmetrical PALM from different ports, respectively. After the DFWM based wavelength conversion (WC) in the clockwise and anticlockwise, the idler exits from the signal port, while the <b>pump</b> <b>outputs</b> from its input port. Therefore, the pump is effectively suppressed in the idler channel without a high-speed tunable filter. Contrast to a traditional PALM, the DFWM based conversion efficiency is increased greatly, and {{the functions of the}} amplification and the WC are integrated in the smart SOA and HN-PCF PALM.

50|$|When {{starting}} out in Drive range, low gear was automatically selected {{and the low}} band applied under pressure modulated by a vacuum modulator which sensed engine output and adjusted clutch and band apply pressures to provide smooth engagement without slip. As the vehicle accelerated, rear <b>pump</b> <b>output</b> would increase and initiate a shift to direct. The rear pump pressures were modified by a throttle valve, and governor, both of which could delay the upshift, or even trigger a forced downshift at driver command. Full throttle downshifts were achieved by the throttle valve which permitted the transmission to stay in low range or be forced into downshifting to speeds between 45 - 50 mph. At speeds under 35 mph, heavy throttle would delay upshifts, or initiate a forced 'detent touch' kickdown for better performance. When Low Range or Reverse are selected, the apply pressures are not modulated and the full line pressure of the transmission is applied to ensure positive engagement. The multiple plate reverse clutch and double wrap low band design offered a slight buffer to engagement to prevent harshness even under high apply pressures. A quite sophisticated valve body timed shifts and apply pressures carefully in Drive range to ensure smoothness and prevent 'hunting' between gears, which is a common complaint of small cars with automatic transmission.

40|$|Many {{portable}} power applications {{require a}} power source that has buck–boost capability with low output ripple. For this application, the REG 710 {{is a prime}} choice; however understanding the affects of the <b>pump</b> and <b>output</b> capacitors allows designers {{to take full advantage}} of the REG 710 ’s capabilities in order to minimize output voltage ripple. A fundamental step in minimizing output ripple is to optimize the PCB layout. A poor layout adversely affects device operation, resulting in increased output ripple, EMI, and poor regulation. To minimize these effects, the <b>pump</b> capacitor, <b>output</b> capacitor, and input capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the REG 710 with the load connected directly across the output capacitor. For best performance, surface-mount ceramic capacitors should be used. For a recommended layout pattern, refer to the REG 710 data sheet. The REG 710 family of products, except for the REG 710 – 5, operates in both the buck and boost modes.
