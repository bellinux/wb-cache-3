40|$|In {{this essay}} I’m asking if the Scandinavian {{countries}} Sweden, Denmark and Norway use {{a third world}} <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> gender equality in their development aid politics. A third world <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> gender equality is a perspective that considers the special experiences and priorities {{of women in the}} third world. My point of view is that third world perspectives represent women in the third world better than western perspectives. To determine if the countries uses a third world <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> gender equality or not I have examined the countries aid policies with a third world theory. The material that I have used is policy documents on gender equality from the three countries and my method is discourse analysis. My study shows that Sweden Denmark and Norway uses a third world <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> gender equality to a certain extent. There are some aspects of the third world <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> gender equality that none of the countries reflect about. Norway is the country with the best result in the study. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers. According to The Business of Culture: Strategic <b>Perspectives</b> <b>on</b> Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E
5|$|The Narrator – as {{in other}} works of metafiction, the narrator's voice {{frequently}} intervenes in the story with a personality of its own. Though the voice appears {{to be that of}} Fowles, Magali Cornier Michael notes that chapter 13, which discusses the role of author and narrator within fiction, distinguishes between the author's role in the text and the narrator's. Alice Ferrebe describes the narrator as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a perpetuation of the <b>perspectives</b> <b>on</b> gendered identity perpetuated by the male gaze.|$|E

5|$|As {{a first-time}} novelist, Niffenegger had trouble finding a {{literary}} agent. She eventually sent the novel to MacAdam/Cage unsolicited and, after an auction took {{place for the}} rights, Niffenegger selected them as her publishers. The book became a bestseller after an endorsement from author and family friend Scott Turow on The Today Show, and as of March 2009 had sold nearly 2.5 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many reviewers were impressed with Niffenegger's unique <b>perspectives</b> <b>on</b> time travel. Some praised her characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized her writing style as melodramatic and the plot as emotionally trite. The novel won the Exclusive Books Boeke Prize and a British Book Award. A film version was released in August 2009.|$|E

During Commando Hunt for example, the Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks {{had been destroyed}} or damaged by air strikes in Laos. These figures were hard to reconcile with the 6,000 trucks imported annually into North Vietnam between 1965 and 1970 – {{for all of its}} operations. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started down the trail was destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to be altered in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.|$|E
