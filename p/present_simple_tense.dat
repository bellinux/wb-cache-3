This research was designed {{in the form of}} qualitative research, especially in descriptive method. This research was conducted at MAN 1 (Model) Bandar Lampung. The subject of this research was the students of class XI. A. 1 which consisted of 33 students. In analyzing the data, the researcher collected the data from the students, determined whether <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> was used in well-formed or error by the students, identified the grammatical errors made by the students, classified the errors of using <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> in studentsâ€™ descriptive text to find out the frequency of errors, displayed the data, calculated the data taken, and made the percentage in each category. Â The result shows that the students used more correct <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> than errors. The correct use of <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> was 73. 81 %, whereas the error in using <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> was 26. 19 %. Furthermore, the highest frequency of errors made by the students based on surface strategy taxonomy was omission error with 56 items (50. 90 %). The teachers are suggested to give much practice about the use of ending -s or â€“es in <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> in order to minimize the omission errors. Moreover, for other researchers, they can provide some techniques to increase studentsâ€™ mastery of <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense.</b> ...|$|R

The classification of functions is established on the corpus of seven economic books.

Futurality is interpreted broadly to include all lexical and grammatical means referring to the future. This approach makes it also possible to analyse futurality {{as a means of}} text coherence. Hence the core grammatical means are interpreted along with co-occurring lexical means under the two categories of functions to provide a comprehensive model of text coherence with regard to futurality. Frequency analysis shows that core futural expressions are not distributed equally throughout the corpus. While some expressions (e. g., will and the <b>present</b> <b>simple</b> <b>tense)</b> dominate, others prove to be rather insignificant (e. g., be on the point/verge of, the present progressive tense).

40|$|In this master’s thesis, we {{test the}} Bottleneck Hypothesis (Slabakova 2006; 2008; 2013) in L 2 {{acquisition}} of English by Norwegian speakers. According to this hypothesis, functional morphology is the bottleneck of L 2 acquisition, i. e. {{the most challenging}} part for L 2 learners to acquire. We test two constructions that do not match in English and Norwegian: subject-verb agreement and verb movement. The former represents knowledge of functional morphology and the latter represents knowledge of syntax. To elaborate, Norwegian is a V 2 language in which finite verbs move to the second position in non-subject-initial declaratives. In contrast, English has no verb movement out of VP in these types of sentences. Hence, the learning task for Norwegian speakers of English is to unlearn the V 2 rule. Westergaard (2003) has shown {{that this is a}} major challenge for Norwegian learners at an early stage. Regarding morphology, English marks <b>present</b> <b>simple</b> <b>tense</b> verbs when the subject is 3 rd person singular, whereas Norwegian has no overt subject-verb agreement. Our results indicate that agreement is not only significantly more difficult for the L 2 learners, but also a more persistent problem as the learners become more advanced speakers. This suggests that learners develop more in their knowledge of English word order than of agreement. We conclude that our findings lend support to the Bottleneck Hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{background}} of the research, Grammar is considered important, because grammar is a basic knowledge of language to understand English perfectly. But in fact, Students have difficulties in learning a grammar. Grammar cover tense, words order, modals, preposition, adjective, and ther structure items. To use in teaching grammar effectively, {{students need to be}} equiped with effective strategies to help them improve their grammar skill. Cooperative learning is one of strategy that teacher should use in his or her class. In cooperative classrooms, students are expected to help each other, to discuss and argue with each other, to asses each other’s current knowledge and fill in gaps in each other’s understandings. One of cooperative learning strategy that appropriate to teach grammar is Jigsaw Strategy. Jigsaw Strategy {{is one of the most}} flexible of cooperative learning methods. This thesis discusses Using Jigsaw Strategy to Improve Students’ Understanding on <b>Simple</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Tense.</b> The research is aimed at answering the following questions: (1) How is the implementation of Jigsaw Strategy to improve students’ understanding on <b>Simple</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Tense</b> ?, (2) how is the improvement of Students’ understanding on <b>Simple</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Tense</b> after being taught using Jigsaw Strategy ? This research is a Classroom Action Research that was done in two cycles. Data collection had been done using observation, test, and documentation. To analyze the data, descriptive quantitative analysis was used; it was used to present result research in the form of descriptive explanation. Statistic analysis is used to analyze the data about the improvement of students’ understanding on <b>Simple</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Tense.</b> The result of research showed that by using Jigsaw Strategy in teaching <b>Simple</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Tense</b> could improve students’ understanding on <b>Simple</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Tense.</b> This success can be seen from the result of students’ average score and good responses. The result after getting all of treatment using Jigsaw Strategy, the students’ average score increased in line with the increase of students score from pre cycle until second cycle. Students’ average score from the pre cycle was 63. 25, first cycle was 71. 75, and second cycle was 82. 75. Based on the result of this research, it is expected to be information for English teacher in teaching <b>Simple</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Tense...</b>|$|R

Samples of JIL and CIL were obtained through guided conversation with four Japanese native speakers and four Chinese native speakers. Tendencies {{in the use of}} <b>simple</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> and <b>simple</b> past <b>tense</b> forms produced in the JIL and CIL samples were identified, and through comparison of Interlanguage tendencies to L 1 forms, the nature of L 1 influence was analysed. It was found that most of the identified tendencies shared features of the speakers’ L 1 forms. These findings supported the hypothesis that tense and aspect forms produced in JIL and CIL are characterised by features of the speakers’ respective L 1 forms. Due to limitations on the extent of this study more extensive research is required to confirm these findings...|$|R
