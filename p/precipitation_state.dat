40|$|During this study, the {{correlation}} between the evolution of the prior austenitic grain size and of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> during thermal treatment performed on steels is presented. To do this, the <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> has been finely characterized. Precipitate volume fractions were measured by plasma spectroscopy. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to determine the precipitate size distributions (HAADF images) and the precipitate chemical composition (EDX, EELS for carbon and nitrogen). In order to treat ELLS spectra obtained on complex carbonitrides (V,Nb,Ti) (C,N), a routine based on the Least Mean square Fitting have been developed. Results obtained with this method are in good agreement with those obtained by EDX analysis for metallic elements (Nb, V, Ti,). Then, grain size distributions were determined using a special etching called "Bechet-Beaujard", which reveals the prior austenite grain boundaries. Two alloys have been characterized in this study. (i) A model alloy, the FeVNbCN, which presents two precipitate types, NbC and VCN. This alloy was chosen to study the role of nitrogen on the <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> during reversion treatments. A model predicting the precipitation kinetics, coupled with a model for grain growth, give a good agreement with experimental results on grain sizes, precipitate sizes and on precipitate volume fraction. (ii) An industrial steel, the 16 MnCr 5 +Nb was also studied. This alloy exhibits the presence of AlN and NbC precipitates. The correlation obtained between the Prior Austenite Grain Size and the evolution of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> shows that a large volume fraction of small precipitates allows a great pinning of grain boundaries. Finally, during thermo-mechanical treatments performed in the industry, some large grains may grow faster than smaller grains, leading to the so-called abnormal grain growth. This kind of growth can lead to undesirable mechanical instabilities. We have developed a criterium for abnormal grain growth which predicts the risk of such growth for a given <b>precipitation</b> <b>state.</b> This model presents a good agreement with all experimental results for both studied alloysVILLEURBANNE-DOC'INSA LYON (692662301) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E

Two stage controlled rolling (roughing and finishing) was carried out on a laboratory rolling mill {{for a set of}} completed and interrupted schedules. Subsequent to rolling, two different cooling routes were used (air-cooling and accelerated water cooling (ACC) together with coiling simulation). From the combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, detailed texture analysis and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICPMS) precipitates quantification, consistent correlations between <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> and microstructure at every stage of TMCP can be recognized.

For the samples with solution heat treatment, the 450 oC sample has a retained Cu type rolling texture while for the 500 oC and 540 oC the textures are quite random. The retained rolling texture found in the 450 oC sample {{is due to the fact}} that it was partially recrystallized as the precipitates prevent complete recrystallization.

40|$|Abstract. The {{intragranular}} nucleation of ferrite was {{studied in}} three low-carbon microalloyed steels. Recrystallization-Precipitation-Time-Temperature (RPTT) diagrams {{were determined by}} means of isothermal double-deformation hot torsion tests. Once the diagrams were drawn, several tests were carried out where the samples suffered a single deformation and were cooled after a variable holding time at a characteristic temperature such as the precipitation nose temperature. Ferrite grain size was measured in these samples and the strength-ening of austenite was measured by {{taking into account the}} unrecrystallized fraction of austenite before phase transformation. In this way, the relationship existing between <b>precipitation</b> <b>state,</b> fraction of austenite recrystallization and ferrite grain size was studied. It was found that V precipitates are more appropriate to promote intragranular nucleation than Nb precipitates. An increase in C, N and V contents pro-motes a <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> which seems to be more suitable for the intragranular nucleation to occur. The nucleation of very fine ferrite grains on V particles was assessed in another set of hot rolling simulation torsion tests carried under continuous-cooling conditions...|$|E
40|$|The low {{solubility}} of titanium nitrides (TiN) in austenite is {{taken advantage of}} in structural steels to control {{the evolution of the}} microstructure in the hot rolling process and in the heat affected zone (HAZ) in processes involving the application of heat, such as welding. However, the quantitative influence of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> of these particles on hot strength and dynamic recrystallisation kinetics, given by the precipitate size distribution and the precipitated volume, is practically unknown. The present work studies the influence of various Ti and N compositions, which give rise to different precipitation states at the reheating temperatures, on the aforementioned phenomena. The influence of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> on hot strength has been quantified by changes in the peak stress and the activation energy. A maximum has been obtained for the activation energy which corresponds to a Ti/N ratio of approximately 1. 3.

40|$|On a {{seasonal}} time scale, forecast centers of National Weather Service produce streamflow forecasts via a method called Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). In {{conjunction with the}} physically-based Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (SAC-SMA), ESP uses historical weather sequences for the forecasting period starting from model 2 ̆ 7 s current initial conditions, to produce ensemble streamflow. There are two major drawbacks of this method|(i) the ensembles are limited {{to the length of}} historical record thereby producing limited variability and (ii) incorporating seasonal climate forecasts such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is done by selecting a subset of historical sequences which further reduces the variability of streamflow forecasts. The need for alleviating these drawbacks motivates the proposed research. To this end, this research effort has two components (i) an improved multi-site stochastic weather generator and (ii) coupling it to the SAC-SMA model for ensemble streamflow forecasting. We enhanced the traditional K-nearest neighbor semi-parametric stochastic weather generator (SWG). In SWG the daily <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> (wet or dry) is modeled as a Markov Chain and the weather vector on a given day is simulated conditioned on the previous day 2 ̆ 7 s <b>precipitation</b> <b>state</b> and weather vector and current day 2 ̆ 7 s <b>precipitation</b> <b>state.</b> A K-nearest neighbor resampling approach is used to simulate from the conditional probability density function. Our improvements to this stochastic generator include (i) clustering the locations into climatologically homogeneous regions and applying the weather generator separately for each region and jointly to better capture the spatial heterogeneity and, (ii) modifying the resampling approach to incorporate probabilistic seasonal climate forecast. We tested this enhanced weather generator by applying it to daily weather sequences at 66 locations in the San Juan River Basin. The proposed method generates a rich variety of weather sequences capturing the distributional properties at all the locations and the spatial dependence. It also simulates consistent weather sequences conditioned on seasonal climate forecasts. The multi-site stochastic weather generator was coupled with the SAC-SMA model (WGESP) within NWS 2 ̆ 7 s new Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS) to produce ensemble streamflow forecast. Spring season ensemble forecasts at several lead times from Nov through Apr for the period 19812010 were made from WG-ESP and the traditional ESP for the San Juan River Basin. We show that the weather generator based ensemble produces a rich variability in the flows including extremes and a higher skill at long lead times. Especially, skill in wet year forecast was found to be higher than dry years. The flexible and robust framework provides many opportunities to further improve the ESP system in enabling increased skills at longer lead times that will be of immense help to water resources managers...|$|E

The values obtained for the driving forces of recrystallisation have always been greater than the pinning forces, allowing static recrystallisation to take place irrespective of the chemical composition of the steel and the strain applied.
