He had hoped for a €600,000 bonus for 2007 and would have received at least half that amount.|$|E

5000|$|A popular {{explanation}} for the 1987 crash was selling by program traders, most notably {{as a reaction to}} the computerized selling required by portfolio insurance hedges. [...] However, economist Dean Furbush points out that the biggest price drops occurred when trading volume was light. In <b>program</b> <b>trading,</b> computers perform rapid stock executions based on external inputs, such as the price of related securities. Common strategies implemented by <b>program</b> <b>trading</b> involve an attempt to engage in arbitrage and portfolio insurance strategies.As computer technology became more available, the use of <b>program</b> <b>trading</b> grew dramatically within Wall Street firms. After the crash, many blamed <b>program</b> <b>trading</b> strategies for blindly selling stocks as markets fell, exacerbating the decline. Some economists theorized the speculative boom leading up to October was caused by <b>program</b> <b>trading,</b> and that the crash was merely a return to normalcy. Either way, <b>program</b> <b>trading</b> ended up taking the majority of the blame in the public eye for the 1987 stock market crash. U.S. Congressman Edward J.

There are essentially two reasons to use <b>program</b> <b>trading,</b> either because of the desire to trade a large number of stocks at the same time (for example, when a mutual fund receives an influx of money it will use that money to increase its holdings in the multiple stocks which the fund is based on), or alternatively to arbitrage temporary price discrepancies between related financial instruments, such as between an index and its constituent parts.|$|E
