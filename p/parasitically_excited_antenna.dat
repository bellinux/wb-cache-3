40|$|We have {{investigated}} the unidirectional spin wave heat conveyer effect in sub-micron thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films using lock-in thermography (LIT). Although the effect is small in thin layers this technique allows us to observe asymmetric heat transport by magnons which leads to asymmetric temperature profiles differing by several mK {{on both sides of}} the <b>exciting</b> <b>antenna,</b> respectively. Comparison of Damon-Eshbach and backward volume modes shows that the unidirectional heat flow is indeed due to non-reciprocal spin-waves. Because of the finite linewidth, small asymmetries can still be observed when only the uniform mode of ferromagnetic resonance is excited. The latter is of extreme importance for example when measuring the inverse spin-Hall effect because the temperature differences can result in thermovoltages at the contacts. Because of the non-reciprocity these thermovoltages reverse their sign with a reversal of the magnetic field which is typically deemed the signature of the inverse spin-Hall voltage.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{emission}} yield {{of the second}} harmonic generation (SHG) from dense ordered arrays of L-shaped Au nanoantennas within a well-defined collection angle and compare it {{to that of the}} isolated nanostructures designed with the same geometrical parameters. Thanks to the high antenna surface density, arrays display one order of magnitude higher SHG yield per unit surface with respect to isolated nanoantennas. The difference in the collected nonlinear signals becomes even more pronounced by reducing the collection angle, because of the efficient angular filtering that can be attained in dense arrays around the zero order. Albeit this key-enabling feature allows envisioning application of these platforms to nonlinear sensing, a normalization of the SHG yield to the number of <b>excited</b> <b>antennas</b> in the array reveals a reduced nonlinear emission from each individual antenna element.

The most pronounced peak of plasma density is generated {{in the case of}} phased helical antenna at only a few mT, where the helicon wave with $|m| = 1 $ is purely excited and propagates. An analysis based on the dispersion relation well explains the density-peak phenomenon in terms of the correspondence between the antenna one-wavelength and the helicon wavelength. The $m=+ 1 $ helicon wave propagates even in high magnetic fields where the density peaks are not observed, but the $m=- 1 $ helicon wave disappers.

We present two examples: one for broad side arrays and the other for steerable linear arrays. Three instances are presented under each category consisting of different numbers of array elements and array pattern directions. The main objective of the work is to compute the radiation pattern with minimum side lobe level (SLL) for specified half power beam width (HPBW) and first null beam width (FNBW). HPBW and FNBW of a uniformly <b>excited</b> <b>antenna</b> array with similar size and main beam directions are chosen as the beam width constraints in each case.

The bacterium contains bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a, 20 % of which was esterified with tetrahydrogeranylgeraniol. In the near-infrared, the antenna showed absorption bands at 805 and 909 nm (929 nm at 6 K). Fluorescence bands were located at 925 and 954 nm, at 300 and 6 K, respectively. Fluorescence excitation spectra and time resolved picosecond absorbance difference spectroscopy showed a nearly 100 % efficient energy transfer from BChl 805 to BChl 909, with a time constant of only 2. 6 ps. This and other evidence indicate that both types of BChl belong to a single LH 1 complex.

40|$|AbstractThe {{definition}} of parameters {{that characterize the}} radiation of electric and magnetic fields for antennas in the time and frequency domain on an unified representation is proposed. The formulation uses a straightforward semi-analytical formulation that can be subsequently applied on the analysis of <b>excited</b> <b>antennas</b> for an arbitrary source with temporal behavior. The effective height is a parameter for antenna analysis defined for quantities in far field region {{and can be used}} as a transfer function of the antenna. This transfer function can be described through the antenna singularities which can be obtained by singularity expansion. The Singularity Expansion Method (SEM) is capable to model an electromagnetic quantity with the singularities extracted by the current densities of an arbitrary object. This work proposes that the singularities are extracted by the Matrix Pencil method applied on the current densities. The current densities are obtained numerically through the method of the Finite Differences in the Time Domain (FDTD) for wired log-periodic antenna and, after the singularities are obtained, the formulation of the semi-analytical effective height equation is written. To validate the presented method, a formulation of the time-domain radiation pattern is presented and a corresponding frequency-domain radiation pattern is also presented using Parseval&# 8217;s theorem...|$|R

Three-Layer EMC Circular Microstrip Antenna A three-layer EMC circular microstrip antenna consists of a probe-fed circular microstrip patch having two <b>parasitically</b> <b>excited</b> circular microstrip patches (without ground planes) stacked above it, with air gaps in between successive substrates. In the "inverted" configuration, the parasitic patches are on the lower (nearer to the driven substrate) surface of the substrate. An exhaustive experimental study of the resonant frequencies, input impedance, impedance bandwidth and radiation characteristics of this antenna, {{has been carried out}} for both the "normal" and the "inverted" configurations. Based on this experimental study, the design and optimisation of the antenna have been discussed and experimentally tested. In the S-band, it is found that an impedance bandwidth as high as 20 percent coupled with good patterns, high gain and low cross-polarisation levels, have been obtained. 2. Three-Layer EMC Circular Microstrip Antenna Arrays Experimental work has also been carried out on linear arrays of three-layer EMC circular microstrip antennas. The design of a linear array both in the E- and H- planes, of the three-layer microstrip antennas in their "normal" as well as "inverted" configurations, has been discussed and realisation carried out. Impedance bandwidths of the arrays have been experimentally found to be {{the same as that of}} the three-layer antenna element High gain and good pattern shape with sidelobes as well as cross-polarisation levels better than - 20 dB through a scan angle of 40 Â°, have been realised. A study of the mutual coupling between two-layer as well as three-layer EMC circular patch elements has also been carried out for the useful range of interelement spacings. 3.
