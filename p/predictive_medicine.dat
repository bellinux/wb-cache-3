25|$|There {{are various}} subcategories {{of the concept}} of {{personalized}} medicine such as <b>predictive</b> <b>medicine,</b> precision medicine and stratified medicine. Although these terms are used interchangeably to describe this practice, each carries individual nuances. <b>Predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> describes the field of medicine that utilizes information, often obtained through personal genomics techniques, to both predict the possibility of disease, and institute preventative measures for a particular individual. Precision medicine is a term very similar to personalized medicine in that it focuses on a patient's genes, environment, and lifestyle; however, it is utilized by National Research Council to avoid any confusion or misinterpretations associated with the broader term. Stratified medicine is a version of personalized medicine which focuses on dividing patients into subgroups based on specific responses to treatment, and identifying effective treatments for the particular group.|$|E

50|$|The {{future of}} medicine's focus may {{potentially}} shift from treating existing diseases, typically late in their progression, to preventing disease before it sets in. Predictive health and <b>predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> {{is based on}} probabilities: while it evaluates susceptibility to diseases, it {{is not able to}} predict with 100% certainty that a specific disease will occur. Unlike many preventive interventions that are directed at groups (e.g., immunization programs), <b>predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> is conducted on an individualized basis. For example, glaucoma is a monogenic disease whose early detection can allow to prevent permanent loss of vision. <b>Predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> is expected to be most effective when applied to polygenic multifactorial disease that are prevalent in industrialized countries, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. With careful usage, <b>predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> methods such as genetic screens can help diagnose inherited genetic disease caused by problems with a single gene (such as cystic fibrosis) and help early treatment. Some forms of cancer and heart disease are inherited as single-gene diseases and some people in these high-risk families may also benefit from access to genetic tests. As more and more genes associated with increased susceptibility to certain diseases are reported, <b>predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> becomes more useful.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} remarkable developments in medical treatment that is personalised, predictive and preventive. The advances made here {{have the potential}} to bring about radical change, not only in diagnostic tests and prescriptions, but also in more fundamental patterns in the provision of health care. Methods. The conceptual framework and principles of modern decision theory are applied to some of the ethical issues raised by recent advances in personalised, <b>predictive</b> and preventive <b>medicine,</b> including questions about limits of autonomy and the implications of justice and fairness in the distribution of health care services. Results. A new way of conceptualising and understanding the ethical issues raised by personalised, <b>predictive</b> and preventive <b>medicine</b> is sketched. Such medicine involves decisions under risk and decisions under uncertainty, depending {{on the extent to which}} current knowledge gaps can be filled. Conclusions. The various ways of conceptualising and understanding these problems need to be discussed before personalised, <b>predictive</b> and preventive <b>medicine</b> is implemented in practical health care...|$|R

50|$|The goal of <b>predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> is {{to predict}} the {{probability}} of future disease so that health care professionals and the patient themselves can be proactive in instituting lifestyle modifications and increased physician surveillance, such as bi-annual full body skin exams by a dermatologist or internist if their patient is found to have {{an increased risk of}} melanoma, an EKG and cardiology examination by a cardiologist if a patient is found to be at increased risk for a cardiac arrhythmia or alternating MRIs or mammograms every six months if a patient is found to be at increased risk for breast cancer. <b>Predictive</b> <b>medicine</b> is intended for both healthy individuals ("predictive health") and for those with diseases ("predictive medicine"), its purpose being to predict susceptibility to a particular disease and to predict progression and treatment response for a given disease.|$|E

40|$|Treatment of {{inflammatory}} {{skin disease}} {{has evolved from}} non-specific suppression of immune cells to increasingly precise targeting and modulation of immune mechanisms at all levels. This has led to dramatic treatment successes and deepened understanding of the pathophysiology. The cycle of in vitro studies, animal models, clinical trials, and case series of non-primary indications is a feedback loop that informs and guides the design of ever better disease models and therapeutic targets. Not only are we constantly discovering new molecules driving skin inflammation, we have also found that psoriasis and other autoimmune conditions are driven by distinct mediators occurring in early and late phases, which could be an opportunity for phase-specific or multipronged interventions. The deeper our mechanistic understanding, the more likely {{we will be able}} to discover subtle strategies to reprogram each patients' immune cells without having to dampen or eliminate their protective effects against pathogens and tumors. Lastly, ongoing genomic studies might soon confirm interesting genetic markers for <b>predictive</b> personalized <b>medicine,</b> the earliest currently being evaluated in psoriasis such as HLA-Cw 6 and TNFAIP 3.
