30|$|Traffic {{volume and}} outside lane width being {{two of the}} most {{important}} variables have concluded that the minimization of bicycle-vehicle interactions and provision of sufficient space for bicycle use are two key factors to enhance the bicycle service qualities. This can be accomplished by providing separate bicycle lane, wide curb-lane, or paved shoulder facilities. It is also concluded that, two traditional activities in Indian cities such as roadside vending activities, illegal on-street parking activities and unauthorized stoppages of intermittent <b>public</b> <b>transits</b> have a potential adverse effect on perceived satisfactions of bicyclists. Thus, these traditional activities must be rectified by the city authorities in order to enhance the bicycle service qualities on urban streets. Some major key innovations of the present study include the identification of two potential parameters not considered in previous studies such as: (1) interruptions by unauthorized stoppages of intermittent <b>public</b> <b>transits,</b> and (2) frequency of driveways carrying a high volume of traffic. In Indian cities, intermittent <b>public</b> <b>transits</b> form a significant percentage of the total traffic and usually stop on roadside areas for boarding and stepping down of passengers. These haphazard activities hinder the path of bicyclists and cause a significant discomfort to them. Likewise, the presence of driveways also has a considerable adversative effect on perceived satisfactions of bicyclists. In the Spearman’s correlation analysis, the frequency of driveways carrying a high volume of traffic had a significant correlation with user-perceived ratings. Conversely, while all driveways (including those carry a less volume of traffic) were considered together, the same parameter had an insignificant correlation with the output. Thus, the former parameter is included in the model development process. Some of these major factors additionally considered in this study feasibly differentiate the BLOS models development in developing countries from those in developed countries.|$|R

40|$|Bicycle {{commuting}} {{is rapidly}} becoming a more popular, recognized mode of sustainable transportation in major U. S. cities. Urban infrastructure and specifically public mass transportation systems must take appropriate steps {{in order to}} accommodate this new influx of bicyclists, in order to further encourage this environmentally friendly mode of transportation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to critically analyze two <b>public</b> mass <b>transit</b> systems (MTA Subway 2 ̆ 6 NY Waterway Ferry) in downtown Manhattan, New York City, to gain a better understanding of what current interactions exist between bicyclists and these two <b>public</b> mass <b>transit</b> systems. A mixed method approach that includes participant observation, ethnographic research, photographs, and a survey is used to jointly determine what the overall perception of <b>public</b> mass <b>transit</b> systems are by bicyclists in New York City. This methodology draws from both qualitative and quantitative data sources in order to determine where gaps in infrastructure and policy exist that discourage bicyclists from using these two <b>public</b> mass <b>transit</b> systems. This thesis concludes with opportunities and obstacles that bicyclists currently face in New York City, drawing from the city 2 ̆ 7 s transportation history and recent 2 ̆ 2 cyclist revolutionâ€. A reflective analysis ties together my mixed method approach, illuminating positive and negative findings between bicyclists and <b>public</b> mass <b>transit</b> systems in New York City.
