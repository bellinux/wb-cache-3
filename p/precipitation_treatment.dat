The dynamic precipitate can be deduced as β phase with face-centered cubic crystal structure (a =  2. 22  nm). Most of the β precipitates locate at the dynamic recrystallization grain boundaries.

The results demonstrate a significant dispersion strengthening effect caused by the precipitation of fine uniformly distributed dispersoids during <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatment.</b> The peak compression yield strength (YS) at 300 °C of the experimental 3004 alloy can reach as high as 78 MPa due to a large volume fraction (~ 2. 95 vol. %) of α-Al(MnFe) Si dispersoids. The dispersoids {{are found to be}} thermally stable at 300 °C for up to 1000 h of holding, leading to consistently high mechanical performance and creep resistance.

Bunge (Chenopodiaceae), a small xerophilous tree growing on contrasting textured soils, were evaluated under no, natural, and double <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments</b> {{during the entire}} growing season of 2006. The contrasting textured soils are sandy and heavy textured, and both are the original habitat of H. ammodendron at the south edge of Gubantonggute Desert, Central Asia. Photosynthesis, leaf water potential, transpiration, water use efficiency and leaf biomass production were monitored throughout the growing season. Root distribution of H. ammodendron was evaluated {{at the end of}} the experiment. Overall, this small tree did not show significant response to a large summer precipitation pulse or <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments,</b> in terms of photosynthetic carbon assimilation on either soil. The leaf water potential, transpiration, and water use efficiency appeared to be highly sensitive to a large precipitation pulse and <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments</b> in sandy soil; and leaf biomass production was also much higher for plants in sandy than that of heavy-textured soil. In sandy soil, defoliation occurred when pre-dawn leaf water potential dropped below - 3. 0 MPa, while in heavy-textured soil, defoliation occurred when pre-dawn leaf water potential dropped below - 3. 75 MPa. For similar above-ground parts, the small trees at the sandy site developed much deeper root systems and had nearly double the surface area of feeder roots compared to those at the heavy-textured site. Partially owning to the deeper and larger root system, H. ammodendron growing at coarse-textured site was in better water conditions than those at heavy-textured site under the same climatic conditions...|$|R

We also measured shifts in foliar C and nitrogen (N) content to determine possible changes in plant C/nutrient balance.

In general, the plants transpired fastest when soils were wet and slowest when soils were dry. Drought treatments increased WUE relative to plants in the ambient and wet treatments but only during the driest and warmest background conditions. Leaf N concentration increased with warming, thereby indicating that future warming may cause some plants to take up more soil N and/or allocate more N to their leaves, possibly as consequences of increased nutrient availability.

This integrated study on the ecophysiological and individual morphological scale investigated the response, acclimation and adaptation of two desert shrubs, with different water-use strategies, to variations in water conditions. The experiments were carried out on two native dominant desert shrubs, Tamarix ramosissima and Haloxylon ammodendron, under three <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments</b> (natural, double and no precipitation, respectively), in their original habitats on the southern periphery of Gurbantonggut Desert, Central Asia, {{during the growing season}} in 2005.

For the phreatophyte T. ramosissima, physiological activity and biomass accumulation rely on the stable groundwater, which shields it from fluctuation in the water status of the upper soil layers caused by precipitation. For the non-phreatophyte H. ammodendron, efficient morphological adjustment, combined with strong stomatal control, contributes to its acclimation to variation in precipitation.

Global climate change has led to alterations in precipitation in the recent years, which inevitably influences P cycling. Soil acid phosphatase plays {{a vital role in}} controlling P mineralization, and its activity reflects the capacity of organic P mineralization potential in soils. In order to study the effects of precipitation on soil acid phosphatase activity, an experiment with precipitation treatments (no precipitation, natural precipitation and doubled precipitation) in three successional forests in southern China was carried out. The three forests include Masson pine forest (MPF), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (MF) and monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (MEBF). Results showed that driven by seasonality of precipitation, changes in soil acid phosphatase activities coincided with the seasonal climate pattern, with significantly higher values in the wet season than in the dry season. Soil acid phosphatase activities were closely linked to forest successional stages, with enhanced values in the later stages of forest succession. In the dry season, soil acid phosphatase activities in the three forests showed a rising trend with increasing precipitation treatments. In the wet season, soil acid phosphatase activity was depressed by no <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatment</b> in the three forests. However, doubled <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatment</b> exerted a significantly negative effect on it only in MEBF. These results indicate that the potential transformation rate of organic P might be more dependent on water in the dry season than in the wet season. A decrease in organic P turnover would occur in the three forests if there was a drought in a whole year in the future. More rainfall in the wet season would also be adverse to organic P turnover in MEBF due to its high soil moisture...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{carbon dioxide}} {{concentrations}} {{due to the}} {{burning of fossil fuels}} and other anthropogenic activities has led to climate change, which may lead to changes in precipitation. Changes in precipitation may affect plant root morphology and chemistry. Since plant roots intermingle with the soil matrix, any changes in these characteristics can affect the soil microbial community and root decomposition. Understanding how precipitation changes affect root decomposition is important, because increased root decomposition enhances the flux of carbon from soil back to the atmosphere. Since soil is the largest terrestrial reservoir for carbon, a small increase in carbon respiration through decomposition will exacerbate climate change. With this study we aimed to assess (1) if changes in precipitation impact root architecture and (2) if fine and coarse roots decompose differently. Roots were collected from a site that has had ongoing <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments</b> for 20 years including ambient (i. e. natural conditions), summer (+ 200 mm), or winter (+ 200 mm) additions of water.

During the incubation we measured carbon respiration, a measure of root decomposition.

However, little is known about the the relative strength of direct and indirect effects or their potential to impact population persistence. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied the effects of altered precipitation and interspecific interactions on the low-density tiller growth rates and biomass production of three perennial grass species in a Kansas, USA mixed prairie. We transplanted plugs of each species into local neighborhoods of heterospecific competitors and then exposed the plugs to a factorial manipulation of growing season precipitation and neighbor removal. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>treatments</b> had significant direct effects on two of the three species. Interspecific competition also had strong effects, reducing low-density tiller growth rates and aboveground biomass production for all three species. In fact, in the presence of competitors, (log) tiller growth rates were close to or below zero for all three species. However, we found no convincing evidence that per capita competitive effects changed with precipitation, as shown by a lack of significant precipitation × competition interactions. Conclusions/Significance We found little evidence that altered precipitation will influence per capita competitive effects. However, based on species 2 ̆ 7 very low growth rates in the presence of competitors in some <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments,</b> interspecific interactions appear strong enough to affect the balance between population persistence and local extinction.

Climate influenced not only the quantity of tannins, but also their molecular composition and cell-wall associations. Irrespective of climatic treatments, tannin composition in Q. rubra was dominated by condensed tannins (CTs, proanthocyanidins). When exposed to Dry and Ambient*Warm conditions, Q. rubra produced higher quantities of tannins that were less polymerized. In contrast, under favorable conditions (Wet), tannins were produced in lower quantities, but the CTs were more polymerized. Further, even as the overall tissue tannin content declined, the content of hydrolysable tannins (HTs) increased under Wet treatments. The molecular composition of tannins influenced their content in senesced litter. Compared to the green leaves, the content of HTs decreased in senesced leaves across treatments, whereas the CT content was similar between green and senesced leaves in Wet treatments that produced more polymerized tannins. The content of total tannins in senesced leaves was higher in Warming treatments under both dry and ambient <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments.</b> Our results suggest that, though climate directly influenced the production of tannins in green tissues (and similar patterns were observed in the senesced tissue), the influence of climate on tannin content of senesced tissue was partly mediated by {{the effect on the}} chemical composition of tannins.

Even in this mesic ecosystem, Rs and Rr responded strongly to the <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments.</b> Drought reduced Rs and Rr, both annually and during the growing season. Annual cumulative Rs responded nonlinearly to precipitation treatments; both drought and supplemental precipitation suppressed Rs compared to the ambient treatment. Warming increased Rs and Rr in spring and winter when soil moisture was optimal but decreased these rates in summer when moisture was limiting. Cumulative winter Rr increased by about 200 % in the high warming (approximately 3. 5 degrees C) treatment.

The calcination of rare-earth oxalates produced mixed rare-earth oxides of 99. 2 % purity and a marketable Fe(III) solution as by-product. The electro-oxidized leachate was also subjected to an alternative neutralization route in which ammonium hydroxide was added to remove iron as ferric hydroxide. The iron free leachate with rare earth elements and cobalt was then subjected to oxalic acid <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatment,</b> which finally produced rare-earth oxides of 99. 7 % purity. Furthermore, a cobalt-rich solution was obtained in the end and electrowinning studies performed on the solution showed the feasibility of recovering pure metallic cobalt. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} were: to perform the physical-chemical characterization of a metalworking effluent and {{to carry out the}} integrated treatment (chemical precipitation and biotreatment), using effluent autochthonous microorganisms (FI and FV) and a reference (A. niger). The characterization indicated pH of 1. 7; color, 1, 495 mg Pt. L- 1; chemical oxygen demand, 9, 147 mgO 2. L - 1; oil and grease, 887 mg. L - 1, and dissolved oxygen with 2. 5 mgO 2. L - 1. With the chemical <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatment,</b> in pH = 7. 5, the reduction of all the investigated metallic ions was obtained. The color was reduced 95 % after the biotreatment using the FV microorganism. The chemical oxygen demand and oil and grease reductions were more significant when using FI, which reduced the same in 52 and 62 %, respectively. These results indicated that the autochthonous microorganisms were more efficient in the effluent treatment than the reference organism A. niger...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} response patterns and mechanisms of soil respiration to precipitation increases in subtropical regions. Methodology/Principal Findings: Field plots in three typical forests [i. e. pine forest (PF), broadleaf forest (BF), and pine and broadleaf mixed forest (MF) ] in subtropical China were exposed under either Double <b>Precipitation</b> (DP) <b>treatment</b> or Ambient <b>Precipitation</b> (AP). Soil respiration, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil microbial biomass and fine root biomass were measured over three years. We tested whether <b>precipitation</b> <b>treatments</b> influenced the relationship of soil respiration rate (R) with soil temperature (T) and soil moisture (M) using R = (a+cM) exp(bT), where a is a parameter related to basal soil respiration; b and c are parameters related to the soil temperature and moisture sensitivities of soil respiration, respectively. We found that the DP treatment only slightly increased mean annual soil respiration in the PF (15. 4 %) and did not significantly change soil respiration in the MF and the BF. In the BF, the increase in soil respiration was related to the enhancements of both soil fine root biomass and microbial biomass. The DP treatment did not change model parameters, but increased soil moisture, resulting in a slight increase in soil respiration. In the MF and the BF, the DP treatment decreased soil temperature sensitivity b but increased basal soil respiration a, resulting in no significant change in soil respiration...|$|R
