40|$|Ongoing {{reforms of}} European welfare states that aim at {{increasing}} ‘choice’ for patients, clients, and beneficiaries provide {{a unique opportunity}} to explore what exactly drives these reforms and how they reconstitute communities of economic risks. Traditionally, the solidaristic bargain underpinning European welfare states revolved around the twin objectives of a redistribution of resources and a <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> (Baldwin, 1990). Much of the retrenchment literature to date has focused on the income distributive effects of dwindling resources to explain changes in European welfare states. We postulate that more profound changes in welfare arrangements are being driven by the introduction of ‘consumer choice’ which is compatible with welfare expansion of new welfare state pillars. Our case study on long term care explores in particular, what choices users get and whether this allow us to infer the thrust behind ‘choice’ reforms as well as the effects on the <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> in European welfare states. We find that welfare state expansion in long-term care has responded to growing demand {{and that there is a}} great variety in the cost-sharing arrangements which cannot all be subsumed under the imperative of cost containment...|$|E

The social insurance is compulsory and charges an income-related contribution with <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks.</b> The private insurance is voluntary and charges a contribution based on individual risks. However due to the adverse selection problem, private insurance companies provide only partial insurance.

We also show that a mixed insurance is politically impossible, regardless of the degree of redistribution of social insurance and the joint distribution of risk and income in the population.

40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} {{effectiveness}} of prophylactic intravenous indomethacin in reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with patent ductus arteriosus and intraventricular haemorrhage in infants weighing less than 1750 g at birth. METHODS: A literature search from 1980 onwards was made of three databases: Medline; Embase; and the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials. Using strict criteria applied to randomised controlled trials only, two observers independently selected 14 studies {{for inclusion in the}} review. The methodological quality of each study was assessed independently by two observers using explicit criteria. Data on relevant outcome measures were extracted on two separate occasions. Where appropriate, the results of individual trials were combined using meta-analysis techniques to provide a <b>pooled</b> estimate <b>of</b> effect. RESULTS: There is a trend towards reduced neonatal mortality in infants receiving prophylactic indomethacin, <b>pooled</b> estimate <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> difference - 0. 025 (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 061, 0. 010). The incidence of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus is significantly reduced in treated infants, <b>pooled</b> estimate <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> difference - 0. 217 (95 % CI - 0. 275, - 0. 160), but {{there is no evidence that}} treatment affects respiratory outcomes. Prophylactic indomethacin significantly reduces the incidence of grades 3 and 4 intraventricular haemorrhage in treated infants, <b>pooled</b> estimate <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> difference - 0. 039 (95 % CI - 0. 066, - 0. 011). However, there is no sound evidence assessing the long term effect of prophylaxis on neurodevelopmental outcome.

So far as the risk sharing in the US depends on interregional transfers through {{the budget of the}} federal government, those prospects are poor. So far as the risk sharing in the US takes place though market channels, they are much better. The Paper addresses the theory and evidence on the subject. The evidence would indicate that EMU still lags far behind the US as regards the <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> through portfolio diversification. But there already seems to be little to distinguish the euro area from the US concerning the ability to borrow to smooth shocks. Thus, some extra risk sharing should already be taking place in the euro area through this channel. How much? Further, there is also evidence that the progress of European economic and monetary integration over the last decade has increased the symmetry of business cycles. This evidence is difficult to interpret. It could even be a sign of remaining capital-market imperfections.

This paper {{focuses on the}} design of a multi-pillar flood-loss sharing program involving partial compensation to flood vitims by the central government, the <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> through a private insurance on the basis of location-specific exposures, and a contingent ex-ante credit to reinsure the liabilities. The analysis is guided by an integrated catastrophe risk management (ICRM) model consisting of GIS-based flood model and a stochastic optimization procedure with respect to location-specific risk exposures. To achieve the stability and robustness of the program towards floods with various recurrences, the ICRM uses stochatic optimization procedure, which relies on insolvency constraint and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) indicators. Two alternative ways of calculating insurance premiums are compared: the robust derived with the ICRM and the traditional average annual loss approaches. The applicability of the ICRM model is illustrated on a case-study of a larger Rotterdam area outside main flood protection system in the Netherlands. Our numerical experiments demonstrate essential advantages of the robust premiums, namely that they: (1) guarantee programs solvency under all (or a percentile) flood scenarios rather than one average event; (2) establish a tradeoff between the security of the program and the welfare of locations; (3) decrease the need for other risk transfer and risk reduction measures...|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 36). IDLC Finance Ltd commenced its journey, in 1985, as the first leasing company of the country with multinational collaboration and the lead sponsorship of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of The World Bank Group. In its arduous journey since, IDLC Finance has succeeded in realizing the dreams of those who established it. Today {{it is one of}} the country’s leading NBFI, contributing significantly to the Country’s economy. In most of our life, we will be earning and spending money. Core financial services provided by financial intermediaries include payments and liquidity, maturity transformation, store of value, information processing and <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks.</b> Banks have traditionally provided most of these services and are increasingly diversifying into other areas. However, banks typically have an edge in providing payment and liquidity related services and they usually select a portfolio mix with an overriding objective of providing a certain return. Non-banking financial institutions (NBFI’s), on the other hand, tend to offer enhanced equity and risk based products. NBFI’s play a crucial role in broadening access to financial services, enhancing competition and diversification of the financial sector. They are increasingly being recognized as complementary to the banking system capable of absorbing shocks and spreading risks at times of financial distress. Traditionally our banking or financial institutions are involved in term lending activities. In this case human resources are very much important to run the operation as well as their motivation too. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a research on motivational factors influencing Hygiene Theory. First of all, to conduct the survey, I had to make a questionnaire which includes motivational factors that influences enthusiasm and eagerness of employees. Secondly, I had to go through data analysis and data interpretation by using SPSS software. For this research, I went through secondary and primary data. For instance, the data itself is the confirmation of the motivation level among my respondents. The respondents are highly motivated towards their job assignments also for their personal recognition. The factors are influencing here are, good supervisor, training level, working environment, promotional activities etc. These will be explain and enclosed later on this report.
