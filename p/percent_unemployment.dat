500|$|The Recession of 1958 was in {{part due}} to {{dramatic}} declines in the automotive industry during 1957 and early 1958. [...] It had been a record year for sales in 1955 with the industry selling almost 8 million automobiles, but this extraordinary surge in sales served to reduce demand in the following few years. [...] Sales had declined to 6.1 million in 1957 and just 4.3 million by 1958, making 1958 the worst year for auto sales since World War II. [...] Manufacturing had declined 47 percent {{by the end of the}} recession, and Michigan experienced 11 <b>percent</b> <b>unemployment,</b> the highest of any state at that time.|$|E
500|$|In {{the three}} years after the stock market crashed in 1929, 50 Philadelphia banks closed. Of those only two were large, Albert M. Greenfield's Bankers Trust Company and the Franklin Trust Company. Savings and loan {{associations}} also faced trouble, with mortgages of 19,000 properties being foreclosed in 1932 alone. By 1934, 1,600 of 3,400 savings and loan associations had shut down. [...] From 1929 to 1933, regional manufacturing fell by 45 percent; factory payrolls fell by 60 percent; retail sales fell by 40 percent. Worst hit of all was construction, where payrolls dropped 84 <b>percent.</b> <b>Unemployment</b> peaked in 1933, when 11.5 percent of whites, 16.2 percent of African Americans, and 19.1 percent of foreign-born whites were out of work. Mayor J. Hampton Moore blamed people's economic woes, not on the worldwide Great Depression, but on laziness and wastefulness, and claimed there was no starvation in the city. Soon after, he fired 3,500 city workers, instituted pay cuts, forced unpaid vacation, and reduced the number of contracts the city awarded. This saved Philadelphia millions of dollars, and the efforts kept the city from defaulting on its debts, but were unpopular among the unemployed. The city relied on state money to fund relief efforts. [...] Moore's successor S. Davis Wilson instituted numerous programs financed by Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal's Works Progress Administration, despite condemning the program during his mayoral campaign. At the peak of WPA-financed jobs in 1936, 40,000 Philadelphians were employed under the program.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relative}} importance of the two main determinants of cyclical unemployment ‡uctuations: vacancy posting and job separation. Using a matching function to model the ‡ow of new jobs, I draw on Shimer’s (2007) unemployment ‡ow rates decomposition and …nd that job separation and vacancy posting respectively account for about 40 and 60 <b>percent</b> of <b>unemployment’s</b> variance. I also generalize the ‡ow rates decomposition to higher-order moments, and I …nd that job separation contributes to about 60 <b>percent</b> of <b>unemployment</b> steepness asymmetry, a stylized fact of the jobless rate. Finally, while vacancy posting is, on average, the most important contributor of unemployment ‡uctuations, the opposite is true around business cycle turning points, when job separation is responsible for most of unemployment movements...|$|R

And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 <b>percent</b> <b>unemployment</b> and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.” Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W. Fisher said that he was [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to the views of the protesters, and added, [...] "We have too many people out of work. We have a very uneven distribution of income.

50|$|More recent {{research}} has shown that there is a moderate trade-off between low-levels of inflation and unemployment. Work by George Akerlof, William Dickens, and George Perry, implies that if inflation is reduced from two to zero <b>percent,</b> <b>unemployment</b> will be permanently increased by 1.5 percent. This is because workers generally have a higher tolerance for real wage cuts than nominal ones. For example, a worker will more likely accept a wage increase of two percent when inflation is three percent, than a wage cut of one percent when the inflation rate is zero.|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the features that, operating "inside the black box", shape the evolution of the Italian economy. In the first section the focus is placed on the functioning of the labour market at the aggregate level. The picture described suggest that the Italian labour market is characterised by high employment rates for adult males and both low participation and low employment rates for other groups of individuals (such as young, old and females) and by a large share of long-term unemployment. The rise in unemployment and its persistently high level have been blamed, both in Italy and in other European countries, on imperfections and rigidities originating mainly in the labour market. In this case, both strong employment protection regulation and rigid system of wage determination appear to have {{played a major role in}} Italy. In particular, the existence of high wage floor [...] either set through statutory minimum wages or by collective bargaining - has the effect of segmenting the labour force, increasing job instability and paradoxically increasing the duration of unemployment. An additional dimension of "segmentation" also characterises the Italian labour market, notably the 30 <b>percent's</b> <b>unemployment</b> rate in the South (6 percent in the North) and the presence of a large share of the labour force employed in the underground economy. In the last section, we discuss how the decentralisation of bargaining, the introduction of higher labour market flexibility as well as the reform of social security, could reduce "insider" power in the labour market and eliminate the vicious cycle that tends to displace workers out of the "primary" sector, thus fuelling the irregular economy...|$|R
