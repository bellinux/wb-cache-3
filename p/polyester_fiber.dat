25|$|In 2016, it was {{estimated}} that 56 million tons of PET are produced each year. While most thermoplastics can, in principle, be recycled, PET bottle recycling is more practical than many other plastic applications because of the high value of the resin and the almost exclusive use of PET for widely used water and carbonated soft drink bottling. PET has a resin identification code of 1. The prime uses for recycled PET are <b>polyester</b> <b>fiber,</b> strapping, and non-food containers.|$|E

40|$|Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) is a {{relatively}} new type of concrete with high flowability and cohesiveness compared to conventional concrete. SCC offers several economical and technical benefits; the use of fibers extends its possibilities. Fibers are known to significantly affect the workability of concrete. Therefore, an investigation was performed to compare the properties of SCC with inclusion of steel and <b>polyester</b> <b>fibers</b> in order to answer the question to what extent the workability of SCC is influenced. The Slump flow, J-ring flow, V-funnel, L-box and U-Box tests were used to evaluate the material characteristics of the fresh concrete along with some hardened properties such as compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength of the same mixtures. Based on the results of the fresh properties of SCC with fibers, steel fibers produced more hinders in flow than <b>polyester</b> <b>fibers,</b> while in hardened state steel fibers gave better strength.
