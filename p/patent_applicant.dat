2500|$|The {{grant and}} {{enforcement}} of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws. [...] Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices. A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention {{in the country in}} which that patent is granted. In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes prior art and enters the public domain (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a <b>patent</b> <b>applicant</b> does not seek protection, the application thus generally becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.|$|E
2500|$|On June 20, 1854, the United States Patent Office issued Patent No. 11,135 to O.H. Needham for {{a breast}} pump. Scientific American (1863) credits L.O. Colbin as the {{inventor}} and <b>patent</b> <b>applicant</b> of a breast pump. In 1921-23, engineer and chess master Edward Lasker produced a mechanical breast pump that imitated an infant's sucking action and was regarded by physicians as a marked improvement on existing hand-operated breast pumps, which failed {{to remove all}} the milk from the breast. The U.S. Patent Office issued [...] for Lasker's breast pump. In 1956 Einar Egnell published his groundbreaking work, [...] "Viewpoints on what happens mechanically in the female breast during various methods of milk collection".

The Egnell SMB breastpump designed through this research is quite robust and many pumps are still in operation today over 50 years after publication.|$|E

The implementation of the former policy reduces strategic non-revelation, but its overall implication remains unclear. The latter policy involves equal screening intensity across all applications, requires a limited commitment power and induces truthful revelation. patents; information; incentives...|$|R

In these nations, patent office administrators' flexibility is often restricted and the responsibility for determining patentability divided between the patent office and the courts.

However, Daegu is a city in which business is primarily based upon SMEs. In the other three cities, if the open innovation of the top 10  % of <b>patent</b> <b>applicants</b> is weakened, that of the lowest 70  % is strengthened. However, Daegu does not show opposite patterns. As such, it could be assumed that large companies and SMEs do not coexist.|$|R
