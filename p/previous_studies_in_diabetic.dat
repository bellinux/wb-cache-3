Natriuretic peptides brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone BNP (NT-proBNP) were measured. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and cardiac volumes and ejection fraction were measured. Doppler and tissue Doppler were measured and diastolic function was stratified according to recent guidelines. Very few echocardiography parameters were correlated with BNP or NT-proBNP levels.

40|$|Pioglitazone, {{added to}} {{optimised}} standard of care, in high-risk {{type 2 diabetic}} subjects with clinical atherosclerotic dis-ease, {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce the combined risk of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI and stroke. Pioglitazone, up to a dose of 45 mg, is well-tolerated in this high-risk popula-tion receiving a number of concomitant medications. Aims/purpose Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is an oral insulin sensitiser which activates PPAR-γ. Several studies suggest that pioglitazone may confer clinical benefits beyond blood-glucose lowering and could potentially slow the progression of cardiovascular disease. 1 <b>Previous</b> landmark <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> <b>diabetic</b> populations, or subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes in large-scale trials, have inves-tigated the benefits of lipid lowering drugs (principally statins), glucose-lowering agents, tight blood pressure control and renin-angiotensin blockade on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and have been reviewed recently in this journal. 2 The PROactive study was undertaken to assess the benefit of pioglitazone, in addition to optimised standard of care, on the secondary pre-vention of macrovascular events in high-risk type 2 diabetic sub-jects with established atherosclerotic disease. Trial design PROactive was a prospective multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group <b>study</b> <b>in</b> type 2 <b>diabetic</b> patients with a history of macrovascular disease.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Newly {{synthesized}} vanadyl-poly(-glutamic acid) complex (VO [...] PGA) with a VO(O 4) coordination mode {{was found}} to have potent antidiabetic activity in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced type 1 diabetic mice (STZ-mice), compared with that of a solution containing only vanadyl sulfate, VOSO 4. This was the first example of orally active vanadyl complex of -PGA for treating STZ-mice. To better define its efficacy, we examined here the effects of VO [...] PGA treatment in STZ-mice by oral administration at the dose of 10 mgV/kg body mass for a longer period time than our <b>previous</b> <b>study.</b> The improvement <b>in</b> <b>diabetic</b> states <b>in</b> STZ-mice compared with saline-treated nondiabetic normal Std ddY mice. It was found that the elevated blood glucose levels in STZ-mice significantly decreased after 3 days and sustained the normalized blood glucose level around 180 – 200 mg/dL (10 – 11. 1 mM) for the last 14 days, which is close to the blood glucose levels 100 – 200 mg/dL (5. 6 – 11. 1 mM) in nondiabetic normal Std ddY mice.

30|$|The cardiac {{function}} parameters were ambiguous, {{and due to}} the {{low number}} of animals with echocardiographic parameters in the ZLC group, the data must be interpreted with caution. We saw {{no difference in the}} cardiac output between ZDF and SprD groups; TnT values were highest in the ZDF group although not significantly, whereas, fractional shortening suggested increased left ventricular function <b>in</b> the <b>diabetic</b> group {{at the end of the}} experiment. However, fractional shortening may be an inadequate measure of cardiac function <b>in</b> this <b>study</b> as the decreased LVID and concomitant increased IVS and LPW thickness in the ZDF group may potentially result in an increased fractional shortening even in the presence of an unaltered or perhaps lowered stroke volume. This is supported by our finding of no difference in the cardiac output after cardiac arrest in the ZDF and SprD groups. The decreased diastolic diameter and increased wall thicknesses in the ZDF group may reflect edema and ischemic contracture due to IR-injury. This is supported by higher levels of TnT in the ZDF group although not significant. While <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> chronic <b>diabetic</b> rats have shown increased susceptibility to IR-injury [12, 30], this depends among other aspects on the age of the included animals as <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> isolated perfused hearts have shown increased hemodynamic recovery in 12 – 16 -week-old ZDF rats, when compared with non-diabetic controls [31, 32]. Considering this, the increased fractional shortening in the ZDF group could be explained by this as our rats were 16 – 18  weeks old. We chose this age span to ensure that the induction of cardiac arrest was conducted on animals with fully developed T 2 DM, which were still resilient enough to survive the systemic IR-injury.|$|R
40|$|T he thiazolidinedione {{class of}} an-tidiabetes drugs has various pleio-tropic effects on {{cardiovascular}} diseases and lipid metabolism (1). Thia-zolidinediones including pioglitazone {{have been shown}} to increase circulating adiponectin <b>in</b> <b>diabetic</b> subjects, although the mechanism is not well understood (2, 3). Since, <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> adi-ponectin levels <b>in</b> <b>diabetic</b> patients were evaluated after 3 weeks of pioglitazone treatment, elevated adiponectin may be, in part, secondary to improved lipid and glucose handling <b>in</b> these <b>studies.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>study,</b> we examined short-term effects of pioglitazone on serum adiponectin in nondiabetic subjects to assess the effect of pioglitazone independently of glycolipid metabolism. The study comprised 10 men aged 28 – 42 years (mean SE age 34 2 years) with normal glucose tolerance, which was confirmed by a 75 -g oral glu-cose tolerance test. Subjects gave written informed consent, and the study was ap-proved by the institutional review board of the University of Kochi Medical School. Study participants were treated with 30 mg/day pioglitazone for 14 days, and fast-ing blood samples were obtained at base-line and at days 3, 7, 10, and 14 of pioglitazone treatment.

40|$|Diabetes-induced {{changes in}} growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP- 3) and tumor {{necrosis}} factor alpha (TNFα) {{have been linked}} to decreased insulin receptor signaling <b>in</b> <b>diabetic</b> retinopathy. Our <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>in</b> retinas of <b>diabetic</b> rats have shown that Compound 49 b, a novel β-adrenergic receptor agonist, prevented diabetic changes by increasing IGFBP- 3 and decreasing TNFα, thus restoring insulin signaling and protection against diabetic retinopathy. The current study was designed to determine whether boosted expression of IGFBP- 3 NB (a non-IGF- 1 binding form of IGFBP- 3) alone is sufficient to mimic the full actions of Compound 49 b <b>in</b> protecting against <b>diabetic</b> retinopathy, as well as testing whether IGFBP- 3 NB is linked to a restoration of normal insulin signal transduction. Two months after initiation of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, rats received a single intravitreal injection of IGFBP- 3 NB plasmid in the right eye. Four days after injection, electroretinogram (ERG) analyses were performed prior to sacrifice. Whole retinal lysates from control, diabetic, diabetic + control plasmid, and diabetic+ IGFBP- 3 NB were analyzed for IGFBP- 3, TNFα, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS 3), and insulin receptor signaling partners using Western blotting or ELISA. Data show that a single intraocular injection of IGFBP- 3 NB <b>in</b> <b>diabetic</b> animals significantly reduced TNFα levels, concomitant with reductions in IRS- 1 Ser 307, SOCS 3, and pro-apoptotic markers, while restoring insulin receptor phosphorylation and increasing anti-apoptotic marker levels. These cellular changes were linked to restoration of retinal function. Our findings establish IGFBP- 3 as a pivotal regulator of the insulin receptor/TNFα pathway and a potential therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy...|$|R
