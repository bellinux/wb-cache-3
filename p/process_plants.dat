25|$|To {{the north}} of the Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF), Risley, was the site chosen for the design offices and {{headquarters}} of the Department of ATomic ENergy (DATEN) after the Second World War. Later to become the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), the offices were charged with the manufacture of the Nuclear Reactors and <b>process</b> <b>plants</b> at Windscale to help build the UKs atomic defence. Following on from the weapons program, the Risley offices were responsible for the building of the Magnox and AGR designs of reactor in the UK. In 1971 BNFL was set up from the production division of the (UKAEA), and until 2003 its headquarters were at Risley, near Warrington. BNFLs headquarters are now at Daresbury Park industrial estate, also near to Warrington.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{treatment}} stage utilises the exothermic nature of adsorption {{and results in}} desorption, partial cracking and polymerization of the adsorbed organics. The final step aims to remove charred organic residue formed in the porous structure in the previous stage and re-expose the porous carbon structure regenerating its original surface characteristics. After treatment the adsorption column can be reused. Per adsorption-thermal regeneration cycle between 5–15 wt% of the carbon bed is burnt off resulting {{in a loss of}} adsorptive capacity. Thermal regeneration is a high energy process due to the high required temperatures making it both an energetically and commercially expensive <b>process.</b> <b>Plants</b> that rely on thermal regeneration of activated carbon have to be of a certain size before it is economically viable to have regeneration facilities onsite. As a result, it is common for smaller waste treatment sites to ship their activated carbon cores to specialised facilities for regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Low {{concentrations}} of dioxins existed in nature prior to industrialization {{as a result}} of natural combustion and geological processes. Dioxins were first unintentionally produced as by-products from 1848 onwards as Leblanc <b>process</b> <b>plants</b> started operating in Germany. The first intentional synthesis of chlorinated dibenzodioxin was in 1872. Today, {{concentrations of}} dioxins are found in all humans, with higher levels commonly found in persons living in more industrialized countries. The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), became well known as a contaminant of Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. Later, dioxins were found in Times Beach, Missouri and Love Canal, New York and Seveso, Italy. More recently, dioxins have been in the news with the poisoning of President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine in 2004, the Naples Mozzarella Crisis the 2008 Irish pork crisis, and the German feed incident of 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Odors {{emitted by}} sewage {{treatment}} are typically {{an indication of}} an anaerobic or [...] "septic" [...] condition. Early stages of processing will tend to produce foul-smelling gases, with hydrogen sulfide being most common in generating complaints. Large <b>process</b> <b>plants</b> in urban areas will often treat the odors with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-slimes, small doses of chlorine, or circulating fluids to biologically capture and metabolize the noxious gases. Other methods of odor control exist, including addition of iron salts, hydrogen peroxide, calcium nitrate, etc. to manage hydrogen sulfide levels.|$|E
2500|$|The Leblanc <b>process</b> <b>plants</b> {{were quite}} {{damaging}} to the local environment. [...] The process of generating salt cake from salt and sulfuric acid released hydrochloric acid gas, and because this acid was industrially useless in the early 19th century, it was simply vented into the atmosphere. Also, an insoluble, smelly solid waste was produced. [...] For every 8 tons of soda ash, the process produced 5.5 tons of hydrogen chloride and 7 tons of calcium sulfide waste. [...] This solid waste (known as galligu) had no economic value, and was piled in heaps and spread on fields near the soda works, where it weathered to release hydrogen sulfide, the toxic gas responsible for the odor of rotten eggs.|$|E

40|$|A single <b>process</b> <b>plant</b> {{throughput}} rate {{to achieve a}} certain recovery at a certain cost is often assumed {{over the life of}} a resource project for strategic planning purposes. The <b>process</b> <b>plant</b> throughput-recovery relationship that exists for each ore type can and should be exploited for the purpose of creating additional economic value within the resource plan. This paper investigates the impact on Net Present Value (NPV) of strategic resource plans when allowing a fluctuating <b>process</b> <b>plant</b> {{throughput rate}} over the life of a base metals operation in comparison to only considering a single fixed throughput rate for a given plant size configuration. The metallurgical throughput-recovery relationship is confirmed as being an important factor in planning the extraction of the resource to feed a given <b>process</b> <b>plant</b> of fixed size since this impacts heavily upon the production schedule and therefore the NPV of the project. Mathematical programming to better aid the decision making process is investigated in comparison to traditional manual approaches to thus help determine the best throughput rate to use in each period. Results suggest that it would seem reasonable to expect an increase of around 4. 0 % in NPV when allowing a fluctuating <b>process</b> <b>plant</b> throughput rate over a single fixed throughput rate over the life of a midsize underground operation when using a mathematical programming approach...|$|R
