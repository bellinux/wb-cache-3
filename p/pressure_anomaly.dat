Regionally, however, distinct patterns of bottom <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> emerge due to spatially inhomogeneous warming and ocean circulation changes. Most prominently, the Arctic Ocean shelves experience an above-average bottom pressure increase. We find a net transfer of mass from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere, and a net movement of mass closer towards Earth's axis of rotation. Thus, ocean warming and the ensuing mass redistribution change the length-of-day by - 0. 12 ms within 200 years, demonstrating that the oceans are capable of exciting nontidal length-of-day changes on decadal and longer timescales...|$|R

The USArray Transportable Array inland and NOAA tide gauges along the coast recorded the <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> associated with the MCSs.

5000|$|Monsoons {{are caused}} by the {{different}} amplitudes of surface temperature seasonal cycles between land and oceans. This differential warming happens because heating rates differ between land and water. Ocean heating is distributed vertically through a [...] "mixed layer" [...] that may be fifty meters deep through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated turbulence, whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating only a meter or so. Additionally, the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly {{greater than that of}} most materials that make up land. Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the land warms and cools faster than the ocean. In turn, air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than does air over the ocean. The warmer air over land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. The <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> then causes a steady wind to blow toward the land, which brings the moist air over the ocean surface with it. Rainfall is then increased by the presence of the moist ocean air. The rainfall is stimulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as low-level air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows near the surface. When such lifting occurs, the air cools due expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation and precipitation.|$|E

Special emphasis is given to the surface HL which forms over Pakistan and adjoining areas of India, Iran and Afghanistan during the summer season. A heat low index (HLI) is defined to depict the surface HL. The HLI displays significant correlations with the upper level mid-latitude circulation over western central Asia and low level monsoon circulation over Arabian Sea and acts as a bridge connecting the mid-latitude wave train to the Indian summer monsoon. A time-lagged singular value decomposition analysis reveals that the eastward propagation of the midlatitude circumglobal wave train (CGT) influences the surface <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> over the Indian domain. The largest low (negative) <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> over the western parts of the HL region (i. e., Iran and Afghanistan) occur in conjunction with the upper level anomalous high that develops over western-central Asia during the positive phase of the CGT. The composite analysis also reveals {{a significant increase in the}} low <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> over Iran and Afghanistan during the positive phase of CGT. The westward increasing low <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> with its north– south orientation provokes enormous north–south pressure gradient (lower pressure over land than over sea). This in turn enables the moist southerly flow from the Arabian Sea to penetrate farther northward over northwestern India and Pakistan. A monsoon trough like conditions develops over northwestern India and Pakistan where the moist southwesterly flow from the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf converge.

The investigation used a series of climate simulations with the Community Atmospheric Model version 3 -which incorporates a coupled, dynamic global vegetation model-with and without vegetation feedback, under both present and doubled CO 2 concentrations. Results indicate that climate warming and associated changes promote circumpolar greening with northward expansion and enhanced greenness of both the Arctic tundra and boreal forest regions. This leads to additional surface warming in the high-latitudes in the growing season, primarily through more absorption of incoming solar radiation.

40|$|The {{observed}} prominent multidecadal {{variations in}} the central to eastern (C [...] E) European summer temperature {{are closely related to}} the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV). Using the Twentieth Century Reanalysis project version 2 data for the period of 1930 [...] 2012, we present a mechanism by which the multidecadal {{variations in the}} C [...] E European summer temperature are associated to a linear baroclinic atmospheric response to the AMV-related surface heat flux. Our results suggest that over the north-western Atlantic, the positive heat flux anomaly triggers a surface baroclinic pressure response to diabatic heating with a negative surface <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> to the east of the heat source. Further downstream, this response induces an east-west wave-like <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly.</b> The east-west wave-like response in the sea level pressure structure, to which we refer as North-Atlantic-European East West (NEW) mode, is independent of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation and is the principal mode of variations during summer over the Euro-Atlantic region at multidecadal time scales.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is studied using observations of the three-dimensional vorticity budget in the Atlantic sector. Analysis of the relative vorticity tendency equation shows that con-vergence of eddy vorticity flux in the upper troposphere counteracts the effect of anomalous large-scale divergence at the upper level. At low levels, the convergence associated with this large-scale vertical circula-tion cell maintains the relative vorticity anomaly against frictional drag. The eddy vorticity flux convergence thus acts to sustain the vorticity anomaly associated with the NAO against drag and increases the persis-tence of the NAO vorticity anomaly. The adiabatic cooling associated with the rising motion in the vorticity maximum also sustains the thermal structure of the NAO anomaly. This constitutes a positive eddy feed-back that helps maintain the NAO. The positive eddy feedback occurs only in the mid-latitude region and is strongest when the Atlantic jet is displaced toward the equator, with a high <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> {{to the north and}} a low <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> to the south. The stronger feedback demonstrated in the case where the jet is displaced toward the equator is consistent with the greater persistence observed for this phase of the NAO.

We first construct an index to characterize Santa Ana events based on offshore wind strength. This index is then used to identify the average synoptic conditions associated with Santa Ana events—a high <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> over the Great Basin. This <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> causes offshore geostrophic winds roughly perpendicular to the region’s mountain ranges, which in turn cause surface flow as the offshore momentum is transferred to the surface. We find, however, that there are large variations in the synoptic conditions during Santa Ana conditions, and that there are many days with strong offshore flow and weak synoptic forcing. This is due to local thermodynamic forcing that also causes strong offshore surface flow: a large temperature gradient between the cold desert surface and the warm ocean air at the same altitude creates an offshore pressure gradient at that altitude, in turn causing katabatic-like offshore flow in a thin layer near the surface. We quantify the contribution of “synoptic” and “local thermodynamic” mechanisms using a bivariate linear regression model, and find that, unless synoptic conditions force strongly onshore winds, the local thermodynamic forcing is the primary control on Santa Ana variability...|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{large-scale}} atmospheric circulation and surface temperatures on extreme dryness and wetness on the Tibetan plateau in summer are analysed using ERA- 40 reanalysis and observed precipitation. The extreme cases of drought and wetness can {{be associated with}} circulation anomalies in the North Atlantic/European sector and wave trains bridging the Eurasian continent. Drought in Tibet reveals an intense high <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> over Scandinavia supported by a more south-west to north-east orientated North Atlantic stormtrack. This creates wave trains crossing Eurasia which, on their southward 'great circle route', reach south-eastern Asia where they modulate the flow north and east of the Tibetan plateau by an anticyclone cyclone dipole suppressing moisture supply from the Bay of Bengal. Wetness in Tibet is characterised by a more zonally oriented cross Atlantic stormtrack creating a low <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> over central Europe and, associated with it, a northward shift of the sub-tropical westerly and tropical easterly jet; wave trains emerging from the North Atlantic on their equatorward route have now a higher chance to reach the sub-tropical jet entrance (instead of propagating further south). Then the wave trains are re-intensified and, passing the Mediterranean Arabian Sea route to India, interact with the monsoon's western branch to lead to ample moisture supply for Tibet. Surface temperatures give indications for positive (negative) El Nino/Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole episodes occurring in years of extreme and severe dryness (wetness) on the Tibetan plateau.

Simulations of galaxy interactions indicate that one can differentiate between these two scenarios by the dark matter content, with a low dark matter content indicating a fossil tidal dwarf. The purpose of this dissertation was to explore the dark matter distribution of two dwarf irregular galaxies using optical and neutral atomic hydrogen data. For DDO 210, the method of mass-modelling was used to determine its dark matter. About 64 % of the galaxy mass was calculated to be in the form of dark matter and hence it is unlikely to be a fossil tidal dwarf. The method of mass-modelling could not be used for DDO 169 as the galaxy shows evidence of being tidally disrupted and hence, has a disturbed velocity field. Instead, the suggestion that dark matter might be responsible for a <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> in DDO 169 was tested to determine its dark matter content.

Upper-air observations, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (formerly the National Meteorological Center) /National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis, and regional SSTs provide clues as to the physics of this relationship using composite and regression methods. Stratification of upper-air data by sea level <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the TA yields several interesting results, including anomalously high (low) pressure association with relatively dry (moist) middle levels, cooler (warmer) midlevel temperatures, and stronger (weaker) 200 – 850 -mb vertical wind shears.

The observations show systematic association between the composite moisture, temperature, and wind differences. Studies of longwave sensitivity using a two stream model show that the moisture field dominates the longwave radiative cooling; hence, dry midlevels enhance cooling of the atmosphere. The effects of SST variations and tropical cyclones on TA <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> suggest that summertime pressure in this region is strongly influenced by additional (unresolved) climate forcings.

40|$|The {{nature of}} a {{recurrent}} pattern of variability in the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) during the boreal autumn has been investigated using a 900 -yr experiment with a coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model. This Indian Ocean Pattern (IOP) is characterized by zonal surface wind perturbations along the equator, as well as east–west contrasts in the anomalous sea surface temperature (SST), surface pressure, and precipitation fields. The IOP is seen {{to be linked to}} the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in the tropical Pacific. By constructing composite charts and analyzing the heat budget for the top ocean layer, it is illustrated that the ENSO-related changes in the surface wind modify the intensity of oceanic upwelling, horizontal temperature advection, and surface heat fluxes {{in various parts of the}} IO basin. These processes lead to SST perturbations with opposite signs in the eastern and western equatorial IO. Further diagnosis of the model output reveals that some strong IOP episodes occur even in the near absence of ENSO influences. In such IOP events that do not coincide with prominent ENSO development, the most noteworthy signal is a zonally elongated sea level <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> situated south of Australia during the southern winter. The anomalous atmospheric circulation on the equatorward flank of this feature contributes to the initiation of IOP-like events when the ENSO forcing is weak. Both simulated and observational data show that the <b>pressure</b> <b>anomaly</b> south of Australia is part of a hemisphere-wide pattern bearing a considerable resemblance to the Antarctic Oscillation. This annular mode of variability is characterized by opposite pressure changes in the midlatitude and polar zones, and is only weakly correlated with ENSO.

In order to improve the atmospheric correction and to evaluate the horizontal components of attraction as well, the Newtonian attraction is computed based on the spatial density distribution derived from three-dimensional weather models...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} deducing wind speed and pressure around tropical cyclones is presented. The technique, called the Surface Wind Inference from Microwave data (SWIM technique, uses satellites microwave sounder data to measure upper tropospheric temperature anomalies which may then be related to surface <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> through the hydrostatic and radiative transfer equations. Surface pressure gradients outside of the radius of maximum wind are estimated for the first time. Future instruments may be able to estimate central pressure with + or - 0 / 1 kPa accuracy...|$|R
50|$|Many ENSO {{linkages}} {{exist in}} the high southern latitudes around Antarctica. Specifically, El Niño conditions result in high-pressure anomalies over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, causing reduced sea ice and increased poleward heat fluxes in these sectors, {{as well as the}} Ross Sea. The Weddell Sea, conversely, tends to become colder with more sea ice during El Niño. The exact opposite heating and atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>anomalies</b> occur during La Niña. This pattern of variability is known as the Antarctic dipole mode, although the Antarctic response to ENSO forcing is not ubiquitous.|$|R
