40|$|A {{method for}} shaping {{photocathode}} laser driver pulses into 3 D ellipsoidal form {{has been proposed}} and implemented. The key idea of the method {{is to use a}} chirped Bragg grating recorded within the ellipsoid volume and absent outside it. If a beam with a constant (within the grating reflection band) spectral density and uniform (within the grating aperture) cross-section is incident on such a grating, the reflected beam will be a 3 D ellipsoid in space and time. 3 D ellipsoidal beams were obtained in experiment for the first time. It is expected that such laser beams will allow the electron bunch emittance to be reduced when applied at R± <b>photo</b> <b>injectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|For each {{accelerator}} {{the choice}} of the injector is a crucial topic and the best gun concept for the different demands must be determined. This paper presents simulated beam parameters of the Rossendorfer SRF gun and compares with the RF <b>photo</b> <b>injectors.</b> The difference between normal and superconducting guns leads to different possibilities in the operation modes. Due to the high RF power losses in normal conducting guns the duty cycle is low and cw-mode operation is impossible. For the SRF gun an exterior magnetic field for emittance compensation close to the photo cathode is prohibited due to the Meißner-Ochsenfeld effect. Therefore, other mechanisms for emittance compensation must be used. In the simulations RF focusing with a proper cathode visor and a solenoid focusing after the gun are considered...|$|R
40|$|An RF <b>photo</b> <b>injector</b> for the European XFEL {{should produce}} {{electron}} beams with normalized transverse emittance under 1 mm mrad. In {{order to achieve}} this high performance of the electron source the electric field at the photo cathode has to be increased up to 60 MV/m. The emittance budget of the optimized XFEL <b>photo</b> <b>injector</b> contains {{a significant part of}} thermal (intrinsic) emittance. A roughness of the cathode could lead to an additional uncorrelated divergence of the emitted electrons and therefore to an increased thermal emittance. The cathode roughness has been modelled using an analytical approximation and numerical simulations.

40|$|Producing a {{flat-top}} temporal intensity {{profile for}} the cathode laser pulse {{is a key}} issue for the XFEL <b>photo</b> <b>injector.</b> The <b>photo</b> <b>injector</b> test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) serves as a test bench for FEL photo injectors. The PITZ cathode laser contains a pulse shaper to produce flat-top temporal pulse profiles. Based on birefringent filters the pulse shaper includes four degrees of freedom to achieve a pulse profile with parameters closer to the required XFEL <b>photo</b> <b>injector</b> specifications (20 ps FWHM, 2 ps rise/fall time). A procedure for experimental temporal laser profile optimization is presented in this paper. The laser profile is measured using a streak camera. The five parameters- pulse length (FWHM), rise and fall {{time as well as}} flat-top modulation period and depth which are obtained from a flat-top fit of the measured profile- are used in the profile evaluation. Using results of beam dynamics simulations for various cathode laser profiles a single value of the goal function – the expected emittance growth due to measured imperfections of the profile- can be obtained. The procedure of the goal function minimization has been implemented and tested at PITZ...|$|E

This concerns espe-cially minimal transverse emittances and proper longitu-dinal phase space. In the first phase {{the energy of the}} pro-duced electrons is about 5 MeV. A short description of the setup and beam parameters is given. Optimization of an electron gun is only possible basing on an extended diag-nostics system. For measuring transversal and longitudi-nal phase space high spatial and temporal resolution and low time spread are needed. Design principles, method-ical measurements and first results are presented. Opti-cal problems, design parameters and measurements of the TV-system, the optical system of the streak-camera and the laser beam-line are presented in detail. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the longitudinal phase space LPS of electron beams is of great importance for optimizing the performance of high brightness <b>photo</b> <b>injectors.</b> To get the longitudinal phase space of an electron bunch in a linear accelerator a tomographic technique can be used. The method is based on measurements of the bunch momentum spectra while varying the bunch energy chirp. The energy chirp can be varied {{by one of the}} RF accelerating structures in the accelerator and the resulting momentum distribution can be measured with a dipole spectrometer further downstream. As a result, the longitudinal phase space can be reconstructed. Application of the tomographic technique for reconstruction of the longitudinal phase space is introduced in detail in this paper.

40|$|High-quality optical beams play {{already an}} {{important}} role in the field of particle accelerators which will most probably become even more prominent in the view of laser-driven particle accelerators. Nowadays, optical transport systems are needed for particle generation in <b>photo</b> <b>injectors,</b> for particle acceleration in laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerators, for particle beam diagnostics such as synchrotron radiation monitoring systems, or for particle manipulation schemes e. g. for external seeding of free-electron lasers. For the latter case, also the photon beam transport to the user end-stations requires dedicated optical transport system. The utilized wavelengths range from the hard x-ray up to the far-infrared spectral range. Parameters like surface quality, polarization effects, damage thresholds in- and out-of-vacuum, mechanical stability, dispersion effect etc. need to be studied for the variaty of applications.

40|$|New {{generation}} accelerator-based X-ray light sources require {{high quality}} beams with high average brightness. Normal conducting L- and S-band photoinjectors {{are limited in}} repetition rate and D-C (<b>photo)</b> <b>injectors</b> are limited in field strength at the cathode. We propose a low frequency normal-conducting cavity, operating at 50 to 100 MHz CW, to provide beam bunches of up to the cavity frequency. The photoinjector uses a re-entrant cavity structure, requiring less than 100 kW CW, with a peak wall power density less than 10 W/cm{sup 2 }. The cavity will support a vacuum down to 10 picoTorr, with a load-lock mechanism for easy replacement of photocathodes. The photocathode can be embedded in a magnetic field to provide correlations useful for emittance exchange. Beam dynamics simulations indicate that normalized emittances smaller than 1 mm-mrad are possible with gap voltage of 750 kV, with fields up to 20 MV/m at the photocathode, for 1 nanocoulomb charge per bunch after acceleration and emittance compensation.
