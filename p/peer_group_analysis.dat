Such relative comparison can improve {{the security of a}} software ecosystem in a number of ways.

This paper introduces software <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>analysis,</b> a novel technique to identify least privilege violation and rank software based on the severity of the violation. We show that <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>analysis</b> is an effective tool for detecting and estimating the severity of least privilege violation.

40|$|<b>Peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>analysis</b> is a {{new tool}} for {{monitoring}} behavior over time in data mining situations. In particular, the tool detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way distinct from objects to which they had previously been similar. Each object is selected as a target object and is compared with all other objects in the database, using either external comparison criteria or internal criteria summarizing earlier behavior patterns of each object. Based on this comparison, a peer group of objects most similar to the target object is chosen. The behavior of the peer group is then summarized at each subsequent time point, and {{the behavior of the}} target object compared with the summary of its peer group.

For this <b>peer</b> <b>group,</b> the three clockspeed accelerators have been benchmarked at both corporate level and gas transmission business level, using time-series analysis and cross-sectional analysis over a 6 -year period (2002 - 2007). The results are visualized in so-called clockspeed radargraphs. Overall corporate clockspeed winners - over the performance period studied - are: Williams, El Paso and Kinder Morgan; MidAmerican {{is a close}} follower. Corporate clockspeed laggards are: CMS Energy and NiSource. The <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> ranking for the natural gas transmission business segment shows similar clockspeed winners, but with different ranking in the following order: Kinder Morgan, MidAmerican and El Paso; Williams is a close follower. Clockspeed laggards for the natural gas transmission segments coincide with the corporate clockspeed laggards of the peer group: CMS Energy and NiSource (over the performance period studied); laggards of the past may become clockspeed leaders of the future if adjustments are made. Practical recommendations are formulated for achieving competitive clockspeed optimization in the US gas transmission industry as a whole. Recommendations for clockspeed acceleration at individual companies are also given.

A device exhibiting outlier behaviour from its peer group need not be an outlier to the population of devices. Indeed a device exhibiting behaviour typical for the population of devices might deviate sufficiently far from its peer group to be flagged as an outlier.

Methods: A secondary analysis of survey data was conducted. The main study was undertaken to measure the reliability of 237 scenarios for inclusion in a national training programme. Nurses were recruited from a quota sample of Australian ED according to <b>peer</b> <b>group.</b> <b>Analysis</b> was performed to determine concordance: the percentage of responses in the modal triage category. Analysis of variance (anova) and Pearson correlations were used to investigate associations between the explanatory variables and concordance. Results: A total of 42 / 50 (84 %) participants returned questionnaires, providing 9946 scenario responses for analysis. Significant differences in concordance were observed by variables describing the type of patient presentation and level of urgency. Mean scores for the comparison group (adult pain; 70. 7 %) were higher than the groups involving a mental health or pregnancy presentations (61. 4 %; P ≤ 0. 001; 65. 0 %; P = 0. 02).

40|$|Purpose – The recent {{financial}} crises {{in the world}} have brought attention to the need for a new international financial architecture which rests on crisis prevention, crisis prediction and crisis management. It is therefore both desirable and vital to explore new predictive techniques for providing early warnings to regulatory agencies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose a new technique to prevent future crises, with reference to the last banking crises in Turkey. Design/methodology/approach – ANN is utilized as an inductive algorithm in discovering predictive knowledge structures in financial data and used to explain previous bank failures in the Turkish banking sector as a special case of EFMs (emerging financial markets). Findings – The empirical results indicate that ANN is proved to differentiate patterns or trends in financial data. Most of the bank failures could be predicted long before, with the utilization of an ANN classification approach, but more importantly it could be proposed to detect early warning signals of potential failures, as in the case of the Turkish banking sector. Practical implications – The regulatory agencies could use ANN as an alternative method to predict and prevent future systemic banking crises in order to minimize the cost to the economy. Originality/value – This paper reveals that the ANN approach can be proposed as a promising method of evaluating financial conditions in terms of predictive accuracy, adaptability and robustness, and as an alternative early warning method that can be used along with the most common alternatives such as CAMEL, financial ratio and <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> <b>analysis,</b> comprehensive bank risk assessment, and econometric models.

This {{study examines}} {{the significance of}} peers {{in the process of}} socialization in Swedish schools, that is to say, the mutual influence that children and young people exert on each other. It analyses how <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization is apprehended and evaluated in curricula for Sweden’s comprehensive schools and in related research. Part One defines the object of study more precisely by relating it to socialization research. In this part of the thesis, research on the socialization of children and young people is reviewed and some central concepts that can serve to characterize <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization are distinguished: friendship, <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> membership and youth socialization. In addition, the school is considered as a potential place of encounter for peers. Part Two consists of a systematic comparison of how different conceptions of <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization have been expressed over time in curricula and in research on schooling. Three different periods with three more or less dominant conceptions of the significance of the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> for socialization are identified: I. The potential of the school to create <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> community is formulated. II. The potential of <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization is neglected. III. The potential of <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization is rediscovered. During the first period, <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization as a means of creating community is prominent in the 1962 comprehensive school curriculum (Lgr 62) and in the official studies and schools research preceding it. In the 1969 curriculum (Lgr 69), perceptions change. Researchers are more ambivalent to the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> and there is somewhat less confidence in its positive potential to foster community. The second period is characterized by a neglect of the <b>peer</b> <b>group’s</b> potential to create community, first in the 1980 curriculum (Lgr 80) and later in that of 1994 (Lpo 94). In research on schools and youth, the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> is represented primarily as a force that seeks to contest the culture of schools. In the third period, a tendency to rediscover <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization can be observed in official studies carried out after Lpo 94. In schools research, attention is drawn to the possible contribution which the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> can make to learning. Some youth researchers express confidence in the <b>peer</b> <b>group’s</b> potential as a positive, community-creating force, {{but at the same time}} there are those who see <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization as risky and a source of problems. There may possibly be a positive community-creating force in <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> socialization that has been overlooked. All things considered, the author ventures to suggest that the community-creating potential of the <b>peer</b> <b>group</b> is an inadequately explored perspective in Swedish research on schooling, a perspective that could enable us to see the possibilities in schools, rather than the problems...|$|R
