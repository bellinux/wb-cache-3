5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

5|$|The {{stone in}} the Capitoline Temple was {{believed}} to have been among the altars located on the Capitoline Hill before the Temple was built under Tarquinius Priscus (traditional reign 616579 BC) or Tarquinius Superbus (535510 BC). When the augurs took the auspices to discover whether the god or goddess of each altar was content for it to be moved, Terminus refused permission, either alone or along with Juventas the goddess of youth. The stone was therefore included within the Capitoline Temple, and its immovability was regarded as a good omen for the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the city's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

25|$|Developmental {{theories}} are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) {{have been described}} in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.|$|E

Furthermore, we prove the stronger no-cloning theorem from the conservation of quantum information. These observations imply that the <b>permanence</b> property <b>of</b> quantum information is connected to the no-signalling and the conservation of quantum information...|$|R

The objective is to illustrate the relation between urban pre-existences and ambiance. The neighbourhoods are studied in a morphological and praxeological perspective, thus, the proposition aims to discern how heritage shapes space’s use and in return how use and practice redefine, shape and reappropriate space. It emerges that the <b>permanences</b> <b>of</b> the past are essential in the active practice of these spaces and revealed in inhabitants’ discourses...|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, the World Bank and the IMF forged the Washington Consensus, {{policies}} that included deregulation and liberalization of markets, privatization and the downscaling of government. Though the Washington Consensus was {{conceived as a}} policy that would best promote development, it was criticized for ignoring equity, employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out. Joseph Stiglitz argued that the Washington Consensus placed {{too much emphasis on}} the growth of GDP, and not enough on the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> growth or on whether growth contributed to better living standards.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Darwin {{returned}} from the Beagle survey expedition in 1836, {{he had begun to}} doubt Lyell's ideas about the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> species. He continued to be a close personal friend, and Lyell {{was one of the first}} scientists to support On the Origin of Species, though he did not subscribe to all its contents. Lyell was also a friend of Darwin's closest colleagues, Hooker and Huxley, but unlike them he struggled to square his religious beliefs with evolution. This inner struggle has been much commented on. He had particular difficulty in believing in natural selection as the main motive force in evolution.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{struggle}} between Protestant factions injured the advancement of their mutual interests, and Bucer, encouraged by Philip, was accordingly occupied {{in the attempt to}} bring Protestants together on a common religious platform, the result being the Wittenberg Concord. The emperor's fears as to the political purpose of the league were, for the time being, set aside, {{but at the same time}} a council which would include representatives of the pope was rejected and measures were taken to secure the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the Protestant cause in the future. In 1538–39 relations between Roman Catholics and Protestants became strained almost to the breaking-point, and war was averted only by the Frankfort Respite. The Protestants, however, failed to avail themselves of their opportunities, largely through the extreme docility and pliability of Philip.|$|E

25|$|Many photographers {{continue}} to produce some monochrome images, sometimes {{because of the}} established archival <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed {{using a variety of}} techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{experiencing}} clashes {{comparable to}} those in Paris, the city was quickly paralysed. The absence of household waste collection gave the streets a foul odour, and the department was short of petrol from 22 May. Against this movement of left, the extreme right was not absent: While militants had thrown an explosive device in protest at the Communist <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the city on 23 December 1967, members of Occident opposed students on 21 May, {{in front of the}} Picardy cinema. During the night of 27–28 May, students tried to take the House of Culture. In the aftermath of President Charles de Gaulle's radio address, his supporters in Amiens demonstrated in the streets on 31 May, while recovery was committed the following week. Faure law promulgated, the University of Amiens was created on 26 October, founded on a campus in the southwestern suburbs of the city.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{doctrine}} of Valentinus, as described by , the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her passion to comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming {{in contact with the}} limiting power Horos, whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert a danger that threatened to affect them all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of a new pair of Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the <b>permanence</b> <b>of</b> the order thus produced. Irenaeus (u. s.) reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair.|$|E

It proposes that an understanding <b>of</b> <b>permanence</b> is necessary in dealing with the contemporary environmental, cultural and psychological. The materialation of an architecture <b>of</b> <b>permanence</b> is explored through two primer projects, the first set on a disused harbour on the Shannon Estuary in the west of Ireland, the second in the new city quarter of Hamburg, Hafen City. Several texts are explored to gain an understanding <b>of</b> <b>permanence</b> within the architectural discourse. The final project, which looks at the lost demesnes <b>of</b> Ireland, considers <b>permanence</b> within the evolution of the landscape and how building within a existing system of control evolved over time can create permanence through a sense of continuity.
