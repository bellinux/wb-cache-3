Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{results of}} studies about {{relationship}} between depression and <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> in schizophrenia are controversial and clarifying {{the nature of}} this association may be difficult. The aim of present study is to investigate relationship between depressive symptoms and <b>positive</b> <b>signs,</b> in acute phase of patients with chronic schizophrenia, who have been admitted in Roozbeh Hospital. Materials and Methods: Assessments were performed using the Beck depression Inventory for depression (subjectively) and positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) for psychotic symptoms. Results: The results demonstrated a significant correlation between depressive symptoms and <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> in these patients. Also, a significant correlation existed between depression and these items: delusions, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, hostility. Conclusion: depressive symptoms and <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> in schizophrenia may have a common underlying pathophysiological origin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Damage of {{the central}} nervous system often {{produces}} an upper motoneuron (UMN) syndrome. Characteristics of the UMS include the presence of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>signs.</b> <b>Positive</b> <b>signs</b> are increased phasic and tonic stretch reflexes, clonus, co-contraction, released flexor reflexes, spastic dystonia, and associated reactions, whereas negative signs signify the loss or impairment of voluntary movement assembly and production. Muscle overactivity seems to be a more suitable term than spasticity, because it evokes more an image of dynamic muscle contraction, which is the general hallmark of all <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> of UMS. Some of the main patterns of UMN dysfunction include: equinovarus foot, hyper-extended great toe, stiff knee, adducted (scissoring) thighs, and flexed hip. The dynamic poly-EMG recordings of trunk and lower limb muscles in combination with the clinical examination provide a more detailed understanding of the genesis of these abnormal patterns in the UMN...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the validity of the supraspinatus test as a screening test for detecting torn rotator cuff and to determine what its valuable <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> were. Both the empty-can test and full-can test were performed on 200 shoulders diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -and in some cases, surgical findings-to have full-thickness or partial-thickness torn rotator cuff s, or no tear in the rotator cuff. During the maneuver, the presence of pain or weakness or both pain and weakness were recorded as <b>positive</b> <b>signs,</b> and the distribution of these signs were analyzed according to the degree of tear. The predictive values were calculated in 2 ways by considering (1) only full-thickness tears as tears and (2) both full- and partial-thickness tears as tears. The 2 tests and the 2 ways of considering partial-thickness tears were compared. Pain and weakness were severity-dependent, and the empty-can test had a higher incidence of pain. The sensitivities of the 2 supraspinatus tests in all <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> were higher when including partial-thickness tears in the tear group; however, their specificities were higher when excluding partial-thickness tears. Both pain and weakness were interpretive for the supraspinatus test, and both tests were sensitive to full- and partial- thickness tears and specific for full-thickness tears...|$|R

500|$|Overall, the {{alternate}} reality game received mixed response from gamers, some praising it as outstanding marketing between Portal 2 and the indie gamers, others considering it {{a way to}} force players to buy games {{they do not want}} to gain access to Portal 2 earlier. Pete Davison of GamePro considered it a [...] "risky marketing move" [...] that relied on Valve's long-standing reputation with the community to build on their trust, as well as a [...] "hugely <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> of support for indie games" [...] from the company. David Ewalt of Forbes considered the tactic a huge benefit for the indie developers, whose games led Steam sales charts in the weeks leading to Portal 2s release. Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica noted that it was entirely possible to ignore {{the alternate}} reality game without any negative effects or losing any potential benefits. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku was more critical, commenting that for most players in North America, having the release only ten hours earlieroccurring overnight for manywould be [...] "business as usual" [...] in that they would not be able to play until the next day; thus, players that purchased and spent time in the Potato Sack games may have simply wasted their money for something they didn't want to gain almost nothing back. Leigh Alexander of Gamasutra also criticized the ARG for not providing an idea of the expectation of reward when it was successfully completed, comparing the ten-hour gain to a vignette in the movie A Christmas Story, where the main character after saving up money and waiting weeks for a secret decoder ring to decipher a message from a radio program, finds that the coded message is only an advertising blurb. Alexander suggested that instead, ARGs should give players an idea of the type of reward that may be offered, and then can exceed player's expectations when it is completed. Retailers in countries where the disc-based version of the game would have lagged a few days behind the Steam release opted to break their street date to avoid losing sales to the digital downloads.|$|E

30|$|The control {{variables}} show some interesting results.

EXPOSURE enters with <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> and significance; therefore, a higher exposure to the interbank deposit market corresponds to a higher interest rate on deposits. CETES presents <b>positive</b> <b>signs</b> and significance, predictably, because of the natural relationship between IIRDE and CETES (see Fig.  1).

The correct timing of surgery in cases of gallstone pancreatitis is debatable. To delineate more clearly {{the influence of the}} timing of surgery in the treatment of the disease, {{a prospective}} randomized clinical study of early surgery (less than 48 hours after admission) and delayed surgery (more than 48 hours after admission) was conducted in 165 patients. Ranson’s prognostic signs of severity of disease were used to classify the patients into two risk groups: mild pancreatitis (three or fewer <b>positive</b> <b>signs)</b> and severe pancreatitis (more than three <b>positive</b> <b>signs).</b> In patients with three or fewer <b>positive</b> Ranson’s <b>signs,</b> the time of surgery appeared to have little effect on the outcome, whereas in patients with more than three <b>positive</b> <b>signs,</b> early surgery resulted in a significant increase in rates of morbidity and mortality. Controlled randomization showed that in patients with gallstone pancreatitis, edematous or hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis can develop, with or without inpacted stones, early or late in the progression of the disease, during early or delayed surgery. These findings suggest that (1) although a gallstone initiates a bout of pancreatitis, it does not cause the progression of the disease; (2) the fate of the progression of pancreatitis is decided early by the amount of digestive enzymes being activated; (3) early removal of an impacted stone does not ameliorate th. e progression) f pancreatitis; and (4) surgery should be performed during the initial hospital admission after the pancreatitis has subsided...|$|R
