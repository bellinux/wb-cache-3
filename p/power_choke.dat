40|$|The {{continuing}} development of microsatellites and nanosatellites for low Earth orbits requires {{the collection of}} sufficient power for instruments onboard a low-weight, low-volume spacecraft. Because the overall surface area of a microsatellite or nanosatellite is small, body-mounted solar cells cannot provide enough power. The deployment of traditional, rigid, solar arrays necessitates larger satellite volumes and weights, and also requires extra apparatus for pointing. One solution to this <b>power</b> <b>choke</b> problem is the deployment of a spherical, inflatable power system. This power system, termed the "PowerSphere," has several advantages, including a high collection area, low weight and stowage volume, {{and the elimination of}} solar array pointing mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) {{can operate}} in two {{different}} conduction modes, each one depicting {{the level of the}} current circulating in the <b>power</b> <b>choke</b> when the power switch is turned on. As will be shown, the properties of two black boxes delivering the same power levels but working in different conduction modes, will change dramatically in DC and AC conditions. The stress upon the power elements they are made of will also be affected. This article explains why the vast majority of low-power FLYBACK SMPS (off-line cellular battery chargers, VCRs etc.) operate in the discontinuous area and present a new integrated solution especially dedicated to these particular converters. Defining the mode Figure 1 a and 1 b show the general shape of a current flowing through the converter's coil during a few cycles. In the picture, the current ramps up when the switch is closed (ON time) building magnetic field in the inductor’s core. When the switch opens (OFF time), the magnetic field collapses and, according to LENZ's law, the voltage across the inductance reverses. In that case, the current has {{to find some way to}} continue its flow and start its decrease (in the output network for a FLYBACK, through the freewheel diode in a BUCK etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of twin supersonic plume resonance is defined and studied {{as it pertains}} to high level dynamic loads in the inter-nozzle region of aircraft like the F- 15 and B 1 -A. Using a 1 / 40 th scale model twin jet nacelle with <b>powered</b> <b>choked</b> nozzles, it is found that intense internozzle dynamic pressures are associated with the synchrophased coupling of each plume's jet flapping mode. This condition is found most prevalent when each plume's jet flapping mode has constituent elements composed of the B-type helical instability. Suppression of these fatigue bearing loads was accomplished by simple geometric modifications to only one plume's nozzle. These modifications disrupt the natural selection of the B-type mode and thereby decouple the plumes...|$|R
50|$|With the Overlord now captured, Anne {{questions}} the Overlord {{again with the}} help of Ben, but is forced to cease the interrogation when Ben's health is affected. Now outside, Anne is confronted by an angry Lexi who uses her <b>powers</b> to <b>choke</b> her, but collapses before she can kill Anne. Concerned for Lexis well being, Anne enlists the help of Dr Kadar who notes extreme concern for her health, and mentions that her fever is over 120 degrees. As Lexis health takes a turn for the worse, Anne turns to the Overlord in desperation and begs it for help, seemingly unaware it's still connected to Ben. When the Overlord doesn't answer her, she attacks it, causing Ben agonizing pain. Maggie hears Ben mention flowers and rushes to tell Anne the news, and of Bens condition. Understanding what the Overlord meant, Anne is able to calm Lexis fever, but is tricked by Lexi who orders Lourdes to release the Overlord. Before Anne can question Lexis motive, Lexi tells her that the Overlord is her father.|$|R
25|$|End of the {{regional}} balance of power. While other African groups adapted to horses and guns, the Basotho state successfully maintained a measure of independence from the many enemies that sought to destroy it. The Basotho case again demonstrates the complexity of African military systems, often conceived mainly in terms of hordes of attacking, spear-wielding infantry. A fuller picture must include the cavalry tradition, both {{in the south and}} in western Africa, and must take into account the alternative, tactical defensive style of peoples like the Shona and Basotho. The case of the Basotho, Zulu, Xhosa and others also shows that indigenous militaries could learn and adapt, and could achieve credible performances even in the 19th century. Some historians note that a rough balance of power prevailed in the region, with native military systems generally holding their own against settler forces and local colonial levies. The heavier intervention of British <b>power</b> however <b>choked</b> off the free market in firearms, and/or deployed regular imperial troops with modern repeating rifles, artillery and machine guns. Such imperial troops in turn, were also to crush Boer power during the Boer War, circa 1899–1902.|$|R
2500|$|Modern driver magnets {{are almost}} always {{permanent}} and made of ceramic, ferrite, Alnico, or, more recently, rare earth such as neodymium and samarium cobalt. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s; [...] there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a <b>power</b> supply <b>choke.</b> A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — {{is the use of}} the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils, as was common in the earliest designs; [...] one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by [...] "recharging" [...] the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.|$|R
2500|$|January Jones plays Emma Frost/White Queen in , {{released}} by Fox on June 3, 2011. She {{is a powerful}} telepath as well as possessing her diamond skin, and is the consort of Sebastian Shaw, the villainous leader of the Hellfire Club who seeks to start a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and United States. This would eradicate all non-mutant life and mutate any survivors, leaving the Hellfire Club to rule over this new world order. Charles Xavier, Erik Lehnsherr, and their team of teenage mutants thwart their plan, and Emma is incarcerated, though she is freed by Erik, who {{is now known as}} Magneto, {{at the end of the}} film. In this film, she is able to completely block Xavier from using his telepathy on her and Shaw, create illusions, perform mental torture, as well as sense the initial activation of Cerebro from thousands of miles away. While in diamond form, she shows absolute immunity towards psychic attack and has enhanced strength, durability, and reflexes, able to easily cut through glass and glacial ice, catch a throwing knife, and punch Magneto off a boat and into the sea. However, Erik uses his <b>powers</b> to <b>choke</b> her with a metal bar to get information out of her while in her diamond form. This caused massive cracks in her body while in that form, and after she reverts to flesh and blood, he implies a single tap should be enough to shatter her completely should she morph.|$|R
50|$|Audio {{frequency}} chokes (AFC) {{usually have}} ferromagnetic cores {{to increase their}} inductance. They are often constructed similarly to transformers, with laminated iron cores and an air gap. A major use in the past was in power rectifiers and direct current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were {{used in conjunction with}} large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency <b>power</b> supplies. Smaller <b>chokes</b> are used in switching power supplies to remove the higher-frequency switching transients from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the mains input. They often have toroidal ferrite cores.|$|R
50|$|When Anna wakes, Ray {{has taken}} her to a {{vacation}} home. There, they discuss their pasts, both revealing that they are divorced. Ray says his ex-wife, who co-founded the business, accused him of criminal wrong-doing. She agrees {{not to go to}} the police, but asks him to explain more details about what she accused him of. Anna suggests he gets off on violence and <b>power,</b> and he <b>chokes</b> her in response. She knocks him unconscious with a fire poker. Armed with Tom's rifle, Anna takes Ray hostage, threatening to shoot him unless he submits to riding in her car's trunk, a punishment he had subjected her to several times. At the end of the ride back to the city, Anna happily thanks him for the experience and offers to invest in his business. Stunned, Ray can only mumble a response. He stumbles back home, and sees Stuart in a restaurant. As Stuart waves at him, Ray cries, then laughs when he sees Stuart is eating a salad.|$|R

40|$|The adjoint {{method is}} {{considered}} {{as the most}} efficient approach to compute gradients with respect to an arbitrary number of design parameters. However, one major challenge of adjoint-based shape optimization methods is the integration into a computer-aided design (CAD) workflow for practical industrial cases. This paper presents an adjoint-based framework that uses a tailored shape parameterization to satisfy geometric constraints due to mechanical and manufacturing requirements while maintaining the shape in a CAD representation. The system employs a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm and in-house developed libraries for the CAD and grid generation {{as well as a}} 3 D Navier–Stokes flow and adjoint solver. The developed method is applied to a multipoint optimization of a turbocharger radial turbine aiming at maximizing the total-to-static efficiency at multiple operating points while constraining the output <b>power</b> and the <b>choking</b> mass flow of the machine. The optimization converged in a few design cycles in which the total-to-static efficiency could be significantly improved over a wide operating range. Additionally, the imposed aerodynamic constraints with strict convergence tolerances are satisfied and several geometric constraints are inherently respected due to the parameterization of the turbine. In particular, radial fibered blades are used to avoid bending stresses in the turbine blades due to centrifugal forces. The methodology is a step forward towards robustness and consistency of gradient-based optimization for practical industrial cases, as it maintains the optimal shape in CAD representation. As shown in this paper, this avoids shape approximations and allows manufacturing constraints to be included...|$|R
