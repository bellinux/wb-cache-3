The phs locus conferred H 2 S production on Escherichia coli, suggesting that it contains the structural gene for thiosulfate reductase. H 2 S production by the E. coli host was, as in S. typhimurium, suppressed by nitrate or glucose in the growth medium. The presence of plasmid-borne phs genes in a S. typhimurium chl+ host containing a chromosomal phs::lacZ operon fusion was found to significantly increase the relative induction efficiency of beta-galactosidase by thiosulfate.

After 6 days cultivation, the removal rates of total nitrogen (TN) and orthophosphate (PO 43 -) using CO 2 regulation were better than those using HAc. The removal rates of PO 43 - and TN were 97. 5 % and 51. 7 %, respectively using CO 2 regulation; 79. 6 % (TN) and 42. 0 % (PO 43 -) were obtained using HAc regulation. Higher biomass, protein, sugar content, and stable pH control were found using CO 2 regulation. However, significantly higher lipid content (31. 8 %) was observed using HAc regulation.

Moreover, in Na+-free media, relieving the acidification by means of ionophores restored maximal O 2 consumption. It was concluded that Na+ is not directly involved in signal transduction during stimulation. Instead, omission of Na+ affects neutrophile activation indirectly, by impairing pHi regulation...|$|R

When the antiport is inhibited, the full magnitude of the initial acidification can be appreciated.

40|$|Abstract Background The tyramine {{producer}} Enterococcus durans IPLA 655 {{contains all}} the necessary genes for tyramine biosynthesis, grouped in the TDC cluster. This cluster includes tyrS, an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase like gene. Results This work shows that tyrS was maximally transcribed in absence of tyrosine at acidic pH, showing a greater than 10 -fold induction in mRNA levels over levels occurring in presence of tyrosine. Mapping of the tyrS transcriptional start site revealed an unusually long untranslated leader region of 322 bp, which displays the typical features of the T box transcriptional attenuation mechanism. The tyrosine concentration regulation of tyrS {{was found to be}} mediated by a transcription antitermination system, whereas the specific induction at acidic pH was regulated at transcription initiation level.

Steady-state pHi was maintained {{even in the}} absence of extracellular Na+ or K+, but was significantly decreased in the absence of Cl-. Acid-loaded epimastigotes regained normal pHi by a process that was ATP-dependent and sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, dicyclohexyl-carbodi-imide and diethylstiboestrol, suggesting involvement of a H(+) -pumping ATPase. Recovery from an acid load was independent of extracellular Na+ or K+ and insensitive to omeprazole, vanadate and low concentrations of bafilomycin A 1. Using the fluorescent probe bisoxonol to measure the membrane potential of intact cells, acid loading of epimastigotes was shown to result in a dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide-sensitive hyperpolarization, which suggests electrogenic pumping of protons across the plasma membrane. Addition of glucose, but not of 6 -deoxyglucose, produced a transient cellular acidification of possible metabolic origin, and increased the rate of recovery from an acid load.
