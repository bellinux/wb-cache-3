Here we report {{the structure of the}} bacteriophage T 4 portal assembly, gene product 20 (gp 20), determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 3. 6 Å resolution. In addition, analysis of a 10 Å resolution cryo-EM map of an empty prolate T 4 head shows how the dodecameric portal assembly interacts with the capsid protein gp 23 at the special pentameric vertex. The gp 20 structure also verifies that the portal assembly is required for initiating head assembly, for attachment of the packaging motor, and for participation in DNA packaging. Comparison of the Myoviridae T 4 <b>portal</b> <b>structure</b> with the known portal structures of f 29, SPP 1 and P 22, representing Podo- and Siphoviridae, shows that the <b>portal</b> <b>structure</b> probably dates back to a time when self-replicating microorganisms were being established on Earth...|$|E

40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{in combination}} with image processing is a powerful method for obtaining structural information on non-crystallized biological macromolecules at the 10 - 50 A resolution level. The processing of noisy microscopical images requires advanced data processing methodologies in which one must carefully avoid the introduction of any form of bias into the data set. Using a novel multivariate statistical approach {{to the analysis of}} symmetry, we studied the structure of the bacteriophage SPP 1 portal protein oligomer. This <b>portal</b> <b>structure,</b> ubiquitous in icosahedral bacteriophages which package dsDNA, is located at the site of symmetry mismatch between a 5 -fold vertex of the icosahedral shell and the 6 -fold symmetric (helical) tail. From previous studies such 'head-to-tail connector' structures were generally accepted to be homododecamers assembled in a 12 -fold symmetric ring around a central channel. Using a new analysis methodology we have found that the phage SPP 1 <b>portal</b> <b>structure</b> exhibits 13 -fold cyclical symmetry: a new point group organization for oligomeric proteins. A model for the DNA packaging mechanism by 13 -fold symmetric portal protein assemblies is presented which attributes a coherent functional meaning to their unusual symmetry...|$|E

On final pathological examination, two lymph nodes were found harboring metastatic melanoma. Conclusion. Extrahepatic lymphatic intra-abdominal spread of ocular melanoma is not impossible.

40|$|Anatomic {{distortion}} and {{displacement of}} hilar structures due to liver lobe atrophy and hypertrophy occasionally complicates the surgical approach for biliary stricture repair. Benign biliary stricture following hepatic resection deserves special consideration {{in this regard}} because the inevitable hypertrophy of the residual liver causes marked rotation and displacement of the hepatic hilum that if not anticipated may render exposure for repair difficult and dangerous. Three patients with biliary stricture after hepatectomy illustrate the influence of hepatic regeneration on attempts at subsequent stricture repair. Following left hepatectomy, hypertrophy of the right and caudate lobes causes an anteromedial rotation and displacement of the <b>portal</b> <b>structures.</b> After right hepatectomy, the rotation is posterolateral, and a thoracoabdominal approach may be necessary for adequate exposure. Radiographs obtained in the standard anteroposterior projection may be deceptive, and lateral views are recom mended to aid in operative planning.

Twenty-three {{percent of}} the patients are symptomatic and present with right upper abdominal pain, nausea and fatty food intolerance. The condition is frequently mistaken with excluded or sclero-atrophic gallbladder, regardless of the imaging modality used. Consequently, AG leads often to unnecessary and potentially dangerous surgery. During laparoscopy, the absence of normal anatomical structures and the impossibility of pulling on the gallbladder to dissect the triangle of Callot represent an increased risk of iatrogenic injury to biliary or <b>portal</b> <b>structures.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} discuss the pitfalls of the available radiological exams and the management of this rare condition. We describe two cases of AG, with a review of the literature. A high index of suspicion is necessary when interpreting the radiological images. In case of doubt, a MRI-cholangiography is mandatory.

In the past several decades, educational institutions have made substantial investments in technology infrastructure with the aim of enhancing student learning, increasing student achievement, and helping students acquire digital literacy skills early on in their education.
