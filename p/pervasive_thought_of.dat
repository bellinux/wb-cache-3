[...] Part of the Christian message of reform, carried out by the Indian agents, demonstrated the <b>pervasive</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Indian land ownership of the late 19th century: civilization can only be possible when Indians cease communal living in favor of private ownership. Many citizens still held the activities of Indian agents in poor esteem, calling the agents themselves [...] "unprincipled opportunists" [...] and people of low quality.|$|E

40|$|A <b>pervasive</b> <b>thought</b> in {{contemporary}} philosophy of mathematics {{is that in}} order to justify reflection principles, one must hold universism: the view that there is a single universe of pure sets. I challenge this kind of reasoning by contrasting universism with a Zermelian form of multiversism. I argue that if extant justifications of reflection principles using notions of richness are acceptable for the universist, then the Zermelian can use similar justifications. However, I note that for some forms of richness argument, the status of reflection principles as axioms is left open for the Zermelian...|$|R

The sessions were videotaped by independent observers. The particulars of the therapeutic relationship (based on functional analytic psychotherapy) and the contextual strategies (based on acceptance and commitment therapy) used are analyzed here. This case highlights progressive positive changes in social behavior, including congruence of values and vital actions, resolution of the eating disorder, greater openness to experience, and decreased <b>pervasive</b> <b>thoughts.</b> The discussion associates these changes with the types of intervention specific to this therapeutic approach...|$|R
40|$|What {{goes through}} our minds while we fall asleep? At sleep onset, {{students}} preparing for exams commonly re-experience {{some of the}} material they have been revising during the day; lovers have <b>pervasive</b> <b>thoughts</b> about their romantic partner; software developers may see bits of programming codes unfold in their mind’s eye. These anecdotal observations suggest that, during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, elements from daytime activities may spontaneously re-emerge in dream-like mentation also called hypnagogic imagery. In a behavioral study published {{in this issue of}} SLEEP, Wamsley and colleagues 1 provide support for the existence of such spontaneous cognitive “replay” at sleep onset. In this study, healthy young participants were trained on a highly motivating visuomotor game–the downhill skiing gam...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{institutions}} {{represent a}} complex setting and a specific case of institutional translation. The European Central Bank (ECB) {{is a particular}} context as the documents translated belong {{to the field of}} economics and, thus, contain many specialised terms and neologisms that pose challenges to translators. This study aims to investigate the translation practices at the ECB, and to analyse their effects on the translated texts. In order to illustrate the way texts are translated at the ECB, the thesis will focus on metaphorical expressions and the conceptual metaphors by which they are sanctioned. Metaphor is often associated with literature and less with specialised texts. However, according to Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) conceptual metaphor theory, our conceptual system is fundamentally metaphorical in nature and metaphors are <b>pervasive</b> elements <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> and speech. The corpus compiled comprises economic documents translated at the ECB, mainly from English into Romanian. Using corpus analysis, the most salient metaphorical expressions were identified in the source and target texts and explained with reference to the main conceptual metaphors. Translation strategies are discussed {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the source and target texts. The text-based analysis is complemented by questionnaires distributed to translators, which give insights into the institution’s translation practices. As translation is an institutional process, translators have to follow certain guidelines and practices; these are discussed with reference to translators’ agency. A gap was identified in the field of institutional translation. The translation process in the EU institutions has been insufficiently explored, especially regarding the new languages of the European Union. By combining the analysis of the institutional practices, the texts produced in the institution and the translators’ work (by the questionnaires distributed to translators), this thesis intends to bring a contribution to institutional translation and metaphor translation, particularly regarding a new EU language, Romanian...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Thoughts</b> <b>of</b> {{death are}} not {{regularly}} included in diagnostic instruments and rarely examined separately from <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide. This exploratory study examined whether <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide affect {{the course of}} late-life depressive disorders. METHODS: In 378 depressed older persons, <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide were assessed using questions from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. After 2 [*]years, {{the presence of a}} DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of minor or major depression or dysthymia was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology was administered every 6 [*]months up till 3 -year follow-up. RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression showed that <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death as well as <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide predicted double depression at follow-up (OR[*]=[*] 2. 14 [95 % CI: 1. 04 - 4. 40] and OR[*]=[*] 6. 47 [95 % CI: 2. 22 - 3. 02], respectively), compared with patients without these thoughts. Results became non-significant when adjusted for baseline depression severity (OR[*]=[*] 1. 17 [95 % CI: 0. 52 - 2. 63] and OR[*]=[*] 2. 57 [95 % CI: 0. 79 - 8. 84], respectively). Mixed linear models showed that severity of depression was lowest in the reference group, while symptoms decreased more over time in those with either <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death or suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death or with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide were more severely depressed at baseline and follow-up, with the highest risk of being depressed at follow-up for patients with <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide. These associations could be explained by baseline depression severity. The results suggest that <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> death and <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> suicide are important risk markers in predicting the course of depression...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on desire to smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression <b>of</b> general smoking <b>thoughts</b> rather than thoughts specifically related to desire to smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of desire to smoke. An experimental study examined the effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke, versus expressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of desire to smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke on subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke were examined. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of desire to smoke. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression <b>of</b> smoking <b>thoughts</b> may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased desire to smoke...|$|R
