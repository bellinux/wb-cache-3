The process also focused on building the capacity of Umoja group members to acquire skills that would enable them to improve share contribution and capital for investment in the income generating activities for the members. It is assumed that by promoting the group, such endeavor can allow them to acquire a legal status that will enable them to have trust, hence, being in a position to contribute and raise their capital to invest and improve their income. The sensitization meetings were performed through organized community meetings in the ward. Here community members met with the Ward leaders and the facilitator. In additional there were regular home base training and sensitization on savings and entrepreneurship knowledge and skills. As for the training, the facilitator worked with the group and coached them on how to stimulate members to save and methods of selecting income-generating projects to invest. The ward community development officer and cooperative officer were the officials responsible for supervisory activities. Indicator measured during the supervision were on the number of sensitization meetings conducted, the number of people interested to join the group, the amount of share contributed by the group since inception to date and availability of a constitution. The constitution is an important document since it helps the group to acquire legal status. Other indicators include people awareness and management performance. (Author abstract) Mgingi, H. J.

More importantly, the servicing of large debt stocks has diverted scarce resources from investment and long-term growth.

The relative simplicity of the model makes it convenient to analyze the links between domestic adjustment policies, foreign borrowing, and growth. We estimate the optimal domestic saving rate that is consistent with maximum real consumption per unit of effective labor in the long run. As a by-product, we estimate the steady-state ratio of net external debt to GDP that is associated with this optimal outcome. The framework is an extension of the standard neoclassical growth model that incorporates endogenous technical change and global capital markets.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of China’s manufacturing, energy consumption has increased rapidly, {{and this has}} become a major bottleneck affecting the sustainable development of China’s economy. This paper deduces and constructs a homologous grey prediction model with one variable and one first order equation (HGEM(1, 1)) for forecasting the total energy consumption of China’s manufacturing based on the Grey system theory. Both parameter estimation (PE) and the deduction of the final restored expression (FRE) of the HGEM(1, 1) model are all from the time response expression of the whitenization differential equation, which solves the ‘non-homologous’ defects of PE and FRE with traditional grey prediction models. HGEM(1, 1) has good performance and can unbiasedly simulate a homogeneous/non-homogeneous exponential function sequence and a linear function sequence. Then, the HGEM(1, 1) model is used to simulate and forecast the total energy consumption of China’s energy manufacturing, and the results show that the comprehensive performance of this model is much better than that of the classic Grey Model with one variable and single order equation, GM(1, 1) for short and the frequently-used Discrete Grey Model with one variable and single order equation, DGM(1, 1) for short. Finally, we forecast the total energy consumption of China’s manufacturing industry during the years 2018 – 2024. The results show that the total energy consumption in China’s manufacturing is slowing down but is still too large. For this, some measures, such as optimizing the manufacturing structure and speeding up the development and <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>saving</b> and emission reduction technologies, to ensure the effective supply of energy in China’s manufacturing industry are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 The "global" {{financial}} crisis (GFC) emerged during 2008 {{and it was}} mainly triggered by the sub-prime mortgage crisis (SMC) in the United States of America. The main aims of this thesis is to conduct an econometric analysis of the {{financial crisis}} and household savings in South Africa and also to provide a rationale that will facilitate a policy attention on Domestic Resource Mobilisation (DRM) through household savings. The study uses quarterly time series data for the period 199401 to 201102 obtained on-line from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). The research is based on the Keynesian saving function, which is a complement of the consumption function. The model will be estimated by using a cointegrating vector autoregressive (CVAR) framework, which allows for endogeneity of the regressors. To check robustness on the cointegration results, the study employs the second empirical technique based on Generalized Impulse Response Function (GIRF) analysis and Variance Decomposition. The regression equation <b>of</b> household <b>savings</b> is expressed as a function of household disposable income, household debt to disposable income, real GOP, interest rate, inflation rate and foreign savings. The variables are tested for the presence of a unit root by the application of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (AOF), Phillips-Perron (PP) Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) tests. The findings of the study are that all variables have unit roots. The cointegration model emphasises the presence of a long run equilibrium relationship between dependent and independent variables. The CVAR reveals the short run of the dynamic household savings model. Taking this into consideration, the study concludes that household debt has a huge influence on the level <b>of</b> household <b>savings.</b> The econometric analysis also revealed that household savings in South Africa actually improved during the period associated with the GFC. It could be postulated that South African households responded to their deteriorating financial situations by reducing their average spending and increasing their savings. Variance decomposition analysis revealed that 'own shocks' constitute the predominant source of variations in household saving therefore household savings {{can be explained by the}} disturbances in macroeconomic variables in the study. The study recommends the <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> household <b>savings</b> and economic growth in order to reduce the dependence of South Africa on foreign savings. DRM is therefore enhanced by a higher level <b>of</b> household <b>savings,</b> which can facilitate higher levels of investment and economic growth. Master...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} be {{successful}} on the market, energy-saving measures for existing buildings need to be promoted with arguments that are directly relevant to the users. Initial marketing for energy retrofitting {{has been based on}} monetary profits from future energy savings. However, for most households in Europe, energy bills for the home account for only 3 - 4 percent of disposable income, hence are not a major concern. As a result <b>of</b> inappropriate <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>savings</b> for existing buildings, less than 1 percent of over 300. 000 projects certified by BREEAM are refurbishments. Apparently, the <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> energy retrofitting needs to be based on different grounds. It has been shown that people are particularly attracted to the idea of increasing the comfort and appearance of their homes, rather than carbon savings or long-term monetary profits. Therefore, the goal in this paper was to analyze the potential of linking energy-efficiency to an increase in housing quality. The first step in the research was to study the current practise of energy upgrades of the existing building stock. Sixty case studies analyzed by International Energy Agency (IEA), under SHC Task 37, were taken as references. Based on these projects, the most frequent refurbishment interventions are: addition of thermal insulation, reconstruction of balconies, enlargement of window area and restructuring of the floor plan. Each of the four measures was analyzed in a separate chapter through various aspects of housing quality. It was concluded that the energy retrofitting can contribute to a higher aesthetic value of a building and to the comfort of its occupants. However, there are some possible negative outcomes of the actions as well, which might discourage people from making the investment. In terms of architecture, both the interior and exterior can benefit from the implementation of energy-saving measures. Due to large quantity of existing buildings, the visual results from these interventions will be dominant in the urban landscape and might even define a new style in architecture. The motive for writing this paper was to provide information about beneficial outcomes from building retrofits, thus help their promotion among the users. Even though this was achieved, the information is not structured in a way relevant for the users. A common user might ask: “What should I do to increase the air quality inside my apartment?” Therefore, further work on this matter should be directed towards organizing the information in a "user-friendly" way so that people can easily get informed on which energy-saving measures directly address their particular comfort requirements and to what extent. </p...|$|R

Building on a randomized control trial, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the impact of this program on the <b>saving</b> behavior <b>of</b> participants. The intervention is successful in increasing the usage of semi-formal financial institutions on the extensive margin as well as to boost the amount held at these institutions. The total amount <b>of</b> <b>savings,</b> however, remains unaffected. Impact heterogeneity is important and the analysis shows that illiterate individuals as well as individuals having experienced theft in the recent past are more likely to respond to the program.

40|$|In {{order to}} save {{agricultural}} water, the famous FAO's "more crop per drop" has been taken literally in many arid or semi-arid {{places around the world}} and policies that aim improving "efficiencies" (irrigation efficiency…) have been implemented, often leading to the <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> water <b>saving</b> technologies. In 1865, studying coal consumption, W. S. Jevons highlighted that improving coal use efficiency could, as a paradox, lead to higher global coal use. Many economists later extended this idea to resource saving technologies in general, showing that, due to the "rebound effect", the adoption of more efficient technologies, in terms of use of resources, could lead to a higher global consumption of this resource if this adoption didn't go with adjustment measures. Regarding these considerations, the emerging question is to which extent water saving technologies (i. e. that aim improving water related efficiencies) are appropriate to save water at large scale. Our study addresses this question through the analysis of the conversion from surface to drip irrigation in Triffa's irrigated perimeter (Morocco). We aim addressing this question using the detailed analysis of two data sets. First, available data were collected for every farm within the study area from the local administrations. Second, interviews were conducted with farmers to complete the dataset and to characterize their behavior. This allowed assessing water related efficiencies at farm scale. Subsequently, models were implemented to link efficiencies with general attributes and thereby identify the main drivers of water related efficiencies in the study area. Finally, these models were used to upscale farm-scale assessment to the perimeter scale. Our results show that, under current conditions, moving from surface to drip irrigation leads to higher global water withdrawal. However, the aforementioned "rebound effect" does not allow explaining the higher pressure because of contextual specificities. Deeper analysis suggests that economic but also social and psychological issues need to be considered in this transition process. To fully achieve the expected results from moving to drip irrigation, those issues must be dealt with and the transition to drip irrigation must go hand in hand with stewardship programs and appropriate farmers capacity building...|$|R

[251] Mr. Booth tells us, with commendable frankness, that [...] "it is {{primarily}} and mainly {{for the sake}} <b>of</b> <b>saving</b> the soul that I seek the salvation of the body" [...] (p. 45), which language, being interpreted, means that the propagation of the special Salvationist creed comes first, and the <b>promotion</b> <b>of</b> the physical, intellectual, and purely moral welfare of mankind second in his estimation. Men are to be made sober and industrious, mainly, that, as washed, shorn, and docile sheep, they may be driven into the narrow theological fold which Mr. Booth patronizes.

In this sense, context-aware technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks and Real-Time Locating Systems, along with the use of Collaborative Learning, Virtual Organizations of Agents and Social Computing, provide a great potential for the development of serious games that foster the acquisition of good energy and healthy habits among workers and users in the public building. This paper presents the development of a serious game to change the users’ behaviors when using resources in public buildings using CAFCLA, a framework that allows the integration of multiple technologies that facilitate both context-awareness and social computing. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
