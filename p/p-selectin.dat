Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as <b>P-selectin,</b> prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{carbohydrate}} ligand for <b>P-selectin,</b> <b>P-selectin</b> glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), {{is expressed}} by {{different types of}} leukocytes (white blood cells). The binding of PSGL-1 on the leukocyte to <b>P-selectin</b> on the endothelial cell allows for the leukocyte to roll along the endothelial surface. This interaction can be tuned by the glycosylation pattern of PSGL-1, such that certain glycovariants of PSGL-1 will have unique affinities for different selectins, allowing in some cases for cells to migrate to specific sites within the body (e.g. the skin).|$|E
25|$|P-selectins: <b>P-selectin</b> is {{expressed}} on activated endothelial cells and platelets. Synthesis of <b>P-selectin</b> can be induced by thrombin, leukotriene B4, complement fragment C5a, histamine, TNFα or LPS.

25|$|Suppressed {{expression}} of some selectins {{results in a}} slower immune response. If L-selectin is not produced, the immune response may be ten times slower, as <b>P-selectins</b> (which can also be produced by leukocytes) bind to each other. <b>P-selectins</b> can bind each other with high affinity, but occur less frequently because the receptor-site density is lower than with the smaller E-selectin molecules. This increases the initial leukocyte rolling speed, prolonging the slow rolling phase.|$|R

40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} to endothelium {{regulates the}} trafficking and recruitment of leukocytes towards lymphoid organs and sites of inflammation. This phenomenon is {{mediated by the}} expression of a number of adhesion molecules on both the endothelium and circulating cells. Activation of endothelial cells (EC) with different stimuli induces the expression of several adhesion molecules (E- and <b>P-selectins,</b> ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1), involved in their interaction with circulating cells. In this report, we have studied the binding of nonactivated and activated B cells to purified E- and <b>P-selectins.</b> Activated but not resting B cells were able to interact with both selectins. This binding capacity of activated B cells paralleled the induction of different carbohydrate epitopes (Lewisx, sialyl-Lewisx, CD 57 and CDw 65) as well as other molecules bearing these or related epitopes in myeloid cells (L-selectin, alpha L beta 2 and alpha X beta 2 integrins, and CD 35) involved in the interaction of different cell types with selectins. B cells infiltrating inflamed tissues like in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also expressed these selectin-binding carbohydrates in parallel with the expression of E-selectin by surrounding follicular dendritic cells. Moreover, the crosslinking of these selectin-binding epitopes resulted in an increased binding of B cells to different integrin ligands. Thus, in addition to the involvement of integrins, E- and <b>P-selectins</b> could {{play an important role in}} the interaction of B lymphocytes with the endothelium during B cell extravasation into lymphoid tissues and inflammatory foci as well as in their organization into lymphoid organs...|$|R

Accordingly, sulfatide may function as a ligand for <b>P-selectin,</b> which facilitates cancer metastasis. Additionally, when L-selectin and sulfatide bind, upregulation of the chemokine co-receptor’s (CXCR4) expression is observed, specifically on the surfaced of leukocytes.|$|E

Further measurements provide a biochemical and biophysical framework for understanding the molecular basis of rolling. Displacements of tethered cells during flow reversal, and measurements of the distance between successive pauses during rolling provide estimates of the length of a tether and the length of the adhesive contact zone, and suggest that rolling occurs with as few as two tethers per contact zone. Tether bond lifetime is an exponential function of the force on the bond, and the upper limit for the tether bond spring constant is of the same order of magnitude as the estimated elastic spring constant of the lectin–EGF unit. Shear uniquely enhances the rate of L-selectin transient tether formation, and conversion of tethers to rolling adhesions, providing further understanding of the shear threshold requirement for rolling through L-selectin...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis is the {{formation}} of new capillaries from the existing vascular network and is essential for tumor growth and metastases. Increased microvessel density in breast cancer is associated with lymph node metastasis and reduced survival. We have assessed tumor vascularity in 211 breast carcinomas using a more rapid technique based on a Chalkley point eyepiece graticule. We confirmed using this method {{a significant reduction in}} overall survival between patients stratified by Chalkley count in both a univariate (p = 0. 02) and multivariate (p = 0. 05) analysis. Since studies have suggested that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) might be important in the angiogenic process, and interaction of neoplastic cells with this neovasculature is a significant step in tumor metastasis, we have also examined the expression of CAMs in a subset of these tumors (n = 64). Using immunohistochemistry we observed widespread and intense staining on the endothelium of tumor-associated vessels for PECAM (100 %), ICAM 1 (69 %), and E- and <b>P-selectins</b> (52 % and 59 % of cases respectively). Endothelial expression of the selectins was more prominent at the tumor periphery.

40|$|Activated {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocytes release heparin-binding protein (HBP; {{also known}} as CAP 37 or azurocidin) from azurophilic granules. HBP is a strong chemoattractant for monocytes that also prolongs monocyte survival and potentiates endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) -induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We investigated the binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated HBP to human monocytes {{in the presence of}} EDTA and the polysaccharide fucoidan. EDTA, which chelates divalent cations, has been widely used to study the role of divalent cations in receptor-ligand interactions or enzyme activity. Fucoidan has been used to inhibit the binding of various ligands to scavenger receptors or selectins. Scavenger receptors are multiligand receptors that mediate endocytosis of proteases, protease-inhibitor complexes, lipoproteins, and LPS-lipid A. Fucoidan also interferes with leukocyte rolling by binding to L-selectins (expressed on leukocytes) and <b>P-selectins</b> (expressed on platelets and endothelium). We demonstrate that the binding of the neutrophil-derived protein HBP to monocytes is inhibited in the presence of EDTA and fucoidan. In addition, fucoidan and EDTA abrogate the enhancing effect of HBP on LPS-induced TNF-α production. These data provide supporting evidence that HBP binds to a receptor expressed on monocytes. This receptor is dependent on divalent cations and is possibly related to the scavenger receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fucoidan, by itself, stimulates TNF-α release from isolated monocytes in a CD 14 -independent fashion. This is an important finding for the interpretation of results from studies that use fucoidan to “block” either scavenger receptors or L- or <b>P-selectins...</b>|$|R

We explored whether curcumin {{is able to}} attenuate different events related to endothelial activation. This includes adhesion, expression of adhesion molecules and oxidative stress induced by PM 10 and TiO 2 -NPs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with 1, 10 and 100 μM curcumin for 1 h and then exposed to PM 10 at 3 μg/cm 2 or TiO 2 -NPs at 10 μg/cm 2. Cell adhesion was evaluated by co-culture with U 937 human myelomonocytic cells. Adhesion molecules expression was measured by flow cytometry after 3 or 24 h of exposure. Oxidative stress was determined by 2, 7 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H 2 DCF) oxidation. PM 10 and TiO 2 -NPs induced the adhesion of U 937 cells and the expression of E- and <b>P-selectins,</b> intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1) and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1). The expression of E- and <b>P-selectins</b> matched the adhesion of monocytes to HUVEC after 3 h. In HUVEC treated with 1 or 10 μM curcumin, the expression of adhesion molecules and monocytes adhesion was significantly diminished. Curcumin also partially reduced the H 2 DCF oxidation induced by PM 10 and TiO 2 -NPs. Our results suggest an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant role by curcumin attenuating the activation caused on endothelial cells by exposure to particles. Therefore, curcumin could be useful {{in the treatment of}} diseases where an inflammatory process and endothelial activation are involved...|$|R

We examined the modulation of LOX- 1 expression and its function by two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). We observed that ox-LDL (40 mug/ml) treatment upregulated the expression of E- and <b>P-selectins,</b> VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1 in HCAECs. Ox-LDL mediated these effects via LOX- 1, since antisense to LOX- 1 mRNA decreased LOX- 1 expression and subsequent adhesion molecule expression. Pretreatment of HCAECs with simvastatin or atorvastatin (1 and 10 muM) reduced ox-LDL-induced expression of LOX- 1 as well as adhesion molecules (all P < 0. 05). A high concentration of statins (10 μM) was more potent than the low concentration (1 μM) (P < 0. 05). Both statins reduced ox-LDL-mediated activation of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) but not AP- 1.

Low molecular weight heparin {{did not have an}} effect on K 1735 melanoma tumor growth either. TF and PAR- 4 expression was similar in the three cell lines. PAR- 1 and CD 24 were hardly expressed by K 1735, whereas CT 26 cells expressed low levels and B 16 high levels of PAR- 1 and CD 24. Fibrin content of the tumors was not affected by LMWH. It is concluded that effects of anticoagulants are dependent on cancer cell type and are correlated with their CD 24 and PAR- 1 expressio...|$|R
