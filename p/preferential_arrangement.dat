In this thesis we develop a unified combinatorial framework to study the enumeration of BPAs and a special subclass of BPAs. The results of the study lead to a positive settlement of an open problem and a conjecture by Nelsen. We derive few important identities pertaining to the number of BPAs and restricted BPAs of an n element set using generating- functionology. Later we show that the number of restricted BPAs of Xn are intricately related to well-known numbers such as Eulerian numbers, Bell numbers, Poly-Bernoulli numbers and the number of equivalence classes of fuzzy subsets of Xn under some equivalent relation...|$|E

40|$|Because the European Union (EU) {{has sought}} from its {{earliest}} history to accommodate nonmember countries through various <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the further expansion toward {{the eastern part}} of Europe is bound to affect the benefits that partners in these <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> can count on. The effects of entering transition economies (TEs) can be direct, {{as a result of the}} TE obtaining access to the four freedoms of the EU. But they can also be indirect, resulting from the way enlargement alters the calculus of EU benefits and costs for present EU members. This paper examines the various <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the major effects that are likely to be experienced by them as a result of the eastward extension of the EU. Given the EU's foreign-policy objectives and the sizable changes that have occurred in Europe, the paper argues that it might now be the appropriate occasion to reexamine those <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The article pays special attention to the ramification of eastward expansion on TEs that will not now or ever qualify for EU membership, yet remain of strategic concern to the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|A <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{of a set}} is a total {{ordering}} {{of the elements of}} that set with ties allowed. A barred <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> is one in which the tied blocks of elements are ordered not only amongst themselves but also with respect to one or more bars. We present various combinatorial identities for r_{m,l}, the number of barred preferential arrangements of l elements with m bars, using both algebraic and combinatorial arguments. Our main result is an expression for r_{m,l} as a linear combination of the r_k (= r_{ 0,k}, the number of unbarred preferential arrangements of k elements) for l <= k<=l+m. We also study those arrangements in which the sections, into which the blocks are segregated by the bars, must be nonempty.

40|$|A <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{of a set}} X_n={ 1, 2, [...] .,n} is an ordered {{partition}} of the set X_n induced with a linear order. Separation of blocks of a <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> with bars result in the notation of barred preferential arrangements. Roger Nelsen and Harvey Schmidt have proposed the family of generating functions P^k(m) =e^km/ 2 -e^m; which for k= 0 and for k= 2 they {{have shown that the}} generating functions are exponential generating functions for the number of preferential arrangements of a set X_n and the number of chains in the power set of X_n respectively. In this study we propose combinatorial structures whose integer sequences are generated by members of the family for all values of k in Z^+. To do this we use a notion of restricted barred preferential arrangements. We then propose a more general family of generating functions P^r_j(m) =e^rm/(2 -e^m) ^j for r,j∈Z^+.

Alternatively the sequence has been interpreted as the number of ordered partitions; the outcomes in races in which ties are allowed or geometrically the number of vertices, edges and faces of simplicial objects. An interesting application of the sequence is found in combination locks. The idea of a <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> has been extended to a wider combinatorial object called barred <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> with multiple bars.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} theory and {{evidence}} that history {{plays a role in}} shaping the direction of international trade. Because there are reasons to anticipate a positive correlation between the predominant direction of trade flows in the past and membership in <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the present, there may be a tendency to spuriously attribute to <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangements</b> the effects of historical factors and to exaggerate the influence of the former. Thus, the standard gravity-model formulation, which neglects the role of historical factors, suffers from omitted-variables bias. We illustrate these points by analyzing the evolution of trade between 1949 and 1964. We find that historical factors exercise an important influence on trade even after controlling for the arguments of the standard gravity model. ...|$|R

40|$|Under proper growth conditions, {{ordered and}} uniform Mn nanodots were {{fabricated}} on the Si(111) - 7 x 7 surface without {{the presence of}} a wetting layer. Furthermore, the Mn nanodots deposited onto the elevated substrates were observed to occupy preferentially on the faulted half unit cells (FHUCs) of the Si(111) - 7 x 7 surface. This phenomenon implies that the Mn dots adsorbed on the FHUCs is more stable than those adsorbed on the unfaulted half unit cells (UFHUCs). Within the framework of quasiequilibrium thermodynamics, the energy difference between adsorption on the UFHUCs and the FHUCs was estimated to be 0. 05 eV.

40|$|International audienceMolecular {{dynamics}} simulations {{were performed}} {{in order to}} obtain a detailed understanding of the selfdiffusion mechanisms of methanol in the zeolite NaY system. We derived a new force-field term to describe the interactions between the methanol molecules and the extraframework cations. From the simulations, we show that diffusive behavior in the high-temperature range consists of a combination of both short- and long-range motions at low and intermediate loadings. This type of motion is characterized by an activation energy that decreases as the loading increases. At low loadings, we also observe short-range diffusive behavior based on a surface-mediated mechanism. The short-range behavior corresponds to motion only on the length scale of an FAU supercage, whereas the long-range behavior involves intercage diffusion. For the saturation loading corresponding to 96 methanol molecules per unit cell, only short-range motions within the same supercage predominate. Finally, the <b>preferential</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the adsorbate molecules around the extraframework cations are examined and compared with those previously deduced from experimental data...|$|E
