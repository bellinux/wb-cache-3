40|$|The U-factor for a {{fenestration}} product {{describes the}} rate of heat flow through the entire unit, not just the glass or <b>plastic</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>material.</b> The U-factor includes the heat flow effects of the glass, the frame, and the edge-of-glass conditions (there also may be spacers, sealants and other elements that affect heat conduction). For skylights mounted on a curb {{that is part of the}} roof construction, the total heat flow considered in determining the U-factor includes losses through the frame, glazing and other components, but not through the curb that is part of the roof construction. Standards Tables 143 -A, 143 -B, and 143 -C, lists skylight product that includes a curb, and the effects of this curb are included in the product U-factor rating. This curb included in the product rating is separate from the curb that is a part of the roof construction.

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Plastics</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> have properties which allow their widespread use in construction, for example as rootlights. However, they are more susceptible than is glass to degradation by weathering, notably the combined effects of ultraviolet light, heat and moisture. Examples of unacceptable durability have been seen in practice, particularly when high operating temperatures occur in sunlight. Artificial weathering tests are used to assess <b>plastics</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> in a reasonably short time, two main types being utilised in this study. The applicability of ultra-fast methods of accelerated degradation {{has been shown to}} depend {{on the extent to which}} the mechanisms of degradation simulate practical weathering, since different procedures were found to promote different mechanisms in the materials tested. Misleading information was obtained when the full spectrum of solar UV and much of the visible was not adequately reproduced in the accelerated tests. In particular an established grade of PVC-U performed unexpectedly poorly under fluorescent lamps. Procedures based on xenon arc sources were found to be the most generally applicable because they better reproduce the full solar spectrum range and, hence, the typical effects observed in plastics materials in practice. Several analytical techniques were used to characterise the virgin polymers and to assess the weathered materials. Two commercial grades of each polymer type (poly[vinylchloride], polycarbonate and poly[methylmethacrylate]) were studied, and measured changes explained in terms of initial polymer properties. Profiling of chemical (e. g. carbonyl index measured by photo-acoustic fourier transform infrared), physical (e. g. molecular weight, surface gloss/roughness), optical (e. g. colour, light transmission) and mechanical properties (e. g. impact resistance) as a function of exposure period and environmental conditions enabled degradation rates and mechanisms to be established for each material. In conducting these tests particular attention was given to the control and effects of sample temperature during weathering, and to the wavelength range of the light source used. Poly(vinylchloride) was affected much more by weathering at higher temperatures, and by exposure to short wavelength radiation, than was polycarbonate, with acrylic being the most durable overall. Practical applications of this work are through Standards committees primarily. in particular with plastics rootlights (B/ 542 / 8 and CEN/TCI 28 /SC 9) ...|$|R

50|$|Light {{transmission}} (for this article, the perceivable {{visible spectrum}} between 390 nm and 750 nm is considered) through glass is diminished either by light reflection or light absorption of the <b>glazing</b> <b>material.</b> The total light transferred through the <b>glazing</b> <b>material</b> (light transmission) {{is reduced by}} reflection and/or absorption. In art framing, light reflection causes glare, while light absorption also may cause the transmitted colors to be dulled or distorted.

The results of the simulations showed a handsome potential savings, over several standard glazing types, for selective transmitters of both the fixed and switchable variety. Fixed transmitters were also excellent performers,several configurations offering savings often only slightly lower than the highest savings attained in the switchable group. The switchable transmitter group contained glazings which produced the lowest annual loads. The primary reductions were made in cooling loads without dramatic increases in lighting loads, but heating savings, resulting primarily from <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> of high thermal resistance, proved to be significant in cold climates. by William A.

He designed several buildings, of which the best were the Howrah Station, gateway to Calcutta, situated in the twin city Howrah, district Howrah, West Bengal, India (1901; with a glowing exterior of brick and coloured tiles), and Debenham House in Holland Park (1905-8), completely faced with impervious <b>glazed</b> <b>materials,</b> even the roof-tiles.

40|$|Annealed {{glass is}} by far the most {{commonly}} used <b>glazing</b> <b>material</b> in building construction. The resistant properties of glazing panels to wind loading has been studied for a long time based on quasistatic modeling. More recently, the vulnerability of infrastructure and its protection against acts of terrorism has been receiving a great deal of attention, as pioneered by the work of Wu and Hao from within Australia, whereas vulnerability studies by Stewart were specific to glass facades in terrorism scenarios. Emphasis has been on modeling the blast induced pressure and impulses, as they are applied to the panels while the resistant properties of the <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> have been based on assumptions used currently in design. Research undertaken by the writers over the past two to three years have revealed scopes of possible improvements to the current models that have been used in defining the resistant properties of <b>glazing</b> <b>materials.</b> Models based on the well known Weibull distribution, although widely assumed in practice, have been found to be not fully consistent with evidence produced experimentally or by analytical simulations. The interaction of the principal stresses surrounding the crack tip and higher mode effects have also been found to have significant effects on the ultimate behavior of the panel. The accurate modeling of these phenomena is particularly important for large panels. This paper provides an update of the redevelopment of a realistic behavioral model for annealed glazing panels subject to impact action.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} temperature field inside a passenger's compartment of a Proton Wira saloon car using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The main goal is to investigate the effects of different glazing types applied onto {{the front and rear}} windscreens of the car on the distribution of air-temperature inside the passenger compartment in the steady-state conditions. The air-flow condition in the passenger's compartment is also investigated. Fluent CFD software was used to develop a three-dimensional symmetrical model of the passenger's compartment. Simplified representations of the driver and one rear passenger were incorporated into the CFD model of the passenger's compartment. Two types of glazing were considered namely clear insulated laminated tint (CIL) with a shading coefficient of 0. 78 and green insulated laminate tint (GIL) with a shading coefficient of 0. 5. Results of the CFD analysis were compared with those obtained when the windscreens are made up of clear glass having a shading coefficient of 0. 86. Results of the CFD analysis show that for a given <b>glazing</b> <b>material,</b> the temperature of the air around the driver is slightly lower than the air around the rear passenger. Also, the use of GIL <b>glazing</b> <b>material</b> on both the front and rear windscreens significantly reduces the air temperature inside the passenger's compartment of the car. This contributes to a better thermal comfort condition to the occupants. Swirling air flow condition occurs in the passenger compartment. The air-flow intensity and velocity are higher along the side wall of the passenger's compartment compared to that along the middle section of the compartment.
