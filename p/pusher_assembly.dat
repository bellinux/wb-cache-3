40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{sensitivity}} of cantilever parameters on load carrying capacity in nanomanipulation process is investigated for atomic force microscope (AFM) nanorobot. Due to limitations in real time control for nanomanufacturing process, predicting possibility of the manipulation process is desirable. Main limitation caused by cantilever's geometry. Considering the relationship between cantilever twist angle with its geometry, maximum allowable particle size and therefore load carrying capacity can be found. Finally the effect of variation of four geometrical parameters such as cantilever's length(L), width(W), thickness(T) and probe's height(H) on load carrying capacity is estimated and also simulated, in order to design and choose appropriate cantilever for accurate and successful <b>pushing</b> and <b>assembly</b> purposes...|$|R

50|$|The roller-locked recoil {{operation}} {{functions as}} follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in tracks on the bolt head, are pushed outwards into matching {{tracks in the}} barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the bolt in place against the breech. Upon firing, rearward force from the recoil of the cartridge ignition <b>pushes</b> the striker <b>assembly</b> back and allows the rollers to move inwards, back to their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly to recoil, extracting the spent cartridge and ejecting it down. The return spring then <b>pushes</b> the bolt <b>assembly</b> forwards again, <b>pushing</b> a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech, and the sequence repeats {{as long as the}} trigger is depressed. The MG 42 is only capable of fully automatic fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon's rate of fire. The usual training objective {{is to be able to}} fire a burst of no more than three rounds. The weapon features a recoil booster at the muzzle to increase rearwards force due to recoil, therefore improving functional reliability and rate of fire.|$|R

40|$|This Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) report {{deals with}} the {{development}} of nickel aluminide alloy for improved longer life heat-resistant fixture assemblies for batch and continuous pusher carburizing furnaces. The nickel aluminide development was compared in both coupon and component testing with the currently used Fe-Ni-Cr heat-resisting alloy known as HU. The specific goals of the CRADA were: (1) casting process development, (2) characterization and possible modification of the alloy composition to optimize its manufacturing ability and performance under typical furnace operating conditions, and (3) testing and evaluation of specimens and prototype fixtures. In support of the CRADA objectives, coupons of nickel aluminide and the HU alloy were installed in both batch and pusher furnaces. The coupons were taken from two silicon levels and contained welds made with two different filler compositions (IC- 221 LA and IC- 221 W). Both nickel-aluminide and HU coupons were removed from the batch and pusher carburizing furnace at time intervals ranging from one month to one year. The exposed coupons were cut and mounted for metallographic, hardness, and microprobe analysis. The results of the microstructural analysis have been transmitted to General Motors Corporation, Saginaw Division (Delphi Saginaw) through reports that were presented at periodic CRADA review meetings. Based on coupon testing and verification of the coupon results with the testing of trays, Delphi Saginaw moved forward with the use of six additional trays in a batch furnace and two <b>assemblies</b> in a <b>pusher</b> furnace. Fifty percent of the trays and fixtures are in the as-cast condition and the remaining trays and fixtures are in the preoxidized condition. The successful operating experience of two <b>assemblies</b> in the <b>pusher</b> furnace for nearly a year formed the basis for a production run of 63 more assemblies. The production run required melting of 94 heats weighing 500 lb. each. Twenty-six of the 94 heats were from virgin stock, and 68 were from the revert that used 50 % virgin and 50 % revert. Detailed chemical analysis of the 94 heats reflected that the nickel aluminide can be cast into heat-treat fixtures under production conditions. In addition to the chemical analysis, the castings showed excellent dimensional reproducibility. A total of six batch furnace trays and 65 <b>pusher</b> furnace <b>assemblies</b> of nickel aluminide alloy IC- 221 M are currently operating in production furnaces at Delphi Saginaw. Two of the <b>pusher</b> furnace <b>assemblies</b> have completed two years of service without any failure.

40|$|SummaryRemarkably, forces {{within a}} neuron can extend its axon to a target {{that could be}} meters away. The two main {{cytoskeleton}} components in neurons are microtubules, which are mostly bundled along the axon shaft, and actin filaments, which are highly enriched in a structure at the axon distal tip, the growth cone. Neurite extension has been thought {{to be driven by}} a combination of two forces: <b>pushing</b> via microtubule <b>assembly,</b> and/or pulling by an actin-driven mechanism in the growth cone [1, 2]. Here we show that a novel mechanism, sliding of microtubules against each other by the microtubule motor kinesin- 1, provides the mechanical forces necessary for initial neurite extension in Drosophila neurons. Neither actin filaments in the growth cone nor tubulin polymerization is required for initial outgrowth. Microtubule sliding in neurons is developmentally regulated and is suppressed during neuronal maturation. As kinesin- 1 is highly evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to humans, it is likely that kinesin- 1 -powered microtubule sliding {{plays an important role in}} neurite extension in many types of neurons across species...|$|R
5000|$|The {{blowback}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as [...] "simple", [...] "straight" [...] or [...] "pure" [...] blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type. In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against {{the rear of the}} barrel, but is not locked in place. At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel {{while at the same time}} pushing the case rearward against the bolt. The expanding gases <b>push</b> the bolt <b>assembly</b> to the rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and the force required to compress the action spring. The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber. The empty case is ejected as the bolt travels to the rear. The stored energy of the compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon fires from an open bolt). A new cartridge is stripped from the magazine and chambered as the bolt returns to its in-battery position.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication {{of a complete}} thermocouple assembly. Elements of construction and installation are discussed under the headings thermocouple current, fabrication, switch box fabrication, field installation of the cable and temperature readings. The principle of measurement is that the emf generated between a reference junction of known temperature and one of unknown temperature can give the unknown temperature. The two metals used are copper and constantan, and the wires must be protected electrically from short circuits. Twenty gauge duplex wire individually encased in polyvinyl chloride is satisfactory. The wires from the installation are usually terminated in a weatherproof switch box. Leeds and Northrup rotary switches, type 31 - 3 are used. Simple clamp type connectors and terminal blocks ensure positive connection. The copper wires are attached to rotary switches. The constantan wires are attached to a common constantan wire. The thermocouple cable's outer jacket is cut at the depths at which readings are required and the copper and constantan wires are soldered to give a thermocouple junction. The completed multi-wire cable is inserted in a suitable length of polyethylene hose. A lucite or brass plug seals the lower end. Steel switch boxes house the switches and wire connection from the elements and still provide accessibility for readings. The cable and switch box are filled with high quality transformer oil. Installation involves <b>pushing</b> the <b>assembly</b> into a bore hole {{or in the case}} of short cables, a test pit.

The one-way heel clutch acted between the heel assembly and the interface component, allowing the heel to rotate freely in plantar-flexion (compressing the spring) but locking when forced {{in the opposite direction}} (unless released by motor actuation). The toe latch acted between the toe assembly and the interface component, and prevented the toe assembly from rotating in plantar-flexion unless unlatched. During preload (about 25 - 40 % stride), the torque acting on the toe assembly increased as the center of pressure advanced forward and ground reaction forces increased, eventually overcoming the torque of the primary compression spring and <b>pushing</b> the toe <b>assembly</b> against a limit stop. This relieved the toe latch of load, so that a motor could move it to effectively release the toe assembly. During push-off, the primary compression spring was then allowed to force the toe assembly through plantar-flexion, returning stored energy.

The fundamental function of engines has not changed since there first introduction. By combusting fuel within the chamber causes a pressure build from the expanding gasses <b>pushing</b> the piston <b>assembly</b> through the cylinder, this linear action is then translated to rotation through the crankshaft to generate work. During combustion the gasses will try to move past the piston and into the crankcase, to deter this from occurring piston rings are introduced. Thus rings {{are designed to be}} in tight contact to the cylinder wall, and is subject to friction and wear as it travels up and down the cylinder wall. When a new ring pack is introduced, a running-in process is required. This involves running the engine at a variation of speeds for set times, typically defined by the manufacturer. While this procedure is executed the compression ring will undergo a series of thermodynamic morphological stages, the material will change shape due to the heat from the combustion process and suffer material loss due to the friction wear between cylinder wall and ring face. This thesis examines the impact of the running-in method on the compression ring and its performance.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the four major political reforms undertaken in Kuwait post- liberation: {{the restoration of the}} National Assembly in 1992, the separation of posts of the Crown Prince from the post of the Prime Minister in 2003, women’s suffrage in 2005 and the redefining of the electoral districts in 2006. These were analysed to establish whether these political reforms represented a process of democratisation or political liberalisation that ultimately consolidated the power of liberalised autocracy and was merely a regime survival strategy. To do that the study employed a theoretical framework that considers Robert Dahl’s (1971) criteria: political participation, contestation and expansion of civil and political rights to assess whether Kuwait’s political system is democratic or not, in conjunction with David Potter’s scheme (1997) of the six pre-requisites that can promote and/or inhibit the process of democratisation: relation of state and political institutions, societal divisions, economic development, civil society, political culture and transnational/international engagement in order to identify the drivers and/or the obstacles to a democratic transition. This analysis contributes to the wider discussions on democratisation processes, furthering the understanding of the necessary conditions for democratisation, as well as what the nature of the obstacles to reform are in the Gulf region. The study concluded that the political reforms were not evidence of democratisation; rather they were part of Al Sabah’s own survival strategy and are better understood in terms of a liberalising autocracy.
