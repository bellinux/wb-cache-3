The <b>phone</b> set and speech representation for a recognizer are optimized for a particular task. This paper studies the effect of <b>phone</b> sets and speech representations for TIMIT <b>phone</b> recognition task. Two <b>phone</b> sets (TIMIT original <b>phone</b> set and 39 classical <b>phone</b> set) and two speech representations (MFCC-based and PLP-based) are tested. The <b>phone</b> recognizers for each <b>phone</b> set and speech representation are experimented and analyzed on both TIMIT training and testing sets. The {{results show that the}} 39 classical <b>phone</b> set with PLP speech representation <b>phone</b> recognizer yields highest <b>phone</b> accuracy. However, this best <b>phone</b> set works well only on a particular <b>phone</b> subset while the other recognizers work better on the other subsets. Therefore, the combination of several <b>phone</b> recognizers indicates higher <b>phone</b> accuracy than any single <b>phone</b> recognizer...|$|R

The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing <b>phones</b> with larger displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models with larger, 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that has been incorporated into many Android <b>phones,</b> but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.|$|E
