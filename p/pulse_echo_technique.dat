50|$|Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898-1986) was an {{acoustical}} physicist, who in 1940 while {{a professor}} at the University of Michigan invented the first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> <b>technique</b> for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “a device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”.|$|E

40|$|Integrated polar {{backscatter}} {{has been}} shown to have potential applications to composites, especially for the detection of matrix cracking, delaminations, fiber waviness, fiber fracture, inclusions and porosity [1 – 11]. The method was attractive because it avoided several measurement limitations inherent to conventional <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> <b>techniques.</b> Polar backscatter, however, has not been without its disadvantages. It has been reported that surface texture introduces unwanted artifacts in images made using the polar backscatter method [12]. One suggested method to overcome this limitation was the use of stripable coatings, which are paints that approximately match the impedance of the composite surface and have the effect of physically “smoothing” the surface impressions away [13]. After ultrasonic testing, these paints can be removed, but this method entails additional part handling and increases the cost of production...|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} discharge die-sinking {{is widely used}} {{in order to make}} a mold and so on. In the {{electric discharge}} die-sinking, an electric discharge occurs between an electrode and a workpiece. When a lot of debris exists at the discharge gap, the electric discharge becomes abnormal. Therefore, in this study, a detection method of the electric discharge die-sinking state by using an ultrasonic technique has been examined in order to prevent the abnormal discharge. In this study, the following results have been obtained. (1) The discharge gap can be measured by using the <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> <b>technique</b> during the electric discharge die-sinking. When the abnormal electrical discharge occurs, the gap becomes large. (2) The abnormal discharge can be detected by the variation of the received elastic waves which are generated at a discharged point and transmitted through the workpiece.

Conventional and innovative ultrasonic techniques were applied to the flaw size measurement problem. Advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Flaw size data obtained ultrasonically were compared to radiographic data and to real flaw sizes determined by destructive measurements. Considerable success was achieved with <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> <b>techniques</b> and with 'pitch and catch' techniques. The radiographic work described demonstrates that careful selection of film exposure parameters for a particular application must be made to obtain optimized flaw detectability.

40|$|Many {{standard}} {{non destructive}} testing systems utilize ultrasonic <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> <b>techniques</b> to localize defects within structures. These techniques rely upon the scattering of acoustic energy by the defect and two or more acoustic detectors for localization. In this paper, an alternate method of structural damage detection and location is proposed. The technique {{involves the use of}} a leaky acoustic waveguide and a unidirectional acoustic waveguide attached to the structure of interest. Only one acoustic detector is required for defect location. An analysis of the concept is provided and experimental results are presented. Much of the work in the smart structures area involves the use of structural health monitoring to provide inputs for active structural health maintenance in adaptive structures. A large body of work has accumulated over the years on various methods of defect detection and location. The vast majority of these nondestmctive testing (NDT) techniques have involved the coupling of acoustic energy into structures and observing the characteristic response of the structure to this energy.

After passing one pressure cycle the as-prepared bulk samples show one-way effect which is characterised by an open hysteresis loop of the elastic constant. Distinct differences of the temperature variation of the elastic constants were also observed for the slowly and rapidly cooled samples after heating to 1000 °C. Thermal and mechanical treatment widens the hysteresis and leads to the observation of a second transformation which is attributed to the transition to the R-phase. ...|$|R

Three sizes of microballoons ranging from 30 - 65 microns were tested. Measurements of longitudinal and shear wave speed and attenuation of ultrasonic wave in syntactic foams were taken. These wave speed values were further utilized to calculate the various moduli of the material. After understanding the behavior of syntactic foams for low volume fractions, functionally graded materials (FGM) with linear variation of increasing volume fraction were manufactured and studied. Further quasi-static compression and low velocity impacts were also performed {{to better understand the}} static and absorption behavior of both syntactic foams and FGM materials. ^ It was found that larger microballoon size had higher attenuation values but not necessarily higher wave speeds in syntactic foams. Matrix absorption was the main attenuation parameter. Ultrasonic tests on FGMs suggest higher degree of interaction due to the impedance mismatch between each layer. Lower volume fractions had higher compressive strength than higher volume fractions. This knowledge is important in understanding the bond strength between the particulates and the epoxy matrix.
