5|$|Wild tigers {{that have}} had no prior contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, {{by the time she was}} shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> outdoors and are not keeping watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{study found}} a {{pronounced}} relationship between economic inequality and life expectancy. However, {{a study by}} José A.

The authors suggest that when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> extra hard during good economic times, they undergo more stress, exposure to pollution, and likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.|$|E
25|$|Following the oil spill, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh {{declared}} two {{islands and}} parts of the Sunshine coast as disaster areas. Cleanup efforts were reportedly going to cost at least $100,000 a day and last more than a week as the oil continued to spread. The company in charge of the cargo ship is faced with a possible $1.5million in fines for the incident. Several search parties have been sent to the spill area to attempt to find the potentially explosive materials that were in the 31 containers. Press reports stated that if the ammonium nitrate were to mix with the heavy fuel, it could ignite the ammonium nitrate and cause a large explosion. If the chemical did not react with the fuel, but still leaked out, marine life could be threatened by large blooms in algae. A team of 88 people were sent out to begin the cleanup process and another 58 were expected to join within the following days. On Moreton Island, a total of 290 <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> to clean up the oil with most of them focusing on Middle Creek and Cape Moreton. Even though hundreds of people were working on cleaning the spill, the average amount cleaned each day was 1km2 (0.6mi2). It was not until May of that year that Moreton Island was finally cleared of oil. The cleanup effort was undertaken by 2,500 people and led to the removal of roughly 3,000 tonnes of contaminated sand.|$|E

500|$|Fagerbakke {{referred}} to Patrick as [...] "AquaDauber" [...] (a {{reference to his}} role as Michael [...] "Dauber" [...] Dybinski on the 1990s sitcom Coach) {{in the first few}} years of working on the show. Patrick is [...] "enormously entertaining to portray" [...] because, according to Fagerbakke, [...] "when I'm performing Patrick, there are many secrets that I could never divulge". Fagerbakke's approach in voicing Patrick is [...] "much the same way I would do [...] any kind of character." [...] "I'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children. To be able to plug in to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas, I have so much fun with that. I love kids; I raised two girls and I love being a parent," [...] he said. The cast members record as a whole cast. Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because [...] "there is something remarkable that happens when <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> together that is unique to that." [...] Fagerbakke modeled his performance whenever Patrick is angry after that of American actress Shelley Winters.|$|E
500|$|The game's design {{came from}} Iwata, {{who was able}} to {{transport}} his original ideas directly into the game as far as the NES' graphical capabilities could be taken at that time. He said: [...] "the goal was really to try to pull off the best graphics on the NES to date. Simple graphics were more or less the standard on the NES at the time but I had this firm belief {{that it was possible to}} do something better, something prettier. I feel like we pulled it off and were able to show people what could be done [...] It left an impression around the office, and from what I've heard [...] influenced the work of other games that were later made by other NES developers as well." [...] The game's music and sound were designed in cooperation between Sunsoft's staff and an outside composer, Naoki Kodaka, who had previously worked on scores for many of the company's other titles. Iwata credited him for giving the company a good reputation for video game music in the late 1980s and lamented that [...] "none of those <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> together anymore since they've all separated from Sunsoft [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club called the episode {{one of the}} [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] of the series and cited it {{as an example of}} the series' subtle shift [...] "from a collection of monster tales to something more akin to an attempt to explain the dark underbelly of America’s obsession with pulp narratives." [...] He ultimately concluded that [...] "Field Trip" [...] showed [...] "how the series would never be as good as its best seasons again, but could still be remarkably effective." [...] In a subsequent review, VanDerWerff awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes of The X-Files sixth season" [...] due to its analysis of what Mulder and Scully each desire from the world, and the fact that the episode argues that the [...] "mysteries can only be solved if both of these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> to solve them." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two positively compared the episode to the episode [...] "Bad Blood", noting that the episode [...] " [...] a retread of those 'Bad Blood' themes". Furthermore, however, Shearman and Pearson noted that, [...] " [...] not merely poking fun at the conventions of the long running sci-fi show, but inviting its audience to question the truths around us we take for granted".|$|E

60|$|This episode {{may be said}} to have {{concluded}} the first act of the commercial drama in which Mike and Psmith had been cast for leading parts. And, as usually happens after the end of an act, there was a lull for a while until things began to work up towards another climax. Mike, as day succeeded day, began to grow accustomed {{to the life of the}} bank, and to find that it had its pleasant side after all. Whenever a number of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> at the same thing, even though that thing is not perhaps what they would have chosen as an object in life, if left to themselves, there is bound to exist an atmosphere of good-fellowship; something akin to, though a hundred times weaker than, the public school spirit. Such a community lacks the main motive of the public school spirit, which is pride in the school and its achievements. Nobody can be proud of the achievements of a bank. When the business of arranging a new Japanese loan was given to the New Asiatic Bank, its employees did not stand on stools, and cheer. On the contrary, they thought of the extra work it would involve; and they cursed a good deal, though there was no denying that it was a big thing for the bank--not unlike winning the Ashburton would be to a school. There is a cold impersonality about a bank. A school is a living thing.|$|E
