5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E

25|$|By May 1951, the CCP Central Committee {{had issued}} a {{directive}} {{calling for a}} stop to the killings, giving the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and execution back to the central government. Furthermore, it clarified the procedures of dealing with accused counterrevolutionaries, as well as limiting the execution of death penalties to those with 'blood debts' or to have 'committed serious crimes'. Others who had received death penalties would have their sentences commuted by two years of manual labor, with their performance assessed as {{to determine whether the}} sentence would still be necessary. Despite the directive, while mass arrests and executions subsided in some regions, they still continued, albeit with much more secrecy.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, the City of St. Anthony and Town of Minneapolis {{were first}} {{adequately}} served by an appointed city marshal based out of St. Anthony who was assisted by constables. Vested with the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> they rarely used it. Criminals sentenced {{would be sent}} to Ramsey County Jail or the Stillwater Penitentiary until the Hennepin County Courthouse and Jail was built in 1857. When the two cities merged and incorporated as Minneapolis in 1867, Mayor Dorilus Morrison immediately appointed H. H. Brackett as the first police chief. With six patrolmen, the new Police Department of Minneapolis served a population of about 5,000 people. In 1884, the force numbered 100 men and Shingle Creek workhouse was completed.|$|E
25|$|A police {{employee}} {{becomes a}} constable by swearing the oath under s 22 of the New Zealand Policing Act 2008. Upon doing so the constable receives certain statutory powers and responsibilities, including the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest.</b> While constables {{make up the}} majority of the workforce, non-sworn staff and volunteers provide a wide range of support services where a constable's statutory powers are not required. Rank insignia are worn on epaulettes. Officers of Inspector rank and higher are commissioned by the Governor-General, but are still promoted from the ranks of non-commissioned officers. A recently graduated constable is considered a Probationary Constable for up to two years, until he or she has passed ten workplace assessment standards. The completion of the above is known as obtaining permanent appointment.|$|E

25|$|Meehan {{returned}} to Northern Ireland, {{where he was}} arrested on 9 August 1972. He was charged with escaping from lawful custody, and at his trial successfully argued that under the Special Powers Act a British soldier had no <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and as such he had {{the legal right to}} escape. He was awarded Â£800 in compensation for being illegally detained for twenty-three days, and the government were forced to amend the Special Powers Act to legalise the detention of others held under the Act. He was charged with membership of the Provisional IRA, and received a three-year sentence when he became the first person to be convicted of the offence. He was imprisoned in Long Kesh, and was released on 4 October 1974. After his release he was immediately interned without trial, and on 5 December 1975 he was the last internee to be released after internment had been abolished.|$|E
25|$|Sheriffs in Kentucky {{are elected}} for {{four-year}} terms {{and are not}} term limited. Kentucky sheriffs are not the chief law enforcement officials of their respective counties. That title is reserved for the Coroner. Sheriffs and deputies in Kentucky {{have the authority to}} patrol as well as <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> in all areas of their particular county, including incorporated cities. Most sheriffs, however, choose to patrol incorporated cities either only on the request of city officials {{or in the case of}} a major emergency. Sheriff's deputies will jointly patrol unincorporated areas of their county with the Kentucky State Police. In addition, sheriffs in Kentucky are responsible for court security, serving court papers and transporting prisoners. They are also responsible for collecting taxes on real estate and tangible property. Also, Kentucky law states that only the county coroner, also an elected peace officer, can serve the sitting sheriff with a state criminal court process or place him/her under arrest (any peace officer, however, can arrest the coroner).|$|E
