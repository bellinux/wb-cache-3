All measurements reveal a high H 2 O mixing ratio of about 7 ppmv above 24 km, thus differing {{significantly from the}} 5 ppmv that are commonly assumed for the calculation of polar stratospheric cloud existence temperatures. The profiles obtained on 12 December 2002 and on 17 January 2003 provide an insight into the vertical distribution of water vapour {{in the core of}} the polar vortex. Unlike the earlier profiles, the water vapour sounding on 11 February 2003 detected the vortex edge region in {{the lower part of the}} stratosphere. Here, a striking diminuition in H 2 O mixing ratio stands out between 16 and 19 km. The according stratospheric temperatures clarify that this dehydration can not be caused by the presence of polar stratospheric clouds or earlier PSC particle sedimentation. On the same day, ozone observations by lidar indicate a large scale movement of the polar vortex, while an ozone sonde measurement even shows laminae in the same altitude range as in the water vapour <b>profile.</b> <b>Tracer</b> lamination in the vortex edge region is caused by filamentation of the vortex. The link between the observed water vapour diminuition and filaments in the vortex edge region is highlighted by results of the MIMOSA contour advection model. In the altitude of interest, adjoined filaments of polar and mid-latitudinal air can be identified above the Spitsbergen region. A vertical cross-section reveals that the water vapour sonde has flown through polar air in the lowest part of the stratosphere. Where the low water vapour mixing ratio was detected, the balloon passed through air from a mid-latitudinal filament from about 425 to 445 K, before it finally entered the polar vortex above 450 K. The MIMOSA model results elucidate the correlation that on 11 February 2003 the frost point hygrometer measured strongly variable water vapour concentrations as the sonde detected air with different origins, respectively. Instead of being linked to dehydration due to PSC particle sedimentation, the local diminuition in the stratospheric water vapour profile of 11 February 2003 has been found to be caused by dynamical processes in the polar stratosphere...|$|E

The diffusion anisotropy of sedimentary rocks has been evaluated mainly from laboratory diffusion experiments, in which the directional diffusivities are separately estimated by through-diffusion experiments using different rock samples, or concurrently by in-diffusion experiments in which only the <b>tracer</b> <b>profile</b> in a rock block is measured. To estimate the diffusion anisotropy from a single rock sample, this study proposes an axisymmetric diffusion test, in which tracer diffuses between a cylindrical rock sample and a surrounding solution reservoir. The tracer diffusion between the sample and reservoir can be monitored from the reservoir tracer concentrations, and the <b>tracer</b> <b>profile</b> could also be obtained after dismantling the sample. Semi-analytical solutions are derived for tracer concentrations in both the reservoir and sample, accounting for an anisotropic diffusion tensor of rank two {{as well as the}} dilution effects from sampling and replacement of reservoir solution.

The analysis reveals the difficulty in estimating diffusion anisotropy; test configurations are proposed for enhanced identifiability of diffusion anisotropy. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the axisymmetric diffusion test is efficient in obtaining the sorption parameter from both steady-state and transient data, and in determining the effective diffusion coefficient if isotropic diffusion is assumed. Moreover, measuring reservoir concentrations in an axisymmetric diffusion experiment coupled with <b>tracer</b> <b>profiling</b> may be a promising approach to estimate of diffusion anisotropy of sedimentary rocks...|$|R

Using a simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, we determine the data-quality required to detect the dark matter density at its expected local value. We introduce a new method for recovering rho_dm that uses moments of the Jeans equations, combined with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique to marginalise over the unknown parameters. Given sufficiently good data, we show that our method can recover the correct local dark matter density {{even in the face}} of disc inhomogeneities, non-isothermal tracers and a non-separable distribution function. We illustrate the power of our technique by applying it to Hipparcos data [Holmberg & Flynn 2000, 2004]. We first make the assumption that the A and F star tracer populations are isothermal. This recovers rho_dm= 0. 003 ^{+ 0. 009 }_{- 0. 007 }Msun/pc^ 3 (with 90 per cent confidence), consistent with previous determinations.

The developments are displayed {{as an extension of}} conventional chloride mass balance (CMB) techniques to account for transient as well as space-dependent water fluxes. The conventional chloride mass balance has been used over two decades to estimate recharge over large time scales in arid environments. In this mass balance approach, the chloride concentration in the pore water, originating from atmospheric fallout, is inversely proportional to the flux of water through the sediments. The CMB method is especially applicable to arid and semi-arid regions where evapotranspirative enrichment of the pore water produces a distinct chloride profile in the unsaturated zone. The solutions presented allow incorporation of transient fluxes and boundary conditions in CMB analysis, and allow analysis of <b>tracer</b> <b>profile</b> data which is not constant with depth below extraction zone in terms of a rational water transport model. A closed-form inverse solution is derived which shows uniqueness of model parameter and boundary condition (including paleoprecipitation) estimation, for the specified flow model.

Test cases of single rising bubble and a bubbling fluidized bed operated with a jet without a chemical reaction were studied in order to obtain fundamental insights in the prevailing mass transfer phenomena. Numerical simulations were carried out to predict the dispersion of tracer gas using a two-fluid model based on Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow (KTGF). The simulations of a single-bubble rising through an incipiently fluidized bed revealed that the assumptions often made in phenomenological models in the derivation of correlations for the mass transfer coefficient, mainly that the bubble diameter remains constant and that the tracer concentration is uniform in the bubble, are not valid. The predicted bubble-to-emulsion phase mass transfer coefficient showed good agreement with the estimated values from the literature correlations assuming additive convection-diffusion transport for different bubble sizes and different particle sizes, indicating the importance of the convective distribution even for relatively small particles. Experiments were carried out to measure the steady state concentration <b>profiles</b> of a <b>tracer</b> gas in a pseudo two-dimensional bubbling fluidized bed operated with a jet.

The tested models range from the regional to the global scale, and include numerical weather prediction (NWP), chemical transport, and chemistry-climate models. Idealised tracers were used in order to prevent the model's chemistry schemes from influencing the results substantially, so that the effects of modelled transport could be isolated. We find large differences in the vertical transport of very short-lived tracers (with a lifetime of 6 h) within the tropical troposphere. Peak convective outflow altitudes range from around 300 hPa to almost 100 hPa among the different models, and the upper tropospheric tracer mixing ratios differ by up to an order of magnitude. The timing of convective events is found to be different between the models, even among those which source their forcing data from the same NWP model (ECMWF). The differences are less pronounced for longer lived tracers, however they could have implications for modelling the halogen burden of the lowermost stratosphere through transport of species such as bromoform, or short-lived hydrocarbons into the lowermost stratosphere. The modelled <b>tracer</b> <b>profiles</b> are strongly influenced by the convective transport parameterisations, and different boundary layer mixing parameterisations also have a large impact on the modelled <b>tracer</b> <b>profiles.</b> Preferential locations for rapid transport from the surface into the upper troposphere are similar in all models, and are mostly concentrated over the western Pacific, the Maritime Continent and the Indian Ocean.

The DRax,LR values ranged from 110 to 200 cm P 2 P/s. There was evidence that the existing literature data on DRax,LR in bubble columns are slightly underestimated, as consistent underestimation {{was found to be}} a characteristic of the widely used dispersion model that disregards radial dispersion. The value of the radial dispersion coefficient was typically about 1 to 2 % of the DRax,LR value under any given condition. The mixing time data were generally consistent with the existing literature...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} {{is an interesting}} technique to determine kinetic parameters of separate components, and also of a complete system to receive adequate information on the ageing process of pyrotechnic compositions. The investigated tracer is a tracking tracer of a Swiss missile. It {{is attached to a}} missile and produces during burning a red flame. The missile system is already in use for 15 years. Periodic inspections of the system take place every three years. These inspections, however only give information on the actual state of the tracer and not on the future state. The aim of this investigation is to predict the ageing behaviour of the tracer system to give additional information about the future use of the missile system. After two ageing <b>profiles</b> the <b>tracer</b> systems were tested on the test range at Armasuisse in Thun. The results of the testing show that an ageing period of 4 weeks at 60 °C gives no changes in performance (light output and burning time). On the other side also a quite heavy ageing period of 4 weeks at 150 °C was applied on tracer systems, which gives a dramatically change in burning time. The light output was even higher after this ageing profile, although the intensity changes a lot. © 2005 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest...|$|R

The tropical transport processes of 14 different models or model versions were compared, {{within the framework of the}} SCOUT-O 3 (Stratospheric-Climate Links with Emphasis on the Upper Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere) project. The tested models range from the regional to the global scale, and include numerical weather prediction (NWP), chemical transport, and chemistry-climate models. Idealised tracers were used in order to prevent the model's chemistry schemes from influencing the results substantially, so that the effects of modelled transport could be isolated. We find large differences in the vertical transport of very short-lived tracers (with a lifetime of 6 h) within the tropical troposphere. Peak convective outflow altitudes range from around 300 hPa to almost 100 hPa among the different models, and the upper tropospheric tracer mixing ratios differ by up to an order of magnitude. The timing of convective events is found to be different between the models, even among those which source their forcing data from the same NWP model (ECMWF). The differences are less pronounced for longer lived tracers, however they could have implications for modelling the halogen burden of the lowermost stratosphere through transport of species such as bromoform, or short-lived hydrocarbons into the lowermost stratosphere. The modelled <b>tracer</b> <b>profiles</b> are strongly influenced by the convective transport parameterisations, and different boundary layer mixing parameterisations also have a large impact on the modelled <b>tracer</b> <b>profiles.</b> Preferential locations for rapid transport from the surface into the upper troposphere are similar in all models, and are mostly concentrated over the western Pacific, the Maritime Continent and the Indian Ocean. In contrast, models do not indicate that upward transport is highest over western Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} of biogenic sediment mixing is often {{expressed as a}} &#x 201 c;biodiffusion coefficient&#x 201 d; (D b), quantified by fitting a diffusive model of bioturbation to vertical profiles of particle-bound radioisotopes. The biodiffusion coefficient often exhibits a dependence on tracer half-life: short-lived radioisotopes (e. g. 234 Th) tend to yield notably larger D b values than longer-lived radioisotopes (e. g. 210 Pb). It has been hypothesized {{that this is a}} result of differential mixing of tracers by particle-selective benthos. This study employs a lattice-automaton model of bioturbation to explore how steady-state tracers with different half-lives are mixed in typical marine settings. Every particle in the model is tagged with the same array of radioisotopes, so that all tracers experienced exactly the same degree of mixing. Two different estimates of the mixing intensity are calculated: a tracer-derived D b, obtained in the standard way by fitting the biodiffusion model to resulting <b>tracer</b> <b>profiles,</b> and a particle-tracking D b, derived from the statistics of particle movements. The latter provides a tracer-independent measure of mixing for use as a reference. Our simulations demonstrate that an apparent D b tracer-dependence results from violating the underlying assumptions of the biodiffusion model. Breakdown of the model is rarely apparent from <b>tracer</b> <b>profiles,</b> emphasizing the need to evaluate the model&#x 2019;s criteria from biological and ecological parameters, rather than relying on obvious indications of model breakdown, e. g., subsurface maxima. Simulations of various marine environments (coastal, slope, abyssal) suggest that the time scales of short-lived radioisotopes, such as 234 Th and 7 Be, are insufficient for the tracers to be used with the biodiffusion model. 210 Pb appears an appropriate tracer for abyssal sediments, while 210 Pb and 228 Th are suitable for slope and coastal sediments...|$|R
