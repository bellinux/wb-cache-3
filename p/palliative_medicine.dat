These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the patient directly. The physician subspecialty of Hospice and <b>Palliative</b> <b>Medicine</b> was established in 2006, to provide expertise {{in the care of}} patients with life-limiting, advanced disease and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary patient and family-centered care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end-of-life care.|$|E

40|$|Aim or goal of work: Frontline {{support staff}} working in General Practice (GP) (i. e. receptionists), Community Pharmacies (CP) and Care Homes {{are likely to}} face issues {{concerning}} <b>palliative</b> care <b>medicines</b> amongst their patient group. Previous service evaluations by the authors found a need for sustainable and accessible palliative care training for these staff. A national online training resource on <b>palliative</b> <b>medicines</b> for health and social care staff was subsequently developed and is currently being evaluated. Design, methods & approach taken: Various education and training materials for these staff groups were consolidated and re-developed into one interactive course, comprised of Core sessions for all staff (e. g. Introduction to Palliative Care) and discipline specific sessions i. e. Pharmacy (e. g. Dispensing Opioids) and Care Home (e. g. <b>Palliative</b> <b>Medicines</b> & Risk of Falls) staff. User feedback was obtained via a questionnaire measuring satisfaction, usefulness and impact. Results: All 50 participants (11 staff from GP Practices, Community Pharmacies (n= 9) and Care Homes (n= 30)) agreed that the training was useful and with the correct degree of difficulty. Participants liked the delivery format and felt the training was “informative” and “easy to access”. Staff also reported that managers were supportive of them undertaking the training. The training provided a good introduction and, for some, a refresher to palliative care. Some participants provided real-life examples of how the training had been beneficial to (and applied by) them in the workplace. Conclusions and lessons learned: This new training resource provides education in an engaging, accessible format to frontline health and social care multi-disciplinary teams. It will be available nationally from November 2016 to support the provision of palliative care by frontline staff {{at the point of}} need...|$|R

500|$|Fourth series [...] (2011), an American co-production, re-establishes Gwen, Rhys {{and their}} {{daughter}} Anwen living reclusively in rural Wales. CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer) renditions Gwen to the United States, believing a worldwide phenomenon wherein no one can die {{to be connected to}} Torchwood and she becomes part of a new Torchwood team alongside Jack, Rex and former CIA analyst Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins). In [...] "The Categories of Life" [...] and [...] "The Middle Men" [...] Gwen returns to Wales to rescue her ailing father Geraint (William Thomas), who survived a fatal heart attack on [...] "Miracle Day", from a facility where the critically injured are incinerated. Upon her return to America her family are kidnapped as leverage to make her surrender Jack. Gwen tells Jack, now ostensibly mortal, that she would allow him to be killed to save Anwen. After Gwen is deported by senior CIA official Allen Shapiro (John De Lancie) because of her dissidence she focusses on protecting her father from the authorities; enclosing him in her mother Mary's (Sharon Morgan) cellar and supplying him with <b>palliative</b> <b>medicine.</b> [...] The concluding episode, [...] "The Blood Line" [...] opens with Gwen eulogising her father as the kindest man she has ever known, before stating that she is about to kill him. When the power and profit driven conspirators behind Miracle Day try to thwart her resolve by wounding Esther, Gwen declares she will sacrifice her entire Torchwood team to restore order. She shoots Jack through the heart, allowing his unique blood to prompt an ancient phenomenon to reset the human morphic field. As Geraint and other [...] "Miracle Day" [...] survivors pass away peacefully, Jack's immortality is restored. Gwen is shocked to discover at Esther's funeral that Rex is now immortal too.|$|E
2500|$|A 2009 study {{published}} in Journal of Pain and Symptom Management studied {{the impact of the}} pathway on the end-of-life care of over three hundred patients and found that it produced a large decrease in the use of medication that might shorten life and increased patients' involvement in their medication and care.

60|$|I {{received}} this note within {{half an hour}} after it was written, and in fifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber. I had not seen him for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes were utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was excessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless, in a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and {{a certain degree of}} physical strength. He spoke with distinctness--took some <b>palliative</b> <b>medicines</b> without aid--and, when I entered the room, was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by pillows. Doctors D---- and F---- were in attendance.|$|R

2500|$|In 2009 The Daily Telegraph {{wrote that}} the pathway has been blamed by some doctors for hastening the death of some mortally ill patients, and {{possibly}} masking signs that the patient is improving.

In contrast, The Times welcomed the pathway {{as an attempt to}} address patients' wishes and warned about [...] "alarmist" [...] press coverage of the scheme.

2500|$|In 1984, Dr. Josefina Magno, who {{had been}} {{instrumental}} in forming the American Academy of Hospice and <b>Palliative</b> <b>Medicine</b> and sat as first {{executive director of the}} US National Hospice Organization, founded the International Hospice Institute, which in 1996 became the International Hospice Institute and College and later the International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC). The IAHPC, with a board of directors as of 2008 from such diverse countries as Scotland, Argentina, China and Uganda, works from the philosophy that each country should develop a palliative care model based on its own resources and conditions, evaluating hospice experiences in other countries but adapting to their own needs. Dr. Derek Doyle, who was a founding member of IAHPC, told the British Medical Journal in 2003 that through her work the Philippine-born Magno had seen [...] "more than 8000 hospice and palliative services established in more than 100 countries."

40|$|The {{management}} of ‘death rattle' was reviewed by a task group {{on behalf of}} the Association for <b>Palliative</b> <b>Medicine's</b> Science Committee. Evidence was searched for the effectiveness of various anti-muscarinic drugs in drying oropharyngeal and bronchial secretions in dying patients. Clinical guidelines were constructed based on evidence from volunteer and clinical studies. Death rattle occurs in half of all dying patients and some response occurs in around 80 % of treated patients. Clinical studies demonstrate that subcutaneous hyoscine hydrobromide 400 mg is more effective at improving symptoms at 30 min than glycopyrronium 200 mg by the same route. Volunteer studies demonstrate that intramuscular glycopyrronium 400 mg is as effective in drying secretions at 30 min as a dose of 200 mg given intravenously. Duration of response is shortest for hyoscine butylbromide (1 h) and longest for glycopyrronium (more than 6 h). There is insufficient evidence to support the use of one drug over another in a continuous infusion and prescribers should base decisions on different characteristics of each anti-muscarinic drug...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{critical}} {{need to expand}} and develop the palliative care evidence base was recently highlighted by the Journal of <b>Palliative</b> <b>Medicine's</b> series of articles describing the Research Priorities in Geriatric Palliative Care. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is uniquely positioned to address many priority areas of palliative care research. This nationally representative, ongoing, longitudinal study collects detailed survey data every 2 years, including demographics, health and functional characteristics, information on family and caregivers, and personal finances, and also conducts a proxy interview after each subject's death. The HRS can also be linked with Medicare claims data and many other data sources, e. g., U. S. Census, Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. Setting: While the HRS offers innumerable research opportunities, these data are complex and limitations do exist. Therefore, we assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators using the HRS for palliative care research to identify the key palliative care research gaps that may be amenable to study within the HRS and {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the HRS for each of these topic areas. Conclusion: In this article we present the work of this group as a potential roadmap for investigators contemplating the use of HRS data for palliative care research. © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014...|$|R

30|$|On {{a higher}} level, {{it was hoped}} that {{inclusion}} would also be reflected in efforts by the wider humanitarian community to advocate on issues such as access to essential <b>palliative</b> <b>medicines</b> especially opiates and the international and national regulatory and policy issues that arise. According to the World Health Organization, “only about 14 % of people who need palliative care currently receive it” (WHO 2018). Despite global statements that palliative care is a human right (International Children’s Palliative Care Network 2008, WHO 2018) and a core component of universal health coverage (WHO 2018), access to sufficient pain relief is deplorably low in LMICs, especially amongst children (Knaul et al. 2018). This background situation directly affects access to pain management in humanitarian crises in LMICs, especially where law or policy limit or prevent the importation of opioids. Humanitarian actors have expressed a commitment to advocate (Nickerson and Attaran 2012) and rally international organizations, governments, policy-makers, and healthcare providers to take the “necessary steps to ensure that all patients in need have access to” essential <b>medicines</b> for <b>palliative</b> care (De Lima et al. 2007). It was felt that advocacy by humanitarian providers would further the recognition and inclusion of palliative care in national and local health systems globally. Concerns were raised about introducing care that could not be sustained once humanitarian response has ended, but this was offset with the potential opportunity for capacity building and health systems strengthening.|$|R
