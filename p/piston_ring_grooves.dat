There {{is a need for}} tools that canbe used to investigate and predict the result of specific design changesmade on the components. In this work, the mechanics and the tribologyof the power cylinder unit and more specifically the operation of thetwin land oil control ring (TLOCR) is investigated. In heavy duty dieselengines (HDDE), TLOCR are typically used. The TLOCR plays a veryimportant role in the engine since it is supposed to distribute the correctamount of oil on the liner to lubricate the other rings. It is importantthat the TLOCR does not leave too much oil on the liner for the twotop rings since it could lead too high oil consumption. In a HDDE thepiston assembly is the largest contributor to frictional losses where thepiston ring pack accounts for the major part of this. The oil control ringhas the largest contribution to frictional losses in the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> packtherefore making it very interesting to study from a fuel consumptionperspective. The objective of this thesis is to develop a simulation toolthat can be used to quantify design changes to the TLOCR. Such as thedimensions of the ring itself but also ring tension, running land profileand out of roundness of the cylinder liner. The model developed in this work accounts for the tribological interfaceof the TLOCR against the cylinder liner and <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> aswell as the elastic deformation of the ring and the <b>ring</b> dynamics withinthe <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> <b>groove.</b> The actual <b>ring</b> cross section is modelled in orderto account for the full three dimensional elastic deformation of the ring. By solving all of these problems as a coupled system it is believed thatthe entire operation of the oil control ring could be understood in a betterway than earlier and open up new optimisation possibilities for theTLOCR. The full ring is modelled in order to account for out of roundcylinder liners. Since the cylinder liner in an engine will always havesome deviation from perfectly round this is important. The model cantherefore be used to investigate the effect on oil distribution by reducedring tension which will affect the frictional losses of the system.

These deposits attached to the surfaces reduce heat transfer and increase inner temperature, which produces a knocking phenomena damaging the crank bearings and fusing of the piston head material.

The model can therefore beused to investigate the effect on oil distribution by reduced ring tensionwhich will affect the frictional losses of the system. It was found that thereduction in tangential force on the TLOCR with kept sealing capability,enabled by reduced out-of-roundness, could result in friction reductionof 40 % at mid-stroke. Because of the complexity, a multi-physics model of this type introducesdifficulties with convergence. Especially when implementinga mass conserving cavitation model and solving for the reversal of thepiston ring. Implementation and numerical verification of a mass conservingcavitation model was therefore performed. A method for dealingwith the convergence problem close to reversal was implemented and discussed. A model considering texture, of dimple type, on the cylinder linerwas also developed to find dimple dimensions optimal for reduced fuelconsumption. Since the dimples are modelled in a deterministic manner,only a periodic section of one land of the TLOCR was considered. Themodel takes mixed lubrication and inertia of the ring into considerationand a mass conserving cavitation algorithm were implemented. Theresults from the model predict friction {{reduction of}} approximately 40 %at mid-stroke speeds.

Itwas found that friction of the TLOCR could be reduced with close to 50 % with kept sealing capability by reduced ring tension and differentgeometry on the lands in contact with the cylinder liner.

This <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> on the support body was a further refinement by the former Meiningen repair shop.|$|R
40|$|A {{running-in}} and starved lubrication {{experiment is}} designed to investigate the heavy-duty scuffing behavior of <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> coatings against cast iron (Fe) cylinder liner using the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> reciprocating liner test rig. The scuffing resistance of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> with the chromium-based ceramic composite coating (CKS), and that with the thermally sprayed nickel-chromium-molybdenum coating (NCM) is compared at different nominal pressures (40 ~ 100 MPa) and temperatures (180 ~ 250 °C). With the failure time as a criterion, the rank order is as follows: NCM/Fe > CKS/Fe. Before the scoring occurs at the interface of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> and cylinder liner (PRCL), the cast iron liner enters into a “polish wear” stage, and iron-based adhesive materials begin to form on the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> surface. With the macroscopic adhesion formation, the plastic shearing cycle causes surface damages mainly due to abrasive effects for the CKS/Fe pairs and adhesive effects for the NCM/Fe pairs...|$|R
