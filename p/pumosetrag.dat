40|$|Background: Low basal lower esophageal {{sphincter}} (LES) {{pressure and}} transient LES relaxations are major causes of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). <b>Pumosetrag,</b> a novel selective partial 5 HT 3 receptor agonist, showed a promising effect on reducing reflux events in health. We aimed {{to evaluate the}} effect of <b>pumosetrag</b> on changes in reflux episodes, lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), and specific symptoms in patients with GERD receiving a refluxogenic meal. Methods: Patients with GERD, who developed heartburn and/or regurgitation after ingestion of a refluxogenic meal, were randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels of <b>pumosetrag</b> (0. 2, 0. 5, or 0. 8 mg) or placebo. Before and after 7 days of treatment, patients underwent manometry, intraesophageal multichannel, intraluminal impedance and pH after a standard refluxogenic meal. Key Results: A total of 223 patients with GERD [125 (56 %) women, mean (SD) age = 36 (12) years] were enrolled. No overall treatment effects were detected for {{the total number of}} reflux episodes (acidic and weakly acidic) (p > 0. 5); however, significant treatment effects (p < 0. 05) on the number of acid reflux episodes were observed with lower values on <b>pumosetrag</b> 0. 2 mg (10. 8 ± 1. 1), 0. 5 mg (9. 5 ± 1. 1), and 0. 8 mg (9. 9 ± 1. 1) compared with placebo (13. 3 ± 1. 1). Significant treatment effects (p < 0. 05) were also observed for the percentage of time pH was < 4, with less time for <b>pumosetrag</b> at 0. 5 mg (10 %) and 0. 8 mg (10 %) compared with placebo (16 %). Conclusions & Inferences: In GERD, the partial 5 HT 3 agonist <b>pumosetrag</b> significantly reduced the rate of acid reflux events but did not result in a significant change in LESP or symptomatic improvement over a 1 -week treatment period...|$|E
