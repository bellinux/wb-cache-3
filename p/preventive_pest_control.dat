Our ideas on the applications of this to bird management are not well developed; we 2 ̆ 7 d be happy to hear your suggestions and comments. The ideas of cultural control are not new and are only one of many approaches. But perhaps we are reaching a stage of public concern about bird problems and about environmental contamination which make the climate for long range plan-ning and cooperation more favorable. Most of the investigators and PCOs engaged in the management of bird populations are aware that the problem has two basic approaches: attacking the birds directly or making the environment unsuitable. Both these approaches are generally applied after the bird problem has developed. In the terminology of the medical profession, we are 2 ̆ 2 treating symptoms. 2 ̆ 2 We build our cities, shopping centers, and airports and wait for the bird populations to develop.

50|$|All the {{historical}} signs and sources {{refer to the}} fact that the conquering tribes were amazed watching the game and fish abundance of the Carpathian Basin and South-West Transdanubia. Even before the times of the Hungarian conquest, hunting practice in the forests and fields of the present South-West Hungary were characterized by different hunting methods. Archaeologists assume that besides trap boards, ancient Hungarians used to hunt deer, wild boars, fur-bearing animals from horseback with bows and arrows. 'Anonymous' (Historian of the early Middle Ages) confirmed that Hungarian tribes of the Conquest times applied bows and arrows, and used dogs for hunting.Wild boars stopped by the hunting dogs were stabbed with lances by the royal hunters. Different kinds of hunting dogs can be traced back, too. The first hunting law (1092) restricted the organization of hunts on feast days in the region of the present South-West Hungary. In 1504, Ladislaus II introduced a ban denying villains´ hunting rights for deer, rabbit, wild boar, pheasant and hazel grouse. Later, in the Turkish Ottoman era, the invading forces unboundedly hunted and destroyed the stock of game, thus decreasing it in Tolna region.In the 18th century, after the Turkish occupation, the hunting of the local game stock was regenerated and it operated as a type of protective, <b>preventive</b> action for <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> At that time, hunting rights belonged to the nobleman who owned the land and later were connected to the land ownership.|$|R
40|$|Insect {{pests and}} vectors of {{animal and plant}} {{diseases}} are a major constraint to the improvement of agricultural productivity, and a continuous threat to food security and livelihoods, particularly in less developed countries. The excessive reliance on broad-spectrum insecticides as the prevailing strategy to <b>control</b> <b>pest</b> outbreaks for over 50 years worldwide has showed some limitations with {{the increasing number of}} documented cases of field-evolved resistance and re-emergence of pests or vector-borne diseases that had been previously placed under control. More widely, agriculture intensification has contributed to the erosion of crop and livestock genetic diversity and fragmentation or suppression of natural habitats supporting biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services such as insect pest regulation. These concerns are being exacerbated in a context of global change, including population growth, global warming, transboundary trade, on-farm loss of biodiversity, and societal demand for a safer environment and residue-free food, which foster increasingly stringent pesticide use in agriculture and livestock farming. Integrated pest management (IPM) is an ecosystem approach to crop production and protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides. IPM thus requires science-based knowledge of the life cycle of pests and their interactions with the environment, including natural enemies and habitats. Field realities, however, show that IPM is often used in a reactive manner and at a local scale, as a simple toolbox. A fundamental shift to a system-wide approach is needed to achieve <b>preventive</b> and effective <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> while enhancing crop yields, and reducing farmers' reliance on pesticide use and the associated environmental impacts. This shift should at least consider: (i) the functional area of the target pest populations; (ii) the complexity of ecological processes driving regulation; and (iii) the intelligent combination of <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> technologies. Area-wide integrated pest management is a promising way to improve conventional <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> by targeting <b>pest</b> populations within their functional area. This approach requires a better knowledge of target pests, especially regarding their life system (spatial distribution, habitats, dispersal ability over time and space, genetic structure, metapopulation dynamics and gene flow), ecological processes driving regulation (food web networks and natural enemy assemblages), and responses to farming practices at a field and landscape scale. In addition, the success of such an approach relies on a strong cooperation amongst stakeholders for the design, implementation and compliance of pest management programs, and requires farmer education and external coordination, either from governmental bodies or farmers associations.

Although the complexity of agricultural landscapes is known to influence natural enemies of pests, few studies have measured the degree of <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> by different enemy guilds across gradients in landscape complexity. Here, we use multiple natural-enemy exclosures replicated in 18 fields across a gradient in landscape complexity to investigate (1) the strength of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> across landscapes, measured as the difference between pest pressure in the presence {{and in the absence of}} natural enemies; (2) the differential contributions of natural enemy guilds to <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> and the nature of their interactions across landscapes. We show that natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> of aphids increased up to six-fold from simple to complex landscapes. In the absence of <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> aphid population growth was higher in complex than simple landscapes, but was reduced by natural enemies to similar growth rates across all landscapes. The effects of enemy guilds were landscape-dependent. Particularly in complex landscapes, total <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> was supplied by the combined contribution of flying insects and ground-dwellers. Birds had little overall impact on aphid control. Despite evidence for intraguild predation of flying insects by ground-dwellers and birds, the overall effect of enemy guilds on aphid control was complementary. Understanding <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> services at large spatial scales is critical to increase the success of ecological intensification schemes. Our results suggest that, where aphids are the main pest of concern, interactions between natural enemies are largely complementary and lead to a strongly positive effect of landscape complexity on <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Increasing the availability of seminatural habitats in agricultural landscapes may thus benefit not only natural enemies, but also the effectiveness of aphid natural <b>pest</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies show}} that {{landscape}} simplification reduces abundance and diversity of natural enemies in agroecosystems, but its effect on natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> remains poorly quantified. Further, natural enemy impacts on pest populations have usually been estimated for {{a limited number of}} taxa and have not considered interactions among predator species. In a quantitative synthesis with data collected from several cropping systems in Europe and North America, we analyzed how the level and within-field spatial stability of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> services was related to the simplification of the surrounding landscape. All studies used aphids as a model species and exclusion cages to measure aphid <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Landscape simplification was quantified by the proportion of cultivated land within a 1 km radius around each plot. We found a consistent negative effect of landscape simplification on the level of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> despite interactions among enemies. Average level of <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> was 46 % lower in homogeneous landscapes dominated by cultivated land, as compared with more complex landscapes. Landscape simplification did not affect the amount of positive or negative interactions among ground dwelling and vegetation-dwelling predators, or the within-field stability of <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Our synthesis demonstrates that agricultural intensification through landscape simplification has negative effects on the level of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> with important implications for management to maintain and enhance ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.
