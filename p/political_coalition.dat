5|$|Menem {{supported}} the Washington Consensus, and tackled inflation with the Convertibility plan in 1991. The plan was complemented {{by a series}} of privatizations, and was a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and developed special relations with the United States. The country suffered two terrorist attacks. The Peronist victory in the 1993 midterm elections allowed him to force Alfonsín to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, which he won. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a <b>political</b> <b>coalition</b> that won the 1997 midterm elections and the 1999 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the ARF {{announced}} that it would nominate its own candidate to run for president of Armenia in the February 2008 presidential election. In an innovation on November 24–25, 2007, the ARF conducted a non-binding Armenia-wide primary election. They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates, Vahan Hovhannisyan and Armen Rustamyan, they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard opinion poll was that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in makeshift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot. In the presidential election, Hovhannisyan placed fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In 2008, ARF re-joined the ruling <b>political</b> <b>coalition</b> in Armenia and supported strong police actions during the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests that led to ten deaths.|$|E
5|$|Save Our Children, Inc. was a <b>political</b> <b>coalition</b> {{formed in}} 1977 in Miami, Florida to {{overturn}} a recently legislated county ordinance that banned discrimination {{in areas of}} housing, employment, and public accommodation based on sexual orientation. The coalition was publicly headed by celebrity singer Anita Bryant, who claimed the ordinance discriminated against her right to teach her children biblical morality. It was a well-organized campaign that initiated a bitter political fight between unprepared gay activists and highly motivated Christian fundamentalists. When {{the repeal of the}} ordinance went to a vote, it attracted the largest response of any special election in Dade County's history, passing by 70%. In response to this vote, a group of gay and lesbian community members formed Pride South Florida, now known as Pride Fort Lauderdale, an organization whose mission was to fight for the rights of the gay and lesbian community in South Florida.|$|E

Such cooperations are coalition phenomena and the corresponding proper subsets of actors are coalitions. 1 Since coalescing partners purposefully seek influence against their adversaries, any coalition in human societies has political features. 2 Except for the more general analysis of Riker (1963), most existing lit...|$|R
5|$|The Pact of Olivos {{diminished the}} electoral {{strength}} of the UCR, leading {{to the rise of}} the Frepaso. Both parties united in a <b>political</b> <b>coalition,</b> the Alliance, which defeated the PJ in the 1997 midterm elections. It was the PJ's first national defeat since 1985. The parties held open primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections. De la Rúa stood for the UCR; the whole party, including Alfonsín, supported him. The Frepaso candidate was Graciela Fernández Meijide, who had defeated Peronism in the populous Buenos Aires province. De la Rúa won the primary elections by a wide margin. In the primaries, De la Rúa was voted for by more people than those who voted for the UCR in 1995. Despite his victory, Alfonsín was still the president of the UCR. They disagreed on the vice president for De la Rúa's ticket; he thought that it should be Meijide because she took part in the primary elections and came from a different district than him. Alfonsín preferred the popular Carlos Álvarez, leader of the Frepaso, saying he could attract more voters and had more political expertise. It was also a result of the internal politics of the Alliance: except for Meijide, the Frepaso did not have a political figure who may run with good chances for governor of the Buenos Aires province. Had she run for vicepresident, Frepaso would have had to resign that candidacy to a radical candidate.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Why have labor {{movements}} in New York City and Los Angeles changed so dramatically? And more specifically, why have the activist social coalitions that revitalized {{the labor movement}} in Los Angeles not played {{the same kind of}} role in New York? Our research persuades us that the relationship between. contrasting coalition types—political and social—is central to explaining the differences. <b>Political</b> <b>coalitions</b> refer to cooperation between unions and parties, politicians, and other social actors, focused largely on elections and policy-making processes. Social coalitions, by contrast, include labor and other social actors such as community, religious, environmental, and immigrant rights groups, focused on a range of political, economic, and social campaigns. A comparison of the two metropolitan areas {{over the past two decades}} reveals distinct patterns of coalition building in New York and Los Angeles. In New York, the labor movement is dominated by several powerful local unions, often at odds with one another in contending <b>political</b> <b>coalitions.</b> New social coalitions have developed but are not central to organized labor 2 ̆ 7 s political action. The focus of most unions on narrow interest representation contributes to a disconnect between social and <b>political</b> <b>coalitions</b> in which the latter dominate. In Los Angeles, by contrast, the significance of social coalition building stands out as the labor movement has coalesced over the past fifteen years. To be sure, labor in Los Angeles participates actively in <b>political</b> <b>coalitions.</b> In contrast to New York, however, <b>political</b> <b>coalitions</b> move beyond narrow union interests, building on social coalitions that broaden the influence of labor as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Global {{economic}} integration is {{often viewed as}} a process orchestrated from 'above' by constituents of an emergent transnational class. Yet such perspectives neglect the autonomous contributions made from 'below' by subnational <b>political</b> <b>coalitions</b> that mediate between global and local interests. In this article we consider the issue of political mobilization at the subnational scale around the material and discursive interests of mobile capital. We highlight the mechanisms that mediate the tension between global and local interests and examine how this tension is articulated at multiple scales. We draw on empirical work in the United States and United Kingdom to illustrate the complex translation between 'global' capital and 'local' <b>political</b> <b>coalitions.</b> We conclude by sketching out the implications of our discussion for research {{on the role of}} <b>political</b> <b>coalitions</b> in fostering modernization through inward investment and upon some of the attendant policy implications.
