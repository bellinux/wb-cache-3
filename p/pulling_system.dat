40|$|Staplers have {{improved}} {{the results of}} esophageal surgery, in our experience and in others experience, as esophago-enteric anastomoses have become safer and faster than when manual suturing is used. Probably {{one of the last}} problems in the stapler technique, especially in the thoracic area, is the performance of on adequate esophageal purse-string suture: an improper performance of this suture can cause a dangerous leak of the anastomosis. So, many surgeons, {{to reduce the risk of}} esophageal dehiscence connected with the esophageal purse-string, use either purse-string devices or alternative methods such as a second handsewn purse-string, U stitches of the esophagus, etc. We think that the risk of improper anastomoses after esophageal resection can be reduced if the need for the esophageal purse-string can be eliminated. This work shows our personal technique for performing esophagoenterostomy, especially in the thoracic area, using the new CEEA stapler (Autosuture) without esophageal purse-string sutures. According to the modified procedure the stapler anvil and the mini rod are introduced in the esophagectomy and a 2 - 0 thread is knotted around the CEEA mini rod.

30|$|The {{physical}} properties of percolating ZnO NW network channels such as thickness and density were controlled by modulating the substrate pulling speed from the NW solution during NW assembly. Figure  2 c shows the AFM (atomic force microscopy) images of ZnO NW networks assembled at different pulling speeds of 0.5, 2, and 10  mm min− 1. The average height profile vs pulling speed {{is shown in}} Fig.  2 d. The NW density was 1.21 NW μm− 2 at pulling speed 0.5  mm min− 1, and 0.09 NW μm− 2 at 10  mm min− 1. The NW channel thickness increased by reducing the pulling speed. The height of the NW channel was usually about 1.5 ~ 2 times higher than single NW average diameter of 200  nm at the slowest speed rate 0.5  mm min− 1 (Fig.  2 d, inset). At pulling speed of 10  mm min− 1, the network connection reached the percolation limit, beyond which the network showed no connection. Current methods of fabricating ZnO NW network devices generally involve electrode deposition ZnO NW-coated film, followed {{with some kind of}} etching process to define the channels [38, 39]. This method is difficult to control the physical dimensions such as adjustment of the ZnO channel width. To overcome these problems, a method using hydrothermal growth of ZnO NWs on pre-patterned layers has been studied [44, 45], but it requires also additional etching process and/or hydrothermal growing processes that take time and cost. In contrast, our method can easily control the width and length of a channel by previously patterning the channel with OTS molecules and then assembling the NWs through a <b>pulling</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

The {{focus has been on}} the effect of stimulated Raman scattering which is activated by the interaction between such a strong evanescent field and the nonlinear liquid surrounding the nanofiber. In order to observe the stimulated Raman scattering, we investigated the nonlinear modeling to determine the needed characteristics of the nanofibers. The modal Raman gain was calculated to determine the optimal radius of nanofibers for each possible liquid. Considering the critical power and the damage threshold of our nanofibers, we found the minimum required interaction length. The condition of adiabacity of the tapers was also described. These specifications of nanofibers guide us towards the design of a proper <b>pulling</b> <b>system.</b> Several pulling systems and techniques are investigated for the fabrication of our specific nanofibers. We now are able to fabricate low loss uniform nanofibers of up to 10 cm long, a diameter down to 200 nm, with two identical low loss tapers by using our own designed translation stage pulling platform and implemented with the “variable heat brush” technique. With the achieved nanofibers, the Raman effect induced in the evanescent field was observed in both pure (ethanol) and binary mixture (toluene in ethanol) liquids. These first measurements are in good agreement with our simulation even without any fitting parameters in the modeling. Cette thèse porte sur les mélanges d’onde non linéaires qui peuvent avoir lieu dans le champ évanescent de nanofibres de silice. Nous nous sommes plus particulièrement intéressés à la diffusion Raman stimulée qui est obtenue par l’interaction du champ évanescent très intense et un liquide non linéaire dans lequel baigne la nanofibre. Afin de mettre en évidence la diffusion Raman stimulée« évanescente », nous avons développé un modèle de simulation non linéaire dont le but est de déterminer les caractéristiques des nanofibres à réaliser. Le gain Raman modal est calculé afin de trouver le rayon optimal des nanofibres pour chaque liquide ou mélange de liquides possible. En considérant la puissance critique et le seuil de dommage de nos nanofibres, nous avons déduit la longueur minimale d’interaction. Les conditions d’adiabacité des parties évasées menant à la nanofibre sont également discutées. Ces spécifications nous ont amenés à développer une plateforme de tirage de nanofibres spécifiquement dédiée à ces expériences de non-linéarités évanescentes. Cette palteforme nous permet de tirer des nanofibres de diamètre allant jusqu’à 200 nm sur des longueurs de 10 cm, avec plus de 90 % de transmission. Avec ces nanofibres, nous avons mis en évidence le premier ordre Stokes de l’éthanol dans le champ évanescent d’une nanofibre, ainsi que les premier et second ordres Stokes du toluène.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the growth, X-ray diffraction assessment and tensile deformation properties of dislocation-free copper single crystals. As such {{it has been}} possible to conveniently section the work carried out into these three main areas within this thesis. Consequently, each chapter may be read almost independently of the others with references and further work suggestions being incorporated {{at the end of}} each chapter. This format, it is felt, does not disjoint the work: rather, it enables the central theme (i. e. the title of this thesis) to be developed in a much more continuously clear way than is normally apparent in a thesis where conclusions, further work suggestions and references are not drawn together until the end of the volume. Chapter I opens with a brief outline of the crystal growth methods which could have been used to produce low dislocation density (andlt; 10 6 cm/cm 3) crystals by utilising the three fundamental phase transitions, i. e. solid to solid, vapour to solid and liquid to solid. The Czochralski method is then discussed in detail since it was used by the author to produce dislocation-free copper single crystals. The technological problems in obtaining such crystals are extensively enumerated and solutions presented. For instance, melt surface vibrations were eliminated by using a continuous flow of cooling water, by standing the complete crystal puller on a bed of foam, and by rigidly clamping the R. F. coil. It is emphasised that these technological problems must be solved before the scientific aspects of the growth of dislocation-free crystals can be studied. It is further shown that the author's modified crystal growing technique can be reliably used to grow dislocation-free crystals of copper each time, providing adequate care is taken over growth rates (andasymp; 1. 2 cm/hr); specimen shape (a long thin "double-neck" must precede the required crystal to eliminate dislocations propagating from the seed and to act as a heat flow resistance); and crystal cooling rates (a long "tail" allowed the crystal to reach the ambient temperature slowly thereby minimising dislocation by thermal stresses and/or vacancy condensation). In the future, it is suggested, an automated crystal <b>pulling</b> <b>system</b> would be advantageous and a study of crystal growth in a synchrotron X-ray beam could be potentially definitive experiment on crystal growth. Chapter II looks at the theoretical aspects of Czochralski crystal growth with the aid of a new model which has been analysed on the Oxford University Computer. The model assumes a crystal-neck-seed configuration to be "sitting" on a liquid and examines the influence of geometric changes of the seed-neck-crystal and of radiation changes on the temperature gradients, primarily at the growth front. Four elements were chosen for study in this way: Si, Ge, Ag, Cu, i. e. four elements which have been grown dislocation-free. It was found that the seed size and shape played a small part in determining the interfacial temperature gradients, DT c (0), of all the elements. The neck, however, could have a marked influence on DT c (0) values in metals but not so much in semiconductor crystals. By geometric control alone it was found that the best way to reduce DT c (0) values was to grow a large diameter crystal. The influence of radiation losses was found to be marked for semiconductor crystals but not for metal crystals. Finally, it is concluded that to minimise DT c (0) values then the seed and neck must be long and thin and the crystal fat. These results fit in well with experimental knowledge. Further work to be carried out could consider the influence of a varying ambient temperature and convective heat losses on the interfacial temperature gradients. Chapter III is concerned with the interaction of X-rays with perfect crystals. The Lang-Borrmann X-ray topography technique is examined, and the experimental methods used to obtain X-ray topographs taken throughout this work are discussed. The major part of the chapter takes up the discussion of the theoretical interaction of X-rays with a perfect crystal set to diffract such X-rays. It is demonstrated that for a plane-wave incident on a cylindrical crystal, for the boundary condition to be satisfied the dispersion surface tie-points are displaced as the crystal traverses the incident X-ray beam. Thus the crystal wave-vectors no longer exactly satisfy the Bragg condition. This effect, was never unambiguously monitored experimentally because of the incident beam divergence. It is suggested that a future study could consider this problem in more detail. The Takagi-Taupin-Uragami generalised X-ray diffraction theory is reviewed and then used to calculate the intensity in the diffracted beam of a traverse topograph from a perfect cylindrical copper crystal. This computer simulation is also compared to an experimental condition. In both cases it is found that the Bragg surface of the crystal produces a very intense reflection whilst the remainder of the crystal gives a much reduced diffracted intensity in comparison. This asymmetric profile is interpreted in terms of absorption mechanisms which are strong at the centre of the crystal but not at the surface. The general agreement between theory and experiment is considered to be good although a few discrepancies arose, e. g. the lateral extent of the Bragg surface peak was found to be larger for the experiment than for the theory. Continued research in this area must explore further these small discrepancies; and it is suggested that a possible line of future study would be to examine theoretically and experimentally the X-ray diffraction from dislocation-free cylindrical crystals which possess low absorption coefficients (e. g. aluminium, silicon) for harder radiations (e. g. M oKandprop; 1, Ag Kandprop; 1). It should then be possible to produce interference fringes and then it should be possible to examine the effects of a strain gradient on fringe spacing and visibility. Chapter IV sets out to discuss the tensile deformation behaviour of [1 and# 773; 2 and# 773; 3] growth axis, dislocation-free, chromium plated copper single crystals. This is done using the results from two sets of coupled experiments: an Instron deformation study and a synchrotron deformation investigation. It is first shown that chromium plating can destroy the perfection of the crystal unless care is exercised over plating temperatures and times. It was finally found that after plating for 10 seconds at 55 C (andasymp; 1 andmu;m of Cr deposited) that there was no indication of lattice dislocation. The stress-strain curve of a chromium plated dislocation-free copper crystal (Cr thickness and# 8815; 1 andmu;m) is shown to exhibit a yield point commensurate with that for a non-plated, dislocation-free copper crystal, i. e. andasymp; 90 g/mm 2. The work hardening curve is shown to be comprised of three distinct regions: an initial rapid work hardening rate; a transitionary work hardening rate; and a stabilised work hardening rate up to a shear strain of 6 %. In straining the crystal through these regions the work hardening rate progressively decreased. For a plated crystal which is dislocation-free initially it is shown that serrations in the flow curve occur, whilst for all other crystals these are shown to be absent. Such serrations are argued to occur by a source suppression and new source operation mechanism during the early deformation stages (andasymp; 1 % shear strain), and then by a crack formation mechanism at the copper-chromium interface during the later stages of deformation. The initial work hardening rates (andasymp; 18 kg/mm 2) were found to be independent of coating thickness (0. 5 andmu;m and 1 andmu;m) but in the latter two regions the thicker coating imparted a higher work hardening rate to the crystal than the thinner layer, e. g. for a 0. 5 andmu;m chromium layer the work hardening rate was andasymp; 1. 65 kg/mm 2 in region iii and for a 1 andmu;m chromium layer it was 2. 97 kg/mm 2 in region iii. It is tentatively suggested that the chromium layer affected mobile dislocation motion rather than dislocation generation. The synchrotron work produced no evidence to support the argument that dislocation motion up the elastic line took place. Yielding was found to occur at a stress level similar to that measured in the Instron work. The complex stress system imposed by the deformation jig and the lack of resolution rendered it impossible to decide where the dislocation sources were located. Further increases in the load on the crystal produced double slip and this was argued to prematurely occur because of the combination of torsion, bending and tension which the crystal experienced. Certain interfacial dislocation activity was registered but this was not readily analysed in terms of surface sources. The yielding behaviour was inhomogeneous and appeared to be remote from the few slip bands induced by specimen transport. After yielding evidence was found for dislocation pile-up at the centre of the crystal. It is pointed out that future studies should use a better design of deformation jig so as to apply only a tensile stress to the crystal. Plating thickness and specimen size could be further explored. </p...|$|E

The problem can be formulated as an undiscounted Markov decision process (UMDP); however, the curse of dimensionality makes it very difficult to find an exact solution.

40|$|International audiencePull systems {{focusing}} on throughput time control and applicable in situations with high variety and customisation are scarce. This paper compares three unit-based <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> that can cope with such situations: POLCA, CONWIP and m-CONWIP. These systems control the shop floor throughput time of orders {{by limiting the}} number of orders on the shop floor. However, their effectiveness in terms of reducing total throughput time is questioned. Theory states that an improvement of the average total throughput time will be due to the workload balancing capability of a <b>pull</b> <b>system,</b> but that many <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> lack this capability. This paper shows this workload balancing capability to exist for POLCA and m-CONWIP, but not for CONWIP. The magnitude of the effect strongly differs, depending on the configuration of the system, the order arrival pattern and the variability of the processing time of the orders...|$|R

The ability to quantify the level of accuracy in a load <b>pull</b> <b>system</b> is explored by using various calibration validation methods. Experiments and simulation comparisons are described for a GaAs pHEMT and a GaAs HJFET. The measured harmonic load pull data pointed to different guidance on how one would match the 2 nd harmonic for best performance. I...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s lean {{manufacturing}} became a common term in business literature. The underlying principles of {{lean manufacturing}} are well founded in operations management; however, lean is usually {{described as a}} collection of best practices. Among these best practices is a production and inventory control technique known as pull. There is a surprising dearth of information about <b>pull</b> <b>system</b> implementation. Some researchers even suggest that “many manufacturers {{will never be able to}} implement pull. ” To the contrary, when implemented properly we have found <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> to be a readily accepted lean practice that provides immediate and remarkable improvements in business performance...|$|R

40|$|Production {{systems such}} as the CONWIP (constant work-in-process) <b>pull</b> {{production}} <b>system</b> have been widely studied by researchers to date. The CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> is an alternative to pure push and pure <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> that lowers and controls inventory levels and reduces production lead time. In this study, a CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> was simulated {{in place of the}} current push production system at a food packaging company. ARENA 12. 0 simulation software was used and a production system with two dedicated production lines was proposed to reduce the current system's complexity. A method for obtaining the optimum CONWIP level was determined. Various advantages of the CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> were analyzed and it was found that besides a reduction in planning complexity, the proposed two dedicated lines with CONWIP <b>pull</b> production <b>system</b> can also help the company to greatly reduce their total WIP and achieve inventory holding costs savings of over S$ 38, 000 per month. In addition, the total customer lead time can also be reduced from 12 days to 10 days while still meeting customer demand. by Jean Jingying Liu. Thesis (M. Eng.)
