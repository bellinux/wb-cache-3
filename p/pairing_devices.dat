Users are able to securely pair their personal devices with previously unknown devices by simply placing them close to each other (e. g., users can pair their phones by just bringing them into proximity). Ensemble leverages a user’s growing collection of trusted devices, such as phones, music players, computers and personal sensors to observe transmissions made by <b>pairing</b> <b>devices.</b> These devices analyze variations in received signal strength (RSS) in order to determine whether the <b>pairing</b> <b>devices</b> are in physical proximity to each other. We show that, while individual trusted devices can not properly distinguish proximity in all cases, a collection of trusted devices can do so reliably. Our Ensemble prototype extends Diffie-Hellman key exchange with proximity-based authentication.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first wireless pairing protocol that works in-band, with no pre-shared keys, and protects against MITM attacks.

40|$|As mobile devices become {{increasingly}} popular, {{the necessity for}} both user-friendly and secure pairing methods for these devices also rises. One natural approach to <b>pairing</b> <b>devices</b> is to match them based on a shared experience. In this work, we define a shared experience as the act of physically holding two devices together and shaking them for a short period. The common movement data collected during the shaking process can subsequently be used to verify the authenticity of a secret key established via a key exchange protocol. This paper explores the process of key verification using two different measures: a coherence measure derived through time series analysis and a measure based on Hamming distance. Using ROC curves, we show that both of these measures robustly distinguish between the case where two devices have been shaken together and the case where two devices have been shaken separately. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Secure initial {{pairing of}} {{electronic}} gadgets is a challenging problem, especially considering {{lack of any}} common security infrastructure. The main security issue is the threat of so-called Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks, whereby an attacker inserts itself into the pairing protocol by impersonating one of the legitimate parties. A number of interesting techniques have been proposed, all of which involve the user in the pairing process. However, they are inapplicable to many common scenarios where devices to-be-paired do not possess required interfaces, such as displays, speakers, cameras or microphones. In this paper, we introduce BEDA (Button-Enabled Device Association), a protocol suite for secure <b>pairing</b> <b>devices</b> with minimal user interfaces. The most common and minimal interface available on wide variety of devices is a single button. BEDA protocols can accommodate pairing scenarios where one (or even both) devices only have a single button as their “user interface”. Our usability study demonstrates that BEDA protocols involve very little human burden and are quite suitable for ordinary users...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With the {{prevalence}} of mobile computing, lots of wireless devices need to establish secure communication on the fly without pre-shared secrets. Device pairing is critical for bootstrapping secure communication between two previously unassociated devices over the wireless channel. Using auxiliary out-of-band channels involving visual, acoustic, tactile or vibra-tional sensors has been proposed as a feasible option to facilitate device pairing. However, these methods usually require users to perform additional tasks such as copying, comparing, and shaking. It is preferable to have a natural and intuitive pairing method with minimal user tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new method, called MagPairing, for pairing smartphones in close proximity by exploiting corre-lated magnetometer readings. In MagPairing, users only need to naturally tap the smartphones together {{for a few seconds}} without performing any additional operations in authentication and key establishment. Our method exploits the fact that smartphones are equipped with tiny magnets. Highly correlated magnetic field patterns are produced when two smartphones are close to each other. We design MagPairing protocol and implement it on Android smartphones. We conduct extensive simulation and experiments to evaluate MagPairing. Experimental results show that MagPairing can successfully pair two smartphones with 4. 5 seconds on average. It is immune to man-in-the-middle attack even when the attacker is a few centimeters away from the <b>pairing</b> <b>devices.</b> I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Secure <b>device</b> <b>pairing</b> is {{especially}} difficult for spontaneous interaction in ubiquitous computing environments because of wireless communication, lack of powerful user interfaces, and scalability issues. We demonstrate {{a method to}} address this problem for small, mobile devices that does not require explicit user interfaces like displays or key pads. By shaking devices together in one hand for a few seconds, they are securely <b>paired.</b> <b>Device</b> authentication happens implicitly as part of the pairing process without the need for explicit user interaction “just for security”. Our method has been implemented in two variants: first, for high-quality data collection using wired accelerometers; second, using built-in accelerometers in standard Nokia 5500 mobile phones. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of personal wireless devices requires secure connection between them. While {{it is easy}} to securely pair electronic devices by wires, it is very challenging to pair them wirelessly when they have no prior association. We propose Good Neighbor, a novel scheme that securely pairs nearby wireless devices by exploiting multiple antennas built in them. Our scheme requires neither shared secrets nor out-of-band channels (e. g., audio, visual, keyboard, etc.) between the <b>pairing</b> <b>devices.</b> It only requires that the receiver has multiple antennas and that the sender can be placed nearby the receiver. Our scheme is based on the propagation characteristic of the wireless signal that the power of the received signal is inversely proportional to some exponent of the distance between the sender and receiver. When a nearby sender moves very close to one antenna on the receiver, the receiver can observe a large difference between the signal strength measured on its two antennas, whereas a faraway sender would be unable to induce such a large difference. We validate our scheme through theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. We discuss the factors that may affect our scheme — including antenna gain, received signal strength (RSS) saturation, dynamic rate adaptation, and multipath effects — and how to mitigate them. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our scheme by implementing and evaluating a prototype. ...|$|E

40|$|In an {{international}} collaboration, a long-term radon concentration survey {{was carried out}} in schools of Southern Serbia with radon detectors prepared, etched and read-out in Italy. In such surveys it is necessary to evaluate measurement precision in field conditions, and to check whether quality assurance protocols were effective in keeping uncertainties under control, despite the complex organisation of measurements. In the first stage of the survey, which involves only some {{of the total number of}} municipalities, paired detectors were exposed in each monitored room in order to experimentally assess measurement precision. Paired passive devices (containing CR- 39 detectors) were exposed for two consecutive 6 -month periods. Two different measurement systems were used to read out CR- 39 s of the first and second period, respectively. The median of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the measured exposures was 8 % for 232 <b>paired</b> <b>devices</b> of the first 6 -month period and 4 % for 242 <b>paired</b> <b>devices</b> of the second 6 -month period, respectively.

The in-field measured precision results are very similar to the precision assessed in calibration conditions and are much lower than the room-to-room variation of radon concentration in the monitored schools.
