25|$|Polystyrene foams {{are good}} thermal {{insulators}} {{and are therefore}} often used as building insulation materials, such as in insulating concrete forms and structural insulated <b>panel</b> <b>building</b> systems. Grey polystyrene foam, incorporating graphite has superior insulation properties. They are also used for non-weight-bearing architectural structures (such as ornamental pillars). PS foams also exhibit good damping properties, therefore it is used widely in packaging. The trademark Styrofoam by Dow Chemical Company is informally used (mainly US & Canada) for all foamed polystyrene products, although strictly it should only be used for 'extruded closed-cell' polystyrene foams made by Dow Chemicals.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results of the annual computational simulations conducted for separate flats of a ten-story W 70 large-panel building. The calculations were carried out in the Design Builder program which prepares a simulation of the building envelope as well as the separate parts of the building interior. The simulations conducted for the polish climatic conditions allowed the assessment of the thermal comfort of the entire multi-family building and of the particular flats. It is very rare to take into consideration the requirements connected with the overheating effect in the <b>panel</b> <b>buildings.</b> This issue is closely related to the thermal comfort of the building, especially during the summer months. For {{the last couple of years}} modernization of large <b>panel</b> <b>buildings</b> has become very popular. Most of the multi-family large <b>panel</b> <b>buildings</b> in Poland have already been insulated, windows were exchanged and in many cases balconies were closed with glazing constructions. Based on conducted simulations authors analyzed the microclimate conditions in different apartments, with different orientation of balconies. Different simulation steps were analyzed which allowed an evaluation of the influence of different windows, loggia glazing framings and night cooling on microclimate in different apartments...|$|R
