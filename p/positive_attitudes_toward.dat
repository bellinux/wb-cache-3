25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{interactive}} effects of chief executive officer (CEO) age and CEO <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> younger and older employees on organisational age cultures. Data was collected from 66 CEOs of small and medium-sized businesses and 274 employees. Results were consistent with expectations based on organisational culture and upper echelons theories. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for younger employees was negative for CEOs with a less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> younger employees and positive for those with a more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> younger employees. The relationship between CEO age and organisational age culture for older employees was positive for CEOs with a more <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> older employees and non-significant for those with a less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> older employees. The findings provide initial support for the existence of organisational age cultures, suggesting that these cultures can be predicted by the interplay of CEO age and age-related attitudes...|$|R

She also stated that if a wife was unfaithful, she should not tell her husband, writing, [...] "if ever there is a case for a downright lie, this is it".|$|E

5000|$|Another program {{evaluation}} in 2003, conducted by Tracie Stewart at the University of Georgia, showed that white students got significantly more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> Asian-American and Latino individuals, but only marginally more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> African-American individuals. In some courses, participants can feel frustrated about [...] "their inability to change" [...] and instead {{begin to feel}} anger against the very groups {{to which they are}} supposed to be more sensitive. It can also lead to anxiety because people become hyper-sensitive about being offensive or being offended. There are not very good measures of effects on long-term outcomes of these training initiatives.|$|E
40|$|Based on Life Design approach, {{the study}} aimed at {{examining}} {{the relationship between}} some constructs relevant for adolescents to handle the current labor market and their role in affecting career decidedness: career adaptability, <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the future, and future orientation. Specifically, the fully mediational role of <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the future and future orientation {{on the relationship between}} career adaptability and career decidedness was tested. We involved 774 adolescents, of which 408 boys and 366 girls. Results showed that career adaptability predicted indirectly, through <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the future and future orientation, career decidedness. As regards practical implication, the results carried out emphasize the importance to support career adaptability, hope, optimism, and future orientation in adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{correlates}} {{of physical activity}} (PA) can help inform and improve programs that promote PA among youth. We analyzed data from the 2010 National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study, {{a representative sample of}} US students in grades 9 - 12. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between PA correlates (obesity, physical education classes, sports team participation, <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> PA, adult support for PA, and environmental support for PA) and participation in daily PA (DPA), vigorous PA (VPA), muscle-strengthening activity (MSA), viewing television (TV), and using computers or video games (C/VG). A <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> PA and adult support for PA were both associated with increased PA and decreased sedentary behavior. However, among students who lived in neighborhoods that were not safe for PA, a <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> PA was not associated with increased DPA or decreased sedentary behavior and was less strongly associated with VPA and MSA. Efforts to increase PA among youth should promote a <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> PA among youth and encourage adult family members to support their efforts to be active. Policies that promote safe neighborhoods may work synergistically with a <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> PA to increase participation in PA and decrease sedentary behaviors...|$|R

The <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> childrearing was associated with the positive feelings to children, and the negative <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> childrearing was related with the negative feelings to children.

According to previous studies, the <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> content is linked to content sharing intention, and this <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> content leads to the <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> the product exposed in the media content (Mangold and Faulds 2009; Venkatesh and Davis 2000).|$|R

50|$|In a study {{testing the}} nature of {{ambivalent}} prejudice, Hisako Matsuo and Kevin McIntyre (2005) studied American attitudes toward immigrant groups.

The other view is an egalitarian or humanitarian one, which is associated with more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> outgroups.|$|E

The present study examines {{the relationship of}} sleep duration with <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> life and academic achievement {{in a sample of}} 2716 adolescents in Switzerland (mean age: 15. 4 years, SD 1 ⁄ 4 0. 8), and whether this relationship is mediated by increased daytime tiredness and lower self-discipline/behavioral persistence. Further, we address the question whether adolescents who start school modestly later (20 min; n 1 ⁄ 4 343) receive more sleep and report better functioning. Sleeping less than an average of 8 h per night was related to more tiredness, inferior behavioral persistence, less <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> life, and lower school grades, as compared to longer sleep duration. Daytime tiredness and behavioral persistence medi- ated the relationship between short sleep duration and <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> life and school grades.

50|$|Romantic {{relationships}} in the workplace allow the individuals involved to become more open and willing to cooperate with each other. In conjunction with having more <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>toward</b> their work, individuals are often easier to work with because they feel more comfortable expressing their ideas and criticisms with their significant other. This behavioral change can lead to more effective work groups, and in the end, a more productive atmosphere in which open communication is a key aspect.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess qualitatively the {{structure}} of the <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> life in adolescence and to develop, based on the results, a scale that measures the <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> life. In Study 1, I conducted the open-ended format survey of 54 university students on the <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> life and classify the obtained data with the KJ method. As a result, it was made clear by the findings of previous works that the psychological structure model obtained in Study 1 was valid as a structure model on the positive psychology characteristic in adolescence. In Study 2, based on the results of Study 1, I made a 46 -item scale on the <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>toward</b> life, and applied it to 252 adolescents. The factor analysis with the promax rotation indicated 5 subscales, 25 items. The alpha coefficient ranged from. 76 to. 91, and the retest reliability after a two-week interval ranged from. 82 to. 94.
