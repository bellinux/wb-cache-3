50|$|The {{main effect}} of {{cyclophosphamide}} is due to its metabolite <b>phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard.</b> This metabolite is only formed in cells that have low levels of ALDH. <b>Phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard</b> forms DNA crosslinks both between and within DNA strands at guanine N-7 positions (known as interstrand and intrastrand crosslinkages, respectively).

50|$|Cyclophosphamide has {{relatively}} little typical chemotherapy toxicity as ALDHs {{are present in}} relatively large concentrations in bone marrow stem cells, liver and intestinal epithelium.

When 0. 1 mM 4 - hydroxycyclophosphamide and 1 mM GSH was incubated in the presence of 10 μM GST A 1 - 1, A 2 - 2, M 1 a- 1 a, and P 1 - 1 the formation of 4 -GSCP was 2 - 4 -fold increased above the spontaneous level. Enzyme kinetic analysis demonstrated the lowest K(m) (0. 35 mM) for GST A 1 - 1, K(m) values for the other GST enzymes ranged from 1. 0 to 1. 9 mM. Glutathione S-transferase A 1 - 1 (40 μM) also increased the conjugation of <b>phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard</b> and GSH (both 1 mM) 2 - fold, while the other major human isoenzymes, A 2 - 2, M 1 a- 1 a, and P 1 - 1, did not influence the formation of monochloromonoglutathionylphosphoramide mustard.

The second series of experiments were carried out with tumour cell lines with high (SKOV- 3) and low (KHT) GSH contents. The cytotoxicity of 4 -OOH-CP, a stable precursor that rapidly gives rise to 4 -OH-CP spontaneously under physiological conditions, was enhanced in GSH-depleted SKOV- 3 cells, but was unchanged in GSH-depleted KHT cells. It is concluded that the high GSH content of SKOV- 3 cells provides a significant protection against 4 -OH-CP by limiting the breakdown/activation of 4 -OH-CP. Deschloro- 4 -hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (deschloro- 4 -OOH-CP), an analogue of 4 -OOH-CP that generates acrolein (AC) but not PM in the spontaneous fission reaction, is essentially non-toxic when compared with 4 -OOH-CP but is equally potent in depleting GSH. It is postulated that AC may promote the cytotoxicity of the parent 4 -OH-CP by depleting cellular GSH. Consequently, the stabilising influence of GSH on 4 -OH-CP is removed, leading to increased formation of PM, the ultimate cytotoxic agent...|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{examined}} the association between {{the expression of a}} cell adhesion molecule, epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin), and rat embryo malformations induced by three model teratogens and an E-cadherin antisense oligonucleotide during organogenesis in vitro. The embryo malformations induced by <b>phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard</b> (PAM), an active metabolite of an anticancer drug, cyclophosphamide, were not associated with any change in the expression of E-cadherin. The embryo malformations induced by exposure to the phorbol ester, 12 - 0 -tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA), were associated with an increased steady state concentration of E-cadherin mRNA in the embryo, but not in the yolk sac. This increase in E-cadherin mRNA {{did not seem to be}} the cause of the embryo malformations. Exposure of embryos to the heavy metal, cadmium chloride, resulted in an increase in the steady state concentration of E-cadherin protein in the yolk sac, but not in the embryo. The timing of this increase would suggest that it may be one of the factors leading to the embryo malformations. An 18 -base E-cadherin antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, injected into the amniotic cavity of 5 - 7 somite stage rat embryo, down regulated the expression of E-cadherin in the yolk sac, and caused specific open anterior neuropore malformations. Together, these data would suggest that E-cadherin expression is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, and that altering the expression of E-cadherin in the yolk sac is associated with embryo malformations...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{multidisciplinary}} approach, we have measured various indicators of DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes of human populations potentially {{at increased risk}} for cancer. Sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) -DNA adducts were evaluated in a group of firefighters; chromosomal aberrations and hprt mutations were evaluated in a group of cancer patients undergoing radieimmunoglobulin therapy (RIT); SCE and acrolein-modified DNA were measured in cancer chemotherapy patients and in pharmacists preparing chemotherapy prescriptions; and SCE and PAlH-DNA adducts are being measured in U. S. army troops stationed in Kuwait. Our results indicate that both SCE and PAH-DNA adduct levels were not elevated in firefighters, but that other factors such as smoking status and race were risk factors for increased SCE and PAH-DNA adducts. RIT was found to increase background rates of chromosome-type aberrations and frequencies of hprt mutations and there was a strong correlation between levels of therapyinduced chromosome damage sustained in vivo and in vitro sensitivity to radiation-induced chromosome damage. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of cancer patients treated with cyclophosphamide showed higher levels of SCE and had a higher incidence of acrolein adducts in DNA. Lymphocytes from pharmacists preparing antineoplastic drugs were found to acquire increased in vitro sensitivity to SCE induction by <b>phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard</b> with increased lifetime duration of drug handling. A prospective, longitudinal study was performe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Antineoplastic drug, Cyclophosphamide (CP), is {{a widely}} used drug that causes {{toxicity}} through its metabolites, <b>phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard</b> and acrolein. Squalene (SQ), an intermediate in the cholesterol metabolism has antioxidant and membrane stabilizing property. In the present study, the protective role of SQ towards the tissue defense system of the liver and kidney in the toxicity induced by CP was assessed. Material and methods: Normal Wistar albino rats were administered CP in a dose of 150 mg/kg b. wt., i. p., twice, for 2 consecutive days to induce toxicity. SQ, in a dose of 0. 4 ml/day/rat p. o. was used to treat the toxicity induced by CP. Results: Significantly decreased activities of enzymic antioxidants [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) ], decreased levels of reduced glutathione and increased levels of thiobarbutric acid reactive substance (TBARS) were observed. These pathological alterations were significantly normalized during the treatment of SQ. Conclusions: CP toxicity increased the free radical levels in the tissues and affected {{the activities of the}} enzymic antioxidants. Increased levels of TBARS [a measure of lipid peroxidation (LPO) ] and decreased levels of GSH (due to utilization for detoxification process) evidenced the damage to these tissues. Protection exerted by SQ could be due to free radical quenching, providing additional alkylation site to CP metabolites and by inducing enzymic antioxidant production in these tissues. In conclusions improved antioxidant defense system in the liver and kidney of the experimental rats confirms the protective role of SQ against CP induced toxicities...|$|E
40|$|Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) via {{metabolic}} activation bydrug-metabolizing enzymes, especially Cytochrome P 450 (GYP), is a major,cause of drug failure and drug withdrawal., In this studyan in vitro model using HepG 2 cells {{in combination with}} human liver microsomes was developed for the prediction of DILI. The cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide, a model drug, for bioactivation was augmented in HepG 2 cells cultured with microsomes in a manner dependent on exposure time, microsomal protein concentration, and NADPH Experiments using pan- or isoform-selective GYP inhibitors showed that CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 3 A 4 {{are responsible for the}} bioactivation of cyclophosphamide. In a metabolite identification study employing LC-ESI-QTrap and LC-ESI-QTOF, cyclophosphamide metabolites including <b>phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard,</b> a toxic metabolite, were detected in HepG 2 cells cultured with microsomes, but not without microsomes The cytotoxic effects of acetaminophen and diclofenac were also potentiated by microsomes. The potentiation of acetaminophen cytotoxicity was dependent On GYP-dependent metabolism, and the augmentation of diclofenac cytotoxicity was not mediated by either CYP-,or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-dependent metabolism. The cytotoxic effects of leflunomide, nefazodone, and bakuchiol were attenuated by microsomes. The detoxication of leflunomide by microsomes was attributed to mainly CYP 3 A 4 -dependent metabolism. The protective effect of microsomes against nefazodone Cytotoxicity was dependent on both CYP-mediated metabolism and nonspecific protein binding. Nonspecific protein binding but not GYP-dependent metabolism played a critical role, in the attenuation of bakuchiol cytotoxicity. The present study suggests that HepG 2 cells cultured with human liver microsomes can be a reliable model in which to predict piu via bioactivation by drug metabolizing enzymes...|$|E
40|$|O 6 -Benzylguanine (BG) inactivates O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), {{resulting}} {{in an increase in}} the sensitivity of cells to the toxic effects of O 6 -alkylating agents. BG significantly enhances the cytotoxicity and decreases the mutagenicity of nitrogen mustards [i. e., <b>phosphoramide</b> <b>mustard</b> (PM), melphalan, and chlorambucil], a group of alkylating agents not known to produce O 6 -adducts in DNA. The enhancement is observed in cells irrespective of AGT activity. Exposure of Chinese hamster ovary cells to 100 M BG results in enhancement in the cytotoxicity of PM (300 M), chlorambucil (40 M), and melphalan (10 M) by 9 -, 7 -, and 18 -fold, respectively. In contrast, mutation frequency after treatment with 300 M PM is decreased from 259 mutants/ 106 cells to 22 mutants/ 106 cells when cells are pretreated with BG. The enhancement of toxicity of these bis-alkylating agents appears to involve cross-link formation, because neither cytotoxicity nor mutagenicity of a mono-alkylating PM analogue is significantly altered when combined with BG. Enhanced cytotoxicity and decreased mutagenicity is concomitant with a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} cells undergoing apoptosis when BG is combined with PM, melphalan, or chlorambucil at 72 – 94 h after treatment. Cell cycle analysis demonstrates that BG alone or combined with nitrogen mustards arrests cells in G 1 phase of the cell cycle. At 16 h after treatment, 11 and 57 % of cells treated with PM alone or with BG plus PM are in G 1 phase, respectively. Our data suggest that treatment with BG causes G 1 arrest and drives noncycling cells treated with nitrogen mustards into apoptosis, thus protecting against mutagenic DNA damage introduced by nitrogen mustards...|$|E
