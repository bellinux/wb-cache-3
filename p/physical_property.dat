5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> that determines the {{direction}} of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

The <b>physical</b> <b>properties</b> of spray were measured using <b>physical</b> <b>properties</b> test apparatus of standard or scheme for water-saving showerheads issued in several water-saving countries, and satisfaction evaluation data was acquired through bathing experiments. The evaluated showerheads were separated into three groups according to usage water flow and the level of satisfaction.

25|$|Viscosity, a <b>physical</b> <b>property,</b> is {{a measure}} of how well {{adjacent}} molecules stick to one another. A solid can withstand a shearing force due to the strength of these sticky intermolecular forces. A fluid will continuously deform when subjected to a similar load. While a gas has a lower value of viscosity than a liquid, it is still an observable property. If gases had no viscosity, then they would not stick to the surface of a wing and form a boundary layer. A study of the delta wing in the Schlieren image reveals that the gas particles stick to one another (see Boundary layer section).|$|E

25|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the glass thermometer. This consists of a glass tube filled with mercury or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the gas thermometer.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{demonstrated}} that dark-field imaging with the grating interferometer {{can be used to}} extract orientational information of structural details in the sub-micrometer regime beyond the spatial resolution of the detection system. While the scattering of X-rays in a direction perpendicular to the grating lines provides the dark-field contrast, the scattering in a direction parallel to the grating lines only lead to blurring in the image, which is not visible at the low resolution of the detector. This intrinsic <b>physical</b> <b>property</b> of the setup is utilized to extract orientational information about the angular variation of the local scattering power of the sample by rotating the sample around the optical axis of the set-up and collecting a set of several dark-field images, each measuring the component of the scattering perpendicular to the grating lines for that particular orientation. This can be used to determine the local angle and degree of orientation of bone and could yield valuable information for improving research and diagnostics of bone diseases like osteoporosis or osteoarthritis.|$|E

Recent hydrate reserves have been estimated at approximately 1016 [*]m 3 of methane gas worldwide at standard temperature and pressure conditions.
