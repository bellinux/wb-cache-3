Method: Five hundred participants (one participant per family) completed a structured questionnaire collecting socio-demographic information, length of time taken to seek help, and where they sought help. Participants were recruited from the mutual self-help group 'Amor Exigente' {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Brazil. Results: <b>Parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> misusers counted as the largest group of family members. It took an average time of 3. 7 years for the family members to discover their relatives' substance misuse. 42 % had then sought help immediately; it took an average of 2. 6 years for the remaining 58 % of the sample to seek some form of support. A belief that the <b>substance</b> misuse <b>of</b> their relatives was just a transient problem or that they could cope with the situation by themselves were among the most indicated reasons for delay in seeking help.

40|$|This article briefly {{outlines}} {{the neglect of}} families within previous UK policy documents relating to drugs and alcohol, and discusses the significant progress {{that has been made}} in focusing on the family over the past decade. Although substance misuse causes major problems for many family members, this was not even recognized across the Western world: substance misuse was seen primarily as a problem for the individual misuser. When at last the impact on family members did start to be recognized, this led to interventions which tended to blame or pathologize affected family members (they were seen as co-dependent or in need of family therapy). Simultaneously, major policy and strategy documents within both the alcohol and the illicit drug worlds gave minimal attention to family members. This is at last starting to change. A range of Government and other national documents from England and the devolved administrations across the UK, along with some wider international strategy documents, are examined. Many have started to reflect on both the needs of, and the advantages of including, family members and other close network members. The vast majority of these documents refer primarily to substance-misusing parents and the effects that they have on their children. There is however still a major need to increase the visibility both of the needs of all family members, including spouses and <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> misusers, to be able to access appropriate help in their own right (such as the 5 -Step Method, the focus of this supplement) and of their important role as part of the treatment that their substance-misusing relatives might receive...|$|R

The first is a systematic literature review, collating literature in the field of support groups and shame or internalised stigma; a close relation. The literature is synthesised and presented in the form of themes arising from theinformation extracted, with reference to the quality of studies selected. The review concludes by delineating the overarching benefit of groups for those who may suffer shame or internalised stigma. Part two describes an empirical study in which the experiences <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> illicit <b>substance</b> misusers are examined. This is done so qualitatively, with reference to parents’ understanding of the role that shame and stigma may play in their lives and experiences of the support group they attend. Outcomes of thematic analyses of interviews with participants are presented, and major themes are discussed. Benefits for <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> attending the support group is highlighted as one of the main themes.

40|$|Abstract Background Among the {{psychological}} difficulties seen in children <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with <b>substance</b> use problems, the anxiety disorders {{are among the}} most chronic conditions. Although children <b>of</b> alcoholic <b>parents</b> often struggle with the effects <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> use problems long into adulthood, empirical investigations of the influence <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> use disorders on the course of anxiety disorders in adult offspring are rare. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine prospectively the relationship between parental substance use disorders and the course of anxiety disorders in adulthood over the course of 12 years. Methods Data on 618 subjects were derived from the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project (HARP), a longitudinal naturalistic investigation of the clinical course of multiple anxiety disorders. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to calculate probabilities of time to anxiety disorder remission and relapse. Proportional hazards regressions were conducted to determine whether the likelihood of remission and relapse for specific anxiety disorders was lower for those who had a history <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> use disorders than for individuals without this parental history. Results Adults with a history <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> use disorders were significantly more likely to be divorced and to have a high school level of education. History <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> use disorder was a significant predictor of relapse of social phobia and panic disorders. Conclusion These findings provide compelling evidence that adult children <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> with <b>substance</b> use disorders are more likely to have relapses of social phobia and panic disorders. Clinicians who treat adults with anxiety disorders should assess parental substance use disorders and dependence histories. Such information may facilitate treatment planning with regards to their patients' level of vulnerability to perceive scrutiny by others in social situations, and ability to maintain a long-term panic-free state. </p...|$|R

40|$|Integrated {{programs}} for mothers {{with substance abuse}} issues: a systematic review of studies reporting on parenting outcomes. Niccols A., Milligan K., Sword W. et al. Harm Reduction Journal: 2012, 9 : 14. The first systematic review <b>of</b> whether integrated <b>substance</b> use/parenting programmes improve the <b>parenting</b> <b>of</b> problem <b>substance</b> using mothers found remarkably few quality studies, but enough to suggest that such programmes can improve the prospects of often highly at-risk children. Summary Treatment for mothers with substance use problems {{may be an important}} opportunity to improve parenting and break the intergenerational cycle of addiction and dysfunction. However, such women find it difficult to use conventional systems of care (for reasons including fear of losing custody of children, guilt, stigma, and lack of transportation), and prefer comprehensive services provided in a caring, 'one-stop' setting. Researchers, clinicians, and policymakers also recommend that substance use treatment programmes address women's needs and those of their children through comprehensive, integrated services at the same site. The result has been the development of numerous programmes integrating addiction treatment with on-site pregnancy, parenting, or child-related services. Typically these provide individual addiction treatment, maternal mental health services, trauma treatment, parenting education and counselling, life skills training, prenatal education, medical and nutrition services, education and employment assistance, child care, children's services, and aftercare. However, no review has yet systematically assessed the impact of these programmes on the quality <b>of</b> <b>parenting.</b> The featured review aimed to fill this gap, specifically by seeking evidence on whether integrated programmes are more effective than usual addiction treatment, and whether some features of integrated programmes are associated with better parenting outcomes than others. The analysts searched databases for studies published in English from 1990 to May 2011 and conducted other searches to ensure as far as possible that all relevant studies were identified. Of the 31 studies which reported on the quality <b>of</b> <b>parenting,</b> just four were randomised trials; three involved mothers with children and one pregnant women.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 As one of {{the fastest}} growing ethnic {{minority}} groups in the United States, alcohol and drug use in Asian Americans has increasingly been recognized as a public health problem. Emerging research has documented biological, psychosocial, and cultural factors that are associated with alcohol use in Asian American youth adults (Hendershot et al., 2005). However, existing studies have neither adopted a developmental perspective to study the emergence of alcohol use and problems in Asian American during late adolescence, nor have they tested whether prior findings can be generalized to predict drug use. Concurrently, research has suggested that effects <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> are often different across Asian and European American youth. Numerous studies, for example, have suggested that authoritarian parenting style has beneficial effects in Asian American youth, but detrimental effects in European American youth on outcomes such as academic performance and socio-emotional competence. Subsequent research has indicated that parental constructs such as warmth and psychological control may also have differential effects across Asian and European American youth (e. g., Chao & Tseng, 2002). Despite these findings, no published study has documented differential effects <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> on alcohol and drug use across Asian and European American youth. The overarching goal of this study was to examine moderation effects by ethnicity on the association between parenting and alcohol and drug use outcomes in a longitudinal sample of Asian and European American youth. Data were drawn from 97 Asian American and 255 European American youth who participated in the Developmental Pathway Project. The current study first tested measurement invariance <b>of</b> three <b>parenting</b> constructs: parental warmth, parental psychological control, and parental knowledge. Configural invariance was found for mother and father parental warmth and knowledge. However, the item “always tries to change how I feel or think about things” was not a significant indicator for the mother psychological control latent factor and was excluded from subsequent analyses. Metric invariance was found for mother and father parenting, whereas scalar invariance was established for father but not mother <b>parenting.</b> Other types <b>of</b> measurement invariance were also evaluated and there was little evidence of systematic measurement non-invariance <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> constructs. Examination <b>of</b> direct effects revealed that mother psychological control was a risk factor for alcohol use and problems in grade 9 among both European Americans and Asian Americans. Father knowledge also had a significant main, protective effect on three substance use outcomes, including alcohol problems in grade 9, alcohol problems in grade 12, and alcohol dependence in grade 12, for the entire sample. Path analyses indicated a total of six moderated mediation effects. Specifically, for European Americans only, mother knowledge at baseline predicted fewer alcohol problems in grades 9 and 12 via fewer externalizing problems in grade 8. Similarly, for European Americans only, father warmth at baseline predicted alcohol problems in grade 9, alcohol problems, alcohol dependence, and marijuana dependence at grade 12 via better academic achievement. Overall, the direct effects <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> on <b>substance</b> use outcomes were not moderated by ethnicity, but several indirect effects were. The pattern of associations also differed by dimension <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> and the gender <b>of</b> the <b>parent.</b> The current study is the first to illustrate moderated mediation effects <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> on <b>substance</b> use outcomes across European Americans and Asian Americans with the use of a longitudinal sample.
