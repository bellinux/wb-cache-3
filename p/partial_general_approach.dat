40|$|To date, {{research}} on multigenerational aspects of delinquency has been de-voted to transmission from parents to offspring, largely ignoring long-term invariance of criminological theories. This study uses multigenerational {{data from the}} most recent waves of the National Youth Survey Family Study to test a general model of delinquency across two samples of adolescents of similar ages, separated by more than 25 years. Original respondents were compared with their adolescent offspring using identical models based on a <b>partial</b> <b>general</b> strain <b>approach.</b> Direct and indirect effects of strains on delin-quency were generally consistent across generations. The discussion of the findings centers on general theoretical and methodological issues associated with a relatively unexplored avenue for understanding crime and delinquency...|$|R
40|$|Models {{of energy}} demand in New Zealand have {{typically}} been based upon either a <b>partial</b> <b>general</b> equilibrium <b>approach</b> or constructed from spreadsheet models. The results created by such methods predict that electricity is forecast {{to be the}} fastest growing energy demanded by households and the industrial sector {{for the next two}} decades. Furthermore, aggregate electricity demand is forecast to grow at a constant rate for the next two decades. In this paper we attempt to model and forecast electricity demand using a number of recent econometric approaches including Engle-Granger's Error Correction Model, Phillip and Hansen's (1990) Fully Modified Least Squares, and the AutoRegressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach of Pesaran et al. (1996, 1998). We identify the model with the smallest forecasting error using a series of forecasting measures and conclude that the new ARDL approach of Pesaran et al., has better forecasting performance than the other approaches considered. ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{model for}} the Balearic Islands in Spain we show how general {{equilibrium}} models are useful tools for policy analysis {{in the context of the}} implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive. We show that, contrary to <b>partial</b> equilibrium <b>approach,</b> <b>general</b> equilibrium models may predict that water saving policies could be ineffective in terms of improvements in water ecosystems. Consequently, we also show the need for ancillary measures, such us price incentives, to meet the ecological targets of the water saving measures. As it is illustrated, AGEMs also provide information about side social benefits of water efficiency measures that should be considered to determine the maximum acceptable cost of implementing water saving programs to reduce pressures on water ecosystems. Finally, the usefulness of AGEMs to compare different institutional arrangements for water allocation is also illustrated with the Balearic Islands case...|$|R
30|$|Some recent {{theoretical}} and empirical studies attempt to make headway in this direction. At the heart {{of them is the}} notion that school choice can only be expected to deliver what parents want. In an interesting recent study, Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) address this issue while combining some elements of the <b>partial</b> and <b>general</b> equilibrium <b>approaches</b> described above. Specifically, the authors implement a project in which applicants for vouchers were first recruited in a number of towns, with two lotteries carried out subsequently. First, some towns were selected for distribution of vouchers. Second, within the towns selected for treatment, some children were randomly selected to receive the vouchers. This allows Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) to go beyond the usual comparison (lottery-winning individuals versus lottery-losing ones) in most studies. As one example, by comparing nonapplicants in towns that did not receive vouchers to nonapplicants in towns that did, the authors can get a sense of negative effects on children “left behind” in the public sector. In the study, the authors do not find much evidence of such externalities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The message-passing {{paradigm}} is now widely accepted and used mainly for inter-process communication in distributed memory parallel systems. However, {{one of its}} disadvantages is the high cost associated with the data exchange. Therefore, in this paper, we describe a message-passing optimization technique based on the exploitation of single-assignment and constant information properties {{to reduce the number}} of communications. Similar to the more <b>general</b> <b>partial</b> evaluation <b>approach,</b> technique evaluates local and remote memory operations when only part of the input is known or available; it further specializes the program with respect to the input data. It is applied to the programs which use a distributed single-assignment memory system. Experimental results show a considerable speedup in programs running in computer systems with slow interconnection networks. We also show that single assignment memory systems can have better network latency tolerance and the overhead introduced by its management can be hidden. 1...|$|R
