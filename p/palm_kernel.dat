25|$|Various fats contain {{different}} {{proportions of}} saturated and unsaturated fat. Examples of foods containing {{a high proportion}} of saturated fat include animal fat products such as cream, cheese, butter, other whole milk dairy products and fatty meats which also contain dietary cholesterol. Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> oil. Many prepared foods are high in saturated fat content, such as pizza, dairy desserts, and sausage.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that consumption of foods containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (including meat fats, milk fat, butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> oil) is potentially less healthy than consuming fats with a lower proportion of saturated fatty acids. Sources of lower saturated fat but higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids include olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, avocados, corn, sunflower, soy, and cottonseed oils.|$|E
25|$|Mayo Clinic has {{highlighted}} certain oils {{that are}} high in saturated fats, including coconut, palm oil and <b>palm</b> <b>kernel</b> oil. Those having lower amounts of saturated fats {{and higher levels of}} unsaturated (preferably monounsaturated) fats like olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, soy and cottonseed oils are generally healthier. The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats. One study showed that consumption of non-hydrogenated unsaturated oils like soybean and sunflower are preferable to the consumption of palm oil for lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|E
