40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} effect of <b>pranoprofen</b> eye drops on corneal {{endothelium}} and tears inflammatory factors in perioperative period of cataract surgery. METHODS: Totally 60 cases(60 eyes) of senile cataract patients were enrolled in this study. Patients with diabetes or other systemic diseases, with other eye diseases or eye surgery, drug allergy were excluded. All the patients were given ophthalmic surgery for the first time. All the patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, 15 patients per group. Each group of patients had been given levofloxacin eye drops preoperatively for 3 d, 4 times per day, and tobramycin dexamethasone eye drops postoperatively, 3 times per day for the first week, 2 times per day for the second week. Group A was the control group, without any other drugs. Group B was given <b>pranoprofen</b> eye drops 4 times per day for 3 d before the operation. Group C was given <b>pranoprofen</b> eye drops 4 times per day for 1 wk after the operation. Group D was given <b>pranoprofen</b> eye drops 4 times per day for 3 d before the operation and 1 wk after the operation. All the surgeries were done by the same ophthalmologist, using the same phacoemulsification machine and the same ultrasound energy parameters. The loss rate of endothelial cell was measured by corneal endothelium counterometry. Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor(TNF) in the tear fluid were measured by ELISA before surgery(before using eye drops) and 1 wk, 1 mo and 3 mo postoperatively. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in patients' gender, age and phacoemulsification time among 4 groups. The levels of inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 in the tear fluid of the Group B before surgery had no significant difference compared to that at 3 mo postoperatively(P > 0. 05), but the differences among the other groups at different time points were statistically significant(P P > 0. 05). At 1 wk after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P P > 0. 05). At 1 mo after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P P > 0. 05). At 3 mo after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P > 0. 05). The levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF in the tear fluid at different time points among each group were significantly different(P P > 0. 05). At 1 w after the operation, there was significant difference between the Group A and the other three groups(P P > 0. 05).

30|$|Abrego et al. {{prepared}} PLGA (poly lactic co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles of <b>pranoprofen</b> for ophthalmic {{delivery in}} the form of hydrogel. This hydrogel formulation have suitable rheological and physicochemical properties for the ocular delivery of <b>pranoprofen</b> with improved biopharmaceutical outline of the drug. Moreover, it intensified the local anti-inflammatory and analgesic results of the drug, resulting in improved patient’s compliance [80]. In another study, cefuroxim loaded nanoparticles of chitosan were developed using a double crosslinking in double emulsion technique. The inference point out chitosan-gelatin particles as potently practical candidates for DD at intraocular level [81]. Moreover, diclofenac loaded N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (DC-TMCNs) were developed for ophthalmic use to improve ocular bioavailability of the drug [82]. Furthermore, nanosized supramolecular assemblies of chitosan-based dexamethasone phosphate have been developed for improved pre-corneal drug residence time due to its muco-adhesive characteristics. These nanoparticles interact strongly with both ocular surface and drug and protect the drug from metabolic degradation leading to extended pre-corneal residence [83]. Glaucoma, an ophthalmic disease, was treated with brimonidine-based loaded sustained release solid lipid nanoparticles using glyceryl monostearate as solid lipid [84, 85]. Similarly, daptomycin-loaded chitosan-coated alginate (CS-ALG) nanoparticles were developed with a suitable size for ocular applications and high encapsulation efficiency (up to 92 %). This study revealed that daptomycin nanocarrier system could be used in future to deliver this antibiotic directly into the eye, in order to act as a prospective therapy against bacterial endophthalmitis and as an efficient alternative to chitosan nanoparticles [86].|$|E

Such disorders {{may be caused by}} drug toxicity. In the present study, we evaluated the toxicity of ophthalmic solutions, with or without benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as the preservative, used for postoperative care. Methods: A range of commercially available antibiotic and anti-inflammatory ophthalmic solutions used postoperatively (ie, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, norfloxacin, tosufloxacin, dibekacin, cefmenoxime, diclofenac, bromfenac, <b>pranoprofen,</b> betamethasone, and fluoromethorone) were assessed in three corneal cell lines and one conjunctival cell line. All antibiotic solutions were BAK free. Cell viability was determined with the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 thiazoyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after cells had been exposed to the drugs for 48 h. The effects of preservatives on cell viability were also determined. Toxicity was compared using the cell viability score (CVS). Results: Based on results of the MTT assay and CVS, the order of cell viability after exposure to the antibiotic solutions was cefmenoxime &ge; tosufloxicin &ge; dibekacin &ge; levofloxacin &ge; norfloxacin = gatifloxacin = moxifloxacin.

In the present study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of six anti-inflammatory eyedrops in four ocular surface cell lines. Methods: The cytotoxicity of six commercially available anti-inflammatory ophthalmic solutions (ie, diclofenac, bromfenac, <b>pranoprofen,</b> betamethasone, and fluoromethorone) was assessed in three corneal cell lines and one conjunctival cell line. Cell viability was determined by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 thiazoyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide and neutral red assays after exposing the cells to 10, 30, and 60 minutes of onefold, twofold, and tenfold dilutions of the drugs. Cytotoxicity was compared using the cell viability score (CVS), an integrated cytotoxic parameter that takes various factors into account, such as dilution by tear fluid or concentration by evaporation, drug exposure time, and ocular surface cell type. Results: Based on the CVS scores, the order of the anti-inflammatory eyedrops tested from least to most cytotoxic, with the active ingredient %CVS 50, and %CVS 40 / 80 for each solution given in parentheses, was as follows: Rinderon&reg; (betamethasone, 100 %, 100 %) &gt; 0. 02 % Flumethoron&reg; (fluoromethorone, 68 %, 22 %) = 0. 1 % Flumethoron&reg; (fluoromethorone, 76 %, 22 %) &gt;Bronuck&reg; (0. 1 % bromfenac, 53 %, &minus; 8 %) = Diclod&reg; (0. 1 % diclofenac, 44 %, &minus; 15 %) = Niflan&reg; (<b>pranoprofen,</b> 50 %, &minus; 19 %). Rinderon&reg; exhibited the least toxicity of all the anti-inflammatory eyedrops tested. Eyedrops containing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exhibited greater cytotoxicity than those containing steroids with benzalkonium at comparable concentrations.

40|$|Coadministration of {{methotrexate}} and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{can cause}} a pharmacokinetic interaction and a subsequent increase in blood methotrexate concentrations. methotrexate and most NSAIDs are excreted into urine via organic anion transporter 3 (OAT 3). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate NSAIDs that compete less with methotrexate by using the renal cell line stably expressing human OAT 3 (S 2 -hOAT 3) in vitro. We also confirmed the pharmacokinetic interaction of methotrexate with NSAIDs in vivo. [3 H]methotrexate uptake into S 2 -hOAT 3 cells was inhibited by most NSAIDs in a concentration-dependent manner, but aspirin, salicylate, tiaramide, and acetaminophen did not inhibit uptake. Inhibition by sulindac and <b>pranoprofen</b> was weaker at therapeutic drug concentrations. Furthermore, methotrexate concentrations in rat serum were significantly increased in a NSAID concentration-dependent manner when concentrations of coadministered NSAIDs increased above the Ki values obtained in the in vitro study. On the other hand, drugs that were not substrates of hOAT 3, such as acetaminophen, did not interact with methotrexate. The magnitude of the pharmacokinetic interaction between methotrexate and NSAIDs was significantly correlated with results of the accumulation study in vitro and was not significantly correlated with a reduction of urinary creatinine excretion. In conclusion, methotrexate and most NSAIDs are substrates of hOAT 3, and those drugs compete via hOAT 3 in tubular secretion, the major mechanism of the interaction between methotrexate and NSAIDs.
