40|$|Ethanol {{synthesis}} by anoxic root segments from <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murray bis) Parl.); yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach); Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> (Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.); western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), and {{incense cedar}} (Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin) {{was compared to}} determine whether the amounts that they produced during flooding could contribute the known greater vulnerability of <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> cedar to infection by Phytophthora lateralis Tucker & Milbrat. Roots were incubated in water at 5, 15, 25, and 35 °C for 14 days with periodic sampling. After 12 h of anoxic stress, Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> and yellow cedar roots produced equal quantities of ethanol that were about two times more than produced by the other three species, which did not differ from one another. The roots remained anoxic for 14 days, with ethanol concentrations increasing 6 to 11 times depending on the species. After 14 days, Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> remained the highest ethanol producer at two to three times more than the other species, whereas incense cedar yields were the lowest. Yellow cedar, western redcedar, and <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> cedar had intermediate levels of ethanol. The similarity in responses of <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> cedar to the other species is strong evidence that ethanol is not an important contributor to its known greater vulnerability to P. lateralis infection. In general, root incubation temperature affected ethanol synthesis similarly for all species. Increases in temperature from 5 to 15 °C or 15 to 25 °C doubled the ethanol yields at 12 h. Literature ratings of anaerobic tolerance for these cedars were compared with ratings based on their ethanol yields after 12 h or 14 days of anoxia. The latter rating appears to more closely correspond with the cedars associations to wet, mesic environments and their likelihood of experiencing anoxia via flooding...|$|R

50|$|During the 1850s the Tututni game {{trails and}} hunting grounds were {{destroyed}} by whites clearing land for farms. In 1851 some settlers built <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> on Tututni land.

Mining activities heightened the competition for resources and tensions between the Tututni and the European Americans.

On February 1856 Tututni attacked the Gold Beach Guards, who were encamped opposite the large Tututni village at <b>Port</b> <b>Orford.</b> In the conflict the Tututni burned most of the settlers' homes between <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> and Smith River.|$|R
40|$|August 31, 2010 <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> {{is a small}} fishing {{community}} on the southern Oregon coast. Like many coastal towns in Oregon, <b>Port</b> <b>Orford's</b> main economy is the commercial fishing industry. As such, the community has a high dependence on its nearshore marine resources. Those who make their living from these resources know that successful management is vital to maintain the fisheries and the economy that they depend on. 	The market for live fish in <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> has increased rapidly {{over the past two}} decades. To ensure that these stocks have resilience to market pressures, the <b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> Ocean Resource Team, a local non-profit organization, has actively promoted collaborative research and monitoring of local stocks.

40|$|<b>Port</b> <b>Orford</b> cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) has a {{reputation}} for being resistant to fungal attack, but much of the work to support this premise used older growth material (80 - 100 yr old).

Weight losses ranged from as little as 1. 1 to more than 60 % with most blocks experiencing weight losses between 11 and 24 %. Heartwood was resistant to attack by G. trabeum but proved to be very susceptible to P. placenta and was only moderately resistant to this species.
