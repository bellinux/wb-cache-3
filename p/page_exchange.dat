Basic hardware and system parameters vitally affecting program exchange are discussed. The basic program exchange methods covered are 1) the Complete Program Exchange 2) the Block or <b>Page</b> <b>Exchange</b> and 3) the Completely Integrated System Exchange. The investigation is conducted using heuristic analysis, and a simulation study is conducted on selected methods.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{scalable}} distributed crawling {{by means}} of the geographical partition of the Web. The approach is based on the existence of multiple distributed crawlers each one responsible for the pages belonging to one or more previously identified geographical zones. The work considers a distributed crawler where the assignment of pages to visit is based on page content geographical scope. For the initial assignment of a page to a partition we use a simple heuristic that marks a page within the same scope of the hosting web server geographical location. During download, if the analyze of a page contents recommends a different geographical scope, the page is forwarded to the well-located web server. A sample of the Portuguese Web pages, extracted during the year 2005, was used to evaluate: a) page download communication times and the b) overhead of <b>pages</b> <b>exchange</b> among servers. Evaluation results permit to compare our approach to conventional hash partitioning strategies. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - POSI/CHS/ 41739 / 200...|$|R

Advisor: Gregg Musiker. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 174 <b>pages.</b> The <b>exchange</b> graph of a quiver is {{the graph of}} mutation-equivalent quivers whose edges correspond to mutations. The exchange graph admits a natural acyclic orientation called the oriented exchange graph. Oriented exchange graphs arise {{in many areas of}} mathematics including representation theory, algebraic combinatorics, and noncommutative algebraic geometry. In representation theory, an oriented exchange graph is isomorphic to a poset of certain torsion classes of a finite dimensional algebra. Of particular interest to mathematicians and string theorists are the finite length maximal directed paths in oriented exchange graphs, which are known as maximal green sequences. Maximal green sequences were introduced to obtain quantum dilogarithm identities and combinatorial formulas for refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants. They were also used in supersymmetric gauge theory to compute the complete spectrum of BPS states. For quivers mutation-equivalent to an orientation of a type A Dynkin diagram, we show that the oriented exchange graphs can realized as quotients of other posets of representation theoretic objects. For the same class of quivers we also show how to explicitly construct some of their maximal green sequences...|$|R

It was convincingly shown in lesion experiments that cockroaches without optic lobes remained arrhythmic throughout their lifetime. But, because arrhythmic locomotion does not indicate the absence of an intact circadian clock, the most compelling evidence for the location of the circadian clock in the optic lobes of the cockroach was provided by transplantation experiments (<b>Page,</b> 1982).

40|$|The {{first step}} towards {{creating}} avatars with human-like artificial minds {{is to give}} them humanlike memory structures with an access to general knowledge about the world. This type of knowledge is stored in semantic memory. Although many approaches to modeling of semantic memories have been proposed they are not very useful in real life applications because they lack knowledge comparable to the common sense that humans have, and they cannot be implemented in a computationally efficient way. The most drastic simplification of semantic memory leading to the simplest knowledge representation that is sufficient for many applications {{is based on the}} Concept Description Vectors (CDVs) that store, for each concept, an information whether a given property is applicable to this concept or not. Unfortunately even such simple information about real objects or concepts is not available. Experiments with automatic creation of concept description vectors from various sources, including ontologies, dictionaries, encyclopedias and unstructured text sources are described.

40|$|Insulin is an {{important}} hormone used by the cells in the body for regulating the uptake of glucose. The insulin molecule consists of one A and one B chain. The chains contain 21 and 30 amino acids, respectively. Two sulphide bridges between the cysteine acids link the two chains together so that the protein can function. By staining the insulin with a fluorescent stain called Alexa Fluor 488, protein residues on a surface can be microscoped with a confocal microscope. In this project the sulphur bridges on stained and unstained insulin are reduced, forming unbound polypeptide chains and it is attempted to separate the chains in fractions by using the size chromatography, native and SDS <b>PAGE,</b> ion <b>exchange</b> chromatography and HPLC methods. The detector is a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The proteins are measured in the ultraviolet range of 280 nm, and the stain is measured in the visual range of 490 nm. Size chromatography using PD 10 column showed interaction with the column, and the insulin was retained. Native PAGE of the A and B chain did not show the expected separating bands. The SDS PAGE method proved more applicable {{but not for the}} purpose of this project. Ion exchange chromatography revealed fraction of the B chain in the first sample with an ABSmax at 276 nm and subsequently fraction of the A chain with an ABSmax at 271 nm. HPLC measurements confirmed these results and chromatograms showed that retention time for the colour peaks rose to the same level as for the A chain. The retention time for the A and B chain also rose after reaction with Alexa Fluor 488. Laboratory results showed that the B chain insulin may have been stained whereas this was apparently not the case for the A chain insulin...|$|R
40|$|This paper may {{solve the}} dark-energy problem because our {{universe}} is not alone, and the multiverse {{is a powerful}} part of the cosmos. The decay of our aging universe is reviewed first. The accelerated expansion takes the decay debris into the inter-universal medium (IUM) of the multiverse for conservation. A prominent component of the debris and of the IUM is the enormous number of old cold photons from decaying universes. When a small central volume (apparently 6. 4 {{percent of the total}} mass) of our proto-universe reached proton density, the old photons and protons became fully re-energized. Outside of that volume, the large numbers of remaining old photons continued their acceleration and the expansion of our universe. The accretion and expansion are described a second time with what we know of dark energy, particularly its acceleration of the expansion of our universe. Identical results are obtained; in fact, the two descriptions are complementary, and the conclusion is therefore made that dark energy is the acceleration energy of old photons. The model is supported by 30 observations and considerations for future work. Comment: 12 <b>pages,</b> 2 Tables; <b>exchange</b> of 1101. 0161 and 1101. 056...|$|R

During the 1990 s wars, music genre known as turbo folk was especially popular in Serbia. Research has shown that this music contains Oriental, most of all Ottoman, influences. Even though it is very popular, this kind of music has been subjected to severe criticism, which may be divided into two main groups. According to some, turbo-folk has been criticized because it was associated with war, nationalism and crime. In the second group are those who are nationalistically terrified of foreign influences in the music, feeling that this music leads to the "tehranization" of Serbia. In addition, critics think that it is kitsch, which favors immorality. The focus of this research is on the perception of turbo folk by You Tube users. The material from this Internet <b>page</b> for video <b>exchange</b> is available in the whole world.

While this popular view does not tell the whole story behind the early beginnings of IXPs, what is true is that since around 1994, the number of operational IXPs worldwide has grown to more than 300 (as of May 2013), with the largest IXPs handling daily traffic volumes comparable to those carried by the largest Tier- 1 ISPs, but IXPs have never really attracted any attention from the networking research community. At first glance, this lack of interest seems understandable as IXPs have apparently little to do with current "hot" topic areas such as data centers and cloud services or software defined networking (SDN) and mobile communication. However, we argue in this article that, in fact, IXPs are all about data centers and cloud services and even SDN and mobile communication and should be of great interest to networking researchers interested in understanding the current and future Internet ecosystem. To this end, we survey the existing but largely unknown sources of publicly available information about IXPs to describe their basic technical and operational aspects and highlight the critical differences among the various IXPs in the different regions of the world, especially in Europe and North America. More importantly, we illustrate the important role that IXPs play in today's Internet ecosystem and discuss how IXP-driven innovation in Europe is shaping and redefining the Internet marketplace, not only in Europe but increasingly so around the world.
