50|$|One {{common purpose}} of a {{workshop}} production {{is to provide a}} <b>preview</b> <b>staging</b> of a new work in order to gauge audience and critical reaction, following which some parts of the work may be adjusted or rewritten before the work's official premiere. Because a workshop production generally pays less for the rights to perform the play, workshop productions also provide an opportunity for smaller theatres to generate increased publicity by staging a popular or highly anticipated work for which a full production might be too costly. Some theatre companies, in fact, specialize exclusively in workshop productions; amateur and youth theatre companies, for example, are commonly structured on the workshop production model.|$|R

30|$|Each OpenStack {{service has}} {{its own set of}} probes and effectors, which allows the Controller to {{interact}} with OpenStack. The information collected by the probes include the different activities related to access control that take place in the OpenStack platform, such as, access requests and authorisation decisions. As aforementioned, each OpenStack service contains a Log component that can be queried for this information (Steps 1 a and 1 d). There are also probes for obtaining the access control policies currently in place (Steps 1 c and 1 f), and information about users (Step 1 e) and about objects being protected (Step 1 b) by means of their respective PIP. This information is fed into the Monitor (Steps 2 a and 2 b), which is responsible for updating behavioural models in the Knowledge. The Analyse stage (3) is responsible for assessing the collected information in order to detect any malicious behaviours. This stage also identifies a set of possible adaptations for mitigating the perceived malicious behaviour, and prevent future occurrences. The Plan stage (Step 4) is responsible for deciding what to do and how to do it by selecting an appropriate adaptation (based on the set of possible adaptations provided by the <b>previews</b> <b>stage)</b> for dealing with the malicious behaviour, and producing the respective adaptation plan. Finally, the Execute stage (5) adapts the authorisation infrastructure by means of effectors (Steps 6 a and 6 b), which alter the access control policies in place through the PAP of each service, i.e., Keystone PAP (Step 7 a) and Swift PAP (Step 7 b).|$|R

500|$|In October 2008, Spears hired Wade Robson, who had {{previously}} worked as director for her Dream Within a Dream Tour, to direct the tour; he announced that rehearsals would start in January. His wife, Amanda Robson, was also hired as co-creative director. Andre Fuentes {{was chosen as the}} lead choreographer. However, on December 23, 2008, the Robsons and Fuentes were replaced due to unknown reasons by Jamie King, who previously collaborated with Spears in her Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. He did the casting of the dancers and acrobats, and worked with Spears on the setlist and the choreography. King described the show saying it was [...] "sexy, fun, explosive, and full of surprises. While avoiding such traditional circus elements as live animals, we've created something innovative and exciting using contortionists, dancers, lighting, fire and other special effects". Simon Ellis was hired as the musical director. The production design was done by Road Rage, a formed alliance between Nick Whitehouse, Bryan Leitch, William Baker and Steve Dixon. Lightning design was done by Visual Light, conformed by Whitehouse and Leitch. The stage was designed by Road Rage and set in-the-round, with a big stage in the center painted to look like a target. There were also two satellite stages in the sides unified by small catwalks, to resemble an actual three-ring circus. The stage was built by Tait Towers and included nine lifts, which had a cost of $10million. It traveled in 3,000 rolling cases packed into 32 semis and a crew of 150 people was needed to set it up. There was a semi-transparent Element Labs Stealth cylinder screen above the stage, comprising 960 panels that Solotech built into custom frames. The backdrops were designed by Dirk Decooedt. There were three new film sequences shot exclusively for the tour: an opening video featuring Perez Hilton, a video of Spears set to Marilyn Manson's [...] "Sweet Dreams Are Made of This" [...] and a final montage. The three videos were created by Veneno. Props, including swings, couches, unicycles, stripper poles, a gold cage and giant picture frames, were designed by ShowFX Inc.; they also provided custom VIP couch seating that lined the perimeter of the stage. VYV provided the video control, which included two Photon Show media servers and two Photon Controllers. The servers took timecode for the show and wrapped the images around the Stealth screen. Emric Epstein of VYV explained, [...] "The servers and software permits us to control a large number of video layers on the 360˚ LED screen, composite the layers in realtime, and transform the final output so that everything look seamless after going through the LED controllers. There is also an astounding 3D <b>preview</b> of the <b>stage</b> and video screens in the software so you can control or re-program the show without being inside the arena bowl".|$|R
40|$|Some {{consultants}} within KPMG advisory {{feel like}} the services that KPMG advisory generates for its clients, could be improved. They see a potential solution within the application of design activities related to design paradigms such as user experience and customer experience. However several hurdles are experienced within the introduction of these approaches. In other words there are difficulties with the successful introduction of an approach called design thinking. According to a market analyses, KPMG’s advisory services has maintained {{about the same size}} in a growing advisory market, where competition has increased the past seven years. KPMG is the only company of the Big Four that has not grown within the past seven years. In the meantime KPMG has lost its leading advisory position within the Big Four consultancies to Deloitte. The market for business services is changing. There is increased competition caused by growing competitors and new European and Dutch audit legislation. In addition clients expect better business services and better business service experiences. KPMG’s position on the advisory market, the growing competition and the development of increased expectations of business services indicate the need for new ways to develop better experiences for clients. Design thinking is an approach {{that can be used to}} do just that. Therefore the assignment of this project was to find a way to introduce design thinking in a successful way at KPMG and design a solution that would enable consultants to apply it in their profession. Design thinking is an approach that centralizes human needs by using technology driven solutions in combination with business feasibility. This way design thinking can be used to develop holistic systems that solve multiple problems at ones. The design thinking process exists out of three stages, inspiration, ideation and implementation. Each of these stages exist out of several design activities. To apply design thinking, a certain mindset is needed. One needs to be empathic, use integrative thinking, collaborative, optimistic and experimental to successfully apply design thinking. This mindset can be created under the right conditions. There are several hurdles associated with the introduction of design thinking within corporations. To learn why and how design thinking is applied within corporation, qualitative research was done with design professionals. This research resulted into several advantages that design thinking brings into corporations and strategies to introduce the approach into corporations. Through conversations and interviews with consultants several hurdles and strategies for the introduction of new initiatives, such as design thinking, were identified. Together with the results of the research with design professionals, these findings were translated into a list of requirements for successful design thinking introduction within KPMG. The value of design thinking should be expressed in terms time and money to make its application interesting for consultants. It should be applied within a service that has often been provided by KPMG and that as many consultants as possible are part of in order to succesfully spread it through the organisation. The proposal development process meets all the requirements that are addressed in these lists. Through the application of context generating methods, co-creation session and idea testing, design thinking can potentially safe a lot of time, increase proposal acceptance and improve the experience of clients at the same time. To enable consultants to take advantage of these design thinking characteristics, a toolkit for the proposal development process was designed based upon existing design thinking methods. The toolkit is called KPMG Essence and exists out of four stages that are associated with the design stages. These are 1. Plan, 2. Discover, 3. Ideate and 4. <b>Preview.</b> The first <b>stage</b> exists out of tools that guide consultants in planning a co-creation session and gathering context about a clients problem. The second and third stages exist out of tools that guide a co-creation session with all consultants that are involved with the development of a proposal. The fourth step enables consultants to preview their ideas to clients and gather feedback about the generated ideas. This enables consultants to learn what direction to take within the further development of the proposal and to estimate whether they can offer the client the solutions they look for, before they spend day on writing a proposal in vain. The Discover and Ideate stages were tested on a real life client case together with seven consultants. Consultants were very enthusiastic about the session and gave a the value of the session a 6 out of 7. At the end of the report a plan of implementation and several recommendations are made for further development. KPMG Essence provides a first step in the further application of design thinking within the proposal process. Furthermore it enables all advisory consultants to experience design thinking. As there are many more opportunities to introduce design thinking within KPMG the tool is expected to create awareness among enthusiastic consultants about how design thinking might also improve other services within KPMG.
