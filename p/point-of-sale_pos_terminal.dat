40|$|Part 3 : Security Attacks and DefensesInternational audiencePassive Near Field Communication (NFC) devices, such as {{contactless}} smart cards, use NFC {{to communicate}} with other devices without any physical connection or an internal battery source, deriving power inductively via the radio field generated by the NFC reader device. Today, many <b>Point-of-Sale</b> (<b>PoS)</b> <b>terminals,</b> credit cards, and also mobile devices are NFC-capable and facilitate contactless payments. Although the communication range is typically limited to a few centimeters, NFC attacks exist that exploit such contactless communication channels. This paper focuses on NFC relay attacks and shows that a practical relay attack on public transport <b>PoS</b> <b>terminals,</b> using off-the-shelf mobile devices and hardware, is feasible. Finally, countermeasures are discussed with the main finding that currently the best countermeasure against relay attacks is to physically shield an NFC device...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{advanced}} {{capabilities of the}} chip-enabled, debit and credit cards, fraud in payment transactions has not diminished- it has shifted. The reason lies in {{the lack of a}} trusted communication path between the smartcard and the cardholder. More explicitly, because users have no means of verifying the authenticity of the <b>Point-of-Sales</b> (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminal,</b> they do not know how much they are about to pay nor to whom. We propose to use the camera-enabled mobile phone and a previously shared secret to create a two-way, secure communication channel. Messages from the card are displayed by the <b>POS</b> <b>terminal</b> as visual codes, then captured and decoded by the phone. Messages from the cardholder are computed by the phone and manually typed in as one-time PINs. We extend the EMV payment protocol to provide explicit verification and confirmation of the transaction amount. In the process we also improve cardholder authentication, protect against stolen PIN and cards, and eliminate the <b>POS</b> <b>terminal</b> from the trust chain altogether. The implementation requires minimal software updates and no hardware modifications. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—EMV, {{also known}} as “Chip and PIN”, is the leading system for card {{payments}} worldwide. It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be introduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can execute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires <b>point-of-sale</b> (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminals</b> or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for each transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered two serious problems: a widespread implementation flaw and a deeper, more difficult to fix flaw with the EMV protocol itself. The first flaw is that some EMV implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to supply this nonce. This exposes them to a “pre-play ” attack which is indistinguishable from card cloning {{from the standpoint of}} the logs available to the card-issuing bank, and can be carried ou...|$|R

30|$|Another service {{related to}} risk {{assessment}} is fraud detection. The illegal {{use and abuse}} of borrowers’ information to get financial products is certainly different from the regular credit application scenario. By using heterogeneous data, an individual’s behaviors on different platforms can be jointly considered in fraud detection. Note {{that it is possible}} for individuals to behave differently in one/some dimensions of their life, such as in financial activities, but it is unlikely and difficult for a person to fake all aspects of his/her online life. So using multiple dimensions of data may lead to a more reliable assessment. For example, many financial institutions conduct credit risk assessment using <b>point-of-sales</b> (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminal</b> transactions, which infer revenue. Therefore, some dishonest enterprises make fake credit card transactions through POS to achieve a higher credit rating. However, if POS data and store owners’ personal online activities are combined, 100 Credit found that it was easier to identify fraud activities and reduce credit risk. 100 Credit’s fraud detection approach includes items such as blacklist checking, credit application analysis (on the pattern of making credit applications), and offline activity assessment (such as whether the device, location, etc. are changed frequently).|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of a survey conducted in fall 2005 on the payment habits of Austrian households, comparing its findings with those of similar surveys carried out in 1996 and 2000. The focus is to analyze changes in the use of payment means over time and, on this basis, to assess future trends. As the analysis in the 2005 survey shows, cash continues to dominate the structure of payment transactions, remaining by far the most important means of payment. Cash payments account for 86 % of all direct payment transactions by Austrian households and for 70 % of the total payment value. Compared with the previous surveys, however, the share of cash has contracted noticeably whereas the share of payments at <b>point-of-sale</b> (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminals</b> (via debit card payments) has more than doubled {{in the last five years}} to 11. 5 %. Although credit card payments have posted a slight increase, their share in the total volume still remains very low (1. 3 %). Overall, the results indicate the continuation of cash-card substitution. From a central banking perspective, assessing future trends in cash demand is a key monetary policy issue. The findings of this study suggest that Austrian households’ payment habits will not change abruptly, therefore, any impact on monetary policy can be expected to remain very limited. usage of payment means, demand for money, monetary policy. ...|$|R

Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV was supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a survey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence from ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of proof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest manufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of frauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards cannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be mistaken or complicit. Pre-play attacks may also be carried out by malware in an ATM or <b>POS</b> <b>terminal,</b> or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the acquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled the flaw to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of the EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal analysis, or monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss countermeasures...|$|R
50|$|For example, a <b>point-of-sale</b> <b>terminal</b> (<b>POS</b> <b>terminal,</b> a {{computerized}} cash register) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, {{this list of}} grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a software program or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a calculator, this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per {{day of the week}} by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times. Such information could then become data for further processing, for example as part of a predictive marketing campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a database, which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.|$|R
