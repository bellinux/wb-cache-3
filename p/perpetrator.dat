40|$|Social norms pervade {{almost every}} aspect of social interaction. If they are violated, not only legal institutions, but other members of society as well, punish, i. e., inflict costs on the wrongdoer. Sanctioning occurs even when the punishers {{themselves}} were not harmed directly and even when it is costly for them. There is evidence for intergroup bias in this third-party punishment: third-parties, who share group membership with victims, punish outgroup <b>perpetrators</b> more harshly than ingroup <b>perpetrators.</b> However, it is unknown whether a discriminatory treatment of outgroup <b>perpetrators</b> (outgroup discrimination) or a preferential treatment of ingroup <b>perpetrators</b> (ingroup favoritism) drives this bias. To answer this question, the punishment of outgroup and ingroup <b>perpetrators</b> must be compared to a baseline, i. e., unaffiliated <b>perpetrators.</b> By applying a costly punishment game, we found stronger punishment of outgroup versus unaffiliated <b>perpetrators</b> and weaker punishment of ingroup versus unaffiliated <b>perpetrators.</b> This demonstrates that both ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination drive intergroup bias in third-party punishment of <b>perpetrators</b> that belong to distinct social groups...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how female and male murder <b>perpetrators</b> are {{represented}} in Swedish news journalism. We examined four specific murder cases, with two female and two male <b>perpetrators,</b> and the questions examined were: How are female and male <b>perpetrators</b> represented in news journalism, and what differences and similarities can be found in these representations? We made a critical discourse analysis of 21 news articles, published between the day of the crime and the day of the verdict, from the tabloids Aftonbladet and Expressen. The result shows that female <b>perpetrators</b> are represented as driven by their emotions, either as victims for unrequited love or as evil, jealous women. Male <b>perpetrators,</b> on the contrary, are represented with attributes that are associated with masculinity. The reporting of female <b>perpetrators</b> is also more intense and dramatically structured. Our study also shows similarities between <b>perpetrators</b> regardless of gender. They are represented as cold hearted and deviant, and the news articles are constructed almost as fiction, with sensational writing and dramatic storytelling...|$|R

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{has received}} increasing attention over recent years, {{both in the}} media and in research (Randle & Graham, 2011). IPV can be an attempt to have power and control over a partner in an intimate relationship (Bowen, 2009), and its effects are far reaching (Cho & Wilke, 2010). The majority of research has investigated male <b>perpetrators</b> with the literature on female <b>perpetrators</b> being somewhat limited (Carney, Buttell & Dutton, 2007). Criminal justice agencies have largely been educated about male <b>perpetrators</b> of IPV (Henning & Feder, 2004), and as a result it is unclear whether treatment options for female <b>perpetrators</b> are effective. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of the current treatment options for female <b>perpetrators</b> of IPV and the characteristics of this specialist population. This review revealed that there is not enough research on female <b>perpetrators</b> of IPV. The results indicate the effectiveness of treatment programs for female offenders of IPV is varied at best. It was also revealed that female <b>perpetrators</b> tend to have some similarities to their male counterparts, but there were also differences. Implications for future research and the development of treatment programs for partner aggressive women are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Data {{drawn from}} the Australian Homicide Project were used to examine whether and how {{maternal}} and paternal filicide <b>perpetrators</b> differ in terms of motivations for filicide and childhood and adulthood adversities. In addition, key differences between filicide and non-filicide <b>perpetrators</b> were examined. Data were collected across {{a number of states}} and territories in Australia between 2010 and 2013 through interviews with 231 men and women convicted of murder or manslaughter. Of these participants, 14 had perpetrated filicide. Detailed information on the developmental background of the <b>perpetrators,</b> as well as motives and situational contexts of the homicide incidents, was gathered through the interviews. Findings from the current study reveal some important gender differences among filicide <b>perpetrators.</b> For example, filicidal fathers are more likely to perpetrate accidental filicide, and to report unemployment, alcohol and drug problems and previous engagement in child abuse, while filicidal mothers are more likely to perpetrate altruistic or neglectful filicide, and to report mental health problems. In addition, male filicide <b>perpetrators</b> report a greater number of adversities compared to male non-filicide <b>perpetrators,</b> while female filicide <b>perpetrators</b> display fewer adversities compared to their non-filicide counterparts.

40|$|Abstract: Alcohol use is {{to one of}} {{the most}} of risk factors for {{intimate}} partner violence. The aim of this study was to check the difference of demographic characteristics and type of violence between of the <b>perpetrators</b> with a history of alcohol abuse (A) versus the <b>perpetrators</b> without a history of alcohol abuse (N). Data were obtained from the survey conducted in the office of the Association for Violence Prevention in the city of Lublin, Poland. 400 <b>perpetrators</b> and their victims (400 subjects) were examined. To collect information from victims a specially designed questionnaire was used (VQ). Besides, another questionnaire (PQ) and The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to measure alcohol use in the <b>perpetrators.</b> About 76 % of the <b>perpetrators</b> scored 8 and above (AUDIT). 84. 8 % of the <b>perpetrators</b> with a history of alcohol abuse (A) versus 9. 2 % of the <b>perpetrators</b> without a history of alcohol abuse (N) committed acts of violence after alcohol consumption. The A-perpetrators were more likely to be younger, have lower education and break law, and less likely to have permanent jobs than the N- <b>perpetrators.</b> The significant difference in the type of violence was found: the A-perpetrators were more likely to commit physical violence (78. 2 %) than the N-perpetrators (33. 2 %) and the N-perpetrators were more likely to commit sexual violence (32. 2 %) than A-perpetrators (9. 14 %).
