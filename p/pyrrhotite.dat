5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} {{found on the}} surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3).

Chalcopyrite occupies later fractures which intersect massive arsenopyrite. Sparse quartz veins normally exist in or adjacent to the arsenopyrite-rich zones. Several northeast-trending deformation zones intersect pyroxenite of a mafic sill in northwest Strathy Township. Within these high-strain zones quartz veins normally contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, <b>pyrrhotite</b> with exsolved pentlandite and traces of sphalerite and galena.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the non-oxidative dissolution in acids of {{the iron}} sulphides FeS, Fe-FeS, and Fe. S 1 o were studied {{by the use of}} rotating-disc electrodes of the various compounds. It was found that the rates of dissolution vary by orders of magnitude with changes in surface potential. The dissolution rates depend on non-integral orders of hydrogen-ion concentration, which in turn vary with potential. A mechanism based on the following premises is proposed to explain the kinetics of dissolution {{of the iron}} sulphides. (I) Only an FeS compound that is exactly stoichiometric dissolves in accordance with the accepted theory of ionic charge transfer. (2) Any non-stoichiometric iron-deficient iron sulphides must be reduced to exactly stoichiometric FeS before spontaneous non-oxidative dissolution can occur. The dissolution of Fe. S 1 o and slightly iron-deficient FeS compounds under open-circuit conditions occurs only when an oxidation reaction (usually the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur) can provide the electrons necessary for the production of exactly stoichiometric FeS.

The chamber allows on-line determination of number/mass size distribution of aerosol particles formed by dispersion and subsequent sampling of size-segregated particles on filter media. The samples tested were lignite, power plant flue ash and overburden soil from the Nastup coal strip mine in Northern Bohemia. About 20 mg of the individual samples were pneumatically dispersed by 0. 5 liter of pressurized air inside the chamber under defined temperature and humidity conditions. Then the dynamics of aerosol size distributions was recorded using an aerodynamic particle sizer with a frequency of 5 seconds. The lignite and flue ash contributed most to the mass of atmospheric aerosol particles smaller than 10 / 2. 5 micrometer – PM 10 / PM 2. 5. The re-suspended mass of the samples varied between 0. 001 % for overburden soil and 0. 32 % for mine road soil. The aerosolized lignite and flue ash samples, sampled by a Harvard Impactor and a Personal Cascade Impactor Sampler, revealed that the ash contained higher amounts of fine particles than the lignite and subsequent chemical analyses, carried out using SEM-EDX, reveals that the PM 2. 5 fraction formed by dispersion of the ash samples had the highest content of sulphur, and PM 10 was dominated by Si.

40|$|Analysis of 0. 25 - 5 µm {{reflectance}} spectra {{provided by}} the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) onboard Rosetta orbiter revealed that the surface of 67 P/CG is dark from the near-UV to the IR and is enriched in refractory phases such as organic and opaque components. The broadness {{and complexity of the}} ubiquitous absorption feature around 3. 2 µm suggest a variety of cometary organic constituents. For example, complex hydrocarbons (aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic) can contribute to the feature between 3. 3 and 3. 5 µm and to the low reflectance of the surface in the visible. Here we present the 0. 25 - 5 µm reflectance spectra of well-characterized terrestrial hydrocarbon materials (solid oil bitumens, coals) and discuss their relevance as spectral analogues for a hydrocarbon part of 67 P/CG's complex organics. However, the expected low degree of thermal processing of cometary hydrocarbons (high (H+O+N+S) /C ratios and low carbon aromaticities) suggests high IR reflectance, intense 3. 3 - 3. 5 µm absorption bands and steep red IR slopes that are not observed in the VIRTIS spectra. Fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g., iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) intimately mixed with other surface components are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low intensities of absorption bands in the VIRTIS spectra of the 67 P/CG surface. In particular, iron sulfides are common constituents of cometary dust, "cometary" chondritic IDPs, and efficient darkening agents in primitive carbonaceous chondrites. Their effect on reflectance spectra of an intimate mixture is strongly affected by grain size. We report and discuss the 0. 25 - 5 µm reflectance spectra of iron sulfides (meteoritic troilite and several terrestrial <b>pyrrhotites)</b> ground and sieved to various particle sizes.

Thermally and photometrically corrected reflectance spectra display low geometric albedo, different red VIS and IR spectral slopes, and a complex broad absorption band centered at 3. 2 μm. The low albedo {{and the structure}} of the ubiquitous 3. 2 μm band suggest that the cometary surface is homogeneously enriched in refractory organic materials and darkening phases (Capaccioni et al., 2015). Detailed studies of laboratory analogue materials are necessary to disentangle different interfering factors that influence the appearance of reflectance spectra. Thus, such investigations are indispensable for reliable compositional analysis of remote sensing data. Here we present 0. 25 - 5 μm laboratory reflectance spectra of well-characterized terrestrial hydrocarbon materials (solid oil bitumens, coals) and discuss their relevance as spectral analogues for 67 P/CG refractory organics. In addition, the possible contribution of inorganic matter to spectral characteristics of 67 P/CG should be understood based on laboratory reflectance measurements. Although a wide range of silicate compositions was found in cometary dust and anhydrous IDPs of presumably cometary origin, Mg-rich crystalline mafic minerals are dominant silicate components. A large fraction of silicate grains are Fe-free pyroxenes and olivines (forsterites) that are not found in terrestrial rocks but can be synthesized in order to provide a basis for laboratory studies and comparison with VIRTIS data. We report the results of the synthesis, analyses, and/or spectral reflectance measurements of Fe-free low-Ca pyroxenes (ortho- and clinoenstatites), forsterites, and a high-Ca pyroxene (diopside). Finally, fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g. iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low contrast of the 3. 2 μm absorption band. Therefore, we present and discuss 0. 25 – 5 μm reflectance spectra of pure Fe-sulfides (troilites, <b>pyrrhotites)</b> and their intimate mixtures with organic and inorganic analogue materials. Based on the reported laboratory data, we discuss the ability of iron sulfides to suppress absorption bands of other cometary refractory components and to affect the spectral slopes and reflectance values of the 67 P/CG surface at different wavelengths from the near-UV to the IR.

40|$|Metal sulfide {{thin films}} are {{important}} class of materials which have applications in photovoltaics, microelectronics and displays. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) {{is well known}} method for the deposition of high quality thin films. Very few classes of single source precursors (eg: dithiocarbamates, xanthates) were successful for the deposition of good quality metal sulfide films by MOCVD. This limited choice {{was due to the}} difficulties of finding precursors with suitable physico-chemical properties. Hence, it is important to develop precursors with suitable volatility, solubility and being able to deposit films with little or no contamination. This work describes the synthesis of a series of metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd) complexes of thio- and dithio-biuret ligands, their structural and spectroscopic characterization and thermal decomposition. The complexes were used as single source precursors for the deposition of iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, cadmium and zinc cadmium sulfide thin films by AACVD. The effect of alkyl groups, coordinating atoms, deposition temperatures on phases and morphology of the films were studied. The deposited films were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Remnants of volcanic vents are an important locator for mineral potential in the Temagami belt because they are adjacent to rocks that contain certain types of mineralization. At the Link Lake Formation, good evidence for copper-zinc massive sulfide deposits has been discovered in associated volcanic rocks. Some gold mineralization may also be associated with volcanic vents. Studies of greenstone terranes in the Superior craton have shown that large gold deposits are associated with regional deformation zones. Therefore, the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone, the Link Lake Shear Zone and the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone are obvious high potential areas. A number of scattered pyrite deposits can be found throughout the Northeast Arm Deformation Zone. The high frequency of gold mineralization in and near the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone suggests that this deformation zone may very well also contain gold deposits; at least 11 have been discovered within a [...] length of the deformation zone. The gold deposits are found in many rock types, indicating a stronger gold-bearing system with the potential of larger gold deposits.
