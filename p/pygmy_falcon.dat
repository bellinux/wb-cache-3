50|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon,</b> or African <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> (Polihierax semitorquatus), is a falcon {{that lives}} in eastern and {{southern}} Africa and is the smallest raptor on the continent. As a small falcon, only 19 to 20 cm long, it preys on insects, small reptiles, and small mammals.|$|E

50|$|Research in {{molecular}} genetics has {{also found that}} the white-rumped falcon is more closely related to the Falco falcons than it is to the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon,</b> and indicates two major clades within the extant members of the falcon subfamily, Falconinae. Boyd places the Microhierax falconets with the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> in tribe Polihieracini, and the white-rumped falcon as Neohierax insignis in tribe Falconini.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pygmy</b> <b>falcons</b> {{occasionally}} {{engage in}} polyandrous relationships, {{where there are}} more than two adults living together and tending nestlings. There are four potential reasons for this behaviour: defence, co-operative polyandry, delayed dispersal of offspring, and thermoregulation (warmth). Corroboration for the last is that in winter African <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcons</b> nest further inside the nest of sociable weavers, where there is better insulation.|$|R

50|$|The white-rumped falcon is {{also known}} as white-rumped <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon,</b> white-rumped falconet, Fielden's falconet, or Burmese pigmy falcon.|$|E
50|$|Its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to the African <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> (Polihierax semitorquatus), but the white-rumped falcon is larger and proportionally longer-tailed.|$|E
50|$|Falconinae, in its {{traditional}} classification, contains the falcons, falconets, and pygmy falcons. Depending on the authority, Falconinae may {{also include the}} caracaras and/or the laughing falcon. Boyd further divides the Falconinae into two tribes: Polyhieracini containing the Microhierax falconets, plus Falconini containing the Falco falcons. The <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> and the white-rumped (<b>pygmy)</b> <b>falcon</b> are split into separate genera (Polyhierax and Neohierax), with the former placed into Polyhieracini and the latter into Falconini.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcons,</b> Polihierax, are a genus of {{bird of prey}} in the Falconidae family. It {{contains}} the following species: ...|$|R
5000|$|In Kenya, <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcons</b> nest in {{white-headed buffalo weaver}} nests, and {{the ranges}} of the two birds coincide. [...] In {{southern}} Africa, they are found around red-billed buffalo weaver nests but predominantly nest in the vacant rooms of sociable weaver nests, which are large and multichamberedâ€”even if the sociable weavers still have an active colony in the nest. Despite being bird-eaters and bigger than sociable weavers, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcons</b> largely leave the latter alone, though they do occasionally catch and eat nestlings and even adults.|$|R
50|$|Kalahari tree skinks {{have been}} found to live around trees that contain the large colonial nests of the sociable weaver bird. Their numbers are higher in these areas despite a known {{predator}} of skinks, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon,</b> also nesting in these trees. It is theorized that the increased opportunity for places of refuge outweigh the risk of predation.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> inhabits dry bush. The {{subspecies}} P. s. castanonotus occurs from South Sudan to Somalia {{and south}} to Uganda and Tanzania; P. s. semitorquatus occurs from Angola to northern South Africa. [...] This range {{is estimated to}} have an area of 2.7 million km2, and the total population {{is estimated to be}} between 100,000 and 1 million birds.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922, Harry Kirke Swann {{proposed}} a new monotypic genus for this bird, Neohierax. [...] During the 20th century, most taxonomic authorities retained it in Polyhierax, though Brown and Amadon supported separating the two genera. Phylogenetic analyses of morphological characteristics found the white-rumped falcon to be basal to the Falco clade, but {{separate from the}} clade containing the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> (or African pigmy falcon, Polihierax semitorquatus) and Microhierax (falconets or pigmy falcons).|$|E
5000|$|Adult <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcons</b> {{are white}} below {{and on the}} face, grey above, and females having a {{chestnut}} back.There are white [...] "eye spots" [...] on the nape. Juveniles have a brown back, duller than adult females, with a rufous wash on the breast. The flight feathers of the wings are spotted black and white (more black above, more white below); the tail is barred black and white.|$|R
50|$|The falcons and {{caracaras}} {{are generally}} solitary breeders, although around 10% of species are colonial, {{for example the}} red-footed falcon. They are monogamous, although some caracaras may also employ alloparenting strategies, where younger birds help adults (usually their parents) in raising the next brood of chicks. Nests are generally not built (except by the caracaras), but are co opted from other birds, for example <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcons</b> nest in the nests of weavers, or on the ledges on cliffs. Around 2-4 eggs are laid, and mostly incubated by the female. Incubation times vary from species to species and are correlated with body size, lasting 28 days in smaller species and up to 35 days in larger species. Chicks fledge after 28-49 days, again varying with size.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include red-crested pochards, <b>pygmy</b> cormorants, saker <b>falcons,</b> common coots, common cranes, pale-backed pigeons, pallid scops-owls, Egyptian nightjars, white-winged woodpeckers, brown-necked ravens, great tits, desert larks, streaked scrub-warblers, Sykes's warblers, Asian desert warblers, saxaul sparrows and desert finches.|$|R
50|$|Sociable weavers {{construct}} permanent nests {{on trees}} and other tall objects. These nests {{are the largest}} built by any bird, and are large enough to house over a hundred pairs of birds, containing several generations at a time. The nests are highly structured and provide birds with a more advantageous temperature relative to the outside. The central chambers retain heat and are used for nighttime roosting. The outer rooms are used for daytime shade and maintain temperatures of 7-8 degrees Celsius inside while outside temperatures may range from 16-33 degrees Celsius. Sociable weaver nests are used commensally by several other bird species, most commonly the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon.</b> Whereas this falcon is mostly believed to be an indifferent in most places, instances of predation of sociable weaver nestlings and animosity with the weavers has been reported from some sites in Kimberley. Red-headed finches and rosy-faced lovebird use the nests for breeding while other bird species such as acacia pied barbet, familiar chat and ashy tit may use it for roosting. Larger birds like owls and vultures use the nest as a platform {{to build their own}} nests.|$|E
40|$|In this radio broadcast, Dieter Oschadleus {{discusses}} weavers, from nest-building {{patterns to}} {{the different kinds of}} weavers (masked weaver, widow and bishop birds, and sparrow weavers, scaly-feathered finch, etc.) and their respective habitats. Weaver nest sites also attract a variety of predators (snakes, birds of prey) and obligate nesters such as the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> who do not create their own nests, and thus weaver sites create their own ecologies through provision of shade and concentration of droppings. Citizen scientists can get involved by photographs of weaver sites which are then used to build up a database of weaver sites which provide demographic information very useful to avian zoologists.

40|$|The way {{in which}} animals use habitat can affect their access to key {{resources}} or how they are buffered from environmental variables such as the extreme temperatures of deserts. One strategy of animals is to modify the environment or take advantage of structures constructed by other species. The sociable weaver bird (Philetairus socius) constructs enormous colonial nests in trees. These nests are frequented by Kalahari tree skinks (Trachylepis spilogaster) and the two species coexist over {{a large portion of}} the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. We tested whether skinks were more abundant in trees containing sociable weaver nests and asked whether the physical features of trees were important predictors of skink abundance. We then focused on potential costs of this association by examining the relationship between skink abundance and the presence of a potential predator, the <b>pygmy</b> <b>falcon</b> (Polihierax semitorquatus), which exclusively uses weaver nest colonies for roosting and nesting. Finally, we simulated a predatory threat to determine if skinks assess risk differently if a weaver nest is present. We found a significant positive association between the presence of weaver nests and skink abundance. In the absence of nests, the type of tree did not influence skink abundance. Skinks used weaver nests and were more likely to perch on the nest than the tree. When threatened with predation, skinks preferred to take refuge in nests. Surprisingly, the presence of nesting pygmy falcons in nests did not influence skink abundance, perhaps because of the abundance of nearby refuges within nests, tree crevices, or in debris at the tree base. We suggest that sociable weaver nests provide multiple benefits to skinks including lowered predation risk, thermal refuges and greater prey availability, although this requires experimental testing. In the current era of global climate change, sociable weaver nests may become a crucial resource for skinks seeking refuge as the Kalahari climate warms. [URL]...|$|E
