50|$|The wooden {{wings of}} Ansons flying in Australia {{were found to}} fail at a high rate. The <b>phenolic</b> <b>glue</b> bonds would part, and it was speculated that the problem {{was due to the}} high humidity. In 1962, the Commonwealth Government decided to ground the {{majority}} of wooden-winged aircraft then in operation; amongst those aircraft affected, the Anson and De Havilland Mosquito were included. Of the Ansons, no such aircraft were re-registered as the government had mandated a test that essentially destroyed the wings, thus requiring the fitting of new wings. Most owners decided to voluntarily scrap their aircraft well before this time.|$|E
40|$|Porous ceramic {{materials}} of SiC were synthesized from carbon matrices obtained via pyrolysis of natural cork as precursor. We propose {{a method for}} the fabrication of complex-shaped porous ceramic hardware consisting of separate parts prepared from natural cork. It is demonstrated that {{the thickness of the}} carbon-matrix walls can be increased through their impregnation with Bakelite <b>phenolic</b> <b>glue</b> solution followed by pyrolysis. This decreases the material's porosity and {{can be used as a}} way to modify its mechanical and thermal characteristics. Both the carbon matrices (resulted from the pyrolysis step) and the resultant SiC ceramics are shown to be pseudomorphous to the structure of initial cork. Depending on the synthesis temperature, 3 C-SiC, 6 H-SiC, or a mixture of these polytypes, could be obtained. By varying the mass ratio of initial carbon and silicon components, stoichiometric SiC or SiC:C:Si, SiC:C, and SiC:Si ceramics could be produced. The structure, as well as chemical and phase composition of the prepared materials were studied by means of Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the components costs of the plywood production and the prices paid to the industry and also identified the influence of macroeconomic variables in this evolution. The survey was conducted based on costs and prices between 2005 and 2012. The Price Indexes were calculated with the average of the annual real data deflated for December 2012 and, to assess the relation between the data and the macroeconomic variables, Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient was used. The results indicated an increase of 0. 08 % in real costs of the ureic glue and a reduction of 2. 7 %, 4. 7 % 9. 9 % and 11. 7 % of the input costs: electricity, <b>phenolic</b> <b>glue,</b> sawn wood and diesel, respectively. Nevertheless, this decrease in the inputs costs was much lower than the 26 % decrease in the price received by the plywood industry in the analyzed period. The veneer wood, however, followed the reduction in prices and had a fall of 25 %; in contrast, the workforce had an increase of 63 %. There was a sharper drop in the price of the final product than the unit costs of inputs. The analysis allows a compression of the contribution margin and a large influence of macroeconomic variables in the sale price and in the components of the production cost of manufacturing plywood...|$|E
