50|$|In biostratigraphy, MN 5 {{is one of}} the MN zones used to {{characterize}} the fossil mammal faunas of the Neogene of Europe. It is preceded by MN 4 and followed by MN 6 and is part of the Orleanian age of the middle Miocene. MN 5 starts within magnetostratigraphic chron C5Cr, at 17.0 million years ago, and ends at the start of chron C5Bn.1r, at 15.0 million years ago, although some different correlations have been proposed. The reference locality used to correlate faunas <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>zone</b> is Pontlevoy-Thenay in France; other localities include La Retama in Spain, Castelnau-d'Arbieu in France, and Sandelzhausen in Germany.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a look at}} the effects of Mediterranean imports on Celtic society in the Middle Rhine-Moselle region through an investigation of burial analysis. These imports, known as prestige goods, were used by the Celtic elite to demonstrate their power and authority and can be readily identified in Celtic burial context. During the Late Hallstatt period, elite control of Mediterranean trade networks shifted, resulting in increased trade <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>zone.</b> <b>This</b> increase in trade is identified and is a possible cause of {{the development of a new}} Celtic culture known as the La T?ne. By analyzing the burials that contain Mediterranean imports from the Late Hallstatt period to the La T?ne A period, changes in the burial forms, location and size were identified that confirm this change in society. In addition it was found that elite graves that contained imports within the Late Hallstatt and La T?ne A were significantly different, in terms of burial characteristics, than the elite graves which did not possess imports...|$|R
