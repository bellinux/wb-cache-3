5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of {{delivering}} accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
25|$|Developments {{in early}} {{recording}} technology paralleled that of electronic instruments. The first means of recording and reproducing audio {{was invented in}} the late 19th century with the mechanical <b>phonograph.</b> <b>Record</b> players became a common household item, and by the 1920s composers were using them to play short recordings in performances.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phonograph,</b> <b>record</b> {{player or}} {{gramophone}} is {{an instrument for}} recording, reproducing and playing back sounds. The earliest phonographs used cylinders containing an audio recording engraved on the outside surface which could be reproduced when the cylinder was played. Later, the gramophone record with modulated spiral grooves set atop a rotating turntable. The phonograph was invented in 1877 by Thomas Alva Edison at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. On February 8, 1878, Edison was issued the first patent (U.S. patent #200,521) for the phonograph.|$|E

25|$|After the {{development}} of sound movies, theatre organs remained installed in many theatres to provide live music between features. However, after the 'golden years' of the 1920s and 1930s, many were scrapped or sold to churches, private homes, museums, ice rinks, rollatoriums, and restaurants. In the 1950s, sometimes known as the theatre organ's second golden age, {{the development}} of high-fidelity recording and the LP <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> created new interest in the theatre organ. This period also saw {{the formation of the}} American Theatre Organ Society (ATOS), originally the American Theatre Organ Enthusiasts (ATOE).|$|E
25|$|In {{the upper}} {{left-hand}} corner is {{a drawing of}} the <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> and the stylus carried with it. The stylus is in the correct position to play the record from the beginning. Written around it in binary arithmetic is the correct time of one rotation of the record, 3.6 seconds, expressed in time units of 0.70 billionths of a second, the time period associated with a fundamental transition of the hydrogen atom. The drawing indicates that the record should be played from the outside in. Below this drawing is a side view of the record and stylus, with a binary number giving the time to play {{one side of the}} record – about an hour.|$|E
25|$|The {{playing time}} of a <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> {{depended}} on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because a 10-inch 78rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59.|$|E

25|$|He became {{prisoner}} of war No. 6 held at Stalag Luft III {{in the province of}} Lower Silesia near the town of Sagan (now Żagań in Poland). Hake occupied himself with a vegetable patch during the early stages of his captivity but soon his talents at making and fixing things brought him into the escapers group where he developed a production line system to hand make compass equipment for escapers. He became a forger of Nazi travel documents and recovering from a mild bout of diphtheria in mid-September 1942 he set up the compass factory in his room in the northern end of Block 103 melting pieces of broken Bakelite <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> to be fixed to pieces of razor blade which was duly magnetized. Over 200 were produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{phonograph}} disc {{record was}} the primary medium used for music reproduction {{until late in the}} 20th century. It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and replaced it by the late 1920s. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the late 1980s, digital media, {{in the form of the}} compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the vinyl record left the mainstream in 1991. From the 1990s to the 2010s, records continued to be manufactured and sold on a much smaller scale, and were especially used by disc jockeys (DJs), released by artists in some genres, and listened to by a niche market of audiophiles. The <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century – 9.2 million records were sold in the U.S. in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009. Likewise, in the UK sales have increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Maier {{wrote the}} essay, “The Jeffersonian Ideals of Religious Liberty,” which was later {{published}} by Concordia. During World War II Maier wrote the well-known Wartime Prayer Guide. The sixty-six page booklet measured less than 3 X 5inches, and {{was designed to}} fit in the uniform pockets of those in service. Several hundred thousand of these were printed by Concordia and distributed to those engaged in the war. Ernst Kaufmann Publishers of New York approached the eminent Professor in 1940 to author the text of a new format of home devotional literature. The work consisted of calendar leaflets for {{each day of the}} year with a Scripture text, and a 200-word devotional printed {{on one side and a}} prayer and hymn verse on the other. W.A.M. produced twelve years of this series, entitled Day by Day; with sales eventually rising to 50,000 annually. <b>Phonograph</b> <b>record</b> albums entitled Day by Day were also produced, with Maier meditations and hymns by the Lutheran Hour Chorus. The Lutheran Hour offered a tuition-free Correspondence Course entitled, “The Fundamentals of the Christian Faith.” The materials for this study series were also written by Maier – thirty lessons (with test sheets). In addition, Maier published five paperback Lenten devotionals from 1945- 1949.|$|E

500|$|The first subwoofers were {{developed}} in the 1960s to add bass response to home stereo systems. Subwoofers came into greater popular consciousness in the 1970s {{with the introduction of}} Sensurround in movies such as Earthquake, which produced loud low-frequency sounds through large subwoofers. With the advent of the compact cassette and the compact disc in the 1980s, the easy reproduction of deep and loud bass was no longer limited by the ability of a <b>phonograph</b> <b>record</b> stylus to track a groove, and producers could add more low frequency content to recordings. As well, during the 1990s, DVDs were increasingly recorded with [...] "surround sound" [...] processes that included a low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, which could be heard using the subwoofer in home theater systems. During the 1990s, subwoofers also became increasingly popular in home stereo systems, custom car audio installations, and in PA systems. By the 2000s, subwoofers became almost universal in sound reinforcement systems in nightclubs and concert venues.|$|E
500|$|In July 1942, Walker {{recorded}} [...] "Mean Old World" [...] and [...] "I Got a Break, Baby" [...] {{as one of}} {{the first}} artists for the Los Angeles-based record company. [...] Music writer Bill Dahl described the songs as [...] "the first sign of the T-Bone Walker that blues guitar aficionados know and love, his fluid, elegant riffs and mellow, burnished vocals setting a standard that all future blues guitarists would measure themselves by". [...] Shortly thereafter, his recording career was interrupted by the 1942–44 musicians' strike and the diversion of shellac (a key material used in the manufacture of the then-standard ten-inch 78rpm <b>phonograph</b> <b>record)</b> for the U.S. war effort during World War II. [...] By 1946, Walker signed with producer Ralph Bass and Black & White Records. [...] Although there is conflicting information regarding the recording date, [...] "Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)" [...] was released as a single in November 1947.|$|E

500|$|Writing in Rolling Stone, Ben Gershon {{remarked on}} the aptness of Starr's {{role as the}} {{catalyst}} for a conciliatory musical statement from the ex-Beatles. He highlighted [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{as one of the}} album's three [...] "most wonderful songs" [...] and the track on which [...] "a stunning alchemy occurs" [...] due to the presence of Harrison and Lennon. Although less impressed with Ringo, Alan Betrock of <b>Phonograph</b> <b>Record</b> wrote that the song heralded Lennon's comeback as a writer, saying that after his recent overtly political work, [...] "the gum chewing proverbial tongue-in-cheek rocker has returned with more of the old genius – and Ringo handles the song quite well." [...] In his review for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray found that Lennon's composition [...] "verges uncomfortably on self parody" [...] with Starr left as [...] "the butt of the joke". Amid his criticism of the lyrics, Shaar Murray said that the return of Billy Shears [...] "complete with canned applause" [...] suggested an attempt to [...] "plug the musical holes in the album with large handfuls of charm and nostalgia".|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Ken Barnes, {{describing}} the musical style of Radio City, opens by noting {{as a backdrop}} that the band's debut, #1Record, established it as [...] "one of the leading new American bands working in the mid-Sixties pop and rock vein". Radio City, Barnes finds, has [...] "plenty of shimmering pop delights", although [...] "the opening tune, 'O My Soul,' is a foreboding, sprawling funk affair"; Barnes concludes that [...] "Sometimes they sound like the Byrds, sometimes like the early Who, but usually like their own indescribable selves". Radio City was released in February 1974 and, like #1Record, received excellent reviews. Record World reported, [...] "The sound is stimulating, the musicianship superb, {{and the result is}} tight and rollickingly rhythmic." [...] Billboard judged it [...] "a highly commercial set". Rolling Stones Bud Scoppa, then with <b>Phonograph</b> <b>Record,</b> affirmed, [...] "Alex Chilton has now emerged as a major talent, and he'll be heard from again". Cashbox called it [...] "a collection of excellent material that hopefully will break this deserving band in a big way". But just as #1Record had fallen victim to poor marketing, so too did Radio City. Columbia, now in complete control of the Stax catalog, refused to process it following a disagreement. Without a distributor, sales of Radio City, though far greater than those of #1Record, were minimal at only around 20,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|Too Much Too Soon {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In {{a review of}} the album for Rolling Stone, Dave Marsh hailed the New York Dolls as the leading hard rock band in the US and noted what he felt was Nolan's competent drumming, Johansen's ability to add depth to his characters, and Thunders's innovative guitar playing. Marsh especially praised his playing on [...] "Chatterbox", calling it [...] "a classic", and believed even the most brazen songs sounded successful because Morton's production highlighted the group's more unrefined musical qualities. Writing for Creem magazine, Christgau said the polished sound reproduction preserved the band's raw qualities, {{especially in the case of}} Johansen's vocals and Nolan's drumming, and remarked that Rundgren [...] "should be ashamed—Shadow Morton has gotten more out of the Dolls than they can give us live on any but their best nights." [...] Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times felt Too Much Too Soon was a better-produced album that proved the band to be [...] "the real thing", calling it the best record of derisive punk rock since Exile on Main St. by the Rolling Stones in 1972. In The New Yorker, Ellen Willis wrote that she learned to appreciate Too Much Too Soon more than New York Dolls after seeing the band perform songs from the former album in concert, particularly [...] "Human Being" [...] and [...] "Puss 'n' Boots", while Ron Ross from <b>Phonograph</b> <b>Record</b> magazine said the group's [...] "easy going ironic sensibility" [...] was expressed [...] "far more amusingly and accessibly" [...] here than on their debut album.|$|E
