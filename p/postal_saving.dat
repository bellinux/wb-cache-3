40|$|Beginning in 2000, Japan’s government-owned <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system {{experienced}} a rapid outflow of funds {{as a large}} number of 10 -year fixed-rate <b>Postal</b> <b>Saving</b> Certificates (PSCs) that had been purchased during the period of high interest rates in the early 1990 s were maturing. This paper exploits this episode as a natural experiment to investigate the crowding-out effects of a government-owned depository institution on local economies. The panel data of 47 prefectures from 1995 to 2004 show that the prefectures where local funds were heavily invested in the <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system in the early 1990 s tended to experience a larger shift of funds into private banks from the <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system in the early 2000 s, suggesting that the exogenous maturing of PSCs was in part responsible for the observed shifts in the allocation of local funds. More importantly, the (instrumented) flow of local funds to private banks from the <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system has statistically robust and economically important positive effects on local output and on the number of small firms, but not on the number of large firms. These results provide empirical support for the view that a government-owned depository institution has crowding-out effects on local economies and, in particular, on small firms that rely on local banks in direct competitio...|$|E

40|$|The former Minister Shizuka Kamei, who was {{appointed}} as the Minister for Financial Services during the premiership of Yukio Hatoyama, pushed reforms to change the previous goal of completely privatizing the postal services. The basic policy is that participation {{by the government in}} the businesses of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> will be practically maintained and the ceiling of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> will be raised from 10, 000, 000 yen to 20, 000, 000 yen. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed whether credit associations in a region whose share of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> is larger are being pressured to set higher deposit interest rates due to the presence of <b>postal</b> <b>savings.</b> The results showed that the presence of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> in a region does not pressure credit associations to set higher deposit interest rates, at least under the present conditions. It can thus be concluded that if a set of reforms is carried out which maintains the participation of the government in the Japan Post Bank, the ceiling of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> should be frozen at the present level. ...|$|R

Even in the long recession, the deregulation policy program toward banking and financial services industries could be effected, it is observed. Whether or not discussions concerning the privatization of the Postal Savings would become more popular among certain stake-holders including the household sector, it still should be expected that the more continuous and overall managerial restructuring policy with vigorous strategies to pursue the very efficiency in the business by the Institution could be retained. As the organization of public enterprise, the domain and scope of business would also involve fields of financial services for households and small-sized firms in local areas, while giving some adequate consideration to meet the customer’s satisfaction and R&D that could to some extent cover and develop the loan business, as well as play the role of being public incubator, and also to cope with the case of market failures...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I am {{studying}} the institutional reforms {{that have been}} made in the Japanese financial system, from the beginning of the 80 s but mostly between the years 1990 - 2000, and the privatization of the Japan Post, started in 2007. In the highly regulated Japanese financial system, the government divided the banks and other financial institutions into functional and regional categories such as city banks, regional banks, long-term credit banks, and securities companies etc, and restricted entry of companies of another category. Government banks also competed with private banks. Deposit rates were fixed according to government regulations. The government was giving banks protection and did not allow any bank to go bankrupt. The background of how the financial system regulations have changed is how the economy has developed in Japan during the years. Especially the financial crises of the 90 s accelerated the reforms. The <b>Postal</b> <b>Saving</b> Bank (PSS) within the Japan Post is a government owned bank that offer deposit services to the Japanese public. The deposit balance of the Postal Savings was in 2004 equal to the deposits at Japan’s four largest private banks together. The PSS used its funds to put into a government program called Fiscal Investment and Loan Program, FILP, where it is used to finance different government investment. Because of the PSS being of such large size compared to the privatized banks, the privatization has raised fears that it would dominate the market after becoming private and therefore hurt competition and private banks. My purpose with the study was to describe the Japanese financial system and how deregulation of the financial sector and privatization of the PSS affected competition on the bank market. My main question was how institutional reform in the form of deregulation and privatization has given/will give a more competitive bank market? This was divided into three questions to easier be able to find an answer on the main question. Q 1 : Has the deregulations of the financial sector given a more competitive bank market? Q 2 : Will the privatization of the PSS give a more competitive bank market? Q 3 : Is the FILP system compatible with free competition on the bank market? The findings show that competition increased on the bank market since the government removed all functional and regional barriers on the market, removing artificial barriers of entry for financial companies. The fact that lending margins has decreased after the deregulations is one sign of increased competition. For the privatization of the PSS the pattern is mostly the same. The privatization will mean the abolition of subsidies from the government to the PSS. The large size of the PSS is mainly because of very generous terms on its products which are likely only possible because of government subsidies. After a privatization the deposits at the PSS could be expected to fall making the competition more equal. Also the banks situation is improving. For the FILP, reforms have made it less problematic for competition but the problem of government banks competing with private banks still remain...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the experience of}} the United States <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> system, and (in less detail) that of Japan, with a view to assessing the past and potential future role of <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> in Japan. The immense size of Japan’s <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> system – accounting for one-third of household savings deposits and comprising the largest “bank ” in the world – means that the question of their disposition is central to any discussion of the future of Japan’s financial system as a whole. This study found that demand for <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> deposits is explained, in both countries, mainly by two variables: price (interestdifferentials) and confidence in private banks. Geographical accessibility in rural areas is of less, and diminishing, importance. It is argued that postal banking should be viewed as an alternative to publicly sponsored deposit insurance, as a means to assure households’ access to safe and convenient savings and payment services. This implies that reform discussion should focus on the possibility of restructuring <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> as a “narrow bank”, in such as way as to ensure that services are priced to fully reflect costs and risks incurred...|$|R
