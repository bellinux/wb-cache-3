5|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 1997 general election, the Referendum Party {{spent more}} on <b>press</b> <b>advertising</b> {{than either the}} incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 constituencies, more than any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately, it gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats in the House of Commons. Following the election, psephologists argued {{that the impact of}} the Referendum Party deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members reformed as a Eurosceptic pressure group called the Democracy Movement, and many others joined Eurosceptic political parties like the UK Independence Party and the Democratic Party.|$|E

500|$|Goldsmith's {{party was}} the biggest spender on <b>press</b> <b>advertising</b> in the 1997 campaign; it spent {{three times as much}} as the Conservatives and five times as much as Labour on press adverts. Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his {{financial}} resources to deliver a videocassette to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: [...] "The most important video you'll ever watch", [...] "The story the politicians don't want you to hear", and [...] "If you care about Britain, please pass this video on." [...] The 12-minute film, presented by the former That's Life! presenter Gavin Campbell, warned of a coming [...] "federal European super-state". In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through [...] "eerie sound effects", the image of a blue stain spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film [...] "manifestly reduced that complex issue of Europe to the lowest common denominator, and aimed to shock." ...|$|E

5000|$|With the {{appearance}} of smooth edges in the 19th century, the deckle edge slowly emerged as a status symbol. Many 19th-century <b>presses</b> <b>advertised</b> {{two versions of the}} same book: one with edges trimmed smooth and a higher-priced deckle version, which suggested the book was made with higher-quality paper, or with more refined methods.

[...] modern deckle is produced by a purpose-built machine to give {{the appearance}} of a true deckle edge by cutting a smooth edge into patterns. Many modern readers are unfamiliar with the deckle edge and may see it as a defect; for example, Amazon.com has left notes to buyers that the deckle is not a flaw in the product. A deckle edge is unrelated to the practice of unopened pages, in which a reader must cut open pages with knife.|$|R
