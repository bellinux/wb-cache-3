5|$|Many {{facets of}} the {{interaction}} between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products.</b> Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

The compound was determined in a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product</b> and in spiked human serum by square-wave adsorptivestripping voltammetry (SWAdSV) after accumulation at the electrode surface, under batch conditions. Because the presence of dissolved oxygen did not interfere significantly with the analysis, it was also possible to determine FVX in the <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product</b> by use of a flow-injection analysis (FIA) system with SWAdSV detection. The methods developed were validated and successfully applied to the quantification of FVX in a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product.</b> Recoveries between 76 and 89 % were obtained in serum analysis. The FIA– SWAdSV method enabled analysis of up to 120 samples per hour at reduced cost, implying the possibility of competing with the chromatographic methods usually used for this analysis...|$|R
