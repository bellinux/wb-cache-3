40|$|The strain {{field in}} the silicon channel of a <b>metal-oxide-semiconductor</b> <b>transistor</b> with silicon-carbon alloy source and drain {{stressors}} was evaluated using the commercial process simulator FLOOPS-ISE (TM). The physical origin of the strain components in the transistor channel region was explained. The magnitude and distribution of the strain components, and their dependence on device design parameters such as the spacing L-G between the silicon-carbon alloy stressors, the carbon mole fraction in the stressors; and stressor depth were investigated. Reducing the stressor spacing L-G or increasing the carbon mole fraction in the stressors and stressor depth increases {{the magnitude of the}} vertical compressive stress and the lateral tensile stress in the portion of the N channel region where the inversion charge resides.
