25|$|Due to the Transport Route Planning Acceleration Act (Verkehrswegeplanungsbeschleunigungsgesetz) adopted {{specifically}} for the new transport routes in the new federal states, {{it was possible to}} put the first planning approval decision for the Erfurt–Arnstadt section into effect at the end of 1994. The planning approval decisions for the new routes were adopted between 24May 1995 and 15April 1997. In the middle of 1996, 75kilometres of the new line and 25kilometres of the rail power line were approved. The approvals were finalised in 1998 apart from the Erfurtstadt and Bad Staffelstein sections. In the middle of 2007, the approvals were finalised for all sections. The planning approval decision for the southern section of the railway power line from the 19December 1995 lost its effect because the construction work had not commenced within the limited <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity.</b> As a result, a plan for the southern section of the railway power line to the Roth substation was reapplied for in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{drivers who}} are {{required}} {{to compete in the}} FIA Formula One World Championship under the nationality of their passport, the FIA's International Sporting Code states that teams competing in the FIA Formula One World Championship shall compete under the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their FIA racing licence. On the basis of this regulation, despite the fact that most current teams are based in the UK, this country is officially represented in Formula One only by teams holding a racing licence issued by the British National Sporting Authority. Teams take the nationality of their parent National Automobile Club that issued their licence for the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> of that licence and the change of the nationality is allowed. Several teams changed their nationality during their competition in Formula One (e.g. Shadow in 1976 from American to British, Benetton in 1996 from British to Italian, Renault in 2011 from French to British).

2500|$|Passengers {{not already}} in {{possession}} of a valid fare when boarding are required to purchase tickets from ticket vending machines on board each streetcar. Each vehicle also carries a ticket validator machine, for stamping [...] "unvalidated" [...] TriMet tickets purchased in advance. TriMet and Portland Streetcar have agreed to honor one another's fares, which means that TriMet passes, tickets and bus transfer receipts are accepted on the streetcar, and tickets purchased or validated on a streetcar are valid for travel on TriMet services (bus, MAX or WES Commuter Rail). To facilitate this, the ticket machines on board the streetcars and at streetcar stops sell TriMet tickets – covering both the streetcar fare and any TriMet rides the purchaser makes within the ticket's <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> (2 hours or all day) – as well as streetcar-only tickets. For the same reason, prior to September 2012, the streetcar ticket machines offered all-zone (three-zone) and two-zone tickets, {{despite the fact that the}} streetcar system was located entirely within TriMet's Zone 1. TriMet tickets and transfers were valid all-day on the streetcar prior to that change, which also coincided with TriMet's elimination of the Free Rail Zone (Fareless Square). Since September 1, 2012, TriMet and Portland Streetcar tickets have an identical <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity,</b> of two hours (except for all-day tickets).|$|E

The objective of the thesis is to describe individual periods in the development of public administration and to mutually compare them. In relation to historical circumstances the thesis is divided into the following parts: the First Czechoslovak Republic, the Second Czechoslovak Republic, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, postwar years (1945 - 1948) and the communist period structured based on <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> individual Czechoslovak constitutions (1948 - 1960, 1960 - 1968 and 1968 - 1989). Each chapter is further divided into shorter subchapters that e. g. split the periods into shorter sections and deal with public administration in individual parts of the country or with specific fields of administration. The thesis also contains maps documenting territorial division of Czechoslovakia in the individual periods...|$|R
30|$|Last but not least, {{apart from}} {{substitution}} over time, which we directly addressed {{by looking at}} periods II and IV, {{there may be other}} reactions that counteracted the effectiveness of the scheme. The most likely is that the incentives could have induced employers to favor workers from eligible demographic groups and thus reduce conversions for the non-eligible (men over 30). We provide evidence regarding this potential channel of substitution by looking at the change in the conversion rate for non-eligible workers during the same periods in 2012 and the previous year. Furthermore, {{as a consequence of the}} policy, employers could have indirectly subsidized direct hires with permanent contracts by hiring workers with fixed-term contracts and converting them after a few days. Similarly, they could have favored conversions with respect to direct hires. We also show what happens during the <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity,</b> and relatively to 2011, to the number of jobs starting with permanent contracts.|$|R

2500|$|The {{modalities}} of how electoral {{registration is}} conducted can also affect turnout. For example, until [...] "rolling registration" [...] {{was introduced in}} the United Kingdom, there was no possibility of the electoral register being updated during its currency, or even amending genuine mistakes after a certain cut off date. The register was compiled in October, and would come into force the next February, and would remain valid until the next January. The electoral register would become progressively more out of date during its <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity,</b> as electors moved or died (also people studying or working away from home often had difficulty voting). This meant that elections taking place later in the year tended to have lower turnouts than those earlier in the year. The introduction of rolling registration where the register is updated monthly has reduced but not entirely eliminated this issue since the process of amending the register is not automatic, and some individuals do not join the electoral register until the annual October compilation process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the 13 th century, a new Chinese astronomical {{calculation}} {{was just}} {{put to use}} {{and it was almost}} entirely included in the calendar of Shoushi (formulated by Guo Shou-jing and his colleagues, epoch of AD 1281, adopted from AD 1281 − 1644). This calendar {{was one of the most}} famous and accurate in the history of China. The perfectly systematic theoretical models at that time had been developed for thousands of years, such as those for solar and lunar motions. In this paper, these models and their accuracy within their <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> are inferred. The results are also compared with contemporary astronomy. Key words: Ephemerides – history and philosophy of astronomy the distributions of their mean values. The average value of the differences is 0. 9 minute of time and the mean of the absolute difference is 21. 0 minutes. Among all lunar eclipses, the average is 0. 8 minute and the absolute is 19. 4 minutes. For solar eclipses, there are only 114 ones computed by us that corresponded to modern calculations. The average is- 0. 6 minute and the absolute is 23. 9 minutes. Because ancient calendars are also thought of as one kind of original material that includes a great number of actual ancient celestial records, these observations could help to identify the reality of historical events, to recover even some omitted data. If we could recover these records (usually long before the publishing <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the Shoushi calendar), the data would be very useful to contemporary studies especially of the secular variation of the earth’s rotation (Li and Zhang 1997 b). 1...|$|R
