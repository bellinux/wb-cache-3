40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{characterize}} membrane-solute interactions using artificial membranes in immobilized liposome chromatography or capillary electrophoresis. The partitioning of a solute into a cell membrane is an essential step in diffusion across the membrane. It is a valid parameter in drug research and {{can be linked to}} the permeability as well as the absorption of drugs. Immobilized liposome chromatography was also used to <b>study</b> <b>partitioning</b> of lignin precursor models. Lignin precursors are synthesized within plant cells and need to pass the membrane to be incorporated into lignin in the cell wall. In immobilized liposome chromatography, liposomes or lipid bilayer disks were immobilized in gel beads and the partitioning of solutes was determined. Capillary electrophoresis using disks as a pseudostationary phase was introduced as a new approach in drug <b>partitioning</b> <b>studies.</b> In addition, octanol/water partitioning was used to determine the hydrophobicity of the lignin precursor models. Electrostatic interactions occurred between bilayers and charged drugs, whereas neutral drugs were less affected. However, neutral lignin precursor models exhibited polar interactions. Moreover, upon changing the buffer ionic strength or the buffer ions, the interactions between charged drugs and neutral liposomes were affected. Hydrophobic interactions were also revealed by including a fatty acid or a neutral detergent into the bilayer or by using a buffer with a high salt concentration. The bilayer manipulation had only a moderate effect on drug partitioning, but the high salt concentration had a large impact on partitioning of lignin precursor models. Upon comparing the partitioning into liposomes and disks, the latter showed a more pronounced partitioning due to the larger fraction of lipids readily available for interaction. Finally, bilayer disk capillary electrophoresis was successfully introduced for <b>partitioning</b> <b>studies</b> of charged drugs.

After evaluating the pharmacological response of these new molecules, the following critical stage is to investigate their in vitro permeability.

The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of ion-pairing on the permeability profile of a model drug: indomethacin (IND) to understand the mechanism behind the permeability improvement across Caco- 2 monolayers. Arginine and lysine formed ion-pairs with IND at various molar ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 4 and 1 : 8 as reflected by the double reciprocal graphs. The partitioning capacities of the IND were evaluated using octanol/water <b>partitioning</b> <b>studies</b> and the apparent permeabilities (P app) were measured across Caco- 2 monolayers for the different formulations. <b>Partitioning</b> <b>studies</b> reflected the high hydrophobicity of IND (Log P = 3) which dropped upon increasing the concentrations of arginine/lysine in the ion pairs. Nevertheless, the prepared ion pairs improved IND permeability especially after 60 min of the start of the experiment.

The multilevel algorithm attempts to balance load, maximize concurrency, and reduce inter-processor communication in three phases to improve performance. The experimental results obtained from our benchmarks indicate that the multilevel algorithm yields better partitions than other partitioning algorithms included in the study. ...|$|R
40|$|Experimental <b>partitioning</b> <b>studies</b> are {{reported}} of K, U, and Th between silicate and FeFeS liquids designed {{to test the}} proposal that actinide partitioning into sulfide liquids is more important then K partitioning in the radioactive heating of planetary cores. For a basaltic liquid at 1450 C and 1. 5 GPa, U partitioning into FeFeS liquids is five times greater than K partitioning. A typical value for the liquid partition coefficient for U from a granitic silicate liquid at one atmosphere at 1150 C and low fO 2 is about 0. 02; the coefficient for Th is similar. At low fO 2 and higher temperature, experiments with basaltic liquids produce strong Ca and U partitioning into the sulfide liquid with U coefficient greater than one. The Th coefficient is less strongly affected...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} by Riečan and Markechová (Fuzzy Sets Syst. 96, 1998), some fuzzy {{modifications}} of Shannon’s and Kolmogorov-Sinai’s entropy were studied {{and the general}} scheme involving the presented models was introduced. Our aim in this contribution is to provide analogies of these results for {{the case of the}} logical entropy. We define the logical entropy and logical mutual information of finite partitions on the appropriate algebraic structure and prove basic properties of these measures. It is shown that, as a special case, we obtain the logical entropy of fuzzy <b>partitions</b> <b>studied</b> by Markechová and Riečan (Entropy 18, 2016). Finally, using the suggested concept of entropy of partitions we define the logical entropy of a dynamical system and prove that it is the same for two dynamical systems that are isomorphic...|$|R
