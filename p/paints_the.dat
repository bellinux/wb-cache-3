5|$|The {{civil war}} years of Matilda's life {{have been the}} subject of {{historical}} fiction. Matilda, Stephen and their supporters feature in Ellis Peters's historical detective series about Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler. Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's decision to entitle his 1855 battle poem Maud.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E

25|$|Maurice Raynal, a preeminent art critic, {{played a}} major role in {{defending}} Cubism in Kantian terms. In 1912 he replaced Apollinaire at L'Intransigeant and simultaneously was hired by Louis Vauxcelles to write in Gil Blas. In his forward for this exhibition⎯his first writing on Cubism⎯Raynal <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> artistic avant-garde as parallel to scientists whose 'very data will turn the common understanding and ordinary sensibilities upside down'. Science and visual arts evolved together leading to 'a more positivistic age'. Artists, just as scientists, were able to capture the 'essence of things'. The goal or art, writes Raynal, is not the 'slavish imitation of nature', but its 'interpretation in accordance with the artist's intellectual capacity'.|$|E
25|$|In {{most modern}} {{operating}} systems (OSs), {{a large body}} of reusable code is provided to simplify the programmer's job. This code is typically provided as a set of dynamically loadable libraries that applications can call at runtime. Because the Java platform is not dependent on any specific operating system, applications cannot rely on any of the pre-existing OS libraries. Instead, the Java platform provides a comprehensive set of its own standard class libraries containing many of the same reusable functions commonly found in modern operating systems. Most of the system library is also written in Java. For instance, the Swing library <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> user interface and handles the events itself, eliminating many subtle differences between how different platforms handle components.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, none of {{the names}} of the artists have survived, so modern {{scholars}} have been obliged to give the recognizable artistic hands and workshops nicknames based on the subject matter of their works, museums which possess the works, or individuals who have distinguished the works from others.

25|$|Ruiz’s {{work does}} focus on race issues, {{considering}} she calls for “an essential Latin ‘difference,’ believing Latinos to be culturally and morally superior,” but her work also encompasses political issues. She warns against U.S. expansionism and corporate monopolies. For instance, in both her novels, she feminizes the male characters in order “to depict the subordinated status of those ‘handicapped’ by societal constraints”. These male characters are hurt by forces of decay and corruption. For example, in Squatter and the Don, the Californio men are victim to both illnesses and land loss {{because of the}} government. This novel centers on {{the corruption of the}} United States government due to the combination of capitalism with democracy. Ruiz <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> enemy here not to be the squatters, but the railroad barons. Even the Alamars and the Darrells, who in the end foster true love and marriage despite race, fall victim to the railroad barons.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the Dragon-Blooded in Creation make up the ruling class of the Realm, currently the most powerful empire in Creation. The state-sanctioned faith known as the Immaculate Order <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> Solar and Lunar Exalted as dangerous Anathema who will bring ruin to the world if allowed to exist. Because of this, the Realm organizes the Wyld Hunt, which actively seeks out newly Exalted Celestials (Solars and Lunars, although they also hunt Abyssals and fair folk as well) and overwhelms them before they can master their new powers. This practice, which had effectively kept the Solars from rising to power again {{since the end of}} the First Age, has faltered in the recent Exalted timeline because of the disappearance of the Scarlet Empress and the stability and leadership that she was able to bring to the Dragon-Blooded. The power struggle by the great Dragon-Blooded houses to fill the resulting power vacuum has destabilized the Realm and allowed the Solar Exalted to escape the purges of the Wyld Hunt and rise in Creation once more.|$|E

500|$|The {{most recent}} film adaptation, {{directed}} by Venezuelan Rómulo Guardia Granier and produced by RCTV (Radio Caracas Televisión Internacional), {{was released in}} November 2007 and is the first film produced by RCTV in more than twentyyears.

500|$|After the {{collapse}} of his businesses, Balzac traveled to Brittany and stayed with the De Pommereul family outside Fougères. There he drew inspiration for Les Chouans (1829), a tale of love gone wrong amid the Chouan royalist forces. Although Balzac was {{a supporter of the}} Crown, Balzac <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> counter-revolutionaries in a sympathetic light—even though they are the center of the book's most brutal scenes. This was the first book Balzac released under his own name, and it gave him what one critic called [...] "passage into the Promised Land". It established him as an author of note (even if its historical fiction-genre imitates that of Sir Walter Scott) and provided him with a name outside his past pseudonyms.|$|E
500|$|Critical opinion {{has also}} noted that both parts of the story arc offer an {{alternative}} explanation for {{the events of the}} series so far, a [...] "less romantic" [...] outcome that <b>paints</b> <b>the</b> ongoing plot as an elaborate hoax to defer attention from the government's experiments, both military and medical. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff feels that such an explanation would [...] "speak more to the sadness {{at the core of the}} X-Files to have Mulder find his answers and be forced to accept they weren't what he was looking for", comparing such a realization to the hero of Don Quixote. This [...] "hoax" [...] plot device would later be revisited in both the fourth season finale [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and the fifth season's opening two-part episodes [...] "Redux and Redux II", although to a much lesser degree of effectiveness.|$|E
