40|$|Bosnia and Herzegovina is a <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> for EU membership. The Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) between Bosnia and the EU {{was signed}} in June 2008. Much of today's Bosnia {{is a product of}} IC and its {{decision}} making. The discussion is concerned with to what extent the EU has achieved to bring Bosnia closer to the EU negotiation table. For the purpose of the thesis, I have chosen two indicators to measure the effect of the integration; Office of the High Representative/EU Specuial Representative and the formal accession agreement between the EU and Bosnia, SAA. Bosnia represents great challenge for the EU. Constitutional elements established by the Dayton Peace Agreement have been frequently challenged by key political leaders and political rhetoric. This has led to a stagnation of the EU related forms. To summarize the findings, one must conclude {{that when it comes to}} making an environment which assists EU integration, the EU and the international community has failed to do so, despite the large efforts. The lack of positive results should give an enforced European political engagement. The EU is necessary but not sufficient. Bosnia is a test for the EU just as the EU is a test for Bosnia...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{financial}} stability challenges in countries preparing for EU membership, i. e. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo*, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. The paper has been prepared by an expert group of staff from the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) in which experts from EU candidate and <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> central banks also participated. The paper finds that near-term challenges to {{financial stability}} primarily relate to credit risks from the generally weak economic dynamics {{in combination with}} already high non-performing loan burdens in many banking systems, especially in the Western Balkans. In the medium-term, challenges to financial stability stem from indirect market risks to banks related to foreign currency lending as well as lingering exposures to funding risks, with Western Balkan economies again appearing as relatively more vulnerable. Looking further ahead, {{the paper highlights that}} the magnitude of the challenge to reach a 2 ̆ 018 new banking normal 2 ̆ 019 for banking systems in these countries appears to remain sizeable, while noting that the establishment of adequate home-host cooperation channels would be important to help maximise the potential benefits to third parties stemming from centralised banking supervision under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{designing}} country {{health care}} programs {{to achieve the}} goals of the Alma Alta declaration of 'Health for All', developing countries have been confronted with the problem of increased health care needs and decreased available resources. Health economists have proferred several possible solutions to this fiscal shortfall, including cost-recovery measures through the imposition of user fees for curative services at government health facilities. Health care providers have been noticeably absent from discussions of the many possible implications of these fees; consequently, resultant programs and policies may be economically sound but may fail to place a sufficient emphasis on features designed to maintain and improve the health of the population. In the present paper we examine the possible impact of user fees on the health of individuals residing in Bangladesh, one <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> for user fees. We note evidence that the existing government health care system appears already to be providing care to two of the most medically vulnerable groups in Bangladesh, the poor and women, and provide evidence that such fees may seriously interfere with maintaining this patient profile. We discuss the significant public health role that curative care provides for the individuals, their families and the wider community. We suggest that additional questions should be asked by health care providers, anthropologists and economists prior to institution of user fees in the government system and that such measures should first be introduced in an experimental format with a rigorous and comprehensive impact evaluation. user fees Bangladesh health care delivery cost-recovery...|$|E

40|$|The EU <b>candidate</b> and <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> {{have made}} {{considerable}} progress in economic transition and {{integration into the}} world economy within less than two decades. Nevertheless, gaps in terms of income per capita relative to the euro area remain large. This suggests that the challenges of real convergence will remain relevant for the region even in the medium and long term. This paper therefore focuses on real convergence and its determinants in the <b>candidate</b> and <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>countries.</b> The analysis reveals that total factor productivity growth has been the main driver of convergence, followed by capital deepening, whereas labour has contributed only marginally to economic growth. There is evidence of conditional convergence in the transition countries of central, eastern and south-eastern Europe. More specifi cally, controlling {{for the quality of}} institutions, the extent of market reforms and macroeconomic policies, there is a significant and negative link between the initial level of GDP and subsequent growth. Labour productivity has improved in most countries, while employment and participation rates have been falling. Structural changes have resulted in, at least temporarily, increasing labour market mismatches. Investment rates have been rising rapidly in recent years, and foreign direct investment has been found to {{have a positive impact on}} total investment. Investment in human capital is still at a relatively low level compared with the euro area average. Thus, in order to sustain the positive developments observed in the past, further improvements are needed in terms of labour productivity and utilisation, as well as in terms of physical and human capital accumulation.

40|$|Study on the {{adjustment}} capacity to shocks of EU <b>candidate</b> and <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>countries</b> of the Western Balkans, {{with a focus}} on labour markets, and background studies on several countries of the region. The main question addressed in this study is the performance of the labour markets in the Western Balkans; to find out whether they can deliver growth of employment and decline of unemployment in the medium run and whether they can withstand short-term shocks due to changes in demand or supply. The study finds that there is an important case for improving {{the rule of law and}} the quality of public services in general in the fight against very low participation and employment rates in the region, as well as very high unemployment. Wages, with some exceptions in specific sectors, do not seem to be mis-aligned with respect to productivity developments. There is some indication of possible positive effects from adjusting employment protection legislation, especially for women. The study also identifies an important role for income policies in some of the countries as an important complement to labour market policies.

40|$|This {{edition of}} Network Industries Quarterly aims to provide {{insights}} into the general legal framework for liberalization and regulation of public utilities, notably communal services, in countries of ex-Yugoslavia. Among ex-Yugoslav countries, two are European Union (EU) Member States (Slovenia and Croatia), two {{are in the process}} of accession negotiations (Montenegro, Serbia), one is a candidate country (Macedonia) and one represents a <b>potential</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>country</b> (Bosnia and Herzegovina). After World War II, ex-Yugoslavia was a unique example of self-management, and a specific system of governance and societal ownership of companies, including public utilities. In the early 1990 s, Yugoslav disintegration and democratization coincided with economic transformation from a socialist market economy to a market economy. However, legacies of the past economic system are still present in some aspects, albeit in some countries more than others, and influence the process of liberalization of public utilities. This process was urged by joining the EU or is still urged by EU accession requirements. Most of the impetus for liberalization comes as a response to low investments in infrastructure, as most of these countries have reached high debt levels and therefore a private finance infrastructure seems to be a solution. The market liberalization agenda began to come to the front, and regulatory reform urged creation of independent regulatory agencies for state-wide public utilities such as electricity and gas markets. On the other side, municipal (communal) services are mainly provided by local authorities and public operators. Liberalization agenda in many of these countries presupposes privatization of public undertakings, contracting out or alternatives to privatization such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and concessions, with special attention given to the general legal framework for PPPs and concessions in these countries. The following are some of the issues the country contributions have strived to address: • The scope and characteristics of public undertakings providing utilities and the character of public utilities owned or regulated by local self-government units; • PPPs and concessions as an “alternative” to full privatization: basic overview of active projects and reference to the legal and institutional framework for PPPs and concessions; • Liberalization agenda and the main issues in regulating local public utilities (communal services); • The character of regulatory powers and challenges posed to municipalities in regulating communal services. Although all country contributions have a similar structure, the level of detail may differ, notably due to the existing level of development of the normative and institutional framework in a respective country and different experiences in private sector involvement. After presenting the institutional and normative setting, in the concluding remarks authors have identified the main pitfalls and prospects for change. Although differences exist, it seems that the volatile political situation in many countries of ex-Yugoslavia and the fragile political will to perform necessary reforms of public (including local) administration and public sector of the economy are the most important deficiencies. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust legal and regulatory frameworks and create a stable economic environment. Local administration and business communities have to understand the concept of PPPs and private finance initiatives, while policymakers and local authorities must develop adequate plans and facilitatory structures for potential PPP projects, including capacities to initiate projects and perform cost-benefit analysis for the potential projects.
