The <b>Pulse</b> <b>Sensor,</b> a low-cost photoplethysmograph, measures green light reflection in the finger and generates output, which is indicative of blood flow and can be read by the low-cost Arduino UNO™. The <b>Pulse</b> <b>Sensor</b> code was modified to increase the sampling frequency and to capture the data in a file, which is subsequently used for waveform analysis using programs written in the R system. Waveforms were obtained using the <b>Pulse</b> <b>Sensor</b> during two 30 -s periods of seated rest, in each of 44 participants, who were between the ages of 20 and 80 years. For each cardiac cycle, the first four derivatives of the waveform were calculated and low-pass filtered by convolution before every differentiation step. The program was written to extract 19 features from the pulse waveform and its derivatives. These features were selected from those that have been reported to relate to the physiopathology of hemodynamics. Results indicate that subtle features of the pulse waveform can be calculated from the fourth derivative. Feature misidentification occurred in cases of saturation or low voltage and resulted in outliers; therefore, trimmed means of the features were calculated by automatically discarding the outliers. There was a high efficiency of extraction for most features. Significant relationships were found between several of the features and age, and systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure, suggesting that these features might be employed to predict arterial compliance. Further improvements in experimental design could lead to a more detailed evaluation of the <b>Pulse</b> <b>Sensor</b> with respect to its capability to predict factors related to arterial compliance...|$|E

40|$|Latent {{heat flux}} {{associated}} with soil water evaporation connects the surface water balance with the surface energy balance. Soil water evaporation and soil carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes both involve soil gas transport processes and properties, and both impact the soil environment and physical, chemical, and biological processes {{occurring in the}} soil. Accurate and dynamic measurements of soil water evaporation and soil CO 2 fluxes enhance the understanding of water, energy, and carbon partitioning at the soil-atmosphere interface and the mechanisms of mass and energy movement in the soil. Most previous work focused on measurements made above the soil surface, and quantitative determinations of in situ water evaporation and carbon dioxide fluxes within soil profile were absent. The objectives of this dissertation were to accurately determine transient soil water evaporation and soil CO 2 fluxes with depth in bare soil and in different management zones of a corn field and to evaluate in situ measurement techniques. Three-needle heat <b>pulse</b> <b>sensors</b> were used to measure subsurface soil water evaporation at depths of 3 mm and below in a bare field. The daily evaporation estimated from the heat pulse method agreed well with the daily evaporation estimated from Bowen ratio and micro-lysimeter methods. The results showed that heat <b>pulse</b> <b>sensors</b> alone could accurately determine subsurface soil water evaporation with time and depth, and surface and subsurface evaporation could be accurately determined with heat pulse measurements combined with Bowen ratio measurements in a bare field. Newly designed 11 -needle heat <b>pulse</b> <b>sensors</b> were used at the following locations within a corn field: within-row (ROW), between-rows with roots (BR), and between-rows without roots (BRNR). The findings showed that heat <b>pulse</b> <b>sensors</b> measured the dynamic soil water evaporation at the three locations. The daily heat pulse evaporation estimates agreed well with micro-lysimeter measurements of daily soil water evaporation at ROW and BR in the corn field. In addition to heat pulse measurements for soil water evaporation, plant transpiration and evapotranspiration (ET) were measured using stem flow gauges and an eddy covariance system in the corn field. The evapotranspiration estimated from the sum of heat pulse evaporation and stem flow transpiration (E+T), eddy covariance ET, and potential evapotranspiration, ET 0, estimated from the Penman-Monteith equation had similar trends. ET 0 was larger than the individually measured E+T and eddy covariance ET. The individually measured E+T and ET 0 had similar values but eddy covariance measurements underestimated ET. Bare soil CO 2 fluxes were determined using a concentration gradient method with in situ measured soil CO 2 concentrations and model estimated gas coefficients during natural wetting and drying periods. Results showed that CO 2 fluxes decreased with depth {{and most of the}} CO 2 was produced at shallow soil depths. CO 2 fluxes decreased with depth from 0 to 90 mm, and kept stable at depths of 90 to 200 mm. The gradient method determined CO 2 fluxes agreed well with surface closed-chamber measured CO 2 fluxes. For 10 out of 12 days the daily mean gradient CO 2 flux values were within the ranges of the closed-chamber CO 2 fluxes values during a soil drying period. The conclusions of the dissertation were that the heat <b>pulse</b> <b>sensors</b> were able to accurately determine soil water evaporation with time and depth in a bare field and in different soil management zones in a corn field. Soil CO 2 fluxes and soil CO 2 production rates with depth in a bare field were accurately determined using a concentration gradient method with in situ CO 2 concentration profiles. These simultaneous soil water evaporation and soil CO 2 flux measurements could serve as a foundation for testing the numerical models of coupled heat, water, and gas transfer in soil, and could enhance further understanding of the complex soil system, and could guide the management of soil properties and processes...|$|R

Due to stochastic nature of radiation simulation of the sensors are made using random bit sequence generator implemented with linear feedback shift registers and additional correcting circuits. Simulations of the <b>pulse</b> ionizing <b>sensors</b> are further used for testing the descreet-floating algorithm and for calculation the dose rate of ionizing radiation. PC using serial RS 232 communication does analyses of the algorithm. Hardware and software realization is presented which measure the dose rate in real time. The system can also be supplied with real pulse detector unit...|$|R
