500|$|One {{negative}} {{review was}} written by Margaret McFadden-Gerber in Magill's Literary Annual, who found the book disappointing and felt that it lacked the power and introspection of Angelou's previous books. At least one reviewer expresses disappointment that Angelou did not use her status to effect any political change in Singin' and Swingin'. Critic Lyman B. Hagen responds to this criticism by stating that Angelou's status during the events she describes in this autobiography did not lend itself {{to that kind of}} advocacy, and that as a person, Angelou had not evolved into the advocate that she would become later in her life. Reviewer John McWhorter finds many of the events Angelou describes throughout all of her autobiographies incoherent and confusing, and in need of further explanation as to her motives and reasons for her behavior. For example, McWhorter suggests that Angelou does a <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> explaining her reasons for her marriage to Tosh Angelos, as well as their divorce.

Eurogamer and Ars Technica disagreed on the virtues of having the Spectrum emulator replicate the graphical glitches of the original console. Jaz Rignall of USgamer appreciated the added option to save game progress at any time for the Spectrum classics, and wrote that the collection will remind players how difficult games used to be.|$|E
30|$|The {{levels of}} total carbon in VFA {{resulting}} from MV or NR additions were nearly identical. Of interest is that MV did a significantly <b>poorer</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> inhibiting methanogenesis and facilitating chain elongation of acetate. Although Bauchop (1967) {{demonstrated that the}} related dye benzyl viologen decreased methanogenesis by mixed ruminal microbes in vitro, the effects on the amounts and distribution of other end products were not reported. The capability of MV {{to serve as an}} electron carrier for hydrogenase and increase the availability of NADH for VFA chain elongation was observed by Peguin et al. (1994) who showed MV to increase butyrate concentrations to 0.65  mol (mol glucose)− 1 in pure cultures of the non-ruminal solventogenic bacterium, Clostridium acetobutylicum. In our experiments, the amount of butyrate was numerically lowered by MV, but the caproate concentration rose to over three times that of the control. This confirms not only that MV is capable of generating butyrate at the expense of shorter products, but also that a second chain elongation to caproate took place despite the short run times, although to relatively modest concentrations.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of the ultraviolet emission lines of cataclysmic variables (CVs) based on ≈ 430 ultraviolet spectra of 20 sources extracted from the International Ultraviolet Explorer Uniform Low Dispersion Archive. These spectra are {{used to measure the}} emission line fluxes of N V, Si IV, C IV, and He II and to construct diagnostic flux ratio diagrams. We investigate the flux ratio parameter space populated by individual CVs and by various CV subclasses (e. g., AM Her stars, DQ Her stars, dwarf novae, nova-like variables). For most systems, these ratios are clustered within a range of ∼ 1 decade for log Si IV/C IV ≈ − 0. 5 and log He II/C IV ≈ − 1. 0 and ∼ 1. 5 decades for log N V/C IV ≈ − 0. 25. These ratios are compared to photoionization and collisional ionization models to constrain the excitation mechanism and the physical conditions of the line-emitting gas. We find that the collisional models do the <b>poorest</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> reproducing the data. The photoionization models reproduce the Si IV/C IV line ratios for some shapes of the ionizing spectrum, but the predicted N V/C IV line ratios are simultaneously too low by typically ∼ 0. 5 decades.

He {{was inspired to}} new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal The Pioneer. The periodical was distinguished {{by the fact that}} most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere, and by the inclusion of very serious criticism, which covered not only literature but also art and music. Lowell wrote that it would [...] "furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines."

Some of them also suspected Avatar of subversive retelling of the biblical Exodus, by which Cameron [...] "invites us to look at the Bible from the side of Canaanites." [...] Conversely, other commentators concluded that the film promotes theism or panentheism rather than pantheism, arguing that the hero [...] "does not pray to a tree, but through a tree to the deity whom he addresses personally" [...] and, unlike in pantheism, [...] "the film's deity does indeed—contrary to the native wisdom of the Na'vi—interfere in human affairs." [...] Ann Marlowe of Forbes agreed, saying that [...] "though Avatar has been charged with [...] "pantheism", its mythos is just as deeply Christian."

[...] Saritha Prabhu, an Indian-born columnist for The Tennessean, saw the film as a misportrayal of pantheism: [...] "What pantheism is, at least, to me: a silent, spiritual awe when looking (as Einstein said) at the 'beauty and sublimity of the universe', and seeing the divine manifested in different aspects of nature. [...] What pantheism isn't: a touchy-feely, kumbaya vibe as is often depicted. [...] No wonder many Americans are turned off."

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between age and literacy skills {{using data from the}} IALS, ALL and PIAAC surveys. In cross-sectional data there is a negative partial relationship between literacy skills and age that is statistically significant indicating that literacy declines with age, especially after age 45. However, this relationship could reflect some combination of age and birth cohort effects. In order to isolate age effects, we use the three international surveys to create synthetic cohorts. Our analysis shows that in most participating OECD countries the negative slope of the literacy-age profile in cross-sectional data arises from offsetting ageing and cohort effects. In these countries more recent birth cohorts have lower levels of literacy and individuals from a given birth cohort lose literacy skills after they leave school at a rate greater than indicated by cross-sectional estimates. Finland, Italy and the Netherlands are exceptions to this pattern; in these countries more recent cohorts have higher literacy levels and the cross-sectional estimates overstate the rate at which literacy declines with age. Our birth cohort results suggest {{that there is not a}} general tendency for literacy skills to decline from one generation to the next, but that the majority of the countries examined are doing a <b>poorer</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> developing literacy skills in successive generations...|$|R

The indices studied were: 1) EPT (percent of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera); 2) BMWP' (Biological Monitoring Work Party System); 3) BMWP'-ASPT (Average Score per Taxon); and 4) HFBI (Hilsenhoff Family Biotic Index). All indices were calculated from five samples collected from April 2005 to April 2006 at two stations on the coastal do Pinto River. The river's headwaters are inside a protected area but impacts increase downriver (e. g., towns, cattle grazing, tourism). The HFBI index did the <b>poorest</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> reflecting water quality. No one index performed better than the others, and all indices yielded water quality scores that did not accurately reflect macroinvertebrate community structure because all of them had differences between ordination scores and the structure of assemblage.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between age and literacy skills in Canada, Norway and the U.

In cross-sectional data there is a weak negative partial relationship between literacy skills and age. However, this relationship could reflect some combination of age and cohort effects. In order to identify age effects, we use the 1994 and 2003 surveys to create synthetic cohorts. Our analysis shows that the modest negative slope of the literacy-age profile in cross-sectional data arises from offsetting ageing and cohort effects. Individuals from a given birth cohort lose literacy skills after they leave school at a rate greater than indicated by cross-sectional estimates. At the same time, more recent birth cohorts have lower levels of literacy. These results suggest a pervasive tendency for literacy skills to decline over time and that these countries are doing a <b>poorer</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> educating successive generations. All three countries show similar patterns of skill loss with age, as well as declining literacy across successive cohorts.

Methods: A general demographic information questionnaire, job adaptation obstacle scale and perceived social support scale were used to investigate 290 community nurses in Changchun. Results: The score <b>of</b> <b>job</b> adaptation obstacle was 20. 85 ± 5. 18; the score of perceived social support was 64. 25 ± 10. 32, the score of support in the family was 20. 01 ± 3. 58, and the score of the support out of family was 42. 57 ± 6. 86; the job adaptation obstacle was negatively correlated with the perceived social support, the support in the family, and the support out of family. Conclusion: The <b>job</b> adaptation situation <b>of</b> the nurses in the survey communities was generally poor and the perceived social support was at a moderate level. Therefore, community nursing managers should actively understand the situation <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> adaptation, and then take effective measures to improve the community nurses social support, improve the current situation <b>of</b> the <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> adaptation <b>of</b> the community nurses, and prevent loss of nursing talents, for the improvement of the quality of nursing service...|$|R
