The method does not require any a priori information about the analyzed signal, nor the knowledge of the Rényi entropy of one of the signal components. This method has been successfully applied to both synthetic and real life signals. Note that such approach is of particular interest in the selection of the time frequency <b>points</b> (<b>signal</b> auto-terms) needed in the spatial time frequency distribution (STFD) based array signal processing.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{wireless}} communication, {{the discovery}} of the surrounding access points is crucial to provide seamless connectivity to mobile users. In IEEE 802. 11, this discovery process is performed by passive and active scanning functions. For both, timers are usually constant (within the 802. 11 driver) and their configuration affects the two main scanning performance metrics, i. e., scanning latency and scanning failure. In order to manage this trade-off, we propose a couple of adaptive scanning algorithms that are aware of the access <b>points</b> <b>signal</b> power and congestion level using cross-layer information from the physical layer.

Our goal {{is to find a}} robust method that gives early turning <b>point</b> <b>signals</b> and steady turning <b>point</b> <b>signals.</b> The revision performance of the methods has been evaluated according to bias, overall revision size and signal stability measures. In a second phase, we investigate if revision performance is improved using stabilizing forecasts or by changing the cycle estimation window from the baseline 6 and 96 months (i. e. filtering out high frequency noise with a cycle length shorter than 6 months and removing trend components with cycle length longer than 96 months) to 12 and 120 months. The results show that, for all tested time series, the PAT de-trending method is outperformed by both the HP or CF filter.

40|$|A Fortran {{computer}} algorithm {{has been}} used to analyze the nucleotide se¬quence of several structural genes. The analysis performed on both coding and complementary DNA strands shows that whereas open reading frames shorter than 100 codons are randomly distributed on both DNA strands, open reading frames longer than 100 codons ("virtual genes") are significantly more frequent on the complementary DNA strand than on the coding one. These "virtual genes" were further investigated by looking at intron se¬quences, splicing <b>points,</b> <b>signal</b> sequences and by analyzing gene mutations. On the basis of this analysis coding and complementary DNA strands of several eukaryotic structural genes cannot be distinguished.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of the boundary conditions (signal reflecting vs. signal adsorbing) on bacterial intercellular communication were addressed by a combined physics and microbiology approach. A predictive biophysical model was devised that considered system size, diffusion from given <b>points,</b> <b>signal</b> molecule decay and boundary properties. The theoretical predictions were tested with two experimental agarose-gel-based set-ups for reflecting or absorbing boundaries. N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) concentration profiles were measured using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens NTL 4 bioassay and found to agree with model predictions. The half-life of AHL {{was estimated to be}} 7 days. The absorbing vs. reflecting nature of the boundaries drastically changed AHL concentration profiles. The effect of a single nonreflecting boundary side was equivalent to a 100 -fold lower cell concentration. Results suggest that the kinetics of signal accumulation vs. signal removal and their threshold-mediated phenotypic consequences are directly linked to the properties of biofilm boundaries, stressing the relevance of the diffusion sensing component in bacterial communication...|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately due to {{unavailability}} of {{data regarding}} mobility of users {{on the landscape}} {{we were not able}} to test closeness of the proposed mobility model and empirical data. Aside from this, one of the most important assumption we take in this article is that the received signal strength at a certain separation distance from the transmitter is indeed stationary while when changing the location different characteristics of the received signal strength distribution changes. To test this assumption we carried out experiments with wireless local area network (WLAN) networks operating in infrastructure DCF mode according to IEEE 802.11 b standard at 11 Mbps (DSSS) in laboratory environments. The access point is installed in the corridors with rooms along both sides of it. The main points of interest were characteristics of the received signal strength process at a certain separation distance from the transmitter and its changes as users move between different attraction <b>points.</b> <b>Signal</b> strength observations were measures with 1 ms granularity and then averaged over 0.5 ms time intervals.|$|E

50|$|Since central {{operation}} of the <b>points</b> and <b>signals</b> from a single signal box is convenient, and since there are practical limits for the distance to these <b>points</b> and <b>signals,</b> crossing loops can have a system-wide effect on train sizes.

40|$|Wireless LANs {{operating}} within unlicensed frequency bands require random access schemes such as CSMA/ CA, so that wireless networks from different administrative domains (for example wireless community networks) may co-exist without central coordination, {{even when they}} happen to operate on the same radio channel. Yet, {{it is evident that}} this Jack of coordination leads to an inevitable loss in efficiency due to contention on the MAC layer. The interesting question is, which efficiency may be gained by adding coordination to existing, unrelated wireless networks, for example by self-organization. In this paper, we present a methodology based on a mathematical programming formulation to determine the parameters (assignment of stations to access <b>points,</b> <b>signal</b> strengths and channel assignment of both access points and stations) for a scenario of co-existing CSMA/ CA-based wireless networks, such that the contention between these networks is minimized. We demonstrate how it is possible to solve this discrete, non-linear optimization problem exactly for small problems. For larger scenarios, we present a genetic algorithm specifically tuned for finding near-optimal solutions, and compare its results to theoretical lower bounds. Overall, we provide a benchmark on the minimum contention problem for coordination mechanisms in CSMA/CA-based wireless networks...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, Stochastic Resonance (SR) {{has evolved}} {{as one of}} the vibration-based {{condition}} monitoring methodologies in mechanical systems fault diagnosis. Of peculiar interest is the distinctive ability of SR to amplify a signal using noise. In reality, signals are never obtained in their raw state and as such, they are always mixed with noise. This seems to suggest that SR has the potential for practical applications. This paper examines the application of SR to impact signals generated by a set of spur gears in mesh as shown in Fig. 1. Since the transmission path alters the signals obtained for SR analysis, it is taken into account in this study. The re-scaling frequency pre-processing technique is used to convert the large parameter system to a small parameter system in order to fulfil the requirements needed for the functionality of SR. Furthermore, the SR results are enhanced by employing a resonance curve, which was recently investigated by the authors. Different number of data <b>points</b> (<b>signal</b> cycles), fault severities and noise levels are tested to establish the suitability of SR for vibration-based condition monitoring in gear...|$|E
40|$|DIGITAL ANALYSIS OF CARDIAC ACOUSTIC SIGNALS IN CHILDREN Milad El-Segaier, MD Division of Paediatric Cardiology, Department of Paediatrics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden SUMMARY Despite {{tremendous}} {{development in}} cardiac imaging, {{use of the}} stethoscope and cardiac auscultation remains the primary diagnostic tool in evaluation of cardiac pathology. With the advent of miniaturized and powerful technology for data acquisition, display and digital signal processing, the possibilities for detecting cardiac pathology by signal analysis have increased. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a simple, cost-effective diagnostic tool for analysis of cardiac acoustic signals. Heart sounds and murmurs were recorded in 360 children with a single-channel device and in 15 children with a multiple-channel device. Time intervals between acoustic signals were measured. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis was used to present the acoustic signals to a digital algorithm for detection of heart sounds, define systole and diastole and analyse the spectrum of a cardiac murmur. A statistical model for distinguishing physiological murmurs from pathological findings was developed using logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the discriminating ability of the developed model. The sensitivities and specificities of the model were calculated at different cut-off <b>points.</b> <b>Signal</b> deconvolution using blind source separation (BSS) analysis was performed for separation of signals from different sources. The first and second heart sounds (S 1 and S 2) were detected with high accuracy (100 % for the S 1 and 97 % for the S 2) independently of heart rates and presence of a murmur. The systole and diastole were defined, but only systolic murmur was analysed in this work. The developed statistical model showed excellent prediction ability (area under the curve, AUC = 0. 995) in distinguishing a physiological murmur from a pathological one with high sensitivity and specificity (98 %). In further analyses deconvolution of the signals was successfully performed using blind separation analysis. This yielded two spatially independent sources, heart sounds (S 1 and S 2) in one component, and a murmur in another. The study supports the view that a cost-effective diagnostic device would be useful in primary health care. It would diminish the need for referring children with cardiac murmur to cardiac specialists and the load on the health care system. Likewise, it would help to minimize the psychological stress experienced by the children and their parents at an early stage of the medical care...|$|E
