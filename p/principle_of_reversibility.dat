As opposed to the positive gains associated with regular progressive physical training, periods of detraining are characterized by the reversal of physiological or performance adaptations. In short, the principle of detraining is the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>reversibility.</b> To date, {{a number of studies}} have followed athletes and nonathletes through varied periods of detraining, and while data are somewhat mixed, it appears that the level of loss of experience is accentuated by increasing age and is associated with the extent and level of training prior to detraining and the detraining duration.

40|$|The {{decision}} to conserve {{has already been}} made when a book is brought to a conservation studio. It means that the material {{has been found to}} have some intrinsic or artifactual value. What to conserve is the decision of the librarian, the archivist, or the bibliophile. How to conserve it is fundamentally the decision of the conservator, often made in conjunction with the custodian of the material or at least with his/her consent. All decisions are made after a careful examination and testing of the material and a thoughtful assessment of the techniques available.

40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} (RTT) is an X-linked progressive neurodevelopmental disorder causing {{mental retardation}} mainly in girls. Affected patients {{are characterized by}} a period of normal development followed by a rapid regression phase that leaves them with a profound mental handicap. Mutations in the MECP 2 gene, coding for a transcriptional repressor involved in chromatin remodeling, are {{the primary cause of}} Rett syndrome but are also found in patients affected by learning disability, neonatal encephalopathy, autism and mental retardation therefore making RTT paradigmatic for the study of autism spectrum disorders. Recent experiments indicate that MeCP 2 -deficient neurons are not permanently damaged, since Mecp 2 reactivation leads to robust abrogation of advanced neurological defects in both young and adult animals.

40|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> {{microscopic}} <b>reversibility</b> was formulated {{for elementary}} reactions at equilibrium. It {{follows from the}} principle that for any elementary reaction the favored reaction path in one direction must be the reverse {{of that in the}} opposite reaction, and that the ratio of rate constants is the equilibrium constant.

For reactions occurring under non-steady-state conditions, for chain reactions even in the steady state, and for non-chain reactions in which the alternative paths are not kinetically equivalen, the preferred reaction path in one direction may be different from that in the other; in such cases the ratio of the over-all rate constants is not equal to the equilibrium constant.
