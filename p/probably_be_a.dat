5|$|The {{first test}} would <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ground burst, but {{consideration}} was also given to {{an explosion in}} a ship to measure {{the effect of a}} ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the total}} income from these {{projects}} the company continued {{to lose money}} and Jobs, {{as chairman of the}} board and now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison. Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story would <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance. For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO. Toy Story went on to gross more than $362million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape's as the biggest IPO of the year. In only its first half-hour of trading Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of un-matched buy orders. Shares climbed to $49 before closing the day at $39.|$|E

25|$|Murtaja {{was often}} criticized for her poor {{performance}} in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906. Selling her was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing Murtaja, in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, Tarmo, without selling the old one. As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, Murtaja was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She {{was said to be}} in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
25|$|Thiago's first {{introduction}} to tennis happened {{when he first}} saw his brother watching Gustavo Kuerten on TV, being eight years old. Monteiro trained football at an Academy near where his brother used to play tennis. He played {{it for the first time}} when his football class was cancelled and his brother called him to hit the ball. Thiago soon started training and disputing local tournaments: in early 2004 he won his first tournament, being only nine years old. Thiago would leave his hometown, Fortaleza, in late 2008 to enter the Larri Passos Academy in Balneário Camboriú to improve his game. Thiago says that if he didn't made that change, he would <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> football player. Now as a professional player, Thiago uses his spare time to enjoy movies and spend it with friends and family. He attends college online and has been dating fellow brazilian tennis player, Beatriz Haddad Maia since March 2016.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schur {{made his}} directorial debut with the pilot episode. The {{original}} {{cut of the}} pilot episode was 48 minutes long, {{and had to be}} trimmed down to 22 minutes. Due to the improvisational style and hand-held camerawork of the series, a great deal of extra footage is filmed in each episode and ultimately has to be discarded for the final cut. Amy Poehler said of this, [...] "For every show, there could <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> second show of stuff we've edited out." [...] Brief portions of those deleted scenes were interwoven into short montage sequences that played along with dialogue from the documentary-style interviews conducted within the episode with the characters.|$|E
500|$|Schur {{said the}} Parks and Recreation {{producers}} approach each episode {{as if they}} are filming a real documentary.

Due to the improvisational acting and hand-held camerawork, a great deal of extra footage is shot that must be discarded for the final cut. According to Poehler, [...] "For every show, there could <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> second show of stuff we've edited out." [...] The original cut of the 22-minute pilot was 48 minutes long.

500|$|However, GameBrink.Com {{felt that}} the gameplay, {{user-friendly}} even to non-Japanese players, consists of too much repetitive button mashing despite featuring characters with different abilities. The Code Extension mode was considered imperfectly implemented, seeming {{as if it were}} [...] "tacked on [...] late in development", being totally optional yet difficult not to use to survive in the later missions. Calling the gameplay [...] "shallow", the site stated that [...] "the soundtrack would <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better purchase than the actual game". On its part, Siliconera noted that while the gameplay may seem complex for using every button on the controller, thirty minutes were enough to grasp how to play the game. The site felt the missions were designed with good pacing and replayability value, but added that hardcore role-playing game fans could dislike the lack of exploration, puzzle, and standard role-playing game principles.|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country. Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place. Yet, he won the [...] for his immortal game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it [...] "The Game of the Century", writing: [...] "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of [...] play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies".

While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity". Complex reviewers were also divided; Brian Josephs considered the track a [...] " [...] club banger", but David Drake criticized Azalea's [...] "nimble rapping and forced accent".

500|$|Science {{fiction writers}} had {{a range of}} {{reactions}} to the film. Ray Bradbury praised the film's photography, but disliked the banality {{of most of the}} dialogue, and believed that the audience does not care when Poole dies. Both he and Lester del Rey were put off by the film's feeling of sterility and blandness in all the human encounters amidst all the technological wonders, while both praised the pictorial element of the film. Del Rey was especially harsh, describing the film as dull, confusing, and boring, predicting [...] "t will <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> box-office disaster, too, and thus set major science-fiction movie making back another ten years." [...] However, the film was praised by science-fiction novelist Samuel R. Delany who was impressed by how the film undercuts the audience's normal sense of space and orientation in several ways. Like Bradbury, Delany picked up on the banality of the dialogue (in Delany's phrasing the characters are saying nothing meaningful), but Delany regards this as a dramatic strength, a prelude to the rebirth {{at the conclusion of the}} film. Without analyzing the film in detail, Isaac Asimov spoke well of Space Odyssey in his autobiography, and other essays. The film won the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation, an award heavily voted on by science fiction fans and published science-fiction writers. James P. Hogan liked the film but complained about the ending that didn't make any sense to him, leading to a bet about whether he could write something better or not; [...] "I stole Arthur's plot idea shamelessly and produced Inherit the Stars." ...|$|E

The 7.62×51mm NATO round has been proven effective out to 800 meters, whereas the 7.62×39mm is considered less effective (out to ± 400 meters).

[...] However a further report a few days later, on May 9, 1901, was that both Vosburg and Wheeler were inside the bar, but could not exit (a status known as “bar bound”) because the channel had recently become clogged with sand. [...] Work was being done to try to reestablish a channel. [...] By May 31, 1901, the channel was still divided but one branch was ten feet deep, and this permitted Vosburg to exit and proceed to Astoria.|$|E
