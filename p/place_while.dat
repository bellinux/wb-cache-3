5|$|At each step, if a {{cell with}} value 1 has a cell with value 0 {{immediately}} to its right, the 1 moves rightwards leaving a 0 behind. A 1 with another 1 to its right remains in <b>place,</b> <b>while</b> a 0 {{that does not}} have a 1 to its left stays a 0. This description is most apt for the application to traffic flow modeling.|$|E
5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took <b>place,</b> <b>while</b> processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Every few weeks, the Nazis {{staged a}} roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people unable to work.

In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death {{on the front porch}} of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|Following the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which took <b>place</b> <b>while</b> six American-Hawaiian ships {{were being held}} in various Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled {{with the fact that}} the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to the canal route.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's victory {{made him}} the fifth {{different}} driver in seven races to win a Grand Prix in 2010. The result meant Webber's advantage over {{second place in the}} Drivers' Championship, now occupied by Button, was extended by five points.

McLaren's 1–2 finish resulted in them reducing Red Bull's lead in the Constructors' Championship to one point. Ferrari's poor result meant they moved from second to third, with 12 races left of the season.|$|E

5|$|It {{was opened}} as Ibrox Park in 1899, but {{suffered}} a disaster in 1902 when a wooden terrace collapsed. Vast earthen terraces {{were built in}} its <b>place,</b> <b>while</b> a main stand, which is now a listed building, was built in 1928. A British record crowd of 118,567 gathered in January 1939 for a league match with Celtic. After the Ibrox disaster of 1971, the stadium was largely rebuilt. The vast bowl-shaped terracing was removed and replaced by three rectangular, all-seated stands by 1981. After renovations were completed in 1997, the ground was renamed Ibrox Stadium.|$|E

This treaty, along with the others that were signed during the conference, each took their name from the suburb of Paris where the signings took <b>place.</b> <b>While</b> 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.|$|E
