When Ontario Place opened in 1971 {{the section of the}} exhibition he had designed called “Explosions” was the most successful exhibit in that first season. In consequence of this success he was appointed chief designer for the whole project. The following year (1972) saw the opening of the “Children’s Village” land play area and from that project grew his reputation as a designer of children’s play attractions. The opening of the “Water Play” area in 1973 secured that reputation. His work introduced ideas like the ball crawl (ball pit), net climb, <b>punch</b> <b>bag</b> forest, birdie glide, roller slide, cave crawl, together toys, foam swamp, water bicycle cannons, balancing buoys, rubber band bounce, and a whole range of interactive play elements.|$|E
5000|$|When the outlaws {{hear from}} William that sweet {{production}} has stopped during {{the remainder of}} the war, they decide to make their own sweets and sell them to the shops and eat them themselves. Each boy races through their mother's larder and bring back an odd array. Included are a tin of sardines and a some coconut pieces. They mix it all together to create [...] "sardine toffee" [...] and taste it, with the following results. First tastiness, second a lasting flavour, third a green countenance! One by one they leave until only William and Ginger remain. When William casually mentions the cakes and sweets they would receive at the party they were attending that evening, Ginger goes too. But, William, never one to say 'I surrender' in any case of the like, goes bravely, yet worriedly to the party. At Mrs Bott's place, where the party will be held, a woman has come to seek one of the children who appears most earnest, to take home to be a companion to her son, Claude. Claude, it turns out, is a bully, even larger than William, and by his mothers standards after all, (she is writing books on child psychology) he should play with a meeker child, so the meeker one would become braver and more manly, and the manly one (meaning Claude) would become more meek. If she had known William's usual look when he hadn't eaten a sweet made of sardines, she may not have been so inclined to take him. But, she didn't. So, she took him. And, when Claude expects another babyish child to pummel at his own will (the father and gardener and housemaid were told not to interfere with proceedings, so not to disturb the balance as Claude's mother said, so unfortunately they watched a poor child being left to the manly strength of Claude) found that William was not his regular <b>punch</b> <b>bag,</b> but a more manly person. When Mrs Brown expects William to come home changed, she gets a full surprise. William, not only unchanged but invigorated, walks in! ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Sweden has emerged {{on the other}} side of the 1990 s crisis with, if not its self-image intact, then at least a reasserted {{confidence}} as, once again, the most modern country in the world. Crisis management in the 1990 s seemed to have succeeded. The Swedish bumblebee – the unthinkable animal that flies despite its high taxes and large public sector – flew again. The ‘Swedish model’ was back after a decade as the <b>punch</b> <b>bag</b> of neoliberalism. Throughout the European centre left – from the debate on the European social model to Ségolène Royal and Gordon Brown – Sweden has reemerged as ‘Nordic light’, proof that a better world is possible. This reappraisal in the eyes of the world has paradoxical consequences in Sweden, since it seems to overwrite the uncertainty and insecurity of crisis with assertion and confidence, while leaving many questions unanswered. It also leads to new definitions of what Sweden is. The paper suggests that Sweden post- 1990 s suffers from a particular kind of nostalgia, in which the famous Model emerges as a kind of paradise lost with uncertain links both to past and future. While Sweden yet again becomes the utopia of others, it is a kind of future past to itself...|$|E

40|$|Tackling in Rugby Union {{is an open}} skill {{which can}} involve {{high-speed}} collisions and is the match event associated with the greatest proportion of injuries. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse the biomechanics of rugby tackling under different three movement conditions: from a stationary position, with the dominant shoulder and with the non-dominant shoulder, and moving forward, with the dominant shoulder. A specially devised contact simulator, a 50 kg <b>punch</b> <b>bag</b> instrumented with pressure sensors, was translated towards the tackler (n= 15) in trials to evaluate the effect of laterality (dominant vs. non-dominant side) and tackling approach (standing vs. moving) on the external loads absorbed by the tackler, on head and trunk motion, and on trunk muscle activities. Peak impact force was substantially higher in the stationary dominant (2. 84 ± 0. 74 kN) than in the stationary non-dominant condition (2. 44 ± 0. 64 kN), but lower than in the moving condition (3. 40 ± 0. 86 kN). Muscle activation started on average 300 ms before impact, with higher activation for impact-side trapezius and non-impact side erector spinae and gluteus maximus muscles. Players’ technique for non-dominant side tackles was less compliant with current coaching recommendations in terms of cervical motion (more neck flexion and lateral bending were observed in the stationary non-dominant condition) and players could benefit from specific coaching focus on non-dominant side tackles...|$|E
40|$|Greece is {{a country}} that {{considers}} itself {{to be part of the}} Western civilization, though still a lot oriental elements exist in its culture and way of thinking. LGBT people are considered to be either invisible or pointed out as metaphorical or literal <b>punch</b> <b>bag.</b> So it was a surprise that a year after the first Athens Gay Pride (2005), two greek movies appeared with homosexuality as their central theme. The first one “The Blue Dress”, a drama about the journey of a young boy till he turns into a woman, won six national cinema awards. The second one “Straight Story”, a comedy about a world were homosexuality is the normative and heterosexuality is the “not normal”, was the biggest box office success of the year. This paper uses the stereotypes portrayed in these two films in order to explore the spatial dimension of being gay in Greece. Both films place queer subjects in their narrative in a stereotyped even offensive way, but at the same point offer a very accurate image of how “homosexuality” is perceived in Greece. Issues that become more and more obvious during the rise of the extreme right organizations and their entrance in the Greek parliament and the violence against gay men. The way these two films explore the subject of being gay in Greece, shows the difficulties of placing the “queer” in public and raise a series of questions of the space available for different sexualities. By analyzing these two films the paper shows how space is constructed regarding LGTB people and the limits created by a strong religious and patriarchic tradition reflected in the heteronormative and homonormative systems of this country...|$|E
