Out of an electorate of 4,158, over 1,100 had <b>proxy</b> <b>votes</b> with an estimate that 775 {{would be for}} Liberal Democrats as against 375 for Labour. The Liberal Democrat candidate, Mozaquir Ali, said he would call for the election to be re-run if he lost, as a council electoral officer had given him incorrect advice on the eligibility of some <b>proxy</b> <b>votes.</b> The situation in Daneshouse partly led to the government reviewing the law on <b>proxy</b> <b>votes</b> to ensure they were not misused to guarantee votes. Meanwhile, the police enquiry would last {{for nearly a year}} but eventually decided no action should be taken.|$|R

The convention used a <b>proxy</b> <b>voting</b> system; every member of the SPW was entitled to attend, and delegates could collect mandates from non-attending members and vote in their stead. A total of 244 [...] "votes" [...] were present at the convention, based upon this system. The <b>proxy</b> <b>voting</b> system was eliminated the subsequent year, in favor of required attendance for participation and a limit of one vote to be cast per delegate. the convention adopted a state platform, which again did not include any proposals for ameliorative reform.|$|E
