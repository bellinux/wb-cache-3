40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} we propose a {{systematic}} development method for rational drug design while reviewing paradigms in industry, emerging techniques and technologies in the field. Although the process of drug development today has been accelerated by emergence of computational methodologies, it is a herculean challenge requiring exorbitant resources; and often fails to yield clinically viable results. The current paradigm of target based drug design is often misguided and tends to yield compounds that have poor absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, toxicology (ADMET) properties. Therefore, an in vivo organism based approach allowing for a multidisciplinary inquiry into potent and selective molecules is an excellent place to begin rational drug design. We will review how organisms like the zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans can not only be starting points, but can be used at various steps of the drug development process from target identification to <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial</b> models. This systems biology based approach paired {{with the power of}} computational biology; genetics and developmental biology provide a methodological framework to avoid the pitfalls of traditional target based drug design...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). However, despite successful viral clearance, many patients continue to have HCV-related disease progression. Therefore, new treatments must be developed to achieve viral clearance and prevent the risk of HCV-related diseases. In particular, the use of pitavastatin together with DAAs may improve the antiviral efficacy as well as decrease the progression of liver fibrosis and the incidence of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. To investigate the management methods for HCV-related diseases using pitavastatin and DAAs, clinical trials should be undertaken. However, concerns have been raised about potential drug interactions between statins and DAAs. Therefore, pre-clinical trials using a replicon system, human hepatocyte-like cells, human neurons and human cardiomyocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem cells should be conducted. Based on these pre-clinical trials, an optimal direct-acting antiviral agent could be selected for combination with pitavastatin and DAAs. Following the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial,</b> the combination of pitavastatin and the optimal direct-acting antiviral agent should be compared to other combinations of DAAs (e. g., sofosbuvir and velpatasvir) according to the antiviral effect on HCV infection, HCV-related diseases and cost-effectiveness...|$|E

The variable domain of camelid heavy chain antibodies (VHH) display potent antigen-binding capacity, have low production costs and are suitable for oral therapies. Two sets of anti-RVA VHHs have been developed: ARP 1 -ARP 3; 2 KD 1 - 3 B 2. Here, we explore the potential of both sets as a prevention strategy complementary to vaccination and a treatment option against RVA-associated diarrhea in endangered populations. Both sets have been expressed in multiple production systems, showing extensive neutralizing capacity against strains of RVA in vitro. They were also tested in the neonatal mouse model with various degrees of success in preventing or treating RVA-induced diarrhea. Interestingly, mitigation of the symptoms was also achieved with freeze-dried ARP 1, so that it could be applied in areas where cold chains are difficult to maintain. 3 B 2 was tested in a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial</b> involving gnotobiotic piglets where it conferred complete protection against RVA-induced diarrhea.

30|$|Interestingly, in a phase-three {{trial of}} sunitinib, {{there was an}} {{improvement}} of the overall and the progression-free survival in patients with pNET [37]. Like vatalanib, sunitinib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor blocking all PDGF-Rs and VEGFRs. Thus, combination of targeted radiopeptides with anti-angiogenic compounds is a particularly attractive option because radiopeptide monotherapies such as [90 Y-DOTA-Tyr 3]-octreotide and [177 Lu-DOTA-Tyr 3]-octreotate showed an excellent objective response rate and progression-free survival in patients with neuroendocrine tumors [3, 4]. In addition, cediranib, a highly potent inhibitor of VEGFR tyrosine kinase activity, showed a radiosensitizing effect in combination with radiotherapy [38]. In contrast, [177 Lu-DOTA-Tyr 3]-octreotate was shown to be less effective when combined with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD 001, Novartis) in a rat model of pancreatic cancer [39]. Along the same line, no synergistic effect of adding imatinib was observed in our <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial.</b> This underlines the importance to choose adequate combination partners for radiopeptide therapy. Since both vatalanib and imatinib inhibit PDGFR, this argues that the main synergistic effect of the combination therapy is mediated via the inhibition of the VEGF receptors. For a potential clinical combination therapy, VEGFR inhibitors may thus be more suitable partners for radiopeptides than other kinase inhibitors.|$|E

As the E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins are expressed in all HPV- 16 tumour cells, vaccines expressing these proteins might clear an already established tumour and support the treatment of HPV-related precancerous lesions. Methods Three different immunisation regimens were tested in a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial</b> in rabbits to evaluate the humoral and cell-mediated responses of a putative HPV- 16 vaccine. Fowlpoxvirus (FP) recombinants separately expressing the HPV- 16 E 6 (FP E 6) and E 7 (FP E 7) transgenes were used for priming, followed by E 7 protein boosting. Results All of the protocols were effective in eliciting a high antibody response. This was also confirmed by interleukin- 4 production, which increased after simultaneous priming with both FP E 6 and FP E 7 and after E 7 protein boost. A cell-mediated immune response was also detected in most of the animals. Conclusion These results establish a preliminary profile for the therapy with the combined use of avipox recombinants, which may represent safer immunogens than vaccinia-based vectors in immuno-compromised individuals, as they express the transgenes in most mammalian cells {{in the absence of a}} productive replication. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{progression}} of diabetic nephropathy {{is associated with}} an infiltration of macrophages expressing different phenotypes. As classically activated chemokine receptor CCR 2 + macrophages are thought to drive tissue inflammation and remodeling, we tested whether blocking CCR 2 could reduce intrarenal inflammation and prevent glomerulosclerosis in type 2 diabetes. This was achieved with RO 5234444, an orally active small-molecule CCR 2 antagonist that blocks ligand binding, its internalization, and monocyte chemotaxis. Male type 2 diabetic db/db mice were uninephrectomized to increase glomerular hyperfiltration to accelerate the development of glomerulosclerosis. From 16 weeks until killing at 24 weeks of age, mice were chow fed with or without admixed antagonist to achieve a trough plasma concentration above IC 50 for binding in the mouse. CCR 2 blockade reduced circulating monocyte levels, but did not affect total leukocyte or neutrophil numbers, and {{was associated with a}} {{reduction in the number of}} macrophages and apoptotic podocytes in the glomerulus.

40|$|Background: A major {{challenge}} in protein quantitation based on enzymatic digestion of complex biological samples and subsequent LC-MS/MS {{analysis of a}} signature peptide {{is dealing with the}} high complexity of the matrix after digestion, which can reduce sensitivity considerably. For the quantitation of a 28 -kDa biopharmaceutical protein, a single-cartridge, multi-dimensional (ion-exchange and reversed-phase) SPE procedure to selectively enrich a signature peptide from a plasma digest was developed, validated and applied. Results: With this procedure, sufficient selectivity was introduced to allow quantitation in 50 µL of plasma down to 10. 0 ng/mL (~ 0. 3 nM). An in-house prepared 18 O-labeled form of the signature peptide was successfully used as internal standard. The developed procedure was validated for both human and rabbit plasma.

Therefore, {{it is important to have}} an estimation of the primary stability that can be achieved with new stem designs in a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial.</b> Fast assessment of the primary {{stability is}} also useful in the preoperative planning of total hip replacements, and to an even larger extent in intraoperatively custom-made prosthesis systems, which result in a wide variety of stem geometries. Methods An analytical model is proposed to numerically predict the relative primary stability of cementless hip stems. This analytical approach is based upon the principle of virtual work and a straightforward mechanical model. For five custom-made implant designs, the resistance against axial rotation was assessed through the analytical model as well as through finite element modelling (FEM). Results The analytical approach can be considered as a first attempt to theoretically evaluate the primary stability of hip stems without using FEM, which makes it fast and inexpensive compared to other methods. A reasonable agreement was found in the stability ranking of the stems obtained with both methods. However, due to the simplifying assumptions underlying the analytical model it predicts very rigid stability behaviour: estimated stem rotation was two to three orders of magnitude smaller, compared with the FEM results. Conclusion Based on the results of this study, the analytical model might be useful as a comparative tool for the assessment of the primary stability of cementless hip stems. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{preservation}} of residual hearing is currently an important challenge for cochlear implant surgeries.

This combined mode of stimulation {{has proven to be}} beneficial both in terms of speech perception and of sound quality. Finding the right procedures for conducting soft-surgeries and designing electrode arrays dedicated to hearing preservation is an open issue. Objective The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the combination of a soft-surgery procedure implicating round-window insertion and the use of dexamethasone and hyaluronic acid during surgery, with the use of a specifically designed straight soft electrode array, on hearing preservation in patients with functional hearing in the low frequencies. Methods This <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial</b> was conducted on seven patients with residual hearing in the low frequencies. The surgical method used employed a round window insertion and the use of topical dexamethasone. Results The soft-surgery protocol could be successfully followed in five patients.

Therefore, gene expression analyses have biomarker potential for measuring therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical trials, particularly those aimed at correcting gene expression abnormalities. Housekeeping genes {{are commonly used}} as endogenous references in gene expression studies. However, a systematic study comparing the suitability of candidate reference genes for use in HD mouse models has not been performed. To remedy this situation, 12 housekeeping genes were examined to identify suitable reference genes for use in expression assays. Results We found that commonly used reference genes are dysregulated at later time points in the R 6 / 2 mouse model of HD. Therefore, in order to reliably measure gene expression changes for use as <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>trial</b> biomarkers, {{we set out to}} identify suitable reference genes for use in R 6 / 2 mice. The expression of potential reference genes was examined in striatum, cortex and cerebellum from 15 week old R 6 / 2 and matched wild-type littermates. Expression levels of candidate reference genes varied according to genotype and brain region. GeNorm software was used to identify the three most stably expressed genes for each brain region. Relative quantification methods using the geometric mean of three reference genes for normalisation enables accurate determination of gene expression levels in wild-type and R 6 / 2 mouse brain regions. Conclusion Our study has identified a reproducible, reliable method by which we able to accurately determine the relative expression level of target genes in specific brain regions, thus increasing the potential of gene expression analysis as a biomarker in HD pre-clinical trials. </p...|$|E
