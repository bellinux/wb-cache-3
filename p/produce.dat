5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to <b>produce</b> offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens <b>produce</b> diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males <b>produce</b> clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to <b>produce</b> haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E

5|$|This {{ability of}} Clostridium to metabolize sugars directly, or to <b>produce</b> acetic acid from less costly inputs, {{suggests}} that these bacteria could <b>produce</b> acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like Acetobacter. However, Clostridium bacteria are less acid-tolerant than Acetobacter. Even the most acid-tolerant Clostridium strains can <b>produce</b> vinegar in concentrations {{of only a few}} per cent, compared to Acetobacter strains that can <b>produce</b> vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to <b>produce</b> vinegar using Acetobacter, rather than using Clostridium and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications.|$|E
5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} <b>produce</b> more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to <b>produce</b> more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to <b>produce</b> more of both goods.|$|E

5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would <b>produce</b> (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to <b>produce</b> mephedrone.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels <b>produce</b> sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats <b>produce</b> waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of time and under the {{appropriate}} environmental conditions, the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle. Fruit body formation is influenced by external factors such as season (which affects temperature and air humidity), nutrients and light. As fruit bodies develop they <b>produce</b> peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse, and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to <b>produce</b> basidiospores, each containing a single haploid nucleus. The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruit bodies are produced is long lasting, and will continue to <b>produce</b> successive generations of fruit bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable.|$|E
5|$|Animals <b>produce</b> colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can <b>produce</b> light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to <b>produce</b> the colours and effects they need.|$|E
