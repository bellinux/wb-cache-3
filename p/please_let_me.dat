In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that [...] "they fired the wrong guy" [...] (referring to Knight), and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result.

500|$|After Harriet Adams died in 1982, her protégé, Nancy Axelrad, oversaw {{production}} of the Nancy Drew books briefly before the Stratemeyer Syndicate was sold to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers. The books and Nancy's character began to change as a result, although there is disagreement {{on the nature of}} this change. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes [...] "more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [...] since 1956."

In response, Avicii accused Lewis and her label of lying about working together, and tweeted [...] "Thanks for accusing me of lying and speaking on my behalf. Since we never met or even spoke, <b>please</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> and my manager know who told you that and what confirmation they gave you." [...] Hours before both Lewis's and Avicii's record labels were supposed to appear in the high court, Syco released a statement that both record labels had reached an agreement and that Avicii would appear as a featured artist on [...] "Collide", whilst Lewis would appear as the lead artist. Avicii and his record label were pleased with the result, with the former saying [...] "Glad to FINALLY have resolved situation with Leona. Music is the answer...

2500|$|Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr wrote [...] "How Soon Is Now?" [...] {{along with}} [...] "William, It Was Really Nothing" [...] and [...] "Please, Please, <b>Please,</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Get What I Want" [...] during a four-day period at Earls Court in London in June 1984. His demo was {{originally}} called [...] "Swamp". In {{contrast to the}} frequent chord changes he had employed in most Smiths' songs, Marr wanted to explore building a song around a single chord (in this case, F) as much as possible, which also appealed to producer John Porter.|$|E
2500|$|Marr {{recorded}} the song with bandmates Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce that July at London's Jam Studios. After {{a night out}} celebrating the session for [...] "William, It Was Really Nothing" [...] and [...] "Please Please <b>Please</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Get What I Want", the trio had reconvened the following afternoon to record what became [...] "How Soon Is Now?". Porter {{was impressed by the}} basic riff Marr showed him, but felt the song needed something else. Their discussion turned to the early recordings of Elvis Presley, which led to an impromptu jam session of the song [...] "That's All Right". During the jam, Marr worked on his chord progression for [...] "Swamp", which inspired the arrangement.|$|E

Can you get this stopped and let me know why this is happening? I will need to send a response back to Apple quickly so <b>please</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know as soon as you can. Thanks Eric". Schmidt's email led to a recruiter for Google being [...] "terminated within the hour" [...] for not having adhered to the illegal scheme. Under Schmidt, there was a [...] "Do Not Call list" [...] of companies Google would avoid recruiting from. According to a court filing, another email exchange shows Google's human resources director asking Schmidt about sharing its no-cold call agreements with competitors. Schmidt responded that he preferred it be shared [...] "verbally, since I don't want to create a paper trail over which we can be sued later?" ...|$|E

[...] After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television (now ABC Studios), Washington issued a statement apologizing at length for using the epithet in an argument with Patrick Dempsey. On January 30, 2007, a source told People magazine that Washington was scheduled to return to the Grey's Anatomy set as early on that Thursday {{for the first time since}} entering [...] "executive counseling" [...] after making the comments at the Golden Globes. However, on June 7, 2007, ABC announced it had decided not to renew Washington's contract, and that he would be dropped from the show. [...] "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore," [...] Washington said in a statement released by his publicist, borrowing the famous line from Network.

[...] In a subsequent interview, Washington claimed that [...] "they fired the wrong guy" [...] (referring to Knight) and said he was considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on Grey's Anatomy. Washington, in late June 2007, began asserting that racism within the media was a factor in his firing from the series. [...] On July 2, 2007, Washington appeared on Larry King Live on CNN, to present his side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who, he felt, was treating him like a [...] "B-word," [...] a [...] "P-word," [...] and the [...] "F-word," [...] which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back." [...] Washington himself said that his dismissal from Grey's Anatomy was an unfortunate misunderstanding that he was eager to move past.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mandolin}} {{has been}} used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations. Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents. The instrument has also {{found its way into}} British rock music. The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose [...] "Fog on the Tyne" [...] was the biggest selling UK album of 1971–72. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do, and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of the Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire. McGuinness Flint, for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single, When I'm Dead And Gone, is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and played mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in the Incredible String Band. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please <b>Please</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> Get What I Want by the Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse. It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit [...] "Dance Tonight." [...] That {{was not the first time}} a Beatle played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name. The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people. Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin. This song was left off their debut album, and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.|$|E
