40|$|Abstract. Equipment {{for use in}} <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> {{is subject}} to {{particular}} requirements on safety and quality as determined {{by a number of}} Standards. For use in Europe, such equipment needs to conform to the EC directive 94 / 9 /EC, also called “ATEX Directive”. The conformity must be certified by a socalled ATEX Certificate. In the frame of the EC-funded research project „Corrosion testing of tank ships“, AE-field tests on board large tank ships were executed. Intrinsically safe certified AE sensors were temporarily immersed through a <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> from the tank top through manholes into the liquid contents. Ship owners and involved classification societies insisted on the availability of a system certificate confirming intrinsic safety for the used sensors and isolation barriers. This paper summarizes basics of explosion protection and the ATEX directive, the safety requirements on Acoustic Emission field test equipment for use in <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and shows a realization of certified equipment and data acquired from immersed sensors on board of a tank ship and used for the location of a natural artificial AE corrosion source...|$|E

Takšni objekti so po klasifikaciji zahtevni objekti. Znotraj objekta so montirane električne naprave in oprema, ki je zelo specifična glede na možnost vgradnje v eksplozijsko ogrožen prostor. Različne tipe naprav mora preglednik ali vzdrževalec prepoznati in tako oceniti, na kakšen način lahko napravo servisira oziroma pregleda. Tako so v diplomskem delu podrobno opisani klasični pregledi za nizkonapetostne inštalacije in merilni postopki, ki so značilni za objekte s potencialno eksplozivno atmosfero. Tudi zaščita pred strelo in prenapetostmi je zelo pomembna zaščita za takšne objekte, saj mora biti pravilno projektirana in izvedena. Zato so v nalogi opisane tudi zahteve in postopki za pregled strelovodne inštalacije.

Zener diodes {{are widely}} used in {{electrical}} barriers to protect equipment operating in a <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Although normally not conducting, the zeners must have a high power rating so that their junction temperature meets safety factors when shunting the maximum fuse current. This often requires two or three lower voltage commercial zeners connected in series. Silicon carbide diodes have much higher thermal conductivity and maximum allowed junction temperature, so {{it should be possible}} to use one SiC zener in the place of two or three commercial diodes and/or allow use of higher fuse ratings. Low voltage SiC Zener diodes were fabricated and tested to evaluate potential benefits of their application as a component of intrinsically safe barriers. The diodes demonstrated mixed avalanche-tunnel breakdown at reverse bias voltages of 23 V with positive temperature coefficients of breakdown voltages of about 0. 4 mV/°C.

40|$|The design, {{construction}} and exploitation of electrical equipment {{intended to be}} used in <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> presents a series of difficulties. Therefore, the approach of these phases requires special attention concerning technical, financial and occupational health and safety aspects. In order for them not to generate an ignition source for the <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> such equipment have to be subjected to a series of type tests aiming to decrease the explosion risk in technological installations which operate in <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> Explosion protection being a concern of researchers and authorities worldwide, testing and certification of explosion-proof electrical equipment, required for their conformity assessment, are extremely important, taking into account the unexpected explosion hazard due to <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> risk which has to be minimized in order to ensure the occupational health and safety of workers, for preventing material losses and for decreasing the environmental pollution.

40|$|As {{with all}} motors, the {{performance}} of an induction motor while at standstill, whether {{in the course of}} a normal starting sequence or as a result of stall, is of crucial importance to a designer. Since the motor is under full voltage, a fast temperature rise may occur in different parts of the motor before the power source is isolated, or substantial acceleration occurs. This may damage some parts of the motor, or cause a premature aging of the electric insulation in various parts of the motor, in particular the stator winding. In addition, in applications where the motor is surrounded by a <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> an unexpected temperature rise at any point in a motor may be enough to ignite the existing mixture of gases. To avoid such phenomena, the temperature distribution in the motor should be predicted as accurately as possible to ensure reliable protection of the motor against overheating in critical points. This work is an attempt to improve the accuracy of prediction of transient temperature distribution in an induction motor, with particular attention to the modelling of deep-bar cage motors.

40|$|A {{tube bundle}} system (TBS) is a {{mechanical}} system for continuously drawing gas samples through tubes from multiple monitoring points {{located in an}} underground coal mine. The gas samples are drawn via vacuum pump {{to the surface and}} are typically analyzed for oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Results of the gas analyses are displayed and recorded for further analysis. Trends in the composition of the mine atmosphere, such as increasing methane or carbon monoxide concentration, can be detected early, permitting rapid intervention that prevents problems, such as a <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmosphere</b> behind seals, fire or spontaneous combustion. TBS is a well-developed technology and has been used in coal mines around the world for more than 50 years. Most longwall coal mines in Australia deploy a TBS, usually with 30 to 40 monitoring points as part of their atmospheric monitoring. The primary uses of a TBS are detecting spontaneous combustion and maintaining sealed areas inert. The TBS might also provide mine atmosphere gas composition data after a catastrophe occurs in an underground mine, if the sampling tubes are not damaged. TBSs are not an alternative to statutory gas and ventilation airflow monitoring by electronic sensors or people; rather, they are an option to consider in an overall mine atmosphere monitoring strategy. This paper describes the hardware, software and operation of a TBS and presents one example of typical data from a longwall coal mine.

40|$|AbstractFor {{international}} trade and production of machinery used in <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> {{it is important to}} know about the regulations within the European Union. This paper presents an application of CHEMSAFE flammability data for fulfilling the requirements of the EU explosion protection directives. Most of the published data for flammability of substances are measured under atmospheric conditions although chemical processes operate often under non-atmospheric conditions. A couple of R&D projects were initiated in Germany to get more knowledge on explosion characteristics for non-atmospheric conditions. The explosion protection for machinery operated under non-atmospheric conditions is defined in the 2006 / 42 /EU Directive. CHEMSAFE fulfills this requirement while it contains data of flammable compounds measured under non-atmospheric conditions and with other oxidizers than air. Furthermore it includes flammability data for gas mixtures consisting of flammable, inert, and different oxidizing components and most of the data are measured according to international standards. Safety data on flammable dusts - such as minimum ignition energy, maximum explosion pressure, ignition temperatures - represents also an important part of the database. The <b>potentially</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>atmospheres</b> are defined in revised Directive 2014 / 34 /EU. For preparing risk assessment documents the following data for flammable gases and vapors, relating to the use of equipment, among others are necessary: Flammability limit, flash point, temperature class - auto-ignition temperature, maximum experimental safe gap. CHEMSAFE’ 2013 includes not only these data but also more than 200 triangular explosion diagrams, e. g. the newly measured methane/nitrogen/oxygen system under pressures up to 50 bars.
