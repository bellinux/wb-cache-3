Purchaser rights as consumer are still unprotected well either in contract phase or in the contract implementation phase.

40|$|The {{essay is}} {{concerned}} with the protection of investors against purchases of ‘junk bonds’. As financial transactions are characterized by inherent risk, contractual unconscionability is not the relevant legal issue to be dealt with. The argument submitted by the author is therefore that <b>protection</b> of <b>purchasers</b> of financial products should focus of the nature and consequences deriving from liability triggered by reliance on negligent misstatements concerning economic information which induces investors to purchase ‘junk bonds’. Moreover, as the complex process underlying the issue and placement of financial securities involves the contribution of different professionals, their different roles should be reflected in a gradated liability scale covering each player contributing to the provision of these financial products. The conclusion is that civil liability remedies do not necessarily provide the only possible answer for the protection of investors: in addition, alternative remedies subsequent to the occurrence of damages (i. e., stricter criminal penalties), or preventive measures (such as applicable rules of conduct), as well as collateral sanctions (reputational risks), or new powerful procedural tools (class actions) may be able to support and protect investors more effectively than simple civil liability rules...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the lack of}} <b>protection</b> granted to <b>purchasers</b> of goods encumbered with retention of title clauses. In chains of transactions, disponees are only able to acquire such title that their immediate disponor had. The difficulties involved in determining {{the extent to which}} the title is encumbered is magnified as chains of transactions extend. English law fails to acknowledge the vital role of authorization in cases involving pre-existing but unknowable encumbrances. The failures of English law can be usefully contrasted with the situation in the USA. Under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, a security interest can pass with the goods upon disposition, yet if the disposition is authorized, the security interest will merely attach to the proceeds of the disposition. The final purchaser will be able to retain the goods. Although prima facie similar to English law, the American case law demonstrates that authorization plays a substantially more influential role, and reduces the risk to purchasers in comparison with English law.

40|$|Chicago School {{antitrust}} policy rests {{upon the}} premise that the sole purpose of antitrust is to promote economic efficiency. This article shows that this foundation is flawed. The fundamental purpose of antitrust is to protect consumers. To protect purchasers from paying supracompetitive prices when they buy goods or services. This is the 2 ̆ 2 wealth transfer, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 theft 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 consumer welfare 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 <b>purchaser</b> <b>protection</b> 2 ̆ 2 explanation for antitrust. The article shows that the efficiency view originated in a detailed analysis of the legislative history of the Sherman Act undertaken by Robert Bork. Bork purported to show that Congress only cared about enhancing economic efficiency. To analyze Bork 2 ̆ 7 s arguments, this article first explains the underlying economic concepts, including Bork 2 ̆ 7 s misleading definition of the term, 2 ̆ 2 consumer surplus 2 ̆ 2 when he should have used the term 2 ̆ 2 total surplus 2 ̆ 2. This article then analyzes the legislative histories of the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Celler-Kefauver Act, and FTC Act. This analysis demonstrates that Congress 2 ̆ 7 s overriding concern when it enacted each law was with protecting consumers from paying supracompetitive prices. Congress did this because it believed that illegally acquired supracompetitive pricing constituted an 2 ̆ 2 unfair 2 ̆ 2 transfer of purchasers 2 ̆ 7 property to firms with market power. Economic efficiency was only a secondary concern. The only exception is the law 2 ̆ 7 s goal of protecting small sellers from anticompetitive behavior by buyers with illegally gained monopsony power. This limited concern, however, is just the mirror image of Congress 2 ̆ 7 desire to protect purchasers from exploitation. In both buy-side and sell-side cases, the overarching goal is the same - preventing firms that have unfairly acquired power from imposing noncompetitive prices or non-price terms on those they do business with. In both cases these firms 2 ̆ 2 unfairly 2 ̆ 2 acquire wealth. When conduct presents a conflict between the welfare of consumers and total welfare (e. g., a merger that raises prices but reduces costs), courts should choose <b>purchaser</b> <b>protection</b> over economic efficiency. This conclusion supports a more aggressive approach to many areas of antitrust...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} problem of gazumping, to {{consider}} the various factors which give rise to it, to examine the adequacy of existing legal doctrine in redressing it, to explore statutory provisions designed to reduce gazumping and to propose reform of the law to address the problem. The term gazumping refers to a practice by which a vendor accepts a purchaser's offer to purchase land or property, and before exchanging contracts, withdraws from the existing agreement in order to accept a higher price from another purchaser. This thesis proceeds on the assumption that gazumping is an undesirable practice, particularly from the prospective purchaser' perspective. The practice of gazumping initially boomed in a volatile property market with constantly rising house prices and where demand exceeded supply. A purchaser who believes he or she has secured the purchase of his or her desired property may suffer emotional stress and significant costs which cannot be recovered when the vendor reneges on his or her agreement. The thesis notes that gazumping occurs at the pre-contractual stage in the sale of property because there is no legally binding relationship before the formal exchange of contracts. The thesis posits that the existing law in various Australian jurisdictions offers inadequate <b>protection</b> to prospective <b>purchasers</b> of property. The thesis examines the inadequacy of existing legal doctrines and remedies in addressing the problem of gazumping at the pre-contractual stage and arrives at the conclusion that existing legal doctrine is inadequate. The thesis notes legislative and other measures in response to gazumping in Australia and other common law jurisdictions and concludes that these too were inadequate in not going far enough to eliminate or reduce gazumping. The competing merits of these approaches are considered. The thesis establishes that the solution to gazumping lies in an early <b>protection</b> of the <b>purchaser's</b> interest in land. This is because as soon as an agreement is enforceable the purchaser acquires an equitable interest and in the event of any breach of the agreement by the vendor, the purchaser, as a general rule, can obtain either damages or specific performance. The thesis raises seven key recommendations for law reform aimed to minimise the occurrence of gazumping and to provide the purchaser with tools against the practice of gazumping. It considers that the recommendations can minimise the undesirable practice of gazumping where the current law is inadequate and also achieve several other objectives...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the changes in Texas law in 1995, 2001, and 2005 created {{significant}} new <b>protections</b> for <b>purchasers</b> but created new problems and left several areas still in need of attention. Leveling the playing field, in short, was not enough. Part II of this Article explores the current lending landscape, the history of contract for deed, and why it is still used for home financing. Part III dissects the changes to Texas contract for deed legislation in 1995, 2001, and 2005. Part IV critiques those changes from a consumer protection viewpoint, suggesting that the typical consumer protection formula failed to resolve many of the abusive practices. In the contract for deed system, leveling {{the playing field is}} about more than the negotiation between the buyer and the seller. It focuses on the buyer's right to enjoy her property-to place a lien, make home improvements, or prevent foreclosure- regardless of the type of home financing she obtained. More meaningful disclosures and penalties for deceptive practices are important corrective steps, as are automatic conversions of contract for deed into mortgages and automatic conversion of lease-to-own agreements into purchase agreements. While this Article focuses primarily on hits and glaring misses in Texas contract for deed legislation, it also suggests a framework for looking at seller financing and residential property protection more generally. Despite significant legal protections, buyers are still losing their homes at an alarming rate and often do not recapture any of the money they have invested. If the goal of consumer protection is to balance the rights of purchasers and sellers and to maximize a homeowner's homestead rights and equity, the legislation should focus on removing barriers and artificial opt-in provisions that place less-sophisticated homeowners at a significant disadvantage...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of the statutory standard sale and purchase agreements as prescribed under Schedules G, H, I and J of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (‘the said agreements’) is mandatory for all house purchases from licensed housing developers in Peninsular Malaysia. However, according to the researcher’s Ph. D in law thesis, the said agreements are void under Islamic Law due {{to the existence of}} gharar al-fahish. The reason for this gharar is {{because of the lack of}} terms and conditions in the said agreements which can protect the rights and interests of purchasers especially when the housing projects are abandoned. Due to the invalidity of the said agreements, this may also affect the subsequent dealings and transactions for instance in the housing loan transactions with Islamic banks. Furthermore due to its invalidity the said agreements may become ‘insufficient and void instruments incapable of registration’ which cannot guarantee indefeasibility of the subsequent titles and interests in land to the interested parties under section 340 of the National Land Code 1965 (NLC). This research has identified certain terms and conditions in the said agreements which purportedly have not complied with the Islamic Law. This research has proposed certain shariah compliant model agreements for the said agreements. These shariah compliant model agreements would provide adequate <b>protection</b> to <b>purchasers</b> including when the housing projects are abandoned by the housing developers. The research methods used are purely shariah legal research and comparative research methodologies, viz comparative between the shariah principles and the conventional law (common law and Malaysian law) principles. These two methods were blended with social research method. Thus, this research is a hybrid of pure shariah legal, comparative legal and socio-legal research methodologies. This research has found that the said agreements are void according to the Quran, Sunnah and Qiyas as the said agreements contain gharar al-fahish elements as against the government and the vendor developers. However, despite inherently the said agreements are void under Islamic Law, they are still good and valid, at least, as against the purchasers due to hardship (mashaqqah) through the principles of maqasid al-shariah, maslahah al-mursalah, uruf and istihsan. This research has recommended shariah compliant model agreements purporting to replace the said agreements. The authorities, especially the housing authority (Ministry of Housing and Local Government), Islamic Banks and the public purchasers at large may benefit from the findings and recommendations of this research, especially in dealing with the problems of abandoned housing projects in Peninsular Malaysia...|$|R

The duty is a first charge on property, but if the property be parted with before the duty is paid the liability of the successor is transferred to the alienee. It is, therefore, usual in requisitions on title before conveyance, to demand for the <b>protection</b> of the <b>purchaser</b> the production of receipts for succession duty, as such receipts are an effectual protection notwithstanding any suppression or misstatement in the account on the footing of which the duty was assessed or any insufficiency of such assessment. The duty is by this act directed to be assessed as follows: on personal property, if the successor takes a limited estate, the duty is assessed on the principal value of the annuity or yearly income estimated according to the period during which he is entitled to receive the annuity or yearly income, and the duty is payable in four yearly instalments free from interest. If the successor takes absolutely he pays in a lump-sum duty on the principal value. On real property the duty is payable in eight half-yearly instalments without interest on the capital value of an annuity equal to the annual value of the property. Various minor changes were made. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 exempted personal estates under 300. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1888 charged an additional 1% on successions already paying 1% and an additional 11% on successions paying more than 1%.
