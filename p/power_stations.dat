5|$|Sri Lanka's {{electricity}} demand is currently met by nine thermal <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> fifteen large hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> and fifteen wind farms, {{with a smaller}} share from small hydro facilities and other renewables such as solar. Most hydroelectric and thermal/fossil fuel–based <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> {{in the country are}} owned and/or operated by the government via the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), while the renewable energy sector consists mostly of privately run plants operating on a power purchase agreement with the CEB.|$|E
5|$|The oil shale-fired {{electrical}} power industry started in 1924 when the Tallinn Power Station switched to oil shale. In 1933, it reached {{a capacity of}} 22megawatts (MW). Other oil shale-fired <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> were built in Püssi (3.7MW), Kohtla (3.7MW), Kunda (2.3MW), and Kiviõli (0.8MW). At the beginning of World War II, the total capacity of oil shale-fired <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> was 32.5MW. Only the Tallinn and Püssi <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> were connected to the grid.|$|E

50|$|The Lough Ree <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> {{is a large}} peat-fired <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in Lanesborough, in the Republic of Ireland. The station generates up 100 MWe of power, ranking as the Third largest peat-fired <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in the country, after West Offaly <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> at 150 MWe. and Edenderry <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> at 120 MWe. The <b>power</b> <b>station</b> was {{constructed}} as a replacement to the ageing 85 MWe Lanesborough <b>power</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
5|$|As of 2015, 1,464MW of {{the total}} thermal {{installed}} capacity was from state-owned fossil fuel power stations: 900MW from Lakvijaya, 380MW from the state-owned portion of Kelanitissa, 160MW from Sapugaskanda, and 24MW from Uthuru Janani. The remaining 641MW of the installed thermal capacity are from six privately owned <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> All thermal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> run on fuel oil, except Lakvijaya, which run on coal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> at Stella, as well as those at Dunston and Blyth (in 1981 and 2001 respectively), the {{northern}} part of North East England has become heavily dependent upon the National Grid for electricity.

5|$|The 500MW Sampur Power Station was {{in early}} stages of {{development}} since 2006, but was subsequently cancelled in 2016 due environmental concerns. Prior to its cancellation, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy also made a statement that no more coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> will be commissioned, making Lakvijaya the only coal-fired power station in the country. Any future thermal <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> will also be natural gas–run, to reduce the nation's carbon footprint.|$|E
5|$|The British {{demand for}} {{electricity}} increased after the Second World War. In the North East of England {{this led to}} the expansion of existing <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> at Dunston and Billingham in the late 1940s, the two new Stella <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> and the construction of two more large stations built at Blyth later in the 1960s. This new generating capacity quickly met the demand for power. The British Electricity Authority were granted permission to construct the Stella North and Stella South <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> in 1951. The two stations were originally projected to cost around £15,000,000.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the coal}} {{produced}} from Northern Coalfields Limited is dispatched to pithead power plants. Some of the power plants in the area are:Singrauli Super Thermal <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> Rihand Thermal <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> Anpara Thermal <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> Orba Thermal <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> Vindhyachal Thermal <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> and Renusagar Thermal Power Plant.|$|R
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} from the <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> {{was still a}} factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the closure}} of Dunston power station, along with the later {{closures}} of the <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> at Stella and Blyth, {{the northern part of}} North East England has become heavily dependent upon the National Grid for electrical supply. However, in the south of the region there are still two large <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> at Hartlepool and Teesside, meaning that the south of the region does not depend upon the National Grid for electrical supply as much as the north of the region.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significant}} reclamation {{on the two}} sites very little evidence remains of the <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> other than {{a small number of}} bricks and steel rods. Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E

50|$|Horahora <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> was {{an early}} {{hydroelectric}} <b>power</b> <b>station</b> on the Waikato River in New Zealand. It was the country’s first large-scale <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> completed in 1913. Initially built to service a gold mine, the <b>power</b> <b>station</b> was expanded to supply {{a significant part of}} the North Island. The <b>power</b> <b>station</b> remained in use until was submerged by Lake Karapiro, which was formed to supply the larger Karapiro <b>Power</b> <b>Station.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{merchant}} solar <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> {{where the}} electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network, the levelised cost of solar energy {{will need to}} match the wholesale electricity price. This point is sometimes called 'wholesale grid parity' or 'busbar parity'.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{activities}} ceased at {{the dock}} with {{the closure of the}} <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> The Port of Bristol Authority finally closed the dock in 1992.|$|E
