5000|$|In 1918 Sutherland zealously {{assisted}} Lloyd George {{in building}} a case to discredit Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice in {{the circumstances surrounding the}} Maurice Debate. He was one Lloyd George's closest policy advisers. He understood that the old Liberal themes of education, Free trade and temperance had lost their resonance with the electorate. In their place he urged an emphasis on social and economic issues. This analysis harked back to the social liberalism of the Liberal Governments of 1908-1914 and certainly pre-figured the radical direction Liberal policy took in the later 1920s when Lloyd George was reinstated as party leader and commissioned the series of ‘coloured books’ on land, industry and employment policy which formed the basis of the Liberal manifesto for the 1929 general election. Sutherland also participated in the building up of the Coalition Liberal organisation in the constituencies, particularly in Scotland [...] and took charge of the <b>publicity</b> <b>programme.</b> His warnings on the need to have good constituency organisation if the Lloyd George National Liberals were going to possess effective local influence went largely unheeded however.|$|E

40|$|Time of use (TOU) tariff {{is common}} {{practice}} in developed economies around the world. These tariffs incentivise and encourage customers to lower peak loads {{in order to reduce}} their electricity bills. The objective for the power utility is to reduce peak loads and/or shift load from peak to off-peak periods. Improvements in the load factor hold benefits to the utility in terms of constant system loading, improved sales and essentially a cost saving for the utility dependent on its tariff structure. In Sri Lanka, TOU tariff has been mandate from 31 March 2011 for all consumers in customer categories of I- 2, I- 3, H- 2 and H- 3 as a means of demand side management measures and load factor improvement. This report will discuss the effective application of TOU tariffs for industrial and commercial power users. Further it will discuss the consequences of recently introduced TOD (Time of day) tariff structure for industrial and hotel sector consumers. As the first step of this study demand and supply side data were collected for the period from January 2009 to August 2011. Based on those data, the system average and peak power variations and trends were observed. It was shown that there is a higher rate of increase in average power than the rate of increase in peak power for the period beyond April 2011. This is a positive indication of proper adaptation of TOU tariff structure. In the past, load factor was calculated without considering the effect of peak power generation by Small Power Producers (SPPs) on the peak demand. Thus it was required to redefine the method of calculating load factor considering the contribution from Small Power Producers (SPPs) for the peak demand. It has shown that the conventional load factor is about 2 % higher than the actual. Energy consumptions of bulk consumers who were already in two tire or three tire time of day (TOD) tariff structure were collected for the period from September 2010 to July 2011 and it was observed that there is a declining trend in percentage consumption during peak time. For the programme to be effective proper <b>publicity</b> <b>programmes</b> and workshops should be arranged for the benefit of consumers coming under this category, educating them and even providing them with technical and financial assistance. Steps would have to be taken to label appliances depending on their energy efficiency and enforce the use of labelled energy efficient equipment by consumers. By making the TOU tariff programme effective a very specific advantage that would be derived by the power sector utilities through load levelling and peak demand curtailment is the improvement of capacity factor of plant and equipment, continuing to maintain a lower growth rate and slower augmentation rate of plant. The load factor improvement and peak load curtailment with the consumer energy efficiency programme would bring immense financial and economic benefits to the country. By reducing the import of hydrocarbon fuel, much foreign exchange can be saved and savings can be utilized for other important tasks...|$|R

Scenes showing Phil and Rainie taking the drug crack cocaine in 2010 prompted over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way—and at no point—glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. [...] We took care to signal the nature of the episode's content to viewers in advance through <b>programme</b> <b>publicity</b> and billings, and the BBC Action Line was trailed following the episode for anyone affected by the issue. In addition to this, our website includes links to organisations who can offer help and advice on this issue. [...] We worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope, throughout the editorial process to ensure that we handled the storyline accurately and sensitively." [...] The Daily Mail asked some viewers about the scenes, including one who said, [...] "I was shocked at the content of the episode. The graphic detail of the drug use with Phil and his friend was terrible and in view of the time that the episode was aired, entirely inappropriate. Viewers do not need to see this kind of storyline. Please, BBC, no more of these horrid storylines." [...] Other viewers said, [...] "They look like they're having a good time. They're in danger of making it look appealing."

5000|$|The debacle sparked some {{internal}} disputes {{within the}} station, which caused doubt within the Students Union {{as to whether}} they could continue to allow URE to run without tight control of the output: in the resulting argument (from URE committee meeting minutes in 1984) URE's management took the station off air for the latter part of 1984. The dispute was only resolved when URE agreed to relinquish its office, in return for the Union to agree to abide by acknowledging URE's autonomy and a management structure decided by internal voting by the stations members, who were deemed to be [...] "anyone enrolled in the university, its staff, or anyone they deemed a fit member of the radio station". (URE constitution 1987). This constitution worked by having a committee of a Station Manager and Programme Controller on equal footing, plus a head of News, Engineering, Publicity, Treasurer, Secretary, and Record Librarian. All had a vote in committee decisions, and the union was relegated to a position at which the station would put in its request for a budget {{at the end of the}} year, and maintain its own finances. In 1988 in a formal referendum URE members voted to accept advertising for the first time, but turned down any suggestion to playlist the station. At the time URE had extensive <b>publicity,</b> including a <b>programme</b> schedule that was produced and sent to each flat on campus every two weeks with a name on the pun of Radio Times (Radio Tubes, Radio Tiles, Radio Tynes etc.): by 1988 the name Radio Crimes had stuck - it was printed fortnightly until 1996, with a wider circulation than any SU publication.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with {{a study of}} policy of Hong Kong Government in effective building management. With the Government’s established policy in advocating building management, the Home Affairs Department (HAD) make use of competitions to induce property management companies (PMCs) and owners’ organizations to improve the management standard. After semi-structured interviews with organizer, judges and participants of competition, the Government’s policy is analyzed. Laguna Verde (LV) in Kowloon City District is taken as an example for illustration. It was found that they make use of techniques similar to business competitive strategies for preparing the competition. This may be the reason for their continued championship. It was concluded that the policy is well address to the objective of advocating quality building management and therefore effective. In addition, the policy has attributes of being an efficient policy, with equity and community acceptance. The institutional constraints are also less because the policy well aligns with other policies. In addition, the policy is flexible and different format can be adopted to address different policy and social needs. Quality Building Management Competition (QBMC) is a territory-wide district-base programme organized by the HAD. LV {{has been successful in}} obtaining the championship in Kowloon City District QBMC for five consecutive terms, i. e., 2004 - 05, 2005 - 06, 2006 - 07, 2008 - 09 & 2009 - 10 (the term of 2007 - 08 was suspended). Using LV as an example, it is considered the factors for achieving quality management. The various strategies adopted by LV in obtaining the championship are studied. It is then utilized to illustrate the key elements of quality management through owners’ and occupiers’ participation. These include the set up of management committees / owners’ corporations (OCs), the representative groups, to manage common parts of buildings and the appointment of PMCs, the trade practitioners, to provide services including professional support and management of common areas. It is also illustrated in this paper that there are other dimensions of institutional arrangements, ranging from the establishment of legal framework, provision of professional and support service to OCs by the Government, to the statutory regulation on the property management industry, which contribute to effective building management and maintenance. HAD, in response to government’s call on encouraging owners’ / occupiers participation in private building management, makes use of this competition to promote the good practice of building management. PMCs and OCs also make use of the competition in promoting their public image and enhancing the value of their properties. Therefore, a case study of how LV obtains the championship and an analysis in the implication of the competition in implementing the Government’s policy and serving the objective in private building management is valuable. The literature review includes the conceptual framework of challenge in managing common property, i. e. the tragedy of the commons versus the tragedy of the anticommons: when multiple owners hold rights to exclude others from a scarce resource and no one exercises an effective privilege of use, the resource might be prone to overuse / underuse. In the context of building management, this refers to the attribute that common area of the buildings is of multiple ownerships. If the rights and obligations of such communal private property are not clearly defined, this will inevitably lead to lack of proper maintenance of the common parts and in turn the dilapidation of buildings and the diminishing value of properties. This problem known as the tragedy of the commons and the anitcommons gives rise to different institutional arrangements for property right governance or property management. It is further investigated into the choice among different institutional arrangements and the collective action of owners’ active participation in building management by referring to transaction costs analysis and Collective Interest Model. Besides, the literature review gives background information of the competition, property management in general in Hong Kong, description of Kowloon City District QBMC and competitive strategies, in which both positioning and resources based approach will be applied. This is a descriptive research and qualitative method will be adopted. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to the key staff participated in the competition. The organizer, that is, HAD and District Council (DC), as well as key members of the judging panel will also be interviewed. From the analysis on various opinions from participating parties in the QBMC, it is concluded that QBMC, being a competition programme, together with a series of individual and continual <b>publicity</b> and educational <b>programmes,</b> performs the function of facilitating effective building management by OCs and service quality improvement committed by PMCs. It echoes to and is efficacious in achieving the Government’s policy in encouraging owners’ / occupiers participation in private building management. To a certain extent, the Government’s role in provision of well-established statutory framework and support services for OCs, as well as in implementation of regulatory framework for private property industry in Hong Kong contributes to effective building management. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
