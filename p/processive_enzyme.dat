50|$|Nolte and {{coworkers}} developed an artificial <b>processive</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{in a form}} of manganese porphyrin rotaxane that treads along a long polymer of alkene and catalyze multiple rounds of alkene epoxidation. Manganese (III) ion in the porphyrin is the molecule's catalytic center, capable of epoxidation {{in the presence of}} an oxygen donor and an activating ligand. With a small ligand such pyridine that binds manganese from inside the cavity of the rotaxane, epoxidation happens outside the catalyst. With a large bulky ligand such as tert-butyl pyridine that does not fit inside the cavity however, epoxidation happens {{on the inside of the}} catalyst.|$|E
50|$|One {{challenge}} for the 'exonuclease approach', where a <b>processive</b> <b>enzyme</b> feeds individual bases, in the correct order, into the nanopore, is to integrate the exonuclease and the nanopore detection systems. In particular, {{the problem is that}} when an exonuclease hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in DNA, the subsequently released nucleotide is not necessarily guaranteed to directly move into, say, a nearby alpha-hemolysin nanopore. One idea is to attach the exonuclease to the nanopore, perhaps through biotinylation to the beta barrel hemolysin. The central pore of the protein may be lined with charged residues arranged so that the positive and negative charges appear {{on opposite sides of the}} pore. However, this mechanism is primarily discriminatory and does not constitute a mechanism to guide nucleotides down some particular path.|$|E
50|$|Though polysaccharides {{are also}} biopolymers, {{it is not}} so common to talk of 'sequencing' a polysaccharide, for several reasons. Although many polysaccharides are linear, many have branches. Many {{different}} units (individual monosaccharides) can be used, and bonded in different ways. However, the main theoretical reason is that whereas the other polymers listed here are primarily generated in a 'template-dependent' manner by one <b>processive</b> <b>enzyme,</b> each individual join in a polysaccharide may be formed by a different enzyme. In many cases the assembly is not uniquely specified; depending on which enzyme acts, one of several different units may be incorporated. This can lead to a family of similar molecules being formed. This is particularly true for plant polysaccharides. Methods for the structure determination of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides include NMR spectroscopy and methylation analysis.|$|E

While processive cellulases with complementary functions differ in structure and catalytic mechanism, processive chitinases belong to one single protein family with similar active site architectures. Using the unique model system of Serratia marcescens with two processive chitinases attacking {{opposite ends of the}} substrate, we here show that different directionalities of processivity are correlated to distinct differences in the kinetic signatures for hydrolysis of oligomeric tetra-N-acetyl chitotetraose...|$|R

The non-lysosomal removal of these proteins is performed by <b>processive</b> <b>enzymes,</b> which belong to the AAA+superfamily, such as the 26 S proteasome and Clp proteases. One important protein degradation pathway, that is common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is the N-end rule. In this pathway, proteins bearing a destabilizing amino acid residue at their N-terminus are degraded either by the ClpAP protease in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or by the ubiquitin proteasome system in the eukaryotic cytoplasm. A suite of enzymes and other molecular components are also required for the successful generation, recognition and delivery of N-end rule substrates to their cognate proteases.

Statistical analysis differentiated single-step hinge closure from enzyme opening, which requires two steps. Seven independent time scales governing lysozyme's activity were observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A <b>processive</b> <b>enzyme</b> binds a {{polymeric}} substrate and catalyzes {{a series}} of similar chcmical reactions along that polymer before releasing the fully modified polymer to solvent. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) is a nonprocessive endoribonuclease that binds the bases of adjacent R N A residues in three enzymic subsites: B 1, B 2, and B 3. The B 1 subsite binds only to residues having a pyrimidine base, while the B 2 subsite prefers adenine and the B 3 subsite prefers a purine base. RNase A mutants were created in which all natural amino acids were substituted for Thr 45 or Phel 20, two residues of the B 1 subsite. These pools of mutant enzymes were screened for mutants that catalyze the cleavage of R N A after purine residues. The Ala 45 and Gly 45 enzymes cleave poly(A), poly(C), and poly(U) efficiently and with 1 03 - 105 -fold increases in purine/pyrimidine specificity. Thus, substrate binding can be uncoupled from substrate turnover in catalysis by RNase A. In addition, both mutant enzymes cleave poly(A) processively. Our results provide a new paradigm: a <b>processive</b> <b>enzyme</b> has subsites, each specific for a repeating motif within a polymeric substrate. Further, we propose that processive enzymes bind more tightly to motifs that do repeat than to those that do not. During enzymatic catalysis, noncovalent and covalent bonds are formed and broken. Upon binding, an enzyme and its substrate exchange noncovalent interactions with solvent and solute molecules for interactions with each other. During turnover, a medley of devices is used to effect changes in the covalent bonds of the bound substrate (Jencks, 1987). Altering the substrate specificity of an enzyme requires adjusting interactions that mediate substrate binding but not those critical to substrate turnover. Impressive results have been obtained in the redesign of several proteases (Craik et al. ...|$|E
40|$|RNA helicases, {{like their}} DNA-specific counterparts, can {{function}} as <b>processive</b> <b>enzymes,</b> unwinding RNA with a defined step size in a unidirectional fashion. Recombinant nuclear DEAD-box protein p 68 and its close relative p 72 are reported here {{to function in}} a similar fashion, though the processivity of both RNA helicases appears {{to be limited to}} only a few consecutive catalytic steps. The two proteins resemble each other also with regard to other biochemical properties. We have found that both proteins exhibit an RNA annealing in addition to their helicase activity. By using both these activities the enzymes are able in vitro to catalyse rearrangements of RNA secondary structures that otherwise are too stable to be resolved by their low processive helicase activities. RNA rearrangement proceeds via protein induced formation and subsequent resolution of RNA branch migration structures, whereby the latter step is dependent on ATP hydrolysis. The analysed DEAD-box proteins are reminiscent of certain DNA helicases, for example those found in bacteriophages T 4 and T 7, that catalyse homologous DNA strand exchange in cooperation with the annealing activity of specific single strand binding proteins...|$|R
40|$|Nature {{has evolved}} complex enzyme {{architectures}} that facilitate the synthesis and {{manipulation of the}} biopolymers DNA and RNA, including enzymes capable of attaching to the biopolymer substrate and performing several rounds of catalysis before dissociating. Many of these 2 ̆ 7 processive 2 ̆ 7 enzymes have a toroidal shape and completely enclose the biopolymer while moving along its chain, as exemplified by the DNA enzymes T 4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme and λ-exonucleoase. The overall architecture of these systems resembles that of rotaxanes, in which a long molecule or polymer is threaded through a macrocycle. Here we describe a rotaxane that mimics the ability of <b>processive</b> <b>enzymes</b> to catalyse multiple rounds of reaction while the polymer substrate stays bound. The catalyst consists of a substrate binding cavity incorporating a manganese(III) porphyrin complex that oxidizes alkenes within the toroid cavity, provided a ligand has been attached to the outer face of the toroid to both activate the porphyrin complex and shield it {{from being able to}} oxidize alkenes outside the cavity.

Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the α–hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore controlled by wild-type phi 29 DNA polymerase (phi 29 DNAP). DNA strands were examined in single file order at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. The registry error probability (either an insertion or deletion during one pass along a template strand) ranged from 10 % to 24. 5 % absent optimization. This general strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual template strands and is transferrable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis.

SecA conformational changes promote directed migration of the polymeric substrate through the translocase, in steps of 20 - 30 aminoacyl residues.

In a previous study (Benen, J. A. E., Kester, H. C. M., and Visser, J. (1999) Eur. J.

40|$|Many {{enzymes that}} hydrolyze {{insoluble}} crystalline polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin guide detached single-polymer chains through {{long and deep}} active-site clefts, leading to processive (stepwise) degradation of the polysaccharide. We have studied the links between enzyme efficiency and processivity by analyzing the effects of mutating aromatic residues in the substrate-binding groove of a processive chitobiohydrolase, chitinase B from Serratia marcescens. Mutation of two tryptophan residues (Trp- 97 and Trp- 220) close to the catalytic center (subsites + 1 and + 2) led to reduced processivity and a reduced ability to degrade crystalline chitin, suggesting that these two properties are linked. Most remarkably, the loss of processivity in the W 97 A mutant {{was accompanied by a}} 29 -fold increase in the degradation rate for single-polymer chains as present in the soluble chitin-derivative chitosan. The properties of the W 220 A mutant showed a similar trend, although mutational effects were less dramatic. Processivity is thought to contribute to the degradation of crystalline polysaccharides because detached single-polymer chains are kept from reassociating with the solid material. The present results show that this processivity comes at a large cost in terms of enzyme speed. Thus, in some cases, it might be better to focus strategies for enzymatic depolymerization of polysaccharide biomass on improving substrate accessibility for nonprocessive enzymes rather than on improving the properties of <b>processive</b> <b>enzymes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of cell shape across generations is remarkably robust in most bacteria. Even when deformations are acquired, growing cells progressively recover their original shape once the deforming factors are eliminated. For instance, straight-rod-shaped bacteria grow curved when confined to circular microchambers, but straighten in a growth-dependent fashion when released. Bacterial cell shape is {{maintained by the}} peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, a giant macromolecule of glycan strands that are synthesized by <b>processive</b> <b>enzymes</b> and cross-linked by peptide chains. Changes in cell geometry require modifying the PG and therefore depend directly on the molecular-scale properties of PG structure and synthesis. Using a mathematical model we quantify the straightening of curved Caulobacter crescentus cells after disruption of the cell-curving crescentin structure. We observe that cells straighten {{at a rate that}} is about half (57 %) the cell growth rate. Next we show that in the absence of other effects there exists a mathematical relationship between the rate of cell straightening and the processivity of PG synthesis—the number of subunits incorporated before termination of synthesis. From the measured rate of cell straightening this relationship predicts processivity values that are in good agreement with our estimates from published data. Finally, we consider the possible role of three other mechanisms in cell straightening. We conclude that regardless of the involvement of other factors, intrinsic properties of PG processivity provide a robust mechanism for cell straightening that is hardwired to the cell wall synthesis machinery...|$|R

Protein dynamics have been widely shown {{to play a role in}} enzyme catalysis; however, the interplay between substrate dynamics and enzymatic activity is less understood. We report insights into the role of dynamics of substrates in the enzymatic activity of PME from Erwinia chrysanthemi, a <b>processive</b> <b>enzyme</b> that catalyzes the hydrolysis of methylester groups from the galacturonic acid residues of homogalacturonan chains, the major component of pectin. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations of this PME in complex with decameric homogalacturonan chains possessing different degrees and patterns of methylesterification show how the carbohydrate substitution pattern governs the dynamics of the substrate in the enzyme’s binding cleft, such that substrate dynamics represent a key prerequisite for the PME biological activity. The analyses reveal that correlated rotations around glycosidic bonds of monosaccharide subunits at and immediately adjacent to the active site are a necessary step to ensure substrate processing. Moreover, only substrates with the optimal methylesterification pattern attain the correct dynamical behavior to facilitate processive catalysis.

A translational fusion between pnp and lacZ was introduced into the chromosome of a delta lac strain to study the expression of pnp. In the presence of increased cellular concentrations of polynucleotide phosphorylase, {{the level of the}} hybrid beta-galactosidase is repressed, whereas the synthesis rate of the corresponding message is not significantly affected. In the absence of pnp, the level of the hybrid protein increases strongly. Thus, polynucleotide phosphorylase is post-transcriptionally autocontrolled.

40|$|The {{structures}} {{of a number}} of <b>processive</b> <b>enzymes</b> have been determined recently. These proteins remain attached to their polymeric substrates and may perform thousands of rounds of catalysis before dissociating. Based on the degree of enclosure of the substrate, the structures fall into two broad categories. In one group, the substrate is partially enclosed, while in the other class, enclosure is complete. In the latter case, enclosure is achieved by way of an asymmetric structure for some enzymes while others use a symmetrical toroid. In those cases where the protein completely encloses its polymeric substrate, the two are topologically linked and an immediate explanation for processivity is provided. In cases where there is only partial enclosure, the structural basis for processivity is less obvious. There are, for example, pairs of proteins that have quite similar structures but differ substantially in their processivity. It does appear, however, that the <b>enzymes</b> that are <b>processive</b> tend to be those that more completely enclose their substrates. In general terms, proteins that do not use topological restraint appear to achieve processivity by using a large interaction surface. This allows the enzyme to bind with moderate affinity at a multitude of adjacent sites distributed along its polymeric substrate. At the same time, the use of a large interaction surface minimizes the possibility that the enzyme might bind at a small number of sites with much higher affinity, which would interfere with sliding. Proteins that can both slide along a polymeric substrate, and, as well, recognize highly specific sites (e. g., some site-specific DNA-binding proteins) appear to undergo a conformational change between the cognate and noncognate-binding modes...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that the electrophoretic mobility of the polysaccharide pectin in typical capillary electrophoresis (CE) experiments is determined largely by its chain-averaged charge density, irrespective {{of how that}} charge is distributed. This {{was found to be}} the case for both high and low calcium sensitive sister fractions separated from a mother sample on the grounds of calcium affinity and for blocky methylester distributions generated by a <b>processive</b> demethylating <b>enzyme.</b> The blockiness of the generated intramolecular methylester distribution was substantiated experimentally, also by CE, by observing the oligomeric digest fragments produced by incubation with endo-polygalacturonase II from Aspergillus niger. The conclusion that the CE migration time is largely invariant to the intramolecular methylester distribution supports the idea that the CE peak shapes can be used to give a useful indication of the intermolecular methylester distribution...|$|R
40|$|An endo-exonuclease {{has been}} {{purified}} from cultured monkey (CV- 1) cells. The enzyme which was purified to near homogeneity to be a 65 kDa monomeric protein. The single-strand DNase activity is endonucleolytic and nonprocessive, whereas the double-strand DNase activity is exonucleolytic and <b>processive.</b> The <b>enzyme</b> {{was also found}} to have RNase activity using poly-rA as substrate. The pH optimum for ss-DNase is 8 and for ds-DNase it is 7. 5. Both DNase activities require a divalent metal ion (Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, Ca 2 +, Zn 2 +) for activity and exhibit the same kinetics of heat inactivation. The purified protein binds to and cleaves a synthetic Holliday junction substrate. The overall enzymatic characteristics of the mammalian protein {{are very similar to}} the putative recombination endo-exonucleases purified from Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|R
