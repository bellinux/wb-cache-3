Drawing on a Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) -funded project on the growing risk of plant diseases in the UK, current and future challenges to plant health are discussed. It is well recognized that farmers {{have an important role}} in shaping plant health policies at a time of major structural changes in agricultural industries. However, the role of consumers has also much potential to improve sustainability of plant disease management options. The <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation</b> is catching up with the many recent developments in plant health, but needs to be integrated with policies aimed at achieving animal and human health. Interdisciplinary approaches in research on plant health, as well as an increasing involvement of stakeholders in the management of plant epidemics, are to be welcomed. Plant diseases also influence (and are influenced by) land use and environmental regulations in general. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of new plant disease outbreaks, particularly when combined with globalization of trade, intensification of land use and structural evolution of the agricultural sector. To tackle the many challenges to plant health, it is mandatory to ensure long-term funding for interdisciplinary plant health research and managemen...|$|E
40|$|In 2002, typical {{symptoms}} of bacterial spot disease of stone fruits caused by Xanthomomas arboricola pv. pruni (Xap) were observed {{for the first}} time on Japanese plum in Badajoz (south-western Spain). During the following years, the pathogen was found in seven other eastern and northern Spanish provinces (Valencia, Alicante, Zaragoza, Huesca, Navarra, Lérida and Mallorca) affecting different cultivars of Japanese plum, nectarine, peach and almond. There are few previous reports of Xap on almond, the Spanish outbreaks constituting its first detection on this host in the European Union (EU). Identification of the pathogen was performed using biochemical tests, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) profiles, conventional and real-time PCR, and hypersensitivity reaction on tobacco leaves. Pathogenicity was demonstrated by inoculation of young potted plants of peach, plum or almond and successful re-isolations from plants with symptoms. In areas where infected plants were found, eradication programs were set up since Xap has a quarantine status according to <b>phytosanitary</b> EU <b>legislation...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{memorandum}} is {{a summary}} of a 32 page study prepared by O’Connor and Company which sets forth the major legal issues {{in connection with the}} WTO legality of the EC’s sanitary and <b>phytosanitary</b> (SPS) <b>legislation</b> as well as the traceability rules to come into force on 1 January 2005. The legislation concerned consists mainly of traceability requirements, conditions for equivalency of the SPS standards of third countries and mutual recognition agreements. In conclusion, the study suggest that the EC legislation can be assumed to hinder trade, {{but it is not clear}} that all aspects of the rules are inconsistent with WTO rules. The study concludes that in order to challenge the traceability rules and those aspects of the SPS rules which are inconsistent with the WTO agreements the ACP group should take advantage of the opportunities offered by the current WTO rules and of a favourable negotiating context (the EPA and Doha negotiations), rather than pursuing WTO dispute settlement...|$|R
40|$|Description The {{objective}} of this research project is to collate and disseminate information relating {{to the performance of}} varieties under organic conditions and to facilitate the use of a knowledge transfer centre by producers and seed suppliers. The website will list all vegetable and cereal varieties available as organic seed and include performance data in organic and non-organic conditions where this is available. The research will collate and disseminate published data on variety performance under UK conditions as well as making the latest variety trials data carried out in the UK rapidly and easilly available for organic producers. It will also group varieties that have similar performance characteristics together for key crops. This will support organic producers searching for appropriate varieties grown from organic seed. The above information will be made accessible to the organic sector via the internet website: www. cosi. org. uk Centre of Organic Seed Information (COSI). The Centre will be used as a resource to disseminate research findings, such as variety trials and a value judgement of grower experience (derived from SA questionnaires) to insure effective technology transfer. A simple search tool on COSI will enable users to search for performance data by variety. COSI will also communicate any standards changes relating to organic seed and will include updates from the four seed working groups that were established by the Soil Association in 2000. In addition latest news and information from existing research projects will be posted on the site, including information on seed treatments and organic seed production techniques. The site will also direct users to the latest legislation in all seed related areas including seed <b>legislation,</b> <b>phytosanitary</b> requirements and latest organic legislation. COSI will be supported by a telephone helpline, run by staff experienced in issues relating to organic seed, that will be able to assist the organic sector in accessing and understanding the information on variety performance trials and standards. The research meets a number of recommendations made within the Governments Organic Action Plan including: - organic feed and seed production should be encouraged - standards development towards consumer expectations, - R&D contracts should include clear strategy for technology transfer It will also be of great help to certification bodies and producers searching for varieties with particular performance charactersitics. Objective 1. To collate, and disseminate organic and non-organic performance information in UK coditions for vegetable and cereal varieties available as organic seed. 2. To maintain constant contact with research organisations carrying out organic variety trials on an annual basis and insure that results are collated in a speedy and user friendly manor. Organisations that the project will work with include Duchy College, Welsh College of Horticulture, HRI, HDRA and Elm Farm Research Centre. 3. To facilitate, collate and disseminate UK wide exchange of data from producers on how varieties have performed under their conditions using a standardised but uniform scoring system. 4. To develop a fully functional Centre of Organic Seed Information accessible over the phone through a telephone support service and via the internet at www. COSI. org. uk. The centre will be used as a vehicle to find up to date variety performance data and latest variety trials, keep up to date with news on organic seed, find out about changing standards and learn about producers experiences with different varieties grown from organic seed. The centre will be the definitve knowledge transfer tool for all organic seed and variety related information and will be used widely by non organic farmers and growers searching for independent variety performance data. 5. To group varieties on COSI, with similar performance characteristics...|$|R
40|$|<b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation</b> {{is widely}} {{thought to be}} the most {{effective}} means of limiting the entry of alien pathogens without hindering trade. However, there is increasing evidence of limitations and weaknesses in phytosanitary systems worldwide. One such case is the entry and establishment of Colletotrichum acutatum in the UK in the 1980 s. To investigate this further, data sets of disease incidence gathered by the authorities responsible for plant health between 1984 and 2008 were analysed to determine how and why the pathogen entered the UK and became established on strawberries. Results suggest that the disease entered the UK in 1982 on plants originating from the USA, a year earlier than the first UK record of the disease was reported. At least 54 further cases of infested plant material breached phytosanitary procedures and entered the UK, 75 % of which originated from EU countries. Moreover, internal trade transmission was found to be highly influential in the successful spread of the disease. The effectiveness of phytosanitary procedures is limited when the sector is importing large numbers of plants from nurseries that have a track record of selling infested plant material, even if they are accompanied by a plant passport. By taking greater responsibility in limiting the spread of quarantine diseases, nurseries throughout the EU have an important role to play in limiting the entry of alien pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The {{trade in}} plants for {{planting}} (P 4 P) {{is one of}} the major pathways for the introduction of pests. The strong increase in world trade in the past decades appears to have led to an increase in introductions of species transported by this pathway, and highlights the need for effective <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation</b> and measures. The phytosanitary regulations in most countries are based on the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, but there are large differences in countries' approaches to managing the risk of introducing invasive alien species through international plant trade. We reviewed elements of the phytosanitary legislations of ten countries on all continents and aimed to find regulations that prevent biological invasions. We found large differences in countries' phytosanitary regulations. New Zealand and Australia have the strictest phytosanitary regulations, while Europe maintains a general authorization for P 4 P imports. The remaining countries have regulations between these extremes. The evidence is sparse regarding the quality of implementation and effectiveness, and impact of individual phytosanitary measures. We recommend that National Plant Protection Organisations collect detailed information on P 4 P imports and the effectiveness of phytosanitary measures. Such information could provide a basis to improve a country's phytosanitary regulatory framework or could be used in risk assessments...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the identity and genetic diversity {{of more than}} 100 isolates belonging to Phyllosticta (teleomorph Guignardia), with particular emphasis on Phyllosticta citricarpa and Guignardia mangiferae s. l. occurring on Citrus. Phyllosticta citricarpa is the causal agent of Citrus Black Spot and is subject to <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation</b> in the EU. This species is frequently confused with a taxon generally referred to as G. mangiferae, the presumed teleomorph of P. capitalensis, which is a non-pathogenic endophyte, commonly isolated from citrus leaves and fruits and {{a wide range of}} other hosts. DNA sequence analysis of the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1, 5. 8 S nrDNA, ITS 2) and partial translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (TEF 1), actin and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) genes resolved nine clades correlating to seven known, and two apparently undescribed species. Phyllosticta citribraziliensis is newly described as an endophytic species occurring on Citrus in Brazil. An epitype is designated for P. citricarpa from material newly collected in Australia, which is distinct from P. citriasiana, presently only known on C. maxima from Asia. Phyllosticta bifrenariae is newly described for a species causing leaf and bulb spots on Bifrenaria harrisoniae (Orchidaceae) in Brazil. It is morphologically distinct from P. capitalensis, which was originally described from Stanhopea (Orchidaceae) in Brazil; an epitype is designated here. Guignardia mangiferae, which was originally described from Mangifera indica (Anacardiaceae) in India, is distinguished from the non-pathogenic endophyte, P. brazilianiae sp. nov., which is common on M. indica in Brazil. Furthermore, a combined phylogenetic tree revealed the P. capitalensis s. l. clade to be genetically distinct from the reference isolate of G. mangiferae. Several names are available for this clade, the oldest being P. capitalensis. These results suggest that endophytic, non-pathogenic isolates occurring on a wide host range would be more correctly referred to as P. capitalensis. However, more genes need to be analysed to fully resolve the morphological variation still observed within this clade. ...|$|E
40|$|Open Access JournalThe ever growing {{international}} trade has limited efforts towards {{the prevention of}} introduction, spread and establishment of invasive organisms. Non-native pests can cause severe loss of production and lead to restriction in exchange of genetic materials and seed marketing across regions. Regulating pests’ movement through quarantine measures and establishment of regional boards {{has been identified as}} {{a way to deal with}} introduction and expansion of invasive organisms. This review analyzes the different pest regulations in the West African sub-region with a specific focus on the implementation of quarantine measures in rice as a case study. The various regulations related to seed production, certification and marketing, and quarantine regulations in West Africa were analyzed and their enforcement and performance were assessed through comparison to international standards, especially the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). Although a regional regulation on seeds and phytosanitary measures has been elaborated, ECOWAS countries are still enforcing their national phytosanitary legislations, which are nearly the same in all West African countries - they all aim at ensuring plant health by applying preventive and curative measures to prevent the introduction and spread of pests in their territory by controlling the import and export of plant materials and disseminating appropriate pest management techniques to boost agricultural production. Most ECOWAS countries are yet to submit their <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation</b> to IPPC to comply with Article VII. 2 i of the endorsed convention. In addition, the entry points are not well defined and provided to the IPPC according to the Article VII. 2 d of the convention. When the quarantine list is available, the organisms regulated for each crop species are not stated, posing a real problem not only for rice genetic resource exchanges for research purposes but also for rice seed trade. Efforts and resources should be devoted by each country to research on pests and regulatory mechanisms in order to define, among others, pest status in the region, and to update regularly the quarantine pests list in the West African region.

40|$|Guignardia citricarpa, {{the causal}} agent of Citrus Black Spot, {{is subject to}} <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation</b> in the European Union and the U. S. A. This species is {{frequently}} confused with G. mangiferae, which is a non-pathogenic, and is commonly isolated as an endophyte from citrus fruits and {{a wide range of}} other hosts. Recently, necrotic spots similar to those caused by G. citricarpa were observed on fruit of Citrus maxima intercepted in consignments exported from Asia. In these spots, pycnidia and conidia of a Guignardia species closely resembling G. citricarpa were observed, and therefore measures were taken for the consignments in line with the European Union legislation for G. citricarpa. To determine the identity of the causal organism on this new host, fungal isolates were subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1, 5. 8 S, ITS 2), translation elongation factor 1 -alpha (TEF 1) and actin genes. A combined phylogenetic tree resolved three species correlating to G. citricarpa, G. mangiferae and a previously undescribed species, Phyllosticta citriasiana sp. nov., closely related to G. citricarpa. Morphologically P. citriasiana can be distinguished from G. citricarpa by having larger conidia, longer conidial appendages, and in not producing any diffuse yellow pigment when cultivated on oatmeal agar (OA). Furthermore, it is distinguishable from G. mangiferae by having smaller conidia, with a narrower mucoid sheath. In culture, colonies of P. citriasiana can also be distinguished from G. citricarpa and G. mangiferae by being darker shades of grey and black on OA, malt extract agar (MEA), potato-dextrose agar, and cornmeal agar. Furthermore, cultures of P. citriasiana achieved optimal growth after 2 weeks at 21 - 27 °C, and ceased to grow at 30 - 33 °C. In contrast, colonies of G. citricarpa and G. mangiferae achieved optimal growth at 27 - 30 °C, and ceased to grow at 30 - 36 °C Colonies of P. citriasiana also grew faster than those of G. citricarpa and G. mangiferae on OA and MEA. Phyllosticta citriasiana appears to be a harmful pathogen of Citrus maxima, causing a tan spot on fruit, underlining the need for further surveys and research to determine its distribution and host range...|$|E
40|$|The carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae Zeller, is a pest of {{agricultural}} commodities and stored products around the world. Carob moth {{is known to}} infest citrus in the Mediterranean region and in southern Africa. In grapefruit cultivars, carob moth infestations are associated {{with high levels of}} mealybug. However, although this relationship has been observed in other citrus types such as Navel oranges, this has never been quantified. A recent survey of infested fruit from various production areas in South Africa indicated that the pest status of carob moth on Navel oranges may have been underestimated. As a result of the incidental pest status of carob moth on citrus in South Africa in the past, a species specific integrated pest management (IPM) programme does not exist. Therefore, the overriding aim of this theses was to evaluate the pest status of carob moth in citrus and establish a species specific IPM programme by determine the autecology of carob moth in citrus. Reliable methods for monitoring carob moth in citrus orchards both for producers and for research purposes were developed. A user-friendly monitoring method for determining weekly carob moth infestation through dropped fruit was suitable for producers. A timed scouting method was also developed; although the accuracy of this method varied with the experience of the scout. The pest status of carob moth was highest in the Loskop Valley, Nelspruit and the Vaalharts production areas and economic injury to growers ranged from R 512. 35 to R 3 719. 80 per hectare {{as a direct result of}} infestation. No infestation was recorded in the Sundays River Valley and Citrusdal production areas over both the 2014 - 15 and 201516 growing seasons. A laboratory study showed the survival of carob moth larvae infesting citrus is less than 10 % in the absence of mealybug. However, this increases to almost 40 % in the presence of mealybug residues and sooty mould. There was a significant relationship between carob infestation at harvest and mealybug infestation in the middle months of the growing season. The relationship between carob moth and mealybug indicates that current production guidelines for the management of mealybug in citrus may need to be amended. Consequently, it is proposed that an orchard with a history of carob moth infestation and a high mealybug infestation in the previous season should be subjected to an early season preventative application of a registered control product. Also, if mealybug infestation in December is higher than a 5 % of fruit per tree, then a corrective application of a registered product is recommended. The application of 2, 4 -D at petal drop reduced the size of the navel-end opening, decreasing the proportion of mealybug found in the navel-end, subsequently reducing carob moth infestation, resulting in a direct benefit for producers. Products registered for the control of false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta Meyrick, were effective in reducing carob moth infestation. In a spray trial conducted over two seasons, Delegate® and Runner® reduced infestation significantly in the 2014 - 15 season (over 80 %), while only Delegate® was effective in the 2015 - 16 season (over 80 %). If a late season corrective chemical application is targeted at both FCM and carob moth, this application should take place between 6 - 7 weeks prior to harvest. The mating disruption product, SPLAT® EC, reduced carob moth infestation by 70 % compared to the untreated control. A laboratory culture was established and head-capsule size categories were determined for all five carob moth instars. A parasitoid survey indicated that parasitism of carob moth larvae is generally less than 5 % in citrus orchards and a new species of Braconidae was described as Phanterotoma carobivora van Achterberg and Thackeray. Carob moth fifth instar were found to be the most cold-tolerant larval stage, and were shown to be more cold susceptible than the most cold-tolerant FCM instars at - 0. 55 ºC for eighteen days. This cold treatment resulted in a mortality of 94. 6 % fifth instar carob moth compared to a combined fourth and fifth instar mortality of 87. 8 % for FCM after eighteen days. These results indicate that post-harvest cold treatments targeting FCM will be as, if not more, effective against carob moth, suggesting that current <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation</b> for carob moth should be amended to incorporate this study’s findings...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[2]Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. pest risk assessment conducted by France on Erionota thrax L. with French Guiana, Erionota thrax (L.) (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae), the palm redeye, banana skipper or banana leafroller, is a pest of bananas, Musa textilis, and some other Zingiberales. Larvae feed on leaves of cultivated and wild banana plants. In its native areas, the defoliation of banana plants is usually very low, but in non-native areas it can be serious during outbreaks and favourable weather conditions. Complete defoliation has been reported sporadically. The Panel examined the risk assessment in detail, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. It {{came to the conclusion that}} the information material provided in the document could be considerably improved. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). The Panel concluded that it is not possible to conduct a risk assessment on E. thrax alone because of uncertainties with its taxonomy and the general confusion in the literature about Erionota spp. The document is therefore, in effect, not a risk assessment just for E. thrax but also for three other closely related Erionota spp. (E. torus, E. hiraca, and E. surprisa). The judgements made by the Panel – if not specified otherwise – thus refer to all four of these closely related Erionota spp. On this basis, the Panel, in general, accepts the conclusions in the French document. The Panel agrees that Erionota spp. have a low probability of entry for the French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique due to the long distance from its current area of distribution and the existing <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>legislation.</b> However, the probability of Erionota spp. gaining entry to French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique would be moderate if the current regulations governing imports of banana material were lifted. The probability of entry for Réunion is higher due to its proximity to Mauritius where Erionota spp. are present. The probability of Erionota sppthe areas where the 4 species currently occur.. establishing in the PRA area[4] after entry is high, since host plants are grown in the PRA area and the climatic conditions are similar to The Erionota spp. can have severe impacts on banana in certain situations. However, the conclusion of the French document that the economic impact would be “extremely high” for Guadeloupe and Martinique and “fairly high” for French Guiana and Réunion cannot be supported by the Panel on the basis of the information provided in the pest risk assessment or from the information available in the scientific literature. Based on the information available, the Panel concludes that the impact of Erionota spp. would be low for French Guiana and Réunion and moderate for the Guadeloupe and Martinique. However, without additional information on the pest and the impacts it causes in Mauritius, the risk posed to Réunion and the other French overseas departments cannot be reliably clarified. The Panel concludes that (a) the probability of entry is low for French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, and higher for Réunion, (b) the probability of establishment is high for all the French overseas departments, and (c) the potential for economic damage is low for French Guiana and Réunion and moderate for Guadeloupe and Martinique. The Panel, based on the information provided in the document and on additional literature consulted, concludes that E. thrax and the three other closely related Erionota spp. are appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|E
