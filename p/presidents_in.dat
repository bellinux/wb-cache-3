5|$|Bush {{was criticized}} internationally and {{targeted}} by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for his administration's foreign policy.

5|$|After {{a lengthy}} public {{debate over whether}} to place the station to the east or west of the Wallkill River, {{it was built in}} 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz. The rail line was {{formally}} opened during a large ceremony on December20, 1870. A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the Mohonk Mountain House by many vacationers, including two U.S. <b>presidents.</b> <b>In</b> the late 19th century, over a dozen stagecoaches ran between the station and Mohonk daily.|$|E
5|$|American actor Stuart Milligan {{was cast}} as President Nixon, {{which he said}} he found exciting, having played other <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> the past, {{including}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prosthetic pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and ears to make him resemble Nixon as much as possible. He also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he had to wear fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland {{as the voice of}} Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Borah {{became one}} of the {{progressive}} insurgents who challenged President William Howard Taft's policies, though Borah refused to support former president Theodore Roosevelt's third-party bid against Taft in 1912. Borah reluctantly voted for war in 1917 and, once it concluded, he fought against the Versailles treaty, and the Senate did not ratify it. Remaining a maverick, Borah often fought with the Republican <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> office between 1921 and 1933, though Coolidge offered to make Borah his running mate in 1924. Borah campaigned for Hoover in 1928, something he rarely did for presidential candidates and never did again.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} eyes {{when he was elected}} to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just months into his term. While some admire Johnson's strict constitutionalism, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African Americans is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> American history.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Lincoln Room is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln painted by 19th-century American portraitist Edward Dalton Marchant; {{it is one of}} a number of drawings, paintings, and photographs of Lincoln used to decorate this room. The sitting room in the Blair House wing of the complex was originally used by the Blair family to receive U.S. <b>presidents.</b> <b>In</b> this room in 1861, Montgomery Blair, acting on Lincoln's orders, offered the command of the Union Army to Robert E. Lee, an offer that Lee declined.|$|E
5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E

5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, Reagan {{did not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Greatly {{concerned}} about the growing partisanship within {{the government and the}} detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party. In spite of his efforts, debates over Hamilton's economic policy, the French Revolution, and the Jay Treaty deepened ideological divisions. Those that supported Hamilton formed the Federalist Party, while his opponents coalesced around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and formed the Democratic-Republican Party. While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, Washington is nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians {{as one of the greatest}} <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> American history, usually ranking in the top three with Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E

5|$|The general {{success of}} William L. Mayo and his college even {{inflamed}} {{the passions of}} their competitors, most especially T. Henry Bridges, the head of Henry College in nearby Campbell. According to William E. Sawyer, {{in the aftermath of}} Reconstruction the Southern-educated Bridges viewed the Northern-educated Mayo as a carpetbagger. After a battle of words between the two college <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> local newspaper columns, on August 24, 1896, Bridges drove into Commerce in his buggy to confront Mayo, first asking him to sign a statement retracting his written claims. When Mayo refused, Bridges drew his revolver on Mayo, and after he missed his target twice, Bridges proceeded to strike Mayo with 15 to 20 lashes of his whip. The disturbance attracted an angry mob of ETNC students, who drove Bridges out of town. Bridges' Henry College would ultimately become defunct in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Clinton's first term, his job {{approval}} rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently {{ranged from the}} high-50s to the high-60s.

According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> the modern era. Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.

5|$|When Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, he held an {{approval}} rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and later Bill Clinton, {{as the highest}} ratings for departing <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> the modern era. He was the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve two full terms, after a succession of five prior presidents did not, some under unusual circumstances. Although he had planned an active post-presidency, Reagan disclosed in 1994 {{that he had been}} diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease earlier that year. He appeared publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon. He died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93. Reagan had the third-longest life out of all the presidents, after Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. An icon among Republicans, he is viewed favorably in historian rankings of U.S. presidents, and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|William Barber died August 31, 1879 of {{an illness}} {{contracted}} after swimming at Atlantic City, New Jersey. His son {{applied for the}} position of chief engraver, as did George T.

Loudon Snowden met to determine the issue. They decided to recommend the appointment of Barber, who was subsequently nominated by President Rutherford B. Hayes and in February 1880, was confirmed by the Senate. Barber would serve nine <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> the position, remaining {{until his death in}} 1917, when Morgan would succeed him.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank <b>presidents</b> <b>in</b> the East room and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
