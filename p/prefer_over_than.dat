50|$|Another {{experiment}} {{examined the}} effect of color and degree of realism on participants' perception of art with differing levels of expertise. Groups of experts, relative experts, and non-experts viewed stimuli consisting of generated versions of figurative paintings varying in color and abstraction. Participants rated the stimuli on their overall preference, abstractness, color properties, balance, and complexity. Figurative pictures were <b>preferred</b> <b>over</b> abstract pictures with decreasing expertise and colored pictures were <b>preferred</b> <b>over</b> black-and-white pictures. However, experts {{were more likely to}} <b>prefer</b> black-and-white pictures <b>over</b> colored ones <b>than</b> non-experts and relative experts. This suggests that experts may view art with cognitive models, while non-experts view art looking for familiarity and pleasure.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we examine}} the {{distribution}} of A-not-A questions using a large collection of Chinese literary texts. Our results indicate that A-not-AB is <b>preferred</b> <b>over</b> AB-not-AB in Modern Chinese, whereas AB-not-AB is <b>preferred</b> <b>over</b> A-not-AB in Classical Chinese. We suggest that such a contrast in distribution provides support to a reductionist account of the A-not-A questions...|$|R

50|$|Rational choice theory then {{assumes that}} an {{individual}} has preferences among the available choice alternatives {{that allow them to}} state which option they prefer. These preferences are assumed to be complete (the person can always say which of two alternatives they consider preferable or that neither is preferred to the other) and transitive (if option A is <b>preferred</b> <b>over</b> option B and option B is <b>preferred</b> <b>over</b> option C, then A is <b>preferred</b> <b>over</b> C). The rational agent is assumed to take account of available information, probabilities of events, and potential costs and benefits in determining preferences, and to act consistently in choosing the self-determined best choice of action.|$|R
