5000|$|In 1947, William E. Bassett (who {{started the}} W. E. Bassett Company in 1939) {{developed}} the [...] "Trim"-brand nail clipper, the first made using modern (at the time) manufacturing methods using the superior jaw-style design {{that had been}} around since the 19th century, but adding two nibs near the base of the file to prevent lateral movement, replacing the <b>pinned</b> <b>rivet</b> with a notched rivet, and adding a thumb-swerve in the lever.|$|R
5000|$|Handle making {{can be done}} {{in several}} {{different}} ways depending on the tang of the knife. Full tang knives usually have handle scales either <b>pinned,</b> <b>riveted,</b> or screwed on to the tang itself while knives without a full tang may be inserted into a solid handle and then attached in one of the previously stated methods. Handle materials can range from natural materials including wood or elk horn to man-made materials like brass, plastic, polymer or micarta. A knife makers grinder may have additional attachments for making knife handles, such as small diameter contact wheels.|$|R
40|$|One {{component}} serves three functions, electrical interconnections, thermal control, {{and mechanical}} integrity, at same time. Several versions of design: (1) Insulated support plate contains holes; (2) Alternate support plate configuration uses rivets instead of pins; and (3) Another configuration includes leaf-spring contacts instead of <b>pins</b> or <b>rivets...</b>|$|R
50|$|The broch was {{inhabited}} {{until the}} Middle Ages. Among the finds in the broch was a decorative pin from the 8th {{century and a}} Norse <b>pin</b> and <b>rivets,</b> dating from the 11th or 12th century. Located near the broch are {{the remains of a}} rectangular building in the Norse style.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of bearing and tensile loads on the creep behavior of joints was studied. A specimen {{was designed for}} this study which possessed some of the general features of <b>pin</b> and <b>rivet</b> joint connections and an apparatus was constructed to apply both bearing and tensile loads to the joint model. Deformation measurements were made by use of a photogrid printed on the joint model...|$|R
50|$|The rear set {{of drivers}} with their {{high-pressure}} cylinders is fixed in the plate {{frame of the}} loco. The front set of drivers with their low-pressure cylinders {{are linked to the}} rear sets with king <b>pins,</b> the <b>rivetted</b> boiler lies on it with its slide plates (Gleitplatten) Leaf springs at the sides hold the driving gear in a central position. Both driving sets have an inside frame.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Indian (Southern) tabar (axe), 18th century, {{the wooden}} haft has a steel tang running 3/4 {{of the way}} down, <b>pinned</b> by four <b>rivets.</b> The axe head is brass with a forged steel blade, L. 58 cm.|$|R
50|$|The PK {{general-purpose}} {{machine gun}} U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm sheet of steel that is supported extensively by <b>pins</b> and <b>rivets.</b> For additional rigidity and strength the PK receiver features double walls made from 1.5 mm steel plates that are welded {{together with the}} U-shaped stamping. The receiver top cover is also stamped from 1.5 mm sheet metal and hinged {{on the front of}} the receiver and locked at the back with a spring-loaded latch.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} of tolerance analysis in assemblies using Sigmund Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) software is validated through {{the example of}} an automobile locking device. Simulation with CAT, applying criteria on both the statistical distribution and the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> position in the hole used in the example, {{will allow us to}} predict the functional dimension tolerances in these assemblies with greater accuracy in the preliminary design phase. These tolerances will subsequently define the manufacturing specifications. The statistical distribution, in the example, that best fits the overall set of tolerances, is the triangular distribution followed by the normal distribution; the position of the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> axis in its hole is off-centre by 53 % with regard to its maximum value...|$|R
50|$|The vibraslap is a {{percussion}} instrument {{consisting of}} a piece of stiff wire (bent into a U-shape) connecting a wood ball to a hollow box of wood with metal “teeth” inside. The percussionist holds the metal wire in one hand and strikes the ball (usually against the palm of their other hand). The box acts as a resonating body for a metal mechanism placed inside with a number of loosely fastened <b>pins</b> or <b>rivets</b> that vibrate and rattle against the box. The instrument is a modern version of the jawbone.|$|R
40|$|Using {{a series}} {{approach}} and the Muskhelishvili formulation in the two-dimensional theory of elasticity, stress-intensity factors K are derived for problems in which cracks emanate radially from {{the boundary of}} an arbitrarily loaded internal circular hole in an infinite plate. Numerical values are obtained for K(I) and K(II) for radial cracks from a hole containing a loose-fitted <b>pin</b> or <b>rivet</b> that is pulled perpendicular to the crack direction in {{the plane of the}} plate. The method is a general one for determining K for a set of symmetrically emanating radial cracks for a variety of concentrated or distributed tractions on the circular hole...|$|R
50|$|The AK-74 {{gas tube}} has a spring washer {{attached}} to its rear end designed {{to retain the}} gas tube more securely. The lower handguard is fitted with a leaf spring that reduces play in the rifle's lateral axis by keeping the wood tensioned between the receiver and the handguard retainer. The receiver remains nearly identical {{to that of the}} AKM; it is a U-shaped 1 mm thick sheet steel pressing supported extensively by <b>pins</b> and <b>rivets.</b> The internal guide rails on which the bolt carrier travels are stamped and spot welded {{to the inside of the}} receiver housing. Minor changes were made to the front barrel and rear stock trunnions as well as the magazine well. All external metal surfaces are coated with a glossy black enamel paint.|$|R
5000|$|The shamshir is a one-handed, curved sword {{featuring}} a slim blade that has almost no taper {{until the very}} tip. Instead of being worn upright (hilt-high), it is worn horizontally, with the hilt and tip pointing up. It was normally used for slashing unarmored opponents either on foot or mounted; while the tip {{could be used for}} thrusting, the drastic curvature of blade made accuracy more difficult. It has an offset pommel, and its two lengthy quillons form a simple crossguard. The tang of the blade is covered by slabs of bone, ivory, wood, or other material fastened by <b>pins</b> or <b>rivets</b> to form the grip. Many of the older Persian shamshir blades are made from high quality crucible wootz steel, and are noted for the fine [...] "watering" [...] on the blades.|$|R
5000|$|Large scale {{operators}} and retail shops may buy bulk chain on reels. This must then be cut and joined to length which {{is done by}} inserting <b>rivet</b> <b>pins.</b> These non-reusable pins are usually supplied already installed into a half-link and must be peened over against a half-link on the other side. As this peening is done with a bench-mounted rotary tool, rather than hammering, it {{is referred to as}} [...] "rivet spinning". The tool is usually hand-cranked, or may be electrically powered for mass production.|$|R
50|$|Installation of the trusses was {{completed}} on July 16, 1908. The winches, manually operated by groups of labourers, {{were used to}} lower the trusses steadily and evenly towards each other until the two arms met in the middle. Labourers then crossed into the gap from either side and rapidly drove in the <b>pins</b> and <b>rivets</b> which secured the two trusses firmly in position. The whole task of lowering and securing the trusses took only four hours, which was considered a noteworthy achievement. Two short steel towers were then erected on {{the central part of}} each truss to support the straight steel deck of the bridge, the members of which were brought up to the mouth of the tunnel and launched by being pulled out over rollers. Installation of the straight beam was finished on November 31, 1908. One week later, on December 6, 1908, the bridge was opened and the first train crossed over the gorge.|$|R
50|$|The West Woodstock Bridge stands {{just north}} of Woodstock Union High School, {{spanning}} the Ottauquechee River east of U.S. Route 4 (US 4) in an east-west orientation. It is a single-span Pennsylvania through truss, {{a variant of the}} Pratt truss with additional vertical members, and its elements are connected by <b>pins</b> instead of <b>rivets.</b> It is 174 ft in length, and rests on rubblestone abutments. It is 16.3 ft wide, carrying two lanes of traffic, and has a portal height of 14.4 ft. The deck consists of rolled I-beam stringers with wooden flooring. Elements of bridge exhibit modest Victorian styling.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>pinned</b> and <b>riveted</b> {{sheet metal}} {{receiver}} of the Bizon {{is derived from}} the AKS-74 and has been modified at the front end, since the gas system was omitted. The handguard is a sheet metal stamping with three rectangular ventilation slots on each side. The magazine serves as the lower handguard and the current models of the magazine are ribbed to enhance grip. The Bizon also shares the same trigger and safety mechanisms of the AK-74 rifle. The selector lever is placed {{on the right side of}} the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and in this position the lever physically blocks the bolt's integral retracting handle; the middle position (marked [...] "АВ") enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position ("ОД") will activate the semi-automatic function of the trigger. An original five-piece anti-bounce device is built into the trigger unit and this functions as a rate reducer, delaying firing until the bolt has settled entirely into battery.|$|R
6000|$|They {{looked around}} in surprise, seeing at first {{no one at}} all. Then from behind a tree there stepped a brown, fuzzy bear whose head came about as high as Cayke's waist--and Cayke was a small woman. The bear was chubby as well as fuzzy; his body was even puffy, while his legs and arms seemed jointed at the knees and elbows and {{fastened}} to his body by <b>pins</b> or <b>rivets.</b> His ears were round in shape and stuck out in a comical way, while his round, black eyes were bright and sparkling as beads. Over his shoulder the little brown bear bore a gun with a tin barrel. The barrel had a cork {{in the end of}} it, and a string was attached to the cork and to the handle of the gun. Both the Frogman and Cayke gazed hard at this curious bear, standing silent for some time. But finally the Frogman recovered from his surprise and remarked, [...] "It {{seems to me that you}} are stuffed with sawdust and ought not to be alive." ...|$|R
60|$|They were good, {{straight}} blows, for boxing {{had been}} his favourite amusement at Sandhurst {{where he was a}} middleweight champion. The first caught Sir John upon his thick lips which were badly cut against the teeth, causing him to stagger; while the second, that with the right, landed on {{the bridge of his nose}} and blacked both his eyes. This, so strong and heavy was it, notwithstanding Sir John's great weight, knocked him clean off his feet. Back he went, and in his efforts to save himself gripped Mr. Knight with one hand and with the other the legs of the early Victorian angel that surmounted Lady Jane's grave against which they were standing. Neither of these could withstand the strain. The angel, which was only <b>pinned</b> by lead-coated <b>rivets</b> to its base and the column behind, flew from its supports, as did Mr. Knight from his, so that in another second, the men having tripped against the surround of the grave, all three rolled upon the path, the marble luckily falling clear of both of them.|$|R
50|$|The {{rocket motor}} of PL-4 is {{designated}} as FG101, and {{is shared by}} another anti-radar derivative named Fenglei-7 (风雷7号). The revival of PL-4 was partially due to the decision to develop the anti-radar derivative in January 1979. The designer of the rocket motor was Harbin Ship Engineering Academy (哈尔滨船舶工程学院), the predecessor of Harbin Engineering University, 349th Factory was tasked to manufacture the propellant, 845th Factory was tasked for ground test, and 331st Factory was tasked for final integration. During the propulsion development, the contractor and subcontractors developed new manufacturing techniques, including improvements in installation, new <b>rivet</b> <b>pins,</b> graphite exhaust nozzle, and tolerance. A brand new heat processing method for integrated spin forming was adopted to achieve the high precision engine components, and this was achieved via {{the use of a}} special spin forming machinery set specially developed by the Beijing Nonferrous Metal Research Academy (北京有色金属研究院). Once the bottleneck of propulsion has been overcame, both programs went forward with ease, and but the conclusion of political turmoil, namely, the end of Cultural Revolution was an even more crucial contribution in the later development.|$|R
500|$|Bronze {{objects such}} as <b>pins,</b> jewellery, and <b>rivets</b> have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no local source of tin and copper ore, this {{demonstrates}} long distance trade, probably with the southwest. Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle, {{there is evidence of}} it being reworked. Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area, but the hill fort {{does not appear to have}} been a centre for iron production in this period; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production. Early in the Iron Age, most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally– within about – however later on sources further afield became more important, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the pottery came from the area around Poole Harbour over [...] away. This long-range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities. Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage, Cunliffe and fellow-archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as [...] "town-like settlements", a form of proto-urbanism.|$|R
50|$|The fibula is a {{multilayered}} structure. Its face {{consists of}} a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of 58 mm. This is fixed by three silver <b>rivet</b> <b>pins</b> to an identically sized, 3 mm thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, 78 mm in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate {{was filled with a}} now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (tin pest). The decoration {{consists of a}} quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.|$|R
40|$|For the {{dismantling}} of austenitic components of nuclear facilities fastening techniques, usable remote controlled under water, are investigated. The components are only one-sided accessable. The fastening techniques are based on Drawn Arc Stud Welding, Mechanical Drilling followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements and thermal drilling with Contact Arc Metal Cutting (CAMC) followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements. In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor tapered holes and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and blind rivet, which are customary in trade, have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected blind rivet is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the <b>rivet</b> <b>pin</b> breaks from 78 kN upwards. The rivet case is formed in minor tapered holes {{in the same way}} as in rough interior surfaces of holes. Drill bur does not influence the results. The developed combined one-way fastening elements and repeatedly applicable fastening elements are able to pierce (CAMC), to interlock and also to fix and to transport the segments of the components without changing end effector of the manipulator. Such a general ideal process is demonstrated in 1 : 1 experiment. The developed fastening technologies are usable at least up to a water depth of 20 m.
