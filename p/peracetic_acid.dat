25|$|It {{is used in}} the {{production}} of various organic peroxides with dibenzoyl peroxide being a high volume example. This is used in polymerisations, as a flour bleaching agent and as a treatment for acne. Peroxy acids, such as <b>peracetic</b> <b>acid</b> and meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid are also typically produced using hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|Prions {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to chemical sterilization. Treatment with aldehydes such as formaldehyde {{have actually been}} shown to increase prion resistance. Hydrogen peroxide (3%) for one hour was shown to be ineffective, providing less than 3 logs (10−3) reduction in contamination. Iodine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and <b>peracetic</b> <b>acid</b> also fail this test (one hour treatment). Only chlorine, phenolic compounds, guanidinium thiocyanate, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reduce prion levels by more than 4 logs; chlorine (too corrosive to use on certain objects) and NaOH are the most consistent. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide.|$|E

In this preliminary study behavioral response was used to assess potential correlations with PAA dosage. A behavioral change or response is not necessarily an indication of compromised welfare. Supportive enzymatic, biochemical and physiological biomarkers can be used along with gill and epidermal histological measures to evaluate the effects on water treatment regimens. The ultimate goal is to define the therapeutic window where fish welfare is not compromised. PAA is among the few disinfectants approved for organic aquaculture. ...|$|R

However, since 1950, there has been an increase in medical devices and instruments made of materials (e.g., plastics) that require low-temperature sterilization. Ethylene oxide gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices.

40|$|Chromium-free {{preferential}} etching {{techniques in}} combination with light optical microscopy were compared with the non-destructive Laser Scattering Tomography (LST) {{for the evaluation of}} crystal defect densities in Czochralski substrates grown under different conditions. Dichromate containing etching solutions (original Secco etch and dilute Secco etch) were included into the study as reference. The chromium-free etching solutions with high etch rates comprised mixtures of nitric, hydrofluoric and acetic acid with water (JEITA 1, MEMC). Those with low etch rates consisted of mixtures of nitric and acetic or propanoic acid with hydrogen peroxide which form <b>peracetic</b> or perpropanoic <b>acid</b> (Organic Peracid Etches). OPE solutions provide improved discrimination of different types of defects and work also on highly doped substrates. As a general result, {{it turned out that the}} defect densities determined by the preferential etching solutions applied were significantly higher than those evaluated by LST. Relatively close to the LST defect densities are those determined by original Secco etch for larger etch pits...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{drinking}} water production plants using membrane processes, contact with cleaning chemicals {{is believed to}} play an important role in membrane ageing. In this article, polysulfone membranes were used to simulate the industrial cleaning in static conditions. Ageing of the membrane was mimicked by immersing samples in solutions containing sodium hypochlorite and commercial oxidants with various concentrations, temperatures and soaking times defined by experimental designs. For the first time in the chemical membranes ageing research, an approach based on methodological tools has been realized. The main interest is to achieve a relevant ageing pattern without using an accelerated ageing protocol (high concentrations and short contact times). The macroscopic changes were monitored by permeability measurement and mechanical strength tests coupled with a microscopic characterization by ATR-FTIR (to identify the chemical functional groups affected by ageing) and SEM (to visualize qualitatively the surface changes and deteriorations). The present work details the comparison between NaOCl and another oxidant: P 3 -Oxysan ZS (composed of <b>peracetic</b> and peroctanoic <b>acid).</b> The comparison of the macroscopic and microscopic properties of hypochlorite-aged membranes and P 3 -Oxysan ZS-aged membrane indicate NaOCl is far more detrimental for membrane integrity than P 3 -Oxysan ZS. The latter might give an alternative solution to the use of chlorine on industrial plant. The obtained results let to consider less harmful cleaning products on membranes. Then, the present study based on experimental designs let to underline that the most commonly used parameter "concentration × time of exposure" (c × t) was not a representative tool to predict membrane ageing...|$|R
2500|$|Although many {{different}} peroxyacids {{are used for}} the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, {{some of the more}} common oxidants include meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) and trifluoroperacetic acid (TFPAA). The general trend is that higher reactivity is correlated with lower pKa (i.e.: stronger acidity) of the corresponding carboxylic acid (or alcohol {{in the case of the}} peroxides). [...] Therefore, the reactivity trend shows TFPAA > 4-nitroperbenzoic acid > mCPBA and performic acid > <b>peracetic</b> <b>acid</b> > hydrogen peroxide > tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The peroxides are much less reactive than the peroxyacids. The use of hydrogen peroxide even requires a catalyst. In addition, using organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide tends to generate more side-reactivity due to their promiscuity.|$|E
2500|$|About 40% of all acute viral {{hepatitis}} {{is caused by}} HAV. [...] Infected individuals are infectious prior to onset of symptoms, roughly 10 days following infection.
