5|$|The <b>planners</b> then {{examined}} {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the <b>planners</b> believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1907, U.S. naval and {{military}} <b>planners</b> {{had concluded that}} it would be impractical to repel an invasion of the Philippines. The best that could be hoped for was that the garrison could hold out on the Bataan peninsula until help arrived. In the 1920s it was estimated that they could do so for about 60 days. By the 1930s, the <b>planners</b> had become decidedly pessimistic in view of the increased capability of aircraft, and by 1936 they were agreed that the Philippine should be written off. But in July 1941, this decision was abruptly reversed, and it became the policy of the U.S. government to defend and hold the Philippines. This was based, at least in part, in the belief that Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers could deter or defeat an invading force.|$|E

Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E

The <b>planner</b> {{can be described as}} a two-level process in which a global <b>planner</b> restricts a local <b>planner</b> to certain subsets of the grid. The global <b>planner</b> starts by letting the local <b>planner</b> search in a coarse subset of the grid, and successively refines the grid until a solution is found. The local <b>planner</b> applies a scheme for lazy evaluation on each subgrid in order to minimize collision checking and thereby increase performance. Experimental results in an industrial application show that lazy evaluation on a grid is very efficient in practice. The algorithm is particularly useful in high dimensional, relatively uncluttered configuration spaces, especially when collision checking is computationally expensive.
