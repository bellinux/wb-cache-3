In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, following the postmortem dissections of Southard's brain {{and those of}} his parents. Canavan undertook the study to examine hereditary links in brain structure. Southard had a prominent frontal lobe, which she associated with his <b>planning</b> <b>ability.</b> Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the acquisition of}} music performance skills in novice and expert pianists. Temporal disruptions in novice performances coincided with constraints in planning capa-cities. Child and adult pianists ranging in age (9 ± 26 years), training (3 ± 15 years) and sight-reading ability learned to perform a novel musical piece in eleven practice trials. Computer-detected pitch and timing errors revealed: (1) gradual improvements in performance tempo and pitch accuracy with skill level and practice, generally ®tting a power function; (2) a relative-timing/pitch accuracy trade-off and high incidence of simultaneous pitch/time errors; (3) improvements in relative timing (temporal continuity, underlying beat, metrical structure) with skill and practice; and (4) increased anticipatory behavior and a greater range of planning with skill and practice. A strong positive relationship between the mastery of temporal constraints and <b>planning</b> <b>abilities</b> within performance suggests that these two cognitive indi-cators are closely related and may arise from segmentation processes during performance.

40|$|Anticipatory motor <b>planning</b> <b>abilities</b> mature as {{children}} grow older, develop throughout childhood {{and are likely}} to be stable till the late sixties. In the seventh decade of life, motor planning performance dramatically declines, with anticipatory motor <b>planning</b> <b>abilities</b> falling to levels of those exhibited by children. At present, the processes enabling successful anticipatory motor planning in general, as do the cognitive processes mediating these age-related changes, remain elusive. Thus, the aim {{of the present study was}} (a) to identify cognitive and motor functions that are most affected by normal aging and (b) to elucidate key (cognitive and motor) factors that are critical for successful motor planning performance in young (n = 40, mean age = 23. 1 ± 2. 6 years) and older adults (n = 37, mean age = 73. 5 ± 7. 1 years). Results indicate that normal aging is associated with a marked decline in all aspects of cognitive and motor functioning tested. However, age-related declines were more apparent for fine motor dexterity, processing speed and cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, up to 64 % of the variance in motor planning performance across age groups could be explained by the cognitive functions processing speed, response planning and cognitive flexibility. It can be postulated that anticipatory motor <b>planning</b> <b>abilities</b> are strongly influenced by cognitive control processes, which seem to be key mechanisms to compensate for age-related decline. These findings support the general therapeutic and preventive value of cognitive-motor training programs to reduce adverse effects associated with high age...|$|R
