5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the valency of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a <b>passive</b> <b>voice</b> (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuanian <b>passive</b> <b>voice</b> {{is always}} {{analytical}} and structured {{differently than the}} active voice. <b>Passive</b> <b>voice</b> has no perfect and no inchoative tenses, because similar semantic relationships can be expressed by the present / past passive participle dichotomy.|$|E

25|$|Some languages, {{including}} several Southeast Asian languages, use {{a form of}} <b>passive</b> <b>voice</b> to indicate that an action or event was unpleasant or undesirable. This so-called adversative passive works like the ordinary <b>passive</b> <b>voice</b> in terms of syntactic structurethat is, a theme or instrument acts as subject. In addition, the construction indicates adversative affect, suggesting that someone was negatively affected.|$|E

50|$|The {{forms of}} the verb for middle and <b>passive</b> <b>voices</b> largely overlap, except in the aorist and future tenses where there are {{separate}} forms for middle and passive.|$|R
50|$|The antipassive voice deletes or demotes {{the object}} of {{transitive}} verbs, and promotes the actor to an intransitive subject. This voice is very common among ergative-absolutive languages (which may feature <b>passive</b> <b>voices</b> as well), but also occurs among nominative-accusative languages.|$|R
50|$|Ancient Greek has {{imperative}} {{forms for}} present, aorist, and perfect tenses for the active, middle, and <b>passive</b> <b>voices.</b> Within these tenses, forms exist for {{second and third}} persons, for singular, dual, and plural subjects. Subjunctive forms with μή are used for negative imperatives in the aorist.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{languages}} (such as Albanian, Bengali, Fula, Tamil, Sanskrit, Icelandic, Swedish, Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Greek) have {{a middle}} voice, {{which is a}} set of inflections or constructions which is to some extent different from both the active and <b>passive</b> <b>voices.</b> The middle voice is said {{to be in the middle}} between the active and the <b>passive</b> <b>voices</b> because the subject often cannot be categorized as either agent or patient but may have elements of both. For example, it may express what would be an intransitive verb in English. In The casserole cooked in the oven, cooked is syntactically active but semantically passive. In Classical Greek, the middle voice often has a reflexive sense: the subject acts on or for itself, such as [...] "The boy washes himself", or [...] "The boy washes". It can be transitive or intransitive. It can occasionally be used in a causative sense, such as [...] "The father causes his son to be set free", or [...] "The father ransoms his son".|$|R

25|$|The town of Willow Bunch is {{occupied}} with Francophone and Métis people who settled upon these lands. The history {{in this small}} town is very interesting to Saskatchewan. The Métis {{played an important role}} in Saskatchewan history. Yet the Métis had fewer advantages in the Francophone town and they had very <b>passive</b> <b>voices.</b> Even today, the Métis are still trying to regain their rights and to educate about the history of the Métis and the roles they played. Just like First Nations peoples, Métis face the same inequality and misconceptions from non-Métis peoples.|$|R
25|$|Gaulish verbs have {{present and}} future tenses; indicative, subjunctive, and {{imperative}} moods; and active and <b>passive</b> <b>voices.</b> Verbs show a number of innovations as well. The Indo-European s-aorist evolved into the Gaulish t-preterit, formed by merging an old 3rd personal singular imperfect ending -t- to a 3rd personal singular perfect ending -u or -e and subsequent affixation to all forms of the t-preterit tense. Similarly, the s-preterit is formed from the extension of -ss (originally from the third person singular) and the affixation of -it to the third person singular (to distinguish it as such). Third-person plurals are also marked {{by the addition of}} -s in the preterit system.|$|R
40|$|Javanese {{language}} Ngoko {{has many}} sophisticated verbal affixes, {{and two of}} them, tak and kok, are widely known as passive markers in Javanese. However, these two affixes seem to have other functions as well. They can also occur as personal pronouns and as modal operators. This raises the question whether these so-called “passive markers” really marked <b>passive</b> <b>voices.</b> At issue is whether tak and kok are single morpheme with multiple functions or multiple homophonic morphemes, each with a different function. This paper argues that Javanese tak and kok are one type of morpheme when they function as passive markers and personal pronouns, but another homophonous type when they function as modal operators...|$|R
25|$|In some languages, <b>passive</b> <b>voice</b> is {{indicated}} by verb conjugation, specific forms of the verb. Examples of languages that indicate voice through conjugation include Latin and North Germanic languages such as Swedish.|$|E

25|$|Many {{languages}} {{have both}} {{an active and}} a passive voice; this allows for greater flexibility in sentence construction, as either the semantic agent or patient may take the syntactic role of subject. The use of <b>passive</b> <b>voice</b> allows speakers to organize stretches of discourse by placing figures other than the agent in subject position. This may be done to foreground the patient, recipient, or other thematic role; {{it may also be}} useful when the semantic patient is the topic of on-going discussion. The <b>passive</b> <b>voice</b> may also be used to avoid specifying the agent of an action.|$|E
40|$|The intention, {{this study}} was {{launched}} with, was to explore {{the applicability of the}} Systemic Functional Grammar, the linguistic development promoted by famous linguist M. A. K. Halliday. The theory establishes the view of functionality of linguistic phenomena in the pieces of literature. The study in hand is aimed to find the functional elements in Rainer Maria Rilke‟s poem „A Walk‟. The poem was analyzed into three major functional methods of the theory including Ideational, Interpersonal and Textual analysis. In the first category, the transitivity patterns and the clauses having active and <b>passive</b> <b>voices</b> were analysed. In the second, the interpersonal elements; having the persons involving in the process and showing relationship with each other were seen. And finally, the textual meaning and the sense emerging from all the above findings were discussed. It further sought the theme of the poem and the basic functional idea of the poetic expression. And in the final stage the emanating message of the poem was discussed in the conclusion...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{particular}} lexical verb is {{specified by}} four stems, two each for the active and <b>passive</b> <b>voices.</b> In a particular voice, one stem (the past stem) {{is used for}} the past tense, and the other (the non-past stem) {{is used for the}} present and future tenses, along with non-indicative moods, e.g. subjunctive and imperative. The past and non-past stems are sometimes also called the perfective stem and imperfective stem, respectively, based on a traditional misinterpretation of Arabic stems as representing grammatical aspect rather than grammatical tense. (Although there is still some disagreement about the interpretation of the stems as tense or aspect, the dominant current view is that the stems simply represent tense, sometimes of a relative rather than absolute nature. There are some unusual usages of the stems in certain contexts that were once interpreted as indicating aspectual distinctions, but are now thought to simply be idiosyncratic constructions that do not neatly fit into any aspectual paradigm.) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Theory & Psychology and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper examines how social psychology textbooks represent Kurt Lewin and his contribution to social psychology. Many textbooks describe Lewin {{as the father of}} social psychology, using a conventional, <b>passive</b> <b>voiced</b> trope to do so. The rhetorical meaning of this trope is analysed to show that textbooks are invoking a collective memory, which closes down views of the past, rather than making a historical argument, which opens up the past for examination. This depiction of Lewin typically involves forgetting his critical views about statistics and experimentation. When textbooks cite Lewin’s famous motto “there is nothing as practical as a good theory”, they tend to ascribe it a special status. In doing so, they change its meaning subtly and treat it as a truth that needs no empirical validation. By their rhetoric, omissions and avoidance of historical sources, textbooks recreate Lewin as a mythic figure rather than a historical one...|$|R
