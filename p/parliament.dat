5|$|After independence, the <b>Parliament</b> of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed to provide for Non-constituency Members of <b>Parliament</b> ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the <b>Parliament.</b> In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of <b>Parliament</b> ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in <b>Parliament.</b>|$|E

Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.|$|E

40|$|Introduction]. This {{paper is}} about the {{involvement}} of national and especially regional <b>parliaments</b> in EU decision-making. The focus on regional <b>parliaments</b> is justified {{by the fact that}} the relationship between regional <b>parliaments</b> and EU-institutions is hardly studied, although in a substantial number of member states, it are legislative regions and their <b>parliaments</b> that are most obviously confronted with EU legislation. A number of relating questions will be adressed in this paper. The first question {{is about the}} actual possibilities national and regional <b>parliaments</b> have to influence European decisions. Secondly we look at the new provisions in the EU Constitutional Treaty: is the role of the national/regional <b>parliaments</b> strengthened and to what extent? Also, are there other possibilities to give <b>parliaments</b> a bigger say in the European decision-making and why are they not adopted by the Convention or by the IGC? And lastly, but very important, what preconditions must be fulfilled (especially by the national/regional <b>parliaments</b> themselves) to fully exploit the provisions and opportunities they have under the current treaties and the new constitution in a constructive way. But we start with some preliminary remarks on the place of national/regional <b>parliaments</b> in the EU multilevel governance system...|$|R

Finally, what kind of a role do regional <b>parliaments</b> play in EU policy-making today, now that they have had several years to react to the trend towards multilevel parliamentarism? The authors argue that regional <b>parliaments</b> do indeed have the potential to contribute a distinct perspective to EU policy-making, even if their current level of activity is still low.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on parliamentary control in EU matters by focussing on {{the adoption of}} the new roles for national <b>parliaments</b> stipulated in the Lisbon Treaty. To seek an explanation for the differences in scrutiny strength across member states, this master thesis investigates whether parliamentary control is in relation with the eurosceptic nature of national <b>parliaments</b> and its public. It is important to examine the eurosceptic nature of national <b>parliaments,</b> as {{it can be argued that}} national <b>parliaments</b> with an eurosceptic public wish to have European matters handled in their national institutions, whereas national <b>parliaments</b> with a pro-European tendency are more willing to delegate authority to EU institutions. In addition, it is also important to examine this subject as many national <b>parliaments</b> are facing the problem of agency loss and are searching for ways to become stronger represented in the EU. In this master thesis, it is examined whether national <b>parliaments</b> with a strong eurosceptic character are stronger represented in the EU. In other words, is parliamentary control on EU affairs strengthened by public opinion...|$|R
