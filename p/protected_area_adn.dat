50|$|The WDPA {{uses the}} IUCN's {{definition}} of a <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> as the main criteria for entries {{to be included in}} the database.The database contains comprehensive information on the different types of <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> ranging from those strictly protected for conservation purposes to those where sustainable use of natural resources is allowed; and includes government, co-managed, private and community managed areas. The IUCN's World Commission on <b>Protected</b> <b>Areas</b> gives international guidance on the categorisation of <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> through its <b>Protected</b> <b>Area</b> Management Categories. These categories are recognised worldwide and facilitate a global system for defining and recording <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> Within the WPDA the IUCN Management Category of a <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> is listed (if one has been assigned/reported) as part of the information on a <b>protected</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R

40|$|For <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> {{that are}} {{extensively}} forested, {{the rate of}} deforestation is one indicator of {{the integrity of the}} <b>protected</b> <b>area,</b> and the effectiveness of <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> management. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the deforestation rate in <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in Central Africa. Using remote sensing techniques, I measured levels of deforestation in 87 <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in five countries in Central Africa from 1990 - 2000. To examine possible causes of deforestation I also measured the level of access in these <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> A lack of access to remote areas can limit deforestation, forest degradation, and the resulting loss of biodiversity while decreasing development in rural areas. Access was defined either as natural (rivers) or constructed (e. g. roads or transmission lines). The annual net deforestation rate for <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in Central Africa, among the <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> studied, was 0. 05 %. This is lower than the annual rate of forest loss found by other studies for the entire Congo Basin forest. Based on the rates of deforestation in the entire Congo Basin and the assumption that <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> are trying to avoid deforestation, this suggests that Central African <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> may be effective safeguards against deforestation. Five of the 87 <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> exhibited zero deforestation, while one forest reserve, Kaga Bandoro in the Central African Republic, showed a five percent net increase in forest cover since 1990. Cameroon's <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> had significantly higher levels of deforestation than those in the other countries in Central Africa. Within <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in each country studied there was a similar level of reforestation of 5 %. Deforestation in a 10 km <b>area</b> around <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> was not significantly higher than that found within the <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>areas</b> that border other <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> had significantly lower levels of deforestation than <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> that were isolated from each other. The increased disturbance caused by increasing access to the forest seems to be of an ephemeral nature, initially resulting in forest loss, but leading to reforestation. There was no difference in deforestation rates when a road or river bordered a <b>protected</b> <b>area,</b> or crossed through a <b>protected</b> <b>area.</b> Only the density of roads or rivers had an effect on the deforestation rates. The secondary impacts of human use on both the forest structure and the wildlife inhabiting the forest are likely to be detrimental, and worthy of further study...|$|R

40|$|Nearly {{two hundred}} transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> {{comprise}} {{a portion of}} the global conservation landscape the size of India, with further expansion anticipated. Proponents claim that transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> outperform isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in achieving conservation objectives, while regional case studies have led critics to challenge this claim. Empirical investigation into the relative performance of transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> is fundamentally limited since these areas cannot be directly compared to the isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> that might otherwise have emerged in the same location. This paper develops a game theory model of park formation to compare counterfactual transboundary and isolated <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> The model suggests that under certain conditions, transboundary <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> can achieve greater conservation and production objectives, {{even in the absence of}} international cooperative park management.

40|$|Historically, <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> {{were often}} {{designated}} using criteria other than biodiversity conservation {{as the primary}} objective. With {{the emergence of the}} science of systematic conservation planning, the designation of new <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> is increasingly made with explicit conservation objectives in mind. However, assessments of the performance of <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> systems typically include all <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> regardless of when they were designated, potentially obscuring recent improvements in conservation planning decisions. Thus, it is often unclear to what extent systematic conservation planning principles have influenced the placement of new <b>protected</b> <b>areas.</b> Here, we compare recently designated <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in Australia with the <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> system that existed prior to the introduction of systematic conservation planning guidelines in 2000. We ask whether {{there is a difference between}} past and recent protection in terms of (i) the size and spatial distribution of <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> (ii) the characteristics of broad regions in which protection is concentrated, and (iii) the extent to which <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> represent ecosystems and threatened species in comparison with selecting <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> at random. We find that the <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> system was historically biased toward areas with steep slopes and low human populations. In contrast, recent protection is more likely to be allocated to regions with high human population and high numbers of threatened species; we show that this effect is not simply a result of biases in the places now available for conservation. Despite this successful realignment of practice, we find that the increase in <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> coverage in poorly protected regions has occurred more slowly than expected if <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> selections were fully guided by systematic conservation planning principles.

There has been a proliferation in the number of categories of <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> in the past ten years; since 1990 six new categories of <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> have been established, two resulting from European directives.
