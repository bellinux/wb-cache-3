25|$|The {{traditional}} {{layout of}} Ado-Ewi {{appeared to have}} taken definite shape {{from the time of}} Ewi Awamaro as a matter of strategic repositioning for Kingdom building and political dominance of the rural and conquered communities. The traditional layout design of Ado-Ekiti relocated most of the early settlers outside the vicinity of Ewi’s Palace. It was an arrangement that also left the Ado community and the subordinate towns to revolve around Ewi in a preferred order. The enlargement of the Ewi’s Kingdom during the reign of Ewi Gberubioya (1630-1696) in the 17th century and other successive Ewis upward into late 19th century which covers the <b>period</b> <b>under</b> <b>review</b> with the expansion of the main town’s layout indicates that they did not alter the traditions for town settings which is similar to what is obtained in many other of Yoruba major towns.|$|E

In the circumstances where subjected towns and their rebellion-prone rulers were faraway or near but troublesome by striving for autonomy or independence from Ewi’s influence as identified in case of the Alawe, the Olosi, the Olode, the Onijan and the Onimesi; rulers of other subordinate towns and Ewi’s chieftains were constantly on hand to check them against crisis that could create chaos or attract foreign invasions.|$|E

2500|$|Via Christi (Macmillan, October, 1902) was {{a volume}} of missionary annals, which {{in less than two}} years reached a sale of nearly 50,000 copies. During the Ecumenical Missionary Conference, held in New York, April 21-May 1, 1900, a long-contemplated plan to unite all Women's Boards of Missions in the United States and Canada in a more {{thorough}} study of missions had taken shape. At a meeting held at the close of the conference, a representative committee was appointed, and was given discretionary power to arrange the course of study and provide the method to pursue it. Via Christi, an Introduction to the Study of Missions, was the first of a series proposed by the committee, to be followed by studies of India, China, Japan, and other countries, each volume treating of the history of all missions in the country to which it was devoted, and beginning, in each case, with the 19th century. William Fairfield Warren, President Boston University, said of it, [...] "Via Christi shows scholarly estimate of the value and enjoyableness of historic sources, as contrasted with rhetorical elaboration merely suggested by the sources. Though but a little US$0.50 volume, it would be hard to find in any book three times its size an equal number of prayers, hymns, and striking appeals, written by the great historic representatives of the missionary spirit themselves." [...] The Christian Endeavor World remarked, [...] "One of the results of the Ecumenical Missionary Conference of 1900 was the uniting of all the Women's Missionary Boards in the United States and Canada for the publication of a thorough and complete course of a study of missions. The initial volume is entitled Via Christi, and is by a most competent and attractive writer, Miss Louise Manning Hodgkins. In six chapters the reader is conducted through the vast course of history, extending from the days of Paul to those of Carey and Judson. The author has not made the mistake of putting in so much that the charm and vividness of the narrative are crowded out. One of the most attractive features of the volume is the set of selections from the <b>period</b> <b>under</b> <b>review</b> at the close of each chapter and the effectively arranged chronological tables." [...] The New York Tribune also reviewed the book, stating, Via Christi gives a bird's-eye view of the missionary efforts of the world from the time of Paul to the nineteenth century. Contemporaneous events in the secular world are mentioned, with names of prominent people and places of the period, giving a perspective as satisfying as it is unusual." ...|$|E

The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the interaction between cultural and religious identity, and more especially, Christian identity; how they develop in relation to each other, and how they differ. This thesis takes as its, starting point {{the conviction that the}} understanding of, and the relationship to, the other, is what both develops and distinguishes Christian identity from cultural identity. In order to come {{to a better understanding of}} this complex set of relationships, the case of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa has been examined. The role of the Dutch Reformed Church in the cultural construction of Afrikaner identity has been examined both in the formative stages of Afrikanerdom until the demise of Apartheid, and then in its more recent role in the deconstruction and reconstruction of Afrikaner identity since the transition to democracy in 1994, tracing both continuities and discontinuities between the earlier and later <b>periods</b> <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> Several others have been considered critical for the construction of Afrikaner identity. Finally, having considered the global upsurge of ethnic and religious fundamentalist identities and the effects of this on Afrikaner identity, the message for the future both locally in South Africa and globally is one of Christian humanism, in conjunction with a general need for global ethics, protecting and celebrating our full humanity, irrespective of race, gender, culture and religious conviction. This thesis is interdisciplinary, examining the issues both from a socio-historical viewpoint and from a theological perspective drawing, in particular, on the work of Mary Douglas and Dietrich Bonhoeffer...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the trends in relative contribution each selected factor makes to the chance of a child’s death over time in South Africa for children born 5 years preceding 1997 and 5 years preceding 2002. Attention was paid to the role played by socio-economic factors, biological and maternal factors, environmental factors, nutrient deficiency factors and health seeking behaviour factors. The study investigates whether the association of a specific factor to under- 5 mortality persist over time. Data from the 1997 October Household Survey and the 2002 General Household Survey were used. Births that occurred in the five years preceding each survey were analysed in relation to the survival of the child and socio-economic factors, biological and maternal factors, environmental factors, nutrient deficiency factors and health seeking behaviour factors. Logistic regression was used to determine the relative contribution of each factor for the two <b>periods</b> <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> Under- 5 mortality was significantly associated with eight factors during 1993 - 1997 period namely; mother’s education, mother’s place of residence, sex, birth order, birth interval, mother’s age at the time of delivery of the subject child, nutrient deficiency and place of delivery. However, during the 1998 - 2002 period only five factors were significantly associated with under- 5 mortality. These were mother’s education, sex, birth interval, type of dwelling and place of delivery. This suggests changing patterns in factors associated with under- 5 mortality between the two birth cohorts: 1993 - 1997 and the 1998 - 2002 birth cohorts.

In both studies, three measures were used to evaluate the efficiency of document delivery operations: fill rate, turnaround time and direct costs.

Results ‐ Data for the two <b>periods</b> <b>under</b> <b>review,</b> 1999 ‐ 2000 and 2004 ‐ 2005, indicate that borrowing fill rates remained relatively stable, showing only a 3 % drop in the latter year, while lending fill rates showed a significant increase (11 %). Turnaround times for filled QEII/DD borrowing returnable requests were faster on average by 4. 2 days or 24 %. Turnaround times for QEII/DD non‐returnable borrowing requests also show improvement: a filled non‐returnable request was faster on average by 1 day or 12 %.

40|$|We {{consider}} a single server queue that serves a finite population of n customers that {{will enter the}} queue (require service) only once, {{also known as the}} Δ_(i) /G/ 1 queue. This paper presents a method for analyzing heavy-traffic behavior by using uniform acceleration, which simultaneously lets n and the service rate grow large, while the initial resource utilization approaches one. A key feature of the model is that, as time progresses, more customers have joined the queue, and fewer customers can potentially join. This diminishing population gives rise to a class of reflected stochastic processes that vanish over time, and hence do not have a stationary distribution. We establish that, when the arrival times are exponentially distributed, by suitably rescaling space and time, the queue length process converges to a Brownian motion with parabolic drift, a stochastic-process limit that captures the effect of a diminishing population by a negative quadratic drift. When the arrival times are generally distributed, our techniques provide information on the typical queue length and the first busy <b>period.</b> Comment: <b>Under</b> <b>review,</b> Math. of Operations Researc...|$|R

With this in mind, a brief overview at the socio-economic history of each country is given and the various plans implemented by both countries are considered. In chapter one, a brief comparison between the histories of the two countries was made. The intent of this comparison is to highlight the disparities between two countries who were once economically on par. In chapter two, the different approaches to economic growth and development is discussed. The role of human capital and its effects on a countries economy is highlighted. The question of which approach to use is also considered. Should it be purely one approach or can it be a combination from the various models? Chapters three and four deals with the various programmes that have been implemented by South Korea and South Africa, respectively. The approach used and also the outcomes (where possible) are evaluated. In the South Korean situation the difficulties that have shaped the nation and the lingering effects that are still prevalent in its policies (budget allowance for defence and education) can be discerned. In the South African situation it is apparent that the government is also trying to deal with the lingering effects of apartheid.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} question, “What political, social, and cultural realities influenced {{the representation of}} women in American popular dramaturgy from the post-Revolutionary through the antebellum periods?” Drawing on the theories of Silvan Tompkins, Michel Foucault, and Lauren Berlant, among others, I theorize {{the extent to which}} affects of distress (the embodied experience of anxiety) inform some of the most frequently reprised tropes of theatrical femininity in the nineteenth century. I argue that racialized tropes of imperiled femininity in the United States’ early plays reflected, and acted as an outlet for, the social anxieties particular to the crises surrounding the related issues of gender, race, law, and liberty that characterized the United States in its founding decades. The oft-repeated moments in which theatrical women are placed in danger relate directly to the nation’s most pressing socio-political issues, namely the controlling of women through restrictive gender roles, the acquisition of land through the aggressive removal of Native Americans, and the persistence of slavery in the “land of the free. ” I employ a historiographical approach to the plays in this study, reading them alongside historical events such as landmark court cases, innovations in medicine, and instances of extreme mass violence. I rely on contemporary literature of the <b>periods</b> <b>under</b> <b>review,</b> including slave narratives, advice manuals, and newspaper articles. Finally, I draw greatly on archival research into nineteenth-century theatrical ephemera {{in order to create a}} sense of the theatre-going experience, especially when describing moments of spectacle and suspense. The specific tropes of femininity I analyze are the white virgin of Republican-era Gothic plays, the helpful Indian princess trope in Jacksonian Pocahontas dramas, and the mixed-race slave woman of antebellum slavery melodramas. To emphasize their frequency, I analyze three plays in each chapter, providing a brief survey of this dramaturgical phenomenon. I demonstrate the extent to which the racist and misogynist attitudes of patriarchy inform these representations and conclude with the consideration that this legacy still influences the depiction of femininity in American media today...|$|R

25|$|With {{regard to}} {{paneling}} generally, there were, {{during the last}} fifty years of the <b>period</b> now <b>under</b> <b>review,</b> three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the linenfold design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at Bere Regis, Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or sprigs of foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the crocket unequaled as they have always been in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house.|$|R
