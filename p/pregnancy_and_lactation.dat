40|$|CONTEXT: It is {{believed}} that about 25 % of menopausal women in the USA will exhibit some kind of fracture {{as a consequence of}} osteoporosis. Fractures of the proximal femur are associated with a greater number of deaths and disabilities and higher medical expenses than all the other osteoporotic fractures together. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and epidemiological features of patients with proximal femur fracture in hospitals in São Paulo. DESIGN: Transversal and retrospective study. LOCAL: Hospital São Paulo and Hospital Servidor Público Estadual "Francisco Morato Oliveira". PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged sixty-five years or more hospitalized because of proximal femur fracture, from March to November 1996 (N = 73). This group was compared to patients of the same age without fracture of the proximal femur. INTERVENTION: Evaluation of weight, height, body mass index; lifestyle habits (physical activity at home, ingestion of dairy calcium, drinking of coffee, smoking habit), gynecological history (ages at menarche and menopause, number of <b>pregnancies</b> <b>and</b> <b>lactations),</b> previous morbidity, use of medications, history of previous fractures, family history of osteoporosis. MEASUREMENT: The comparison of the different data regarding lifestyle habits between the two groups was made using the chi-squared test. Other data were analyzed using the Mann [...] Whitney test. P £ 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: We noted a predominance of proximal femur fracture among females in relation to males (a female/male ratio of 3. 3 : 1) with a progressive increase in the frequency of proximal femur fracture with age in both sexes. The group with proximal femur fracture, in comparison with the control group, showed a lower body mass index, less physical activity, and a greater number of <b>pregnancies</b> <b>and</b> <b>lactations.</b> Other data were not different. CONCLUSION: In accordance with the literature, we found a predomination of proximal femur fracture in women in relation to men, and a favorable effect of higher body mass index and physical activity for decreasing the frequency of proximal femur fracture. We also discuss the role of <b>pregnancies</b> <b>and</b> <b>lactation</b> on the frequency of proximal femur fracture...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the changes in renal function in late pregnant and early lactating Corriedale ewes. Compared with the non-productive state, plasma urea concentration was increased by 67 % during pregnancy, whereas it decreased by 36 % during lactation. Urine flow, urea clearance, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) during both late <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> early <b>lactation.</b> Filtered load of urea and the amount of urea eliminated were significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) only in lactating ewes. No changes were noted in the fractional excretion of urea, the filtration fraction and the urine osmolality during both late <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> early <b>lactation.</b> It was concluded that, as in other breeds, Corriedale ewes can adapt to increased nitrogen requirements during late <b>pregnancy,</b> <b>and</b> especially during early lactation, by increasing the renal conservation of urea.

25|$|Fennec foxes {{are social}} animals that mate for life, with each pair or family {{controlling}} their own territory. Sexual maturity is reached at around nine months old.

However, in captivity most litters are born later, between March and July, although births can occur year-round. The species usually breeds only once each year. The copulation tie has been recorded as lasting up to two hours and 45 minutes.

40|$|Lactation {{will reduce}} the stores of bone mineral {{irrespective}} {{of the amount of}} dietary calcium. In the rat, mineral requirements for lactation are met primarily by remodeling the cancellous bone in the metaphyses of long bones. Fluoride, by the nature of its incorporation into bone crystals and by its direct cytotoxic effect on bone resorbing cells, reduces the availability of calcium from bone. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the effects of fluoride ingestion <b>and</b> multiple <b>pregnancies</b> <b>and</b> <b>lactations</b> on the morphology of the rat femur. Virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a standard laboratory diet and 150 ppm fluoride in the drinking water ad lib. while undergoing three successive <b>pregnancies</b> <b>and</b> <b>lactations.</b> Rebreeding periods commenced immediately following a 21 -day lactation period. All litters were normalized to 8 pups on the day of birth. Following the third lactation period, both femurs were removed from all animals and prepared for either light or scanning electron microscopy. Periosteal surfaces of the diaphysis consisted of areas of woven bone formation with some prolonged resting areas around osteocyte lacunae. Endosteal surfaces consisted of areas of bone formation and resorption. Mineralized segments in formation areas were short and irregular in shape, and arranged in an unorganized manner. The irregular Howship 2 ̆ 7 s lacunae in resorption areas were located at various depths and sub-divided by prominent sharp ridges. The active resorption process exposed several layers of bone lamellae. The interior of the diaphysis was characterized by absence of an endosteal zone and by extensive bone loss from the intermediate zone by cavitation and remodeling in secondary Haversian systems. Distal metaphyseal trabeculae were dominated b y large areas of active resorption. It appears that fluoride ingestion during lactation created a heightened state of calcium homeostatic stress. Consequently, additional bone mineral was mobilized by resorption of the interior and endosteal surfaces of the diaphysis...|$|R

25|$|Choline in food {{exists in}} either a free or esterified form (choline bound within another compound, such as phosphatidylcholine, through an ester linkage).

Both <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> <b>lactation</b> increase demand for choline dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of PEMT via increasing estrogen levels to produce more choline de novo, but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for choline is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that Pemt -/- mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental choline.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a direct}} {{correlation}} between the geographic distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) {{and the distribution of}} indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that receive higher amounts of UVR, generally located closer to the equator, tend to have darker-skinned populations. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower intensity of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations. Researchers suggest that human populations over the past 50,000 years have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned and vice versa as they migrated to different UV zones, and that such major changes in pigmentation may have happened in as little as 100 generations (≈2,500 years) through selective sweeps. Natural skin color can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells. In addition, it has been observed that adult human females on average are significantly lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium during <b>pregnancy</b> <b>and</b> <b>lactation.</b> The body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight, which helps it absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.|$|E
