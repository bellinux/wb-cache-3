40|$|All Finnish-speaking {{students}} in Finland {{are obliged to}} study Swedish at lower and upper secondary school. At university, students taking a degree must obtain a Civil Service Language <b>Proficiency</b> (CSLP) <b>Certificate</b> in Swedish, for which spoken and written proficiency corresponding to at least level B 1 on the Council of Europe’s Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) must be demonstrated, along with the proficiency necessary for the professional field in question. This article aims to empirically examine {{the extent to which}} university students demonstrate the requested level of written proficiency when entering university, and to discuss potential actions {{to meet the challenges of}} the current situation. A total of 490 university students participated in the study, representing seven faculties at a Finnish-speaking university.

The results show that 52. 9 % of the essays were marked below B 1. This article concludes by discussing the need for increased consistency in assessment procedures at all educational stages. Possible actions for improving general level of skills at lower and upper secondary schools are suggested, as is a reconsideration of the need for everyone to obtain the CSLP Certificate as part of university study...|$|R
5000|$|To {{coincide}} with {{introduction of the}} various upskilling packages in the early 2000s there was a {{move away from the}} once nationally consistent qualification titles (Ambulance Officer, Intermediate Care Officer, Advanced Care Officer (Paramedic)) that existed under the National Training School to the introduction of new titles into each of the services. St John renamed Intermediate Care Officer to [...] "Paramedic" [...] and Paramedic (ACO) to [...] "Advanced Paramedic" [...] in 2001 along with a new national uniform. [...] Wellington Free Ambulance chose to rename all staff qualified at National <b>Certificate</b> (<b>Proficiency)</b> or Intermediate Aid to [...] "Paramedic" [...] and their Paramedics (ACOs) to [...] "Intensive Care Paramedic". There is anecdotal suggestion that the renaming of staff who did not hold the full National Diploma/Advanced Aid to [...] "Paramedic" [...] was {{due in part to the}} high media profile of programs such as Third Watch and Rescue 911 which glorified and glamorised the role of [...] "Paramedic" [...] thus giving the public an expectation that they, as on TV, should be attended to by a [...] "Paramedic". It has also been recorded that the move to rename Intermediate Care Officer to [...] "Paramedic" [...] on the part of St John was somewhat motivated by their desire to expedite contract negotiations with the Ministry of Health and ACC which required a certain number of [...] "Paramedics" [...] however it can be logically assumed that the contract did not actually define what a [...] "Paramedic" [...] was, as the original definition of a Paramedic in New Zealand was somebody qualified to National Diploma/Advanced Care level.|$|R
