25|$|An {{abdominal}} {{aortic aneurysm}} is usually diagnosed by physical exam, ultrasound, or CT. Plain abdominal radiographs may show {{the outline of}} an aneurysm when its walls are calcified.

Additionally, free <b>peritoneal</b> <b>fluid</b> can be detected. It is noninvasive and sensitive, but the presence of bowel gas or obesity may limit its usefulness. CT scan has a nearly 100% sensitivity for an aneurysm and is also useful in preoperative planning, detailing the anatomy and possibility for endovascular repair. In the case of suspected rupture, it can also reliably detect retroperitoneal fluid. Alternative less often used methods for visualization of an aneurysm include MRI and angiography.|$|E

The present study was aimed to explore the effects of the extracts of SMB (ESMB) on the serum levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA- 125) and the levels of interleukin (IL) - 13, IL- 18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> of rat endometriosis models. Three extraction methods for SMB were compared, which are the sample extracted with conventional method, the sample extracted with espresso coffee machine and the commercial condensed powder of natural products.

40|$|To {{investigate}} possible {{mechanisms of}} pain pathophysiology {{in patients with}} peritoneal endometriosis, a clinical study on sensory and sympathetic nerve fibre sprouting in endometriosis was performed. Peritoneal lesions (n= 40) and healthy peritoneum (n= 12) were immunostained and analysed with anti-protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5), anti-substance P (SP) and anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), specific markers for intact nerve fibres, sensory nerve fibres and sympathetic nerve fibres, respectively, to identify the ratio of sympathetic and sensory nerve fibres. In addition, immune cell infiltrates in peritoneal endometriotic lesions were analysed and the nerve growth factor (NGF) and interleukin (IL) - 1 β expression was correlate with the nerve fibre density. <b>Peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> from patients with endometriosis (n= 40) and without endometriosis (n= 20) {{were used for the}} in vitro neuronal growth assay. Cultured chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and sympathetic ganglia were stained with anti-growth associated protein 43 (anti-GAP 43), anti-SP and anti-TH. We could detect an increased sensory and decreased sympathetic nerve fibres density in peritoneal lesions compared to healthy peritoneum. <b>Peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> of patients with endometriosis compared to patients without endometriosis induced an increased sprouting of sensory neurites from DRG and decreased neurite outgrowth from sympathetic ganglia.

Patients with endometriosis were divided into 7 different groups depending on their preoperative pain score and symptomatology: patients with no pain, patients with minimal pain (dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, or both), and patients with severe pain (dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, or both) and were used for the neuronal growth assay with cultured chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and for Western blot analyses.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{production}} of ascites {{is a common}} complication of ovarian cancer. Ascites constitute a unique tumor microenvironment that may affect disease progression. In this context, we recently showed that ovarian cancer ascites may protect tumor cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In this study, we sought {{to determine whether the}} prosurvival effect of ascites affects disease-free intervals. Methods <b>Peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> were obtained from 54 women undergoing intra-abdominal surgery for suspected ovarian cancer (44 cancers and 10 benign diseases). The ability of <b>peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> to protect from TRAIL was assessed in the ovarian cancer cell line CaOV 3, and IC 50 were determined. The anti-apoptotic activity of 6 ascites against cisplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide and vinorelbine was also assessed in CaOV 3 cells, and the prosurvival activity of two ascites was assessed in 9 primary ovarian cancer cultures. Results Among the 54 <b>peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> tested, inhibition of TRAIL cytotoxicity was variable. Fluids originating from ovarian cancer were generally more protective than fluids from non-malignant diseases. Most of the 44 ovarian cancer ascites increased TRAIL IC 50 and this inhibitory effect did not correlate strongly with the protein concentration in these ascites or the levels of serum CA 125, a tumor antigen which is used in the clinic as a marker of tumor burden. The effect of ascites on cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced cell death was assessed with 4 ascites having inhibitory effect on TRAIL-induced cell death and 2 that do not. The four ascites with prosurvival activity against TRAIL had some inhibitory on cisplatin and/or paclitaxel. Two ovarian cancer ascites, OVC 346 and OVC 509, also inhibited TRAIL cytotoxicity in 9 primary cultures of ovarian tumor and induced Akt activation in three of these primary cultures. Among a cohort of 35 patients with ascites, a threshold of TRAIL IC 50 with ascites/IC 50 without ascites > 2 was associated with shorter disease-free interval. Conclusions The prosurvival activity of ascites against TRAIL is associated with shorter disease-free interval, which may be explained, at least in part, by ascites-induced cisplatin/paclitaxel resistance. Our findings suggest that ascites may contain prosurvival factors that protect against TRAIL and chemotherapy and consequently affect disease progression. </p...|$|R

Study: Synovial, cerebrospinal, pleural and <b>peritoneal</b> <b>fluids,</b> obtained from 32 patients were analyzed by Gram stain, culture and PCR. Results: 1.

40|$|The peritoneal cavity is {{a common}} target of metastatic {{gastrointestinal}} and ovarian cancer cells, but the mechanisms leading to peritoneal metastasis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the roles of cells in <b>peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> {{on the development of}} peritoneal metastasis. We found that a minor subset of human intraperitoneal cells with CD 90 (+) /CD 45 (-) phenotype vigorously grew in culture with mesothelial-like appearance. The mesothelial-like cells (MLC) displayed the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cell, such as differentiating into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes, and suppressing T cell proliferation. These cells highly expressed type I collagen, vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin and fibroblast activated protein-α by the stimulation with TGF-β, which is characteristic of activated myofibroblasts. Intraperitoneal co-injection of MLCs with the human gastric cancer cell line, MKN 45, significantly enhanced the rate of metastatic formation in the peritoneum of nude mice. Histological examination revealed that many MLCs were engrafted in metastatic nodules and were mainly located at the fibrous area. Dasatinib, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, strongly inhibited the proliferation of MLCs but not MKN 45 in vitro. Nevertheless, oral administration of Dasatinib significantly inhibited the development of peritoneal metastasis of MKN 45, and resulted in reduced fibrillar formation of metastatic nodules. These results suggest floating MLCs in the <b>peritoneal</b> <b>fluids</b> support the development of peritoneal metastasis possibly through the production of the permissive microenvironment, and thus the functional blockade of MLCs is a reasonable strategy to treat recurrent abdominal malignancies...|$|R
