The REC consisted of around 100 persons who were located {{in each of the}} SITE clusters, at the SITE studio in Bombay, and at the headquarters of the REC in Ahmedabad. The research design was finalized by the SITE Social Science Research Co-ordination Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. M. S. Gore, Director of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Bombay. Impact on primary school children was studied under a joint project involving ISRO and the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). The overall evaluation design was divided into three stages. The first stage, the formative or input research, was a detailed study of the potential audience. The second stage, <b>process</b> <b>evaluation,</b> was the evaluation carried out during the life-time of SITE. This evaluation provided information about the reaction of the villagers to different programmes. The third stage, the summative evaluation, involved a number of different studies to measure the impact of SITE. These included the Impact Survey (Adults) to measure the impact on adults, SITE Impact Survey Children (SIS-C) to measure the impact on school children, and the qualitative anthropology study to measure, at a macro-level, the change brought by TV in rural society.|$|E

While <b>process</b> <b>evaluations</b> of health behavior interventions have increasingly engaged with the social world and sociological aspects of interventions, there has been a lag in applying relevant and potentially useful approaches from the social sciences. This has limited the scope for health behavior <b>process</b> <b>evaluations</b> to address pertinent contextual issues and methodological challenges. Three aspects of <b>process</b> <b>evaluations</b> are discussed: the incorporation of contexts of interventions; engagement with the concept of “process” in process evaluation; and working with theory to understand interventions.

50|$|Process {{analysis}} looks {{beyond the}} theory of what the program {{is supposed to do}} and instead evaluates how the program is being implemented. This evaluation determines whether the components identified as {{critical to the success of}} the program are being implemented. The evaluation determines whether target populations are being reached, people are receiving the intended services, staff are adequately qualified. <b>Process</b> <b>evaluation</b> is an ongoing process in which repeated measures may be used to evaluate whether the program is being implemented effectively. This problem is particularly critical because many innovations, particularly in areas like education and public policy, consist of fairly complex chains of action. Many of which these elements rely on the prior correct implementation of other elements, and will fail if the prior implementation was not done correctly. This was conclusively demonstrated by Gene V. Glass and many others during the 1980s. Since incorrect or ineffective implementation will produce the same kind of neutral or negative results that would be produced by correct implementation of a poor innovation, it is essential that evaluation research assess the implementation process itself. Otherwise, a good innovative idea may be mistakenly characterized as ineffective, where in fact it simply had never been implemented as designed.|$|E

This article is an explication of <b>process</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods from studies involving several frameworks for process evaluations.
