5|$|We {{have here}} a Dr. Reich, a worthy but impetuous young man, passionately {{devoted to his}} hobby-horse, who now salutes in the genital orgasm the {{antidote}} to every neurosis. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> might learn from your analysis of K. to feel some respect for the complicated nature of the psyche.|$|E
5|$|Tatwine was a Mercian by birth. His {{epigraph}} at Canterbury {{stated that}} when he died he was in old age, so <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was born around 670. He became a monk at the monastery at Breedon-on-the-Hill in the present-day County of Leicestershire, and then abbot of that house. Through the influence of King Æthelbald he was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury in 731 and was consecrated on 10 June 731. He {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s. Apart from his consecration of the Bishops of Lindsey and Selsey in 733, Tatwine's period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful. He died in office on 30 July 734. Later considered a saint, his feast day is 30 July.|$|E
5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured {{as to why he}} made this decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because he's not buried here. He's not Christian-buried anywhere, {{as far as}} we know. In short, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> not {{buried at}} all; and between ourselves, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> alive.' ...|$|R

25|$|But then again, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> {{just had}} big hands.|$|E
25|$|In the Life of Crassus Plutarch {{wrote that}} in Rome {{there were reports}} about the two men's meeting with Caesar. Pompey and Crassus {{were asked if they}} were going to be {{candidates}} for the consulship. Pompey replied that <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was not. Crassus replied that he would if it was in the interest of the city, but otherwise he would desist. When they announced their candidacies everyone withdrew theirs, but Cato encouraged Lucius Domitius to proceed with his. He withdrew it when his slave was killed. Plutarch mentioned Cato's encouragement and the murder of the slave in The Life of Pompey as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstances}} of Cabot's death appear obscure and contradictory. He was last {{mentioned as a}} member of an expedition led by his son Sebastian in 1508-1509. Nothing is known about Cabot after that; <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> died during the journey, or more likely shortly after returning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, just so," [...] {{the clerk}} {{answered}} calmly. [...] "He didn't mention your name. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> coming back by-and-by {{to settle for}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|MINNIE. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> been here--I don't know. I {{just came}} in. (She hesitates a second, then {{goes to the}} bench and lays the letter down.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was afraid}} {{when he was}} ill; I wonder why. The fellow has no {{religious}} or moral code. But he drinks hard and <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> superstitious." ...|$|R
25|$|Polo did {{not entirely}} {{understand}} what he saw, however. As explained in the Aobo Tu, workers actually sprinkled sea water on the fields which then filtered through sand or fine ash into pits, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> could have seen “earth salt” derived from soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{physician}} was Al-Ḥariṯ ben-Kalada aṯ-Ṯaqafī, {{who lived at}} the same time as the prophet. He is supposed to have been in touch with the Academy of Gondishapur, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was even trained there. He reportedly had a conversation once with Khosrow I Anushirvan about medical topics.|$|E
25|$|For his chord table Hipparchus {{must have}} used a better {{approximation}} for π than the one from Archimedes of between 3+1/7 and 3+10/71; <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> had the one later used by Ptolemy: 3;8:30 (sexagesimal) (Almagest VI.7); {{but it is not}} known if he computed an improved value himself.|$|E
60|$|The station passed, the {{brakeman}} did not return, <b>perhaps</b> because <b>he</b> {{found some}} other listener, <b>perhaps</b> because <b>he</b> {{was afraid of}} boring this pleasant young fellow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{the pity}} of it! After all, a {{shepherd}} has his human weaknesses; <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> too fond of using his private mark or {{the stamp of}} his guild." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, don’t try," [...] said Miss Boom kindly. [...] "You’d {{better go}} back and tell father about the pouch. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he’s</b> waiting for a smoke all this time." ...|$|R
25|$|Next, {{he ran for}} the quaestorship {{after losing}} an {{election}} for local office in Arpinum. The military tribunate shows that he was already interested in Roman politics before the quaestorship. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> simply ran for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to some other local worthy. Nothing is known of his actions while quaestor.|$|E
25|$|He {{regarded}} {{his life}} in bittersweet terms. He had risen from humble origins to mix with the intellectual elite and was by 35 a considerably wealthy man and leading member of the 'progressive sciences'. Nonetheless, he was insecure about his land holdings and his ambitions of obtaining important political posts remained frustrated. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> expected the astronomical rise he experienced in his early years to continue throughout his life. Contemporaries described him, nonetheless, as humorous, good-natured and rational.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, Stirling has {{set this}} novel in 1998 placing us firmly within {{the realms of}} {{alternative}} history. The reason {{for the use of}} this device is not clear, as it doesn't really impact upon the progress of the narrative. Perhaps the author sought after a sense of immediacy garnered by making the events take place in our past rather than our future. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> sought to avoid the work being viewed as a prediction of things to come – an obvious trap for many speculative works.|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly--and two grandmothers as well. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> {{got them}} yet," [...] replied the grave {{man with a}} contemplative look over the side, where the {{rippling}} sea gleamed with phosphoric brilliancy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{spotted him}} all right. It was that chap who was marking me today, Stanning. Wonder what <b>he's</b> after. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> gone to tar the statue, like O'Hara. Rather a sportsman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> speculating in {{building}} lots; we deal in them," [...] Carmen rejoined with a laugh. [...] "I sometimes meet my father's friends, but don't {{ask them about}} their business." ...|$|R
25|$|Chief Waramaug watched sadly as {{once more}} his daughter's health began to fail and her usually happy {{disposition}} to turn morose under mounting waves of despondency. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>he</b> thought, he might {{bring her back}} from the brink of deep depression if he could only interest her in a young man of her own race. So, unknown to Lillinonah, Waramaug arranged a marriage for her with Eagle Feather, one of the brightest, most promising braves in the Pootatuck tribe. Surely, such a fine youth as he, could give Lillinonah something to live for.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 Boccioni {{published}} his book, Pittura, scultura futuriste (Futurist Painting and Sculpture), which caused a rift {{between himself and}} some of his Futurist comrades. As a result, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>he</b> abandoned his exploration of Dynamism, and instead sought further decomposition of a subject by means of colour. With Horizontal Volumes in 1915 and the Portrait of Ferruccio Busoni in 1916, he completed a full return to figurative painting. Perhaps fittingly, this last painting was a portrait of the maestro who purchased his first Futurist work, The City Rises.|$|E
25|$|Crowned (1989) tackles {{a similar}} theme, {{but from the}} {{perspective}} of the founding fathers. The film, based on a play by author Yaakov Shabtai (adapted by Ephraim Sidon and Ram Loevy), is an intense comedy based on the final days of the biblical King David. As his life approaches its end, he faces the most difficult task of his forty-year reign—giving up his crown to the next generation. Or <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> might even find a way to keep the crown for himself. The fact that this film was aired when Israel was itself forty years old was not lost on its audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "The nearest {{doctor is}} fifteen miles away, and Manuel {{is nowhere to}} be found. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> gone to look after the stock. There's some talk of snow; imagine the absurdity of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very much, after all. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> {{accountable}} for my broken bones, {{but it was}} my obstinacy and ridiculous self-confidence that sent me here. That's what I really mean to talk about." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "John-John McIntyre is the {{smallest}} seventh grader in the world. Even fifth graders can see over his head. Sometimes I {{have a hard time}} believing he and me are both thirteen. He is Maleeka's color, but ever since second grade he's been teasing me about being too black. At first, there doesn't seem to be a reason why John-John might be teasing Maleeka. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> jealous because Maleeka is a tall, cute, smart young lady even if she doesn't quite realize it yet, she's rather gorgeous too. And <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> also jealous of her perfect relationship with Caleb.|$|R
25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. <b>Perhaps,</b> <b>he</b> suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that we would have never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E
25|$|He took María Josefa Tafoya, the {{daughter}} of a prominent Taos family who were Mexican citizens, as his wife in a common-law marriage. By the late 1820s and early 1830s, the Mexican authorities were growing concerned about American settlers and their influences in Nuevo México. They began to impose increasingly severe restrictions on trade and trapping. Perhaps in part to avoid these restrictions, Young was baptized a Catholic in 1830 (<b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> also became a Mexican citizen and formalized his marriage to Maria Tafoya; however, if he did so, no record of these two events survives).|$|E
25|$|Soon after Johnston's trial had concluded, Bligh {{received}} a backdated promotion to rear admiral. In 1814 {{he was promoted}} again, to vice admiral of the blue. Significantly <b>perhaps,</b> <b>he</b> never again {{received a}}n important command, though with the Napoleonic Wars almost over {{there would have been}} few fleet commands available. He did, however, design the North Bull Wall {{at the mouth of the}} River Liffey in Dublin. Its purpose was to clear a sandbar by Venturi action. As a result of its building. North Bull Island was formed by the sand cleared by the river's now more narrowly focused force. Bligh also charted and mapped Dublin Bay.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> {{turned himself}} about, [...] His face unto his horse's tail, [...] And still and mute, in wonder lost, [...] All like a silent horse-man ghost, [...] He travels on along the vale.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} {{a man so}} imperturbable, and who had yet so much to say for himself. I wonder what <b>he</b> is! <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> on business, and that man {{was a kind of}} a clerk." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Farnam pondered {{this and}} then made a sign of understanding. [...] "I think I see; the man is white, {{although}} <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> foolishly proud. In fact, I imagine he's worth one's taking some trouble about--" ...|$|R
