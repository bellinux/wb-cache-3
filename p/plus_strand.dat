25|$|Picornaviruses have a {{viral protein}} (VPg) covalently linked to 5’ {{end of their}} genomes instead of 7-methylguanosine cap like {{cellular}} mRNAs. Virus RNA polymerases use VPg as primer. VPg as primer uses both minus and <b>plus</b> <b>strand</b> RNA synthesis. Picornavirus replication is initiated by the uridylylation of viral protein genome-linked (VPg).It is uridylylated at the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue.|$|E
2500|$|Genomic RNAs of picornaviruses possess {{multiple}} RNA {{elements and}} they are required for both negative and <b>plus</b> <b>strand</b> RNA synthesis. The cis acting replication(cre) element is required for replication. The stem-loop-structure that contains the cre is independent of position but changes with location between virus types when it has been identified. Also, the 3’ end elements of viral RNA are significant and efficient for RNA replication of picornaviruses. The 3’ end of picornavirus contains poly(A) tract which be required for infectivity. On the other hand, RNA synthesis is hypothesized to occur in this region.3’ end NCR of poliovirus is not necessary for negative-strands synthesis. However, it is important element for positive—strand synthesis. Additionally,5’ end NCR that contain secondary structural elements is required for RNA replication and poliovirus translation initiation(IRES). Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) [...] are RNA structures that allow cap independent initiation of translation, {{and are able to}} initiate translation {{in the middle of a}} messenger RNA.|$|E

It had the properties of double-stranded RNA. (i) Sedimentation behavior in sucrose gradient was independent of salt concentration. (ii) Thermal transition profile was sharp; the melting temperature is 83 C in 0. 1 SSC (0. 15 m NaCl plus 0. 015 m sodium citrate) and 98 C in SSC. (iii) Buoyant density in cesium sulfate was 1. 58 g/cm 3 compared to 1. 64 g/cm 3 for single-stranded RNA. (iv) It gave rise to single-stranded RNA after denaturation.

40|$|AbstractBacteriophage Φ 6 has a genome {{of three}} {{segments}} of double-stranded RNA enclosed in a polyhedral procapsid.

40|$|All ten {{reovirus}} genome RNA segments were radiolabeled {{at their}} 3 '-termini by incubation with RNA ligase and 32 pCp. The extent of radiolabeling was similar {{for each of}} the double-stranded RNAs in the genome segment mixture. Radioactivity was equally distributed between the separated <b>plus</b> and minus <b>strands</b> indicating that the 5 '-cap in <b>plus</b> <b>strands</b> did not block 3 '-end-labeling of minus strands. The 3 '-termini of the four S and three M segments included the common sequences: [...] . U-A-G-C in minus strands and [...] . U-C-A-U-C in <b>plus</b> <b>strands.</b> By comparing the minus strand 3 '-sequences with 5 '-sequences of reovirus mRNAs, small-size genome segments S 2, S 3 and S 4 were correlated with the previously sequenced initiation fragments s 46, s 45 and s 54 derived from small class mRNAs. Medium-size genome segments M 1, M 2 and M 3 similarly were correlated with fragments m 30, m 52 and m 44, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequences deduced from the mRNA nucleotide sequences can now be assigned to the nascent chains of particular reovirus proteins...|$|R

40|$|Rifampin interferes {{exclusively}} with RNA replication in vivo {{of the group}} I phages MS 2, f 2, and R 17, whereas QbetaRNA replication is unaffected by the drug. In addition, rifampin has a discriminative effect of group I phage RNA replication. In the experimental system employed by us the antibiotic differentially interferes with the synthesis of minus RNA strands in f 2, whereas it has almost {{no effect on the}} synthesis of progeny <b>plus</b> <b>strands.</b> In MS 2, the drug differentially arrests the synthesis of progeny <b>plus</b> <b>strands</b> and almost fails to affect the synthesis of minus RNA strands.

40|$|The {{existence}} of viral mRNA replicons was demonstrated in cells {{infected with the}} bovine coronavirus by showing a minus-strand counterpart and a corresponding replicative intermediate for each subgenomic mRNA species. mRNA replication is thus a universal property of coronaviruses, since this is now the third coronavirus for which it has been demonstrated. During the acute phase of infection (first 48 h), minus and <b>plus</b> <b>strands</b> accumulated {{at the same rate}} initially, but maximal accumulation of minus strands peaked earlier than that for <b>plus</b> <b>strands,</b> indicating that minus- and plus-strand levels are differentially regulated. In addition, packaged (input) mRNAs appeared to serve as templates for their own early replication. mRNA replication continued throughout establishment and maintenance of persistent infection (studied for 120 days), which is consistent with our hypothesis that mRNA replication contributes mechanistically to virus persistence. A replication-defective (potentially interfering) species of RNA existed transiently (beginning at day 2 and ending before day 76 postinfection), but because of its transient nature it cannot be considered essential to the long-term maintenance of virus persistence...|$|R

In many cases some of the complementary strands are covalently linked as snap-back molecules.

Possible origins for these snap-back molecules are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In most {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) viruses, RNA transcription occurs {{inside a}} polymerase (Pol) complex particle, which contains an RNA-dependent RNA Pol subunit {{as a minor}} component. Only plus- but not minus-sense copies of genomic segments are produced during this reaction. In the case of φ 6, a dsRNA bacteriophage from the Cystoviridae family, isolated Pol synthesizes predominantly <b>plus</b> <b>strands</b> using virus-specific dsRNAs in vitro, thus suggesting that Pol template preferences determine the transcriptional polarity. Here, we dissect transcription reactions catalyzed by Pol complexes and Pol subunits of two other cystoviruses, φ 8 and φ 13. While both Pol complexes synthesize exclusively <b>plus</b> <b>strands</b> {{over a wide range}} of conditions, isolated Pol subunits can be stimulated by Mn 2 + to produce minus-sense copies on φ 13 dsRNA templates. Importantly, all three Pol subunits become more prone to the native-like plus-strand synthesis when the dsRNA templates (including φ 13 dsRNA) are activated by denaturation before the reaction. Based on these and earlier observations, we propose a model of transcriptional polarity in Cystoviridae controlled on two independent levels: Pol affinity to plus-strand initiation sites and accessibility of these sites to the Pol in a single-stranded form...|$|R

40|$|The {{topographical}} {{locations on}} the simian virus 40 (SV 40) genome of the templates for virus-specific RNA species present {{late in the}} lytic infection were determined by RNA-DNA hybridization experiments with the Hind restriction enzyme fragments. Two classes of late virus-specific cytoplasmic mRNA's can be separated {{on the basis of}} either sedimentation properties in neutral sucrose or electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels. In the 16 S class, two species of RNA were identified by hybridization experiments. One of these species was complementary to sequences of the early template on the minus (E) strand (0. 175 to 0. 655 map units), and the other more abundant species was complementary to sequences present in the late template on the <b>plus</b> (L) <b>strand</b> (0. 655 to 0. 175 map units).

A less abundant nonpolyadenylated 16 S RNA species complementary to the <b>plus</b> (L) <b>strands</b> of Hind fragments C, D, and E (0. 655 to 0. 945 map units) may result from post-transcriptional processing or nonspecific degradation of the 19 S viral RNA complementary to the <b>plus</b> (L) <b>strand...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{complementary}} {{strands of}} most of the genome double-stranded RNA segments of insect cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV) and human reovirus are separated for the first time by agarose gel electrophoresis in in the presence of 7 M urea. CPV (+) strands and most reovirus (-) strands migrate faster than the corresponding strands of opposite polarity. Glyoxal treatment, which modifies guanine residues and prevents G-C basepairing, results in a loss of strand resolution and concomitantly a significant decrease in electrophoretic mobilities. Reovirus mRNAs synthesized in vitro with ITP substituted for GTP show similar decreased electrophoretic mobilities as the glyoxalated mRNAs. These results clearly indicate that the basis for (+) and (-) strand resolution is the presence of secondary structure formed mainly by G-C(U) base-pairs that are maintained during gel electrophoresis in the presence of 7 M urea. When the <b>plus</b> and minus <b>strands</b> of CPV genomes were separated and compared for protein synthesizing activity, it was found that only the <b>plus</b> <b>strands</b> were able to form stable 80 S ribosome-RNA initiation complexes in wheat germ cell-free extracts...|$|R
40|$|The {{rates of}} viral RNA and protein syntheses for {{wild-type}} RNA bacteriophages and their nonpolar, coat protein amber mutants were determined in amber suppressor (S 26 R 1 E, Su- 1 and H 12 R 8 a, Su- 3) and nonsuppressor (AB 259, S 26, and Q 13) strains of Escherichia coli {{in the presence}} of rifamycin. It was demonstrated that the rates of synthesis of phage-specific replicase and RNA minus strands drop off concurrently in both wild-type and coat protein mutant-infected Su− and Su+ cells after 10 and 15 min postinfection, respectively. The rate of synthesis of RNA <b>plus</b> <b>strands</b> started to decline 5 to 10 min later in both cases. Excessive synthesis of replicase in the coat protein mutant-infected cells was accompanied by a similar overproduction of RNA minus strands, but not of <b>plus</b> <b>strands.</b> Partial suppression of protein synthesis in wild-type phage-infected cells abolishing coat protein control over replicase accumulation led to prolongation of replicase synthesis. Such an effect was observed also in coat protein mutant-infected cells, indicating that the excess of replicase itself may be capable of suppression of replicase synthesis in the absence of coat protein. The prolongation of replicase synthesis was followed by the prolonged synthesis of RNA minus strands in both cases. Moreover, replicase and minus strands were formed in nearly equal amounts when protein synthesis was partially inhibited. Assuming functional instability of phage RNAs, the observed coupling of replicase and minus-strand RNA synthesis offers a possibility for control of viral RNA replication by means of control of replicase synthesis on the translational level. A hypothesis is put forward to explain the molecular mechanism of such coupling between the syntheses of replicase and RNA minus strands...|$|R
