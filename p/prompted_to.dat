5|$|In another study, synesthetes were <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> form novel synesthetic {{associations}} to graphemes {{never seen}} before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time {{too short to}} account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain, pointing again towards ideasthesia.|$|E
40|$|Color poster with text, images, and graphs. Prompts are {{commonly}} utilized to teach canines novel skills during canine obedience training {{with the goal}} of having control of the desired behavior transferred from the <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> a vocal command. Over prompting or fading prompts too quickly may be detrimental to skill acquisition. To remedy the issue past research has used a <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> probe method (Mattingly & Bott, 1990) to determine when control of the behavior has been transferred from the <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> the verbal command. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 different <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> probe ratios, 1 : 1, 3 : 1, and 5 : 1, when teaching various skills to canines.

During a race, the player can only activate the chosen special ability when the meter in the upper left-hand corner of the screen is full. After using the special ability, the player must wait for the meter to recharge to use it again.|$|E

5|$|Wollstonecraft was <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> publish Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{because she}} was heavily in debt. The {{successful}} sales of this, her most popular book in the 1790s, came at an opportune moment.

5|$|Bowen was <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> {{write the}} story of the {{relocated}} wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki felt that the portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino felt that the game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> divide their status points.|$|E

5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware {{that he was not going}} to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E
5|$|In October 1927, Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was {{accepted}} for publication by Century, and Marquis was <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> take down his medical practice sign. However, this was premature, {{as it would be}} some time before royalties were forthcoming. Lack of funds drove Marquis to continue seeing patients and carrying out insurance medical examinations. He also needed to borrow money from relatives and cash in his war risk insurance policy. Memoirs of a White Crow Indian was published in April 1928 and received good reviews.|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> {{search for the}} object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E

While wary of initially releasing information about the resignation, the Holy Synod felt <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> release a public statement about his release due to rumors that had spread about their intentions. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. In the statement, the Holy Synod clarified the reason they withheld information initially was to protect the reputation and integrity of Metropolitan Jonah as well as protect anyone involved in the specific decisions made by him.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> take steps to rehabilitate his public image, which {{was more or less}} tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Just Dance {{originated}} from a minigame developed {{for inclusion in}} the Rayman Raving Rabbids series. Ubisoft France's managing director Xavier Poix and his team felt the Wii Remote and Nunchuck would work well for music games; Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 featured a music minigame that IGN compared to Guitar Hero—where players shook the Wii Remote or Nunchuck when <b>prompted</b> <b>to</b> play an instrument. For , the concept was iterated into a pose-based dance game. Proving popular in demonstrations, the concept was refined and re-developed into a stand-alone game.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} a field experiment designed to measure the effect of <b>prompts</b> <b>to</b> form implementation intentions on realized behavioral outcomes. The outcome of interest is influenza vaccination receipt at free on-site clinics offered by a large firm to its employees. All employees eligible for study participation received reminder mailings that listed the times and locations of the relevant vaccination clinics. Mailings to employees randomly assigned to the treatment conditions additionally included a <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> write down either (1) the date the employee planned to be vaccinated or (2) the date and time the employee planned to be vaccinated. Vaccination rates increased when these implementation intentions prompts were included in the mailing. The vaccination rate among control condition employees was 33. 1 %. Employees who received the <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> write down just a date had a vaccination rate 1. 5 percentage points higher than the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant. Employees who received the more specific <b>prompt</b> <b>to</b> write down both a date and a time had a 4. 2 percentage point higher vaccination rate, a difference that is both statistically significant and of meaningful magnitude. ...|$|R
