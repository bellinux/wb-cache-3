5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>electricity</b> is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily {{achieved}} in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|Widespread grid parity, {{the point}} at which <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>electricity</b> is equal to or cheaper than grid power without subsidies, likely {{requires}} advances on all three fronts. Proponents of solar hope to achieve grid parity first in areas with abundant sun and high electricity costs such as in California and Japan. In 2007 BP claimed grid parity for Hawaii and other islands that otherwise use diesel fuel to produce electricity. George W. Bush set 2015 as the date for grid parity in the US. The Photovoltaic Association reported in 2012 that Australia had reached grid parity (ignoring feed in tariffs).|$|E

2500|$|This was {{despite the}} fact that the merit order effect had been {{depressing}} electricity spot prices. [...] The merit order effect occurs when preferentially dispatched wind and photovoltaic generation displaces more expensive fossil fuel generation from the margin – often gas-fired combined cycle plant – thereby driving down the cleared price. [...] This effect is more pronounced for photovoltaics because their midday peak correlates with the maximum generation requirement on the system. [...] The merit order effect also lowers the revenues for conventional power plants and makes them less economically viable. [...] A 2007 study finds that [...] "in the case of the year 2006, the volume of the merit order effect exceeds the volume of the net support payments for renewable electricity generation which have to be paid by consumers". [...] A 2013 study estimates the merit order effect of both wind and <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>electricity</b> generation for the years 2008–2012: the combined merit order effect of wind and photovoltaics ranges from 0.5¢/kWh in 2010 to more than 1.1¢/kWh in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>electricity</b> while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation.
