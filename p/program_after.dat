40|$|These notes {{discuss the}} {{simultaneous}} use of generalised fold operators and monads to structure functional programs. Generalised fold operators structure <b>programs</b> <b>after</b> the decomposition {{of the value}} they consume. Monads structure <b>programs</b> <b>after</b> the computation of the value they produce. Our programs abstract both from the recursive processing of their input {{as well as from}} the side-effects in computing their output. We show how generalised monadic folds aid in calculating an efficient graph reduction engine from an inefficient specification...|$|R
