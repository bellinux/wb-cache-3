2500|$|Congress has the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> {{money on}} the credit of the United States. In 1871, when {{deciding}} Knox v. Lee, the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only [...] "binding on {{the conscience of the}} sovereign", as the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges its commitment.|$|E
2500|$|The bill {{outlined}} three proposals: {{the first}} was full devolution or 'devolution max', suggesting that the Scottish Parliament should be responsible for [...] "all laws, taxes and duties in Scotland", {{with the exception of}} [...] "defence and foreign affairs; financial regulation, monetary policy and the currency", which would be retained by the British government. The second proposal outlined Calman-type fiscal reform, gaining the additional powers and responsibilities of setting a Scottish rate of income tax that could vary by up to 10p in the pound compared {{with the rest of the}} UK, setting the rate of stamp duty land tax and [...] "other minor taxes", and introducing new taxes in Scotland with the agreement of the UK Parliament, and finally, [...] "limited <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money". The third proposal was for full independence.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding paper money, Nathaniel Gorham {{explained}} at the Constitutional Convention that he [...] "was for striking out" [...] {{an explicit}} power of Congress to issue paper money, but Gorham was also against [...] "inserting any prohibition." [...] That is what ultimately {{happened at the}} Convention: language explicitly giving the federal government power to issue legal tender paper money was removed on a vote of 9-2, but an option allowing the issuance together with a prohibition against making it legal tender was not acted upon. [...] Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress power to [...] "borrow money on the credit of the United States," [...] and therefore Gorham envisioned that [...] "The power , {{as far as it}} will be necessary or safe, is involved in that of borrowing." [...] The power to emit paper money (e.g. bank notes) has been justified by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause in combination with the other enumerated powers which include the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money. [...] The power to [...] "issue bills of credit" [...] is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as a prohibition on the States, and could therefore be interpreted as a power so momentous that {{it would have to be}} conferred explicitly on the federal government rather than inferred from the Necessary and Proper Clause, although it is not entirely clear whether or not the framers intended such an interpretation, nor did the Supreme Court adopt such an interpretation in the Legal Tender Cases or subsequently.|$|E

50|$|Neville J {{held that}} rule 35 {{was not a}} {{question}} of the Society's capacity, but it was a power and the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> had to be for proper purposes. The whole banking business was ultra vires and so the bank's depositors could recover nothing. In the Court of Appeal, Lord Cozens-Hardy MR, Buckley LJ held the depositors would be paid last, after the shareholders. Fletcher Moulton LJ dissented.|$|E

5000|$|Local {{government}} in the United Kingdom is devolved to various different types of political subdivisions, but these were generally collectively referred to as [...] "local authorities" [...] in the litigation. These local authorities raise money through local taxation (at {{the time of the}} swaps litigation this was rates; it has subsequently been replaced by council tax). Local authorities also have limited <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money in order to fund capital projects and defray the cost over future years. These <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> are carefully circumscribed in the Local Government Act 1972.|$|R

50|$|The National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC) was a film {{funding agency}} in the United Kingdom which {{operated}} from 1949 until it was wound up in 1985. The NFFC was established by the Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Act 1949, and further enhanced by the Cinematograph Film Production (Special Loans) Act 1952, which gave the NNFC the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> from sources other than the Board of Trade.

50|$|Some {{collective}} investment vehicles have the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> {{money to make}} further investments; {{a process known as}} gearing or leverage. If markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle {{to take advantage of the}} growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested. However this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved. If the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved.|$|E

Unlike the road networks in most nations, most Chinese expressways are not directly owned by the state, but rather are owned by for-profit corporations (which have varying amounts {{of public and private}} ownership) which borrow money from banks or securities markets based on revenue from projected tollways. One {{reason for this is that}} Chinese provinces, which are responsible for road building, have extremely limited <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> tax and even fewer <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow.</b>|$|R

Tribe said that since Congress has means other than borrowing to pay the federal debt (including raising taxes, coining money, and selling federal assets), {{the argument that the}} President could seize the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> could be extended to give the President the ability to seize those powers as well.|$|E
50|$|Mr Turquand was the {{official}} manager (liquidator) of the insolvent Cameron's Coalbrook Steam, Coal and Swansea and Loughor Railway Company. It was incorporated under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844. The company {{had given a}} bond for £2,000 to the Royal British Bank, which secured the company's drawings on its current account. The bond was under the company's seal, signed by two directors and the secretary. When the company was sued, it alleged that under its registered deed of settlement (the articles of association), directors only had <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> up to an amount authorised by a company resolution. A resolution had been passed but not specifying how much the directors could borrow.|$|E
25|$|The first {{improvement}} of the lower river was at Newark, where the channel splits into two. The residents of the town wanted to increase {{the use of the}} branch nearest to them, and so an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1772 to authorise the work. Newark Navigation Commissioners were created, with <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money <b>to</b> fund the construction of two locks, and to charge tolls for boats using them. The work was completed by October 1773, and the separate tolls remained in force until 1783, when they were replaced by a one-shilling (5p) toll whichever channel the boats used.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} the {{governor}} of Florida was appointed to a three-year term by the President and the territory operated with little federal funding, while a popularly elected Florida Territorial Council had only minimal <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money, issue licenses, and organize a state militia. According to the State Archives of Florida, [...] "A political protest in 1838 by Colonel Downing forced {{the establishment of a}} more representative bicameral legislature, where voices of rural farmers could be better presented. This reform was offset by the isolation of most homesteads and their lack of political participation. In 1840, Downing introduced House Bill 466 to end the Seminole War." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to one study, the 1964 Housing Act, {{which was}} passed by in the {{incoming}} Labour government, “strengthened local authorities’ <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> enforce minimum standards on privately owned housing and encouraged housing societies to build for low rent and for co-ownership by establishing a Housing Corporation which had <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> from the Exchequer (£50 {{million in the first}} instance) for this purpose.” Generous new subsidies were also introduced by the government to encourage authorities to construct many more houses and to build them to Parker Morris standards. In 1967, the government issued a circular which urged authorities to adopt and publicise rent rebate schemes. As a result of this circular, the number of authorities adopting such schemes rose from 40% before the circular to 53% by March 1968. About 70% of tenants were covered, though not necessarily in receipt of rebates: ...|$|R

50|$|In England, {{the roads}} of each parish were {{maintained}} by compulsory labour from the parishioners, six days per year. This proved inadequate {{in the case}} of certain heavily used roads, and from the 18th century (and in a few cases slightly earlier), statutory bodies of trustees began to be set up with <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money to repair and improve roads, the loans being repaid from tolls collected from road users. In the 1750s there was a boom in creating new turnpike trusts with the result {{that by the end of}} the 18th century almost all main roads were turnpike roads. Each trust required an Act of Parliament, both on its initial creation and to renew it when the term granted by the Act expired. Cars were invented in the 1800s.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Trade were reticent about {{allowing}} a Municipal Authority, {{in this case}} Bradford, to build a railway which was located outside its area of jurisdiction, and was not connected to a railway which started within its area. However, on 30 December 1903, a transfer order was granted, with <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> up <b>to</b> £30,000 to fund the project. In May 1904, the Board of Trade agreed to a change to standard gauge, and <b>borrowing</b> <b>powers</b> were increased <b>to</b> £66,000 in 1908, because of the extra costs of building the wider formation. The document was signed by Winston Churchill, the President of the Board of Trade. In addition to the main reservoir contract, John Best was awarded a contract to build the light railway to Lofthouse for £23,000, and a tramway from Lofthouse to Angram for £5,385.|$|R
50|$|Commissioners were appointed, who had <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money, {{with which}} to fund the {{construction}} of the canal. They also had powers over the River Hull below the canal, as far down at Aike Beck. There were teething problems. A local man called Richard Porter was appointed as engineer, but was replaced six weeks later by Samuel Allam, on the recommendation of Grundy. Two contractors were appointed in October 1767, but gave up, and were replaced by a partnership between James Pinkerton and James Dyson, who ultimately built the whole canal, including a culvert in Driffield to provide a water supply. The canal opened progressively, with the first section completed on 12 December 1768, the next section to Wansford open by 25 May 1769, and the whole canal formally opened on 25 May 1770. The distance by canal from Emmotland to Driffield was 5.75 mi, a reduction of 3 mi on the distance by river.|$|R
50|$|The company {{obtained}} an Act of Parliament on 24 July 1876, {{to allow}} the line to be constructed. The main line was 8 mi long, running from Southwold to Halesworth, and two branches were also authorised. A 0.48 mi branch at Halesworth linked up with the Blyth Navigation, {{and there was a}} link to Blackshore Quay, between Southwold and Walberswick, which was to be 0.25 mi long. The company could raise £40,000 in working capital by issuing £10 shares, and also had <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> a further £13,000 by issuing debentures. The gauge of the railway had to be at least , and because the line was covered by the Regulation of Railways Act 1868, it could use a simple signalling system and light earthworks, providing loads were limited and speeds did not exceed 25 mph. In practice, this meant that journey times between the two termini would be about 30 minutes, and trains were limited to 100 passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The bill {{outlined}} three proposals: {{the first}} was full devolution or 'devolution max', suggesting that the Scottish Parliament should be responsible for [...] "all laws, taxes and duties in Scotland", {{with the exception of}} [...] "defence and foreign affairs; financial regulation, monetary policy and the currency", which would be retained by the British government. The second proposal outlined Calman-type fiscal reform, gaining the additional powers and responsibilities of setting a Scottish rate of income tax that could vary by up to 10p in the pound compared {{with the rest of the}} UK, setting the rate of stamp duty land tax and [...] "other minor taxes", and introducing new taxes in Scotland with the agreement of the UK Parliament, and finally, [...] "limited <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money".

5000|$|While the {{constitution}} did not explicitly grant {{the power to}} issue paper currency, it did grant the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money. Treasury Notes, {{as a form of}} debt, were an innovation to help bridge federal financing gaps when the government encountered difficulty selling a sufficient amount of long term bonds, or loan [...] "stock". Treasury Notes were first employed during the War of 1812 and were issued irregularly up through the civil war. Characteristically the issues were not extensive and the [...] "polite fiction" [...] was always maintained that Treasury Notes did not serve as money when, in fact, to a limited extent they did. These notes usually bore interest, their value varied with market conditions, and they rapidly disappeared from the financial system after the crisis associated with their issuance had ended.|$|E
5000|$|Up {{until the}} early 1990s, a number of local {{authorities}} had been engaged in interest rate swap transactions as part of managing their debt portfolios. Under the Local Authorities Act 1972, the local authorities had <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> in order to amortise their costs of capital projects {{over a longer period}} of time. In connection with that borrowing, certain local authorities sought to enter into swap transactions to hedge their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. There were some doubts as to the ability of local authorities to enter into such transactions, but the local authorities sought the opinion of Anthony Scrivener QC, a leading commercial silk, who had advised that if a [...] "rate swap is undertaken as part of the proper management of the council's fund then ... the swap will be intra vires" [...] within the powers of the council.|$|E
5000|$|The 1881 Act sanctioned the {{construction}} of a double-track line from the LCDR's Main Line to a terminus which was said to be [...] "Near the Ragged School" [...] at Gravesend and initial plans had it sited in Princes Street. The initial capital of the railway company was £200,000 and it had <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> a further £55,000. The line had to be completed within five years after which it would be worked by the LCDR. The construction works were put out to tender and eventually the offer of £108,000 from a Mr G. Barclay-Price was accepted on 3 August 1881. There was some internal discussion over the eventual siting of the terminus which was changed to Bath Street and then finally to Stuart Road. Around the same time, the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway proposed to link with the Gravesend Line and the SER via a tunnel under the Thames from Tilbury, but this was never realised.|$|R
5|$|Both Acts were {{unusual in}} that they gave the bodies <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> money, but did not create the {{companies}} to do the work. Nor were the financial arrangements clearly laid down, and both groups resorted to issuing shares to fund the improvements, although they were not actually empowered to do so. In October 1730, the two groups decided to amalgamate, but a 1731 Act to formalise the agreement and legalise the issuing of shares was defeated because it also included <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> make further changes to the river, including the section below Barnby Dun. Finally an Act of 1733 created The Company of the Proprietors of the Navigation of the River Don, with <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> create a new cut from Bromley Sands above Rotherham to Ickles Dam. The problems presented by the river below Wilsick House, including shallows and fords at Bramwith and Stainforth, and bridges on the Dutch River that were difficult to navigate, resulted in the proprietors trying again <b>to</b> obtain <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> improve the lower river in 1737, but again the petition was defeated in a parliamentary committee. Work continued, {{and it appears that}} Aldwarke was the head of navigation for some years, but Rotherham was reached in 1740.|$|R
5000|$|In 1877 a Bill was {{submitted}} for <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> take more <b>borrowing,</b> <b>to</b> confirm the double track on the swing bridge, and for additional fender {{protection for the}} piers on the river channel, and for [...] "the provision of stations, rails, and signals". The additional capital needed was £100,000, a 44% increase on the original capital.|$|R
