5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} are officially ranked {{on one of}} five {{tropical cyclone}} intensity scales, according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basin(s) they are located in. Only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones, but some alternative scales also exist, such as accumulated cyclone energy, the <b>Power</b> <b>Dissipation</b> Index, the Integrated Kinetic Energy Index, and the Hurricane Severity Index.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} <b>Power</b> <b>Dissipation</b> Index (PDI).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an address bus coding method to reduce dynamic <b>power</b> <b>dissipations</b> and delay faults at on-chip applications. The {{purpose of the}} {{proposed}} new coding technique is to diminish the switching and coupling activities on instruction address busses effectively. The proposed bus coding method is called the exclusive-OR and bus inverter transition signaling (XOR-BITS) code. The XOR-BITS code has four advantages. Firstly, it can save {{a large number of}} switching activities. Secondly, it can also save a large number of coupling activities. Thirdly, its architecture belongs to a low-complexity architecture. Finally, its delay is short after optimizations. Experimental results show that the XOR-BITS coding indicates an average reduction in 78. 5 % switching activities and 21. 9 % coupling activities on instruction address busses. It surpasses the other address coding methods in total <b>power</b> <b>dissipations</b> when the load capacitance is more than 1 pF/bit with the TSMC 0. 13 mu m CMOS technology. For a 50 pF/bit load capacitance, it achieves a 74. 9 % average reduction in total <b>power</b> <b>dissipations,</b> compared with the un-coded schemes by using seven benchmarks. Similarly, our method also surpasses the other address bus coding methods with the TSMC 0. 18 mu m CMOS technology...|$|R

40|$|MOS Current-Mode Logic (MCML) {{is widely}} used for {{high-speed}} circuits. However, the MCML circuits have large static power consumptions due to their constant operation currents. This paper presents a power-gating scheme for MCML circuits to reduce their static <b>power</b> <b>dissipations</b> in sleep mode. The PMOS transistors for linear load resistors of MCML circuits are used for power-gating switches.
