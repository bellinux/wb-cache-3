She found this out when she was helping physically balance his new dub <b>plate</b> <b>press</b> and learned these were used as the original template of vinyls. She decided to be released as a sound globally carried by these type of cuts and named the original sounds that were created in her studio in Philadelphia, Sapphirecut. Sapphirecut has produced many original and remixed releases. She has albums and singles released on various labels including her own label OSP. Sapphirecut is digitally released by Ingrooves and Isolation network. Her album is a mixture of electronic songs written and mixed by Sapphirecut and played by various co artists.|$|R

25|$|From 1908 to 1914 coil stamps {{were printed}} with Flat <b>Plate</b> <b>presses</b> in sheets of 400 {{which were then}} cut into strips for coiling. In 1915 the Bureau began {{printing}} coil stamps from continuous rolls of paper with the Rotary <b>Press.</b> The printing <b>plates</b> were curved and affixed around a rotating cylinder, a process that stretched the images somewhat, making them slightly longer than similar images printed from a flat-plate.

The high thermal conductivity of aluminum pans makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base will not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan will have. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces but the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.|$|R

50|$|Coil {{waste is}} a type of U.S. stamp made from damaged or {{unusable}} printing stock intended for use as coil stamps and is a term applied to several stamp issues of the late 1910s and early 20s. Sometimes in the printing of coils on rotary presses, a number stamps from the run were deemed unusable for coil production. Instead of discarding these, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing processed them through the flat-plate perforating machine to finish them as fully perforated stamps. These finished products are known as coil waste. While seemingly identical to normal fully perforated issues (which were printed on flat <b>plate</b> <b>presses),</b> coil waste stamps are distinguishable by their size: their designs are slightly wider or longer than normal because rotary press printing slightly stretches an image.|$|R

The elements {{are made up of}} zig zag corrugated <b>plates</b> <b>pressed</b> into a steel basket giving sufficient annular space in between for the gas to pass through. These plates are corrugated to give more surface area for the heat to be absorbed and also to give it the rigidity for stacking them into the baskets. Hence frequent replacements are called for and new baskets are always kept ready. In the early days, Cor-ten steel was being used for the elements. Today due to technological advance many manufacturers may use their own patents.Some manufacturers supply different materials {{for the use of the}} elements to lengthen the life of the baskets.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 4 mine or Mine G.S. Mk IV was a British {{anti-tank}} mine used during World War II. Externally the mine has a cylindrical main body filled with explosive either TNT or Baratol.

The mine uses the Shear-pin based Contact Mine Fuze No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded striker pin restrained by a shear pin. Sufficient pressure on the pressure <b>plate</b> <b>presses</b> the <b>plate</b> down on the head of the fuze, breaking the shear wire and releasing the striker, which is driven into the detonator by the striker spring.|$|R
