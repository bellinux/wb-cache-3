The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> one end of the chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.|$|E
5|$|Astana {{participated in}} the Volta a Catalunya in May, while the Giro d'Italia was ongoing. The team did not win any stage, but Haimar Zubeldia took third overall in the event, and the team won the teams classification. In the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in June, Contador {{was thought to be}} a {{favorite}} for victory, but he did not seem to try his hardest to win, not attacking or taking any <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the mountainous Stage 5 and seeming to work for Alejandro Valverde on the race's last two days. The team next took part in the Tour de Suisse, with Klöden in fourth their highest-placed rider.|$|E
5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which the subject is unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and shoes. In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E

25|$|Shoulder pain or {{tenderness}} and, occasionally, a bump in {{the middle}} of the top of the shoulder (over the AC joint) are signs that a separation may have occurred. Sometimes the severity of a separation can be detected by taking x rays while the patient holds a light weight that <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the muscles, making a separation more pronounced.|$|E
25|$|The {{inner edge}} of the Cassini Division is governed by a strong orbital resonance. Ring {{particles}} at this location orbit twice for every orbit of the moon Mimas. The resonance causes Mimas' <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> these ring particles to accumulate, destabilizing their orbits and leading to a sharp cutoff in ring density. Many of the other gaps between ringlets within the Cassini Division, however, are unexplained.|$|E
25|$|Deep-water waves {{travel to}} shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's {{wavelengths}} are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water {{interacts with the}} bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> {{the bottom of the}} wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} house spider mating {{ritual is}} a lengthy (over an hour) and elaborate process with long periods during which neither the male nor the female moves considerably. When the wandering male encounters a female's web, {{there may be an}} initial confrontation where each scares the other. Upon recovering, the male then constructs a large web around the female's crevice. When this web is complete, the male <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> its strands continuously to draw the female out of her hole, which may take several minutes. Following her emergence, each spider will tap at the other in an effort to grasp the other by the forelegs, with the male remaining suspended in his web.|$|E
25|$|The Tayledras, now {{aware that}} the drakes were gated in from Vanyel's experience, Savil and Vanyel set out to check on a village that was under Tayledras {{protection}} and has fallen under an enemy shield. Upon arriving at this village Vanyel is left to assist in protecting the village from minor harm and instead finds himself {{face to face with}} a Blood magic crazed wizard. In Vanyel's attempts to deflect the wizards magic he <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the power of a node and destroys the wizard with the raw power. He believes he will die as well, but is comforted by the thought that he will be with Tylendel. Vanyel wakes to find himself with his aunt in K'Treva as she presents him with the white robes of a full-fledged Herald-Mage.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{communication between}} diver and attendant was by <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the diver's lifeline. Later a speaking tube system was tried, {{but it was}} not very successful. A small number were made by Seibe-Gorman, but the telephone system was introduced soon after this and since it worked better and was safer, the speaking tube was soon obsolete, and most helmets which had them were returned to the factory and converted. In the early 20th century electrical telephone systems were developed which improved the quality of voice communication. These used wires incorporated into the lifeline or air line, and used either headsets worn inside the helmet or speakers mounted inside the helmet. The microphone could be mounted {{in the front of the}} helmet or a contact throat-microphone could be used. At first it was only possible for the diver to talk to the surface telephonist, but later double telephone systems were introduced which allowed two-divers to speak directly to each other, while being monitored by the attendant. Diver telephones were manufactured by Siebe-Gorman, Heinke, Rene Piel, Morse, Eriksson, Draeger and others. This system was well-established by the mid-20th century, and has been technologically improved, but is still in common use for surface-supplied divers using lightweight demand helmets and full-face masks.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, a seal knob is also {{referred}} to as a seal nose (yin bi 印鼻): [...] "the nose of seal"; bi (鼻) means [...] "nose", perhaps because in ancient time people needed a rope to <b>pull</b> <b>on</b> the seal through its top, just like <b>pulling</b> <b>on</b> an ox or slave through his nose.|$|R

500|$|Six years later, Zhou {{takes the}} group to visit his old friend, the abbot of a small Buddhist temple on the [...] "Hill of Dripping Water". Thirteen-year-old Yue wanders behind the temple and finds the [...] "Cave of Dripping Water", in which lives a magical snake. When it lunges at Yue, he dodges {{to one side and}} <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> its tail with his supernatural strength, causing it to turn into an , {{gold-plated}} spear named the [...] "Supernatural Spear of Dripping Water". When they return home, Zhou begins to drill all of his students in the military arts—eighteen weapons of war, archery, and hand-to-hand combat. After three years of practice, Zhou enters them into a preliminary military examination in Tangyin in which sixteen-year-old Yue wins first place by shooting a succession of nine arrows through the bullseye of a target two hundred and forty paces away. After his display of marksmanship, Yue is asked to marry the daughter of Li Chun (李春), an old friend of Zhou's and the county magistrate who presided over the military exams. Father and son then return home to their village.|$|E
2500|$|In modern {{scientific}} usage, {{weight and}} mass are fundamentally different quantities: mass is an [...] "extrinsic" [...] (extensive) property of matter, whereas weight {{is a force}} that results from the action of gravity on matter: it measures how strongly {{the force of gravity}} <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> that matter. However, in most practical everyday situations the word [...] "weight" [...] is used when, strictly, [...] "mass" [...] is meant. For example, most people would say that an object [...] "weighs one kilogram", even though the kilogram is a unit of mass.|$|E
2500|$|An {{equilibrium}} tidal bulge {{does not}} really exist on Earth because the continents do not allow this mathematical solution to take place. Oceanic tides actually rotate around the ocean basins as vast gyres around several amphidromic points where no tide exists. The Moon <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> each individual undulation as Earth rotates—some undulations are ahead of the Moon, others are behind it, whereas still others are on either side. The [...] "bulges" [...] that actually do exist for the Moon to pull on (and which pull on the Moon) are the net result of integrating the actual undulations over all the world's oceans. Earth's net (or equivalent) equilibrium tide has an amplitude of only 3.23cm, which is totally swamped by oceanic tides that can exceed one metre.|$|E

2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel – {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving spool that is geared so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of the spool. [...] The bait casting reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early bait casting reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, German silver, or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on the spool to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking pawl mechanism. [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep the spool from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the clicking noise of the pawls provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|E
2500|$|Like his in-game offense, Quan Chi's Fatalities {{vary from}} the use of magic to {{outright}} brutality. His first in MK4 enabled him to mimic opposing players' finishers, but his second involved tearing off his opponent's leg at the hip and then savagely beating them nonstop with the still-bleeding limb as the screen faded to black for the next match, making it the one neverending Fatality in the series. It was carried over into the 2011 reboot (enhanced with the explosion of the opponent's head in the process), while his other Fatality saw him summoning a sword composed of green energy that he used to dismember and decapitate his opponent, similar to Scorpion's [...] "Split Decision" [...] finisher in the same game. However, his Fatality from Deadly Alliance, the [...] "Neck Stretch"—in which Quan Chi leaps onto his beaten opponent's shoulders and <b>pulls</b> <b>on</b> their head to stretch their neck to an impossible length—became one of the most infamous Fatalities in the series due to its cartoonish appearance and lack of blood or gore. It proved the least popular Fatality among many of the Midway staff; lead storyteller John Vogel revealed that the finisher was [...] "a funny idea" [...] that was instantly disliked after its addition, but the developers were forced to leave it in due to time constraints. Sound designer Dan Forden cited it {{as an example of the}} team at the time [...] "getting a little low on creativity", and programmer Nick Shin declared that it [...] "totally didn't make sense." [...] Boon deemed the [...] "Neck Stretch" [...] his least-liked Fatality, but called the [...] "Leg Beatdown" [...] his all-time favorite.|$|E
