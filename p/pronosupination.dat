40|$|Posttraumatic radioulnar {{synostosis}} (RUS) {{is a rare}} event following forearm fractures. Consequences are disabling {{for patients}} who suffer from functional limitation in forearm <b>pronosupination.</b> Distal RUS are even more rare and more difficult to treat because of high recurrence rates. The patient we describe in this paper came to our attention with a double distal RUS recurrence and a Darrach procedure already performed. We performed a radical excision of RUS and interposition with a vascularized dorsoulnar artery (DUA) adipofascial perforator flap. Four years after surgery, the patient shows the same complete range of motion in <b>pronosupination,</b> and MRI confirms that the flap is still in place with signs of vascularization. Simple synostosis excision has been proven ineffective in many cases. Interposition is recommended after excision, and biological material interposition seems to be more effective than foreign material. Surgeons are increasingly performing vascularized interposition, and the results are very encouraging...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionMalunion {{following}} open {{reduction and}} internal fixation of distal radius fracture threatens wrist function. Fixed-angle palmar plates provide rigid fixation that is stable over time; however, the pronator quadratus sectioning {{required by the}} anterior approach entails a risk of pronation strength loss and of distal radioulnar joint destabilization. The present study assessed recovery of grip, pronation and supination strength following such internal fixation. Patients and methodA prospective study included 26 distal radial fractures with dorsal displacement, osteosynthesized using a fixed-angle palmar plate, in 25 patients (mean age: 47. 5 years; range: 17 – 72 years). Assessment concerned the classical parameters, plus grip and <b>pronosupination</b> strength recovery. ResultsAt a mean 14 months follow-up (range: 6 – 30 months), patients had recovered 91 % grip strength, 88 % pronation strength and 85 % supination strength {{with respect to the}} healthy side. Complications comprised three cases of malunion, two of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, and four of post-traumatic carpal tunnel syndrome. DiscussionA study of the literature found 75 – 95 % grip strength recovery following osteosynthesis using fixed-angle plates. Few studies, however, have focused on <b>pronosupination</b> strength, and none reported its evolution following osteosynthesis. ConclusionThe present study found no drawbacks associated with a technique which usually involves sectioning the pronator quadratus. Except in case of malunion or joint stiffness, fixed-angle palmar plate osteosynthesis was followed by recovery of grip and <b>pronosupination</b> strength.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} predictors of a superior functional outcome after corrective osteotomy for paediatric malunited radius and both-bone forearm fractures. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data, searching databases up to 1 October 2016.

30|$|In chronic cases, the {{clinical}} symptoms are {{dictated by the}} above-mentioned proximal migration of the radius with radio-capitellar impingement and ulno-carpal impaction by positive ulnar variance. The history of the patients will reveal a precedent trauma to the forearm with severe radial head fracture or even radial head resection. In addition, the patients might present with increasing pain over the wrist and elbow, paired with decreasing range of motion over time. Reduced grip-strength is often observed as well. On examination, there will be painful restriction of <b>pronosupination</b> as well as extension and flexion at the wrist and elbow. In ulnar positive variance, the ulno-carpal impaction decreases supination and extension {{over the course of}} proximal radial migration. This is due to a dorsal and, in relation to the radius, more distal position of the distal ulna, which conflicts with the carpus during motion [34, 35].|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Altered {{kinematics}} of {{the distal}} radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and/or bone impingement are considered causes of long-term complications associated with malunited distal radius fractures. However, a recent CT image-based in vivo study {{of patients with}} malunited distal radius fractures found that malunion did not alter forearm kinematics and that limitations of <b>pronosupination</b> were not caused by bony impingement (Moore et al., in press). In this study, data from the previous study was reanalyzed to explore focal changes in the articulation at the DRUJ (location and area of bone contact) and potential soft tissue constraints ('length' of the dorsal and palmar radioulnar ligaments).

40|$|Radioulnar {{synostosis}} {{is a rare}} {{complication of}} forearm fractures. The formation of a bony bridge induces functional disability due to limitation of the <b>pronosupination.</b> Although the etiology of posttraumatic synostosis is unknown, {{it seems that the}} incidence is higher in patients who have suffered a concomitant neurological or burn trauma, and extensive soft tissue injury, mainly due to high-energy impact. Surgical treatment, such as reinsertion of distal biceps tendon into the radius, seems to be another possible factor. The aim of the surgical treatment is to remove the bony bridge and restore complete range of movement (ROM), thus preventing recurrence. Literature does not indicate a preferred type of surgical procedure for the aforementioned complication; however, {{it has been shown that}} surgical interposition of inert material reduces the formation rate of recurrent bony bridge.

40|$|Untreated distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) {{injuries}} {{can give}} rise to long lasting complaints. Although common, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} DRUJ injuries remains a challenge. The articulating anatomy of the distal radius and ulna, among others, enables an extensive range of forearm <b>pronosupination</b> movements. Stabilization of this joint is provided by both intrinsic and extrinsic stabilizers and the joint capsule. These structures transmit the load and prevent the DRUJ from luxation during movement. Several clinical tests have been suggested to determine static or dynamic DRUJ stability, but their predictive value is unclear. Radiologic evaluation of DRUJ instability begins with conventional radiographs in anterioposterior and true lateral view. If not conclusive, CT-scan seems to be the best additional modality to evaluate the osseous structures. MRI has proven to be more sensitive and specific for TFCC tears, potentially causing DRUJ instability. DRUJ instability may remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic DRUJ injuries treatment can be conservative or operative. Operative treatment should consist of restoration of osseous and ligamenteous anatomy. If not successful, salvage procedures can be performed to regain stability...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} changes {{in the shape of the}} {{triangular}} fibrocatilage (TFC: disc proper) which occur during forearm rotation in disarticulated and articulated wrists. The influence of artificial 3 mm ulnar lengthening on distortion of the disc was also examined. In the disarticulated wrists, slight distortion of the central and radial portions of the TFC was observed in the ulnar neutral variance specimens. More distortion was noted in the radial and central portions of the TFC in specimens with positive ulnar variance or with the ulna lengthened. However, in the articulated wrist, the TFC demonstrated little change in shape during <b>pronosupination</b> even in the ulnar positive variance wrists or with the ulna lengthened. There was no significant change in palmar and dorsal peripheral lengths of the TFC in ulnar neutral, ulnar positive or ulna-lengthened specimens at three rotatory positions of the forearm. These findings suggest that changes in ulnar variance which occur during forearm rotation can produce distortion on the TFC, but the carpus helps to maintain the shape of the TFC during pronation–supination, even with positive ulnar variance...|$|E

30|$|Stiff elbow {{can result}} from several {{different}} etiologies, including burns, trauma, spasticity, osteoarthritis, and septic arthritis. The most common of these is trauma to the elbow, in which intrinsic changes set causal conditions in motion. The mechanism of posttraumatic elbow contracture is intra-articular effusion, which induces the elbow joint to develop intra-articular adhesion and capsular thickening, limiting flexion, extension, and <b>pronosupination,</b> thus resulting in posttraumatic elbow stiffness, loss of motion, and considerable impairment in daily life. Established contractures should initially be treated with physical therapy and static progressive splinting. Patients who have failed a minimum of six months of nonsurgical management are candidates for a surgical approach [1 – 3]. Less invasive techniques for elbow contracture release have been developed {{in an effort to}} avoid excessive scarring and soft-tissue trauma, which may contribute to contracture recurrence. More recently, arthroscopic release of posttraumatic elbow stiffness has gained acceptance, and has been shown to lead to excellent restoration of elbow motion [4 – 7]. Arthroscopic surgery is a demanding procedure that requires great surgical expertise, and a high risk of severe neurovascular complications has been reported in the literature [4].|$|E

40|$|Distal radioulnar joint is a {{trochoid}} joint {{relatively new}} in evolution. Along with proximal radioulnar joint, forearm bones and interosseous membrane, it allows <b>pronosupination</b> and load transmission across the wrist. Injuries around distal radioulnar joint are not uncommon, {{and are usually}} associated with distal radius fractures,fractures of the ulnar styloid and with the eponymous Galeazzi or Essex_Lopresti fractures. The injury can be purely involving the soft tissue especially the triangular fibrocartilage or the radioulnar ligaments. The patients usually present with ulnar sided wrist pain, features of instability, or restriction of rotation. Difficulty in carrying loads in the hand is a major constraint for these patients. Thorough clinical examination to localize point of tenderness and appropriate provocative tests help in diagnosis. Radiology and MRI are extremely useful, while arthroscopy is {{the gold standard for}} evaluation. The treatment protocols are continuously evolving and range from conservative, arthroscopic to open surgical methods. Isolated dislocation are uncommon.

40|$|Eclypse is a {{pyrocarbon}} spacer {{that has}} been developed to substitute the articular portion of the damaged ulnar head in patients with an isolated distal radioulnar joint degenerative arthritis. The spacer can be inserted without significantly detaching the foveal insertion of the triangular fibrocartilage and preserving intact the extensor carpi ulnaris sheath. The goal of the implant is to maintain adequate separation of the 2 forearm bones throughout {{the entire range of}} <b>pronosupination.</b> After surgery, the joint stability is supported by the joint physiological stabilizers such as the triangular fibrocar-tilage and extensor carpi ulnaris muscle. To avoid dislocation of the implant at the extremes of forearm rotation, a titanium stem is implanted into the ulnar distal metaphysis with a distal peg inserted in a cylindrical hole {{in the center of the}} spacer. The loose fitting of the peg into the spacer allows some proximodistal translation and slight axial rotation of the implant, enough to adjust its position to the always-changing space between the distal ulna and the sigmoid notch concavity. Preliminary results in 3 patients are very encouraging, with minimal discomfort at the extremes of motion and a mean pronation of 65 degrees and supination of 70 degrees.

40|$|Background: Ataxia-Teleangiectasia (A-T) {{is a rare}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} progressive cerebellar degeneration. Till few years ago only supportive care was available to improve the neurological function in A-T patients. Even though A-T remains an incurable disease, we recently demonstrated a drug dependent amelioration of neurological signs in A-T patients during a short-term treatment with oral betamethasone. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate whether the steroid induced motor performance changes in A-T are associated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) modifications. This represents a preliminary pilot study, which requires a validation on a larger cohort of patients. Methods: Six A-T patients received a 10 -days cycle of oral betamethasone at 0. 03 mg/kg/day. fMRI studies were carried out at T 0 and at the end of the cycle. The neurological evaluation was performed through the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) quantification.

40|$|Conventional {{rehabilitation}} after stroke, consisting in one-to-one {{practice with}} the therapist, is labor-intensive and subjective. Furthermore, {{there is evidence that}} increasing training would benefit the motor function of stroke survivors, though the available resources do not allow it. Training with dedicated robotic devices promises to address these problems and to promote motivation through therapeutic games. The goal of this project is to develop a simple robotic system to assist rehabilitation that could easily be integrated in existing hospital environments and rehabilitation centers. A study was first carried out to analyze the kinematics of hand movements while performing representative activities of daily living. Results showed that movements were confined to one plane so can be trained using a robot with less degrees-of-freedom (DOF). Hence ReachMAN, a compact 3 DOF robot based on an endpoint based approach, was developed to train reaching, forearm <b>pronosupination</b> and grasping, independently or simultaneously. ReachMAN's exercises were developed using games based on software thereby facilitating active participation from patients. Visual, haptic and performance feedback were provided to increase motivation. Tuneable levels of difficulty were provided to suit patient's ability. A pilot study with three subjects was first conducted to evaluate the potential use of ReachMAN as a rehabilitation tool and to determine suitable settings for training. Following positive results from a pilot study, a clinical study was initiated to investigate the effect of rehabilitation using ReachMAN. Preliminary results of 6 subjects show an increase in patients upper limb motor activity, range of movements, smoothness and reduction in movement duration. Subjects reported to be motivated with the robot training and felt that the robot helped in their recovery. The results of this thesis suggest that a compact and simple robot such as ReachMAN can be used to enhance recovery in sub-acute stroke patients.

Ulnar resection has thus become a palliative solution. HypothesesDoes ulna resection influence {{the outcomes of}} distal radius malunion corrective osteotomies? What preoperative factors warrant preserving the distal radio-ulnar joint?Patients and methodsTwenty-one corrective osteotomies of the radius were retrospectively reviewed. Ulna resection was performed in cases of cartilage damage, joint incongruence, or persistent stiffness in <b>pronosupination</b> after osteotomy of the radius. After the osteotomies, two groups were identified: 10 cases with preservation of the distal end of the ulna (DRU+) and eleven with distal resections (DRU–). ResultsAt review, all the osteotomies had united, with comparable anatomical restoration of the radial epiphysisfor the two groups. We noted a statistically significant gain in mobility after osteotomy for both techniques (but no difference between them) and comparable grip strengths with 89. 8 % of the contralateral side for the DRU+ group versus 90. 4 % for the DRU– group. Pain (scale, 0 – 3) had significantly diminished for both groups decreasing from 1. 9 to 0. 3 for the DRU+ group and from 2. 5 to 1. 1 for the DRU– group, with {{no significant difference between}} them. The Mayo Clinic Wrist Score and the DASH score did not differ significantly with 73 / 100 and 13. 5 for the DRU+ group compared with 68. 2 / 100 and 20. 2 for the DRU– group, respectively. DiscussionThese results show that the impact of ulna resection after distal osteotomy of the radius is limited as reflected by radiological correction, mobility and grip strength. However, after resection pain in the ulnar tilt of the wrist due to instability of the distal ulnar stump was noted. Besides cartilage damage, ulnar deviation of over 5 mm was, for this series, a constant factor in non-preservation of the DRU joint. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Retrospective study...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The wrist {{arthrodesis}} {{has become}} a well-established procedure on the treatment of various diseases that affect the radiocarpal joint {{with the objective of}} pain relief and restoration of joint stability, allowing a recovery of gripping function and lifestyle. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the functional outcomes of wrist arthrodesis in patients with advanced symptomatic inflammatory or degenerative arthritis and evaluate the residual synovitis by ultrasonography. METHODS: Review the patients who underwent a total wrist arthrodesis in our Hospital between 1999 and 2009, by a comparative and functional study. The study population was divided into two groups: Inflammatory Rheumatic Disease (IRD group) and another that included the remaining cases (RC group). For functional evaluation we used the Buck-Gramcko&Lohman (BGL) Evaluation for Total Wrist Function and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score. Pain levels were measured pre- and postoperatively according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A General Electric P 5 Power Doppler Ultrasound with a high-resolution linear 7 - 12 MHz array was used to identify local synovitis. Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and Chi-Square tests were applied for statistical evaluation. p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: According to the study criteria we selected 38 patients. From these, 7 were treated bilaterally, with a total of 45 total wrist arthrodesis evaluated (IRD group n= 25 vs RC group n= 20). The predominant gender was the female (78. 4 %), the average age at the time of surgery was 50. 0 ± 14. 2 years and the mean postoperative follow-up was 4. 8 ± 2. 6 years. Regarding to the most common surgical indication, on the RC group we had 40 % of post-traumatic arthritis and on the IRD group, 96 % had rheumatoid arthritis. The most frequent surgical technique used on the IRD group was Mannerfelt (52 %) vs AO/ASIF plate osteosynthesis (95 %) on the RC group, Darrach procedure was associated in 37. 8 % of all cases. IRD group presented a greater time for bone union (3. 6 vs 2. 9, p= 0. 228), fewer postoperative complications (12. 0 % vs 35. 0 %, p= 0. 069) and fewer cases of material extraction (20. 0 % vs 25. 0 %, p = 0. 481). There was a lower deficit of <b>pronosupination</b> on the RC group (76 % vs 60 %, p= 0. 204), and this group also presented a better assessment on the DASH score (13. 0 vs. 22. 4, p= 0. 153). 75. 0 % of the RC group had a BGL score with excellent to good results vs 32. 0 % on the IRD group, p = 0. 005. All patients improved their VAS between pre-and postoperatively (8. 0 vs 2. 0 on the IRD group and 6. 5 vs 1. 5 on the RC group, p = 0. 000). After surgery, most patients maintained the previous profession (90 % on the RC vs 56 % on the IRD group, p = 0. 013). The ultrasonographic wrist evaluation of the IRD group revealed local synovitis in 2 cases as also as extensor tenosynovitis of the fingers in other 2 cases. All of these 4 cases were of low intensity and without inflammatory activity identified by power-Doppler signal. CONCLUSION: Although being a retrospective study it allows us {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} wrist arthrodesis, on its various indications, with encouraging functional outcomes and pain relief levels on patients with and without inflammatory rheumatic disease...|$|E
