40|$|Projet M 3 NWe present TASOPT, a new <b>plateform</b> for shape {{optimization}} in rotating frames for {{in particular}} applications in turbomachinery. The theoretical background {{comes from the}} idea develloped at INRIA for aerodynamical shape optimization. TASOPT adopts the unstructured CAD-free framework for shape and mesh deformati- ons where the interface with CAD is realized at {{the final stage of}} the optimization. This framework is extended to 2 D and 3 D multi-block structured grids. Automatic differentiation through Odyssée is used to access discrete sensitivities in reverse mode. In addition, the incomplete gradient approach for functionals based on boundary integrals enables for a drastic reduction of the computational cost. The <b>plateform</b> uses various flow solvers depending on the physic of the problem ranging from incompressible to high speed flows. Various minimization algorithm based on linear and quadratic models for the functional are presented. These ingredients are illustrated through a first cascade configuration blade shape optimization.

40|$|Introduction The key {{obstacle}} to the widespread adoption of parallel systems is the difficulty in program development. An application has to be decomposed into {{a large number of}} parallel components, referred to as processes, objects according to the computational model underlying the programming language, and each component has to be assigned, or mapped, to the system node. Both program development and mapping are complex and a proper set of integrated programming tools is required, but it should not be designed for a physical machine. As in sequential systems, a virtual machine enables the development of applications that are portable across different hardware <b>plateforms.</b> PVM supplies the functions to automatically start-up tasks on the virtual machine, to manage communication and synchronisation among the processes, to enter and exit the virtual machine.

40|$|A {{summary of}} an {{investigation}} of deep convective cloud systems that typify the summertime subtropical environment of northern Alabama is presented. The major portion of the research effort included analysis of data acquired during the 1986 Cooperative Huntsville Meteorological Experiment (COHMEX), which consisted of the joint programs Satellite Precipitation and Cloud Experiment (SPACE) under NASA direction, the Microburst and Service Thunderstorm (MIST) Program under NSF sponsorship, and the FAA-Lincoln Laboratory Weather Study (FLOWS).

40|$|The Gafsa {{fault is}} the longest and most active {{structure}} of the fold-and-thrust belt achieving southeastward propagation of the Atlas belt of Eastern North Africa onto the Saharan platform. The Gafsa fault is a 75 -km long dextral-oblique basement fault ramp that poses a sizable challenge in earthquake hazard assessment because the post-Paleozoic sedimentary cover is decoupled from its basement above the basement fault. In this study, we combine seismic lines interpretation, tectonic geomorphology and paleoseismological investigations to assess the level of seismic hazard of this fault and evaluate {{its role in the}} geodynamic framework of the Central Mediterranean. We show that despite a moderate instrumental and historical seismicity, the fault has produced M >= 6 earthquakes with a return period of ca. 500 - 5000 years during the Late Quaternary. The latest large event having produced a surface rupture on the fault occurred around 8000 yr BP, suggesting an M >= 6 earthquake is overdue on the fault. The fault has a minimum reverse component of slip rate of 0. 21 - 034 mm/yr over the past 50 Ka. The occurrence of M >= 7 paleoearthquakes on the fault may be suspected but not established. Such very strong earthquakes would require transient coseismic linkage of the buried basement fault with the overlying listric fault ramping off the decollement layer. The level of seismic hazard may be underestimated on the Gafsa fault. Indeed, given the geometry of the basement-cover fault system, a number of earthquakes generated in the basement would have led to coseismic surface folding instead of to surface rupture.
