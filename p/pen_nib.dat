500|$|Iridium–osmium alloys {{were used}} in {{fountain}} <b>pen</b> <b>nib</b> tips. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold. Since 1944, the famous Parker 51 fountain pen was fitted with a nib tipped by a ruthenium and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called [...] "iridium", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as ruthenium, osmium and tungsten have taken its place.|$|E
500|$|Osmium (from Greek ὀσμή osme, [...] "smell") is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Os and atomic number 76.

Osmium is the densest naturally occurring element, with a density of [...] Its alloys with platinum, iridium, and other platinum-group metals are employed in fountain <b>pen</b> <b>nib</b> tipping, electrical contacts, and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed.|$|E

5000|$|In the 19th century, around 100 {{companies}} distributed steel pens in Birmingham. The <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> produced {{were distributed}} worldwide, until the trade was overtaken by fountain pens and the ballpoint pen. The museum {{looks into the}} lives of the employers and workers involved in the business, as well as providing information on the pen companies. It also has information on how steel <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> were made and has <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> on display. Beyond the steel pen, the museum also aims to educate on other forms of writing equipment and on writing in general.|$|R

50|$|Information at {{the museum}} is given through {{displays}} and tours by volunteer guides, {{as well as through}} demonstrations and ‘hands on’ activities, such as writing with different kinds of pen, early typewriters and Braille machines, and making a <b>pen</b> <b>nib</b> using original factory presses. Entry to the museum is by admission, additional donations are appreciated.|$|E

[...] But Johnson, nodding to modernity, scans the finished drawings for transmission to the syndicate editors, and syndicate colorists color the daily strips. He uses Photoshop to color the Sunday strips himself.|$|E
5000|$|Left-to-right alphabets can {{be written}} smudge-free and in proper [...] "forward slant" [...] with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn {{clockwise}} (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do calligraphy in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed <b>pen</b> <b>nibs.</b> Otherwise, left-handed <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> are {{required in order to}} get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century copperplate hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.|$|R
50|$|After {{the early}} 1960s {{injection}} molded plastic of a uniform colour {{was used for}} the manufacture of <b>pens.</b> <b>Nibs,</b> which had been 14ct gold until this time, were generally replaced by stainless steel.|$|R
25|$|Another major {{trade in}} the Jewellery Quarter and the {{surrounding}} area was the pen trade. The Quarter was home to the world's first mass producer of <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> which made <b>pens</b> more affordable by reducing the cost by 99.9%. At the industry's peak in the area, 5,000 workers produced 1,500million <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> per year. The area was home to many dip pen manufacturers who played a vital role in the pen {{trade in the}} city. During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, Swan Pens opened a large gold pen factory in the city, taking advantage of the skilled gold workers of the Jewellery Quarter.|$|R
50|$|When pen {{plotters}} became widespread, {{a special}} variety of point assemblies was produced. These had the basic {{characteristics of the}} standard <b>pen</b> <b>nib,</b> but the tube was much thicker to strengthen it against quick lateral movements. Only {{the tip of the}} tube had the desired, line-size width. They fell out of use as plotters were replaced with ink-jet printers.|$|E

5|$|Fountain <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> {{made from}} gold are {{sometimes}} plated with palladium when a silver (rather than gold) appearance is desired. Sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades, either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely.|$|R

50|$|In 1915, Ryōsuke Namiki (並木良輔), a {{professor}} from Tokyo Nautical College in Japan, left {{his job to}} found a small factory near Tokyo to produce gold <b>pen</b> <b>nibs.</b> In 1916, Namiki expanded his product line and became a full-fledged manufacturer of writing instruments.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s the {{equipment}} available expanded: drawing apparatus and Rapidograph-drawing pens appeared, improving the line quality and, especially, producing consistent line width. In {{addition to the}} Rapidograph stylus, a more traditional Grafos-type stylus was used for a long time, where different line widths were achieved by changing the <b>pen</b> <b>nib.</b> For instance in Finland Grafos was commonly used as a primary drawing tool still in the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Pen feeds {{are crucial}} to {{preventing}} ink from dripping or leaking. Feeds often feature finned structures intended for buffering fountain pen ink. Buffering is the capacity to catch and temporary hold an overflow of ink caused by other conditions than writing towards the nib. When a fountain <b>pen</b> <b>nib</b> receives such an overflow it will result in ink blobbing or dripping also known as burping. A pen with a misconfigured feed might fail to deposit any ink whatsoever.|$|E
5000|$|Casual scripts show a less formal, {{more active}} hand. The strokes may vary in width but often {{appear to have}} been created by wet brush rather than a <b>pen</b> <b>nib.</b> They appear {{in the early twentieth century}} and with the advent of {{photocomposition}} in the early-1950s their number rapidly increased. They were popularly used in advertising in Europe and North America into the 1970s. Examples of casual script types include Brush Script, Kaufmann and Mistral. Some may be non-connecting.|$|E
50|$|Other {{styles of}} {{fountain}} <b>pen</b> <b>nibs</b> include hooded (e.g. Parker 51, Parker 61, 2007 Parker 100 and Hero 329), inlaid (e.g. Sheaffer Targa or Sheaffer P.F.M) or integral Nib (Parker T-1 and Falcon, Pilot Myu 701), which {{may also be}} ground to have different writing characteristics.|$|R

5000|$|In 1947 Esterbrook {{bought out}} John Mitchell (which had been {{established}} in 1822 as the World's first manufacturer to cut nibs by machine) and then acquired Hazell Pen Co.

5000|$|Soennecken {{was born}} in Iserlohn-Dröschede, Sauerland in 1848, {{the son of a}} blacksmith. On May 27, 1875 he founded the F. Soennecken Verlag, a {{commercial}} enterprise in Remscheid, Westphalia. His main invention is the [...] "round writing" [...] style of calligraphy and the <b>pen</b> <b>nib</b> associated with it. Round writing was designed to be a visually appealing, standardized style of penmanship which was easy to learn and execute, and Soennecken published books on the topic in several languages.|$|E
