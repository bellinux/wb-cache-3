40|$|Abstract: In {{consideration}} of inconvenient to sinusoidal machine in naval vessels maintain to quick guarantee goal nowadays, a portable synthetic testing {{system has been}} designed in this paper which used for servo system based on information fusion. The testing system used a <b>portable</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>computer</b> as a core, which uses Windows as operating platform and C++Builder as programmable aid, and Native-XML database technique and dynamic access mechanism, and Win Driver technique and dynamic graphics display for accurate and coarse channels signal. Through developed and designed for hardware and software, it had extended function of conventional sinusoidal machine. It adopts NFE estimator to fusion multi-source information to diagnosis the instrument on-line and database technique for off-line. Application shows it possesses the advantage of simple operate and easy test, high efficiency. And it reduces the difficulty of equipment maintenance, conveniences to track and mastery the equipment for long time, and increases the quick guarantee capability. The static position precision of test overland gets 0. 1 mil. It has great application value and promotion value. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|E
