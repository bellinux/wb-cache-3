50|$|Moissan {{eventually}} {{succeeded in}} preparing fluorine in 1886 by the electrolysis {{of a solution}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>difluoride</b> (KHF2) in liquid hydrogen fluoride (HF). The mixture was needed because hydrogen fluoride is a nonconductor. The device was built with platinum/iridium electrodes in a platinum holder and the apparatus was cooled to −50°C. The result was the complete isolation of the hydrogen produced at the negative electrode from the fluorine produced at the positive one. This is essentially still the way fluorine is produced today. For this achievement, {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize in 1906. Late in his life, the government of France named him a Commandeur de la Legion d'honneur.|$|E

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) {{has been used}} to assess the fundamental and neurochemical parameters in normal and diseased human organisms. 1 Measuring these parameters with PET requires the preparation of specific molecular imaging probes labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes. Labeling pharmaceuticals with [18 F]fluorine often enables the fluorine-substituted analogue to be used to trace biochemical processes while maintaining favorable interaction with the target. 2 Thus, a rapid and effective method for the introduction of 18 F is a great concern in organofluorine and radiopharmaceutical chemistry. The typical method for introduction of a fluorine atom in an aliphatic molecule is the nucleophilic substitution of the corresponding sulfonates or halides by a fluoride ion. 3 For example, the reaction of 2 -(3 -methanesulfonyloxypropoxy) -naphthalene with CsF in t-BuOH gave 2 -(3 -fluoroprop-oxy) naphthalene in 92 % yield along with the corresponding ether. 4 Epoxide opening with a fluoride ion has been widely used in the preparation of fluorohydrins, which were often found in a certain bioactive molecules such as steroids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and prostaglandins. 5 Anhydrous hydro-gen fluoride is a good reagent for cleavage of the epoxide ring, but {{it is not easy to}} handle due to its toxicity and corrosiveness. 6 To avoid this problem, some reagents have been developed; HF-amine complex, 7 <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>difluoride,</b> 8 silicon tetrafluoride...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{parameters}} {{of a product}} such as wine are a very objective matter. <b>Potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate is acomponent, which a customer without much knowledge of wine could negatively evaluate. The market {{offers a lot of}} variants for <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate elimination, which includes electrodialysis. The aim of this work was to process 4 types of wines with the electrodialysis technique, of which at least 2 white and 2 red wines were preferentially unstable in terms of formation of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> crystals. These wines were processed by the electrodialysis laboratory machine EDR [...] Z/ 10 which was from the MemBrain company. During the operation, the process parameters (electrical current, voltage, flow, volume, pH and conductivity of the individual hydraulic flow) were measured. The samples of wine processed by electrodialysis were analysed by the sensory technique, for the content of tartaric acid and potassium, and for the saturation temperature of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> tartrate. The work dealt with the relation between the level of demineralization of wine, by electrodialysis, and its organoleptic properties (color, smell, taste, harmony).

The associated excess entropy was 0. 90 calth K- 1 mol- 1. The thermal properties of the azides and the corresponding structurally similar <b>hydrogen</b> <b>difluorides</b> are nearly identical.

50|$|When {{choosing}} primary {{standards in}} analytical chemistry, compounds with higher equivalent weights {{are generally more}} desirable because weighing errors are reduced. An example is the volumetric standardisation of a solution of sodium hydroxide which has been prepared to approximately 0.1 mol&thinsp;dm&minus;3. It is necessary to calculate the mass of a solid acid which will react with about 20 cm3 of this solution (for a titration using a 25 cm3 burette): suitable solid acids include oxalic acid dihydrate, <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> phthalate and <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> iodate. The equivalent weights of the three acids 63.04 g, 204.23 g and 389.92 g respectively, and the masses required for the standardisation are 126.1 mg, 408.5 mg and 779.8 mg respectively. Given that the measurement uncertainty in the mass measured on a standard analytical balance is ±0.1 mg, the relative uncertainty in the mass of oxalic acid dihydrate would be about one part in a thousand, similar to the measurement uncertainty in the volume measurement in the titration. However the measurement uncertainty in the mass of <b>potassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> iodate would be five times lower, because its equivalent weight is five times higher: such an uncertainty in the measured mass is negligible {{in comparison to the}} uncertainty in the volume measured during the titration (see example below).|$|R
