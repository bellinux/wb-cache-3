5|$|At the Miles family home, Billy, now highly suspicious, {{enters and}} <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> {{gun on the}} man {{who appears to be}} his father. After the confrontation, Billy relinquishes his gun, at which point the other man {{physically}} morphs and reveals himself to be the Alien Bounty Hunter. At that point, Mulder and Scully pull up and walk into the house, unable to locate Billy or his father.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Kripik <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> hand free of {{the single}} manacle used to chain him down, but mangles his hand while doing so. Kripik flees the post with his team of sled dogs, heading for his family's old village. Hunt and Balk pursue him. The rifle Kripik steals proves useless when the bullets are not the right gauge. Kripik is forced to kill his sled dogs one by one for food. In a driving blizzard, Kripik falls short of {{reaching}} his family, and is attacked and injured by a wolf (which he manages to kill). Kripik is found by his eldest son Orsodikok (now a teenager), rescued, and fed by his family.|$|E
5|$|He {{returns to}} the {{observation}} room and finds the letter he'd written to Amanda, in which he'd used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches {{the end of his}} path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch and a bed of needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates, and he <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> head free, ripping open his cheek.|$|E

25|$|As {{usual in}} medieval art, {{the figures are}} not individualized, but repeat a few stylised types. They have the disproportionately large, oval faces which are {{characteristic}} of Pre-Romanesque sculpture. Their very large, almond-shaped eyes sit in flat sockets with sharply delineated eyebrows. The hair is composed of parallel strands from a central parting. Nevertheless, the facial expressions of some figures are very individuated and match the figures' gestures. Especially relevant in this respect is the figure of Cain who looks up to the Hand of God in heaven with fearful, terror-stricken eyes and <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> cloak tight around his body.|$|E
25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether {{he might be}} the other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet. Estragon awakes and <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E
25|$|At the dance, after introductions, the {{teenagers}} begin to dance; soon a challenge dance is called ("Dance at the Gym"), during which Tony and Maria (who aren't {{taking part in}} the challenge dance) see each other across the room and are drawn to each other. They dance together, forgetting the tension in the room, and fall in love, but Bernardo <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> sister from Tony and sends her home. Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc's, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria's building and serenades her outside her bedroom ("Maria"). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another ("Tonight"). Meanwhile, Anita, Rosalia, and the other Shark girls discuss the differences between the territory of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States of America, with Anita defending America, and Rosalia yearning for Puerto Rico ("America").|$|E

25|$|After {{some time}} of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate {{the men of}} Brethil. Turambar leads an {{expedition}} to cut him off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is dying {{on the bank of}} the ravine, Turambar <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Niënor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Niënor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river Taeglin and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Niënor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.|$|E

500|$|Vaudeville era magician Presto DiGiotagione {{is famous}} for a hat trick wherein he <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> rabbit Alec Azam out of his top hat. A hungry and irritated Alec is locked in a cage, unable to reach his carrot. After Presto returns from eating a meal, he begins {{practicing}} his act with Alec, revealing that his top hat is magically connected or is a functioning Einstein-Rosen Bridge with a wizard's hat kept backstage with Alec, so that when Presto reaches into the top hat, his hand appears out of the wizard's hat, allowing him to grab Alec and pull {{him out of the}} top hat.|$|E

500|$|Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp {{starts to}} shuffle away, {{but the girl}} steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes hold {{of his hand and}} presses the coin into it. As she closes his palm she stops abruptly; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: [...] "You?" [...] The Tramp nods with an {{uncertain}} smile and asks, [...] "You can see now?" [...] The girl replies, [...] "Yes, I can see now" [...] and tearfully <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.|$|E
500|$|Even so, {{the narrator}} <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> chair {{directly}} in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks for a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|E

He finds Grace and they begin to escape, but are seen by a nun, who is then attacked by the creature. The creature then attacks Kit, who manages to disembowel it. Frank finds them and <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> gun on Kit. Grace jumps in his way and is shot. Shachath appears and asks her if she is ready. Grace responds, [...] "Yes," [...] and the angel kisses her. As she dies, Grace says, [...] "I'm free." ...|$|E
2500|$|The tagged man chases a group into {{a subway}} station, where they cram {{themselves}} into a departing train. He manages to jam his arm between the closing doors, but the people in reach shrink away. He frustratedly <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> arm {{out of the door}} and, after glancing to his left, begins strolling nonchalantly past the train, its occupants jammed against the window watching him. The camera cuts ahead to reveal a lone straggler who failed to make it onto the train. As he spots the tagged man, he turns to flee and the commercial ends with the pair continuing the chase outside of the view of the camera, a superimposed swoosh accompanying the campaign tagline, [...] "Play".|$|E
2500|$|A bowler {{releases}} a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in {{position and the}} first two fingers positioned {{on top of the}} cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> fingers down {{the left side of the}} ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of his hand over the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Ty Cobb {{took over}} from Hughie Jennings {{as manager of}} the Tigers. Bush became {{involved}} in repeated arguments with Cobb's [...] "first lieutenant", Dan Howley. The Detroit Free Press wrote that Howley [...] "never is quite so contented" [...] as he is when arguing with Bush and added: [...] "Bush would fight {{at the drop of}} a hat for Dan, yet the midget never gets nearly so mad at anyone as he does when Howley, with deliberate intent, corners Donie somewhere and starts a debate[...] [...] [...] Often Donie becomes so enraged that he <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> cap off his head and throwing it off the door of the hotel lobby or in the turf of the ball field, stamps on it in his hysteria." [...] For the first half of the season, Bush continued as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Halfway through the season, however, Cobb moved Bush from his regular shortstop position to second base.|$|E
2500|$|Out of the {{confluence}} of Leavitt's scholarly interests, his former career as a newspaper writer and publisher, and his work as an author of textbooks was born the idea behind his farmer's almanac, which he first began publishing while living in Gilmanton. From the beginning, Leavitt demonstrated an unrelenting common sense, {{as well as a}} sly sense of humor. In an early edition of his almanacs, for instance, Leavitt included an illustration of a New Hampshireman struggling against the elements. Quoting a supposed poem of the 17th century, Leavitt wrote, in lines summoning feelings familiar to current Granite State residents, [...] "Our mountains and hills and our vallies (sic) below; Being commonly cover'd with ice and with snow; And when the north-west wind with violence blows, Then every man <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> cap over his nose; But if any's so hardy, and will it withstand, He forfeits a finger, a foot or a hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} symbols in Our Mutual Friend {{is that of the}} River Thames, and the river is linked to major themes of the novel, rebirth and renewal. Water is seen as a sign of new life, and associated by the Christian Church with the sacrament of Baptism. Characters like John Harmon and Eugene Wrayburn end up in the waters of the river, and come out reborn as new men. Wrayburn emerges from the river on his deathbed, but is ready to marry Lizzie to save her reputation. [...] He surprises everyone, including himself, when he survives and goes on to have a loving marriage with Lizzie. John Harmon also appears to end up in the river through no fault of his own, and when Gaffer <b>pulls</b> <b>his</b> [...] "body" [...] out of the waters, he adopts the alias of John Rokesmith. This alias is for his own safety and peace of mind; he wants to know that he can do things on his own, and does not need his father's name or money to make a good life for himself.|$|E
