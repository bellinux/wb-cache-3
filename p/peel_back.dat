5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently <b>peel</b> <b>back</b> the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E
5|$|British {{policy-makers}} regarded Portugal as {{a traditional}} friend—the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance dated back to 1386, and both countries were in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Free Trade Association—but the combined strength of the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby in the United Nations forced the British to <b>peel</b> <b>back</b> {{their support for the}} pluricontinental Estado Novo ("New State") during the early 1960s. Portugal's Colonial War, starting in Angola in 1961, pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its African territories, most of which subscribed to communist political thinking. Britain opposed communist encroachment into southern Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly opposed general consensus at the UN, which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist-backed insurgencies across the region, regarding them as racial liberation movements. It therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose Portugal without meaningfully doing so.|$|E

It was Whedon's first {{contribution}} to the series, and Cho's second. In an interview fifteen days before the broadcast of [...] "The Dreamscape", showrunner and executive producer Jeff Pinkner stated that it and several surrounding episodes would be [...] "stand-alone in quality, {{but at the same}} time we [...] start to <b>peel</b> <b>back</b> another layer of the onion" [...] to transition the second half of the season into a [...] "new chapter." [...] Anna Torv later commented that she wished for Olivia to [...] "lighten up" [...] during the first season, [...] "but every time she did, something would happen." [...] The writers inputted small scenes to shine more light on her character, which included Olivia dressing up for a night out but then [...] "the phone rings. It’s Broyles, and she wipes the lipstick off, puts on a coat, and goes out. That’s it. You’re on call. She breaks my heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Olivia {{has been described}} as [...] "an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be <b>peel</b> <b>back</b> over time." [...] She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as it makes her a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew {{what she wanted to do}} for a career [...] "pretty much since [...] was nine", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.|$|E

2500|$|Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} {{parallels}} drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: [...] "The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, {{the idea that}} the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy." [...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. And we all know how that turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you <b>peel</b> <b>back</b> the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E
