5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{led away}} at the restart, but his Ferrari {{teammate}} Räikkönen was forced to <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane on lap 22 with fire coming from his airbox and subsequently retired, handing second place to Rosberg. Over {{the next couple of}} laps, Vettel was able to pull away from Rosberg on the softer tyre compound. Marcus Ericsson was handed a drive-through penalty for having his team work on his car less than 15 seconds before the restart. By lap 31, the gap between Vettel and Rosberg started to come down again, while Hamilton moved ahead of Sainz into fifth as the latter made a pit stop. Two laps later, Verstappen was in as well, but a slow pit stop lost him time. On lap 35, Rosberg took the lead as Vettel made a pit stop, who also lost time due to a mistake during his stop. He emerged back on track in fourth place. Hamilton now started to pull back time on the leaders, while debutant Palmer held off the two Toro Rosso drivers in a struggle for ninth place.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some familiar faces with some new faces is {{something to look forward}} to. I also think finding some new Marvel characters to <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> universe would be cool. Fans seem to respond when there are characters from the Marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] He later explained that the series has the opportunity to explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E

2500|$|Bannock Pass, on the Idaho-Montana {{border and}} the Continental Divide, {{was by far}} the most {{substantial}} obstacle encountered by the G [...] The pass itself is at an elevation of , some [...] higher than the center of Horse Prairie. [...] Temporary trackage was built {{over the top of the}} pass during the G's construction, but a tunnel beneath the pass was clearly needed for the railway's permanent use. [...] Since a tunnel to completely bypass the heavy grades of the pass was prohibitively expensive, the railroad compromised by boring a shorter, [...] tunnel at the [...] elevation. [...] To bring the tracks to the elevation of the tunnel, the railroad line included a switchback on each side of the summit; trains ascending the pass would <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first switchback, run backwards through the summit tunnel, and then reverse direction again at the switchback on the opposite side.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the 1892 {{arrest of}} Engineer Kern for {{complicity}} in a steamboat race, Elwood was again {{involved in a}} race in 1896, with the sternwheeler Hattie Belle. [...] Hattie Belle entered the Willamette River from the Columbia about 200 yards ahead of Elwood, which overtook Hattie Bell at Post Office Bar. [...] Post Office Bar was {{a short distance from}} the mouth of the Willamette. [...] As Elwood passed Hattie Belle, the two vessels came so close together that Hattie Belle was carried along in the suction created by the passage of Elwood, a larger vessel. [...] The two boats ran this manner all the way to the Steel Bridge. [...] This was a distance of 12.1 miles {{from the mouth of the}} Willamette. [...] At the Steel Bridge, the two boats separated, and Hattie Belle was able to <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dock first.|$|E

2500|$|When the bushrangers {{heard the}} train <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> station, they knew their plan {{to destroy the}} train had failed. They put on their suits of armour {{and went on to}} the {{verandah}} of the hotel to wait for the police. In the first few shots, police Superintendent Hare, Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne were wounded, and Jack Jones, son of the hotel owner was fatally wounded. Ned Kelly, who was dressed in his armour, was able to leave the hotel and kept shooting at the police. The police fired their guns into the hotel building for seven hours. It is [...] that 15,000 bullets were fired during the shooting. Byrne died after being shot in the groin. Ned Kelly went back to hotel but could not find Dan or Steve Hart who were hiding in a back room. He again left and tried to find his horse. Ned Kelly was shot in the legs as he searched outside for his brother. The police were then easily able to capture him.|$|E

60|$|The reach which Shelton chose was {{innocent}} of launches, champagne bottles and loud laughter; it was uncivilised, and seldom troubled by these humanising influences. He paddled slowly, silent and absorbed, watching Antonia.

She made Shelton <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reeds, and plucked two rounded lilies sailing like ships against slow-moving water.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{you will}} keep the cutter just without the breakers, Mr. Effingham," [...] Captain Truck continued, after {{standing}} up a while and examining the shore, [...] "I will <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> channel, and land in yonder bay. If you feel disposed to follow, you may do so by giving the tiller to Mr. Blunt, on receiving a signal to that effect from me. Be steady, gentlemen, at your oars, and look well to the arms on landing, for {{we are in a}} knavish part of the world. Should any of the monkeys or ouran-outangs claim kindred with Mr. Saunders, we may find it no easy matter to persuade them to leave us the pleasure of his society." ...|$|E
60|$|The two cutters were intrusted to {{the command}} of the second-lieutenant, with orders to <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> broad passage {{between the end of}} the cape, or the 'Hook,' and that long narrow island which {{stretches}} from the harbor of New-York for more than forty leagues to the eastward, sheltering the whole coast of Connecticut from the tempests of the ocean. Ludlow knew, though ships of a heavy draught were obliged to pass close to the cape, in order to gain the open sea, that a light brigantine, like the Water-Witch, could find a sufficient depth of water for her purposes further north. The cutters were, therefore, sent in that direction, with orders to cover as much of the channel as possible, and to carry the smuggler should an occasion offer. Finally, the yawl was to occupy the space between the two channels, with orders to repeat signals, and to be vigilant in reconnoitring.|$|E
60|$|Thus the whale-line folds {{the whole}} boat in its {{complicated}} coils, twisting and writhing around it {{in almost every}} direction. All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit--strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whaleboat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew <b>pull</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.|$|E
