40|$|In {{industrial}} applications, different rubber {{types are}} often blended to fine-tune or optimize the property portfolio required for successful performance of articles. Considering {{the complexity of}} a rubber blend compound, wherein numerous additives are involved, vulcanization or cure mismatch often occurs as an outcome of inhomogeneous distribution of the curatives or imbalanced reactivities of the different rubber phases towards the curatives. The solubility study of various curatives in different rubbers was measured with an easy and effective method based on weight up-take by the migration of curative molecules into slightly pre-crosslinked rubbers. The experimental results correlate well with calculated solubility parameter differences. The study provides valuable data for predicting the distribution of curatives in the different phases of dissimilar rubber blends. A mixing study {{was carried out by}} applying the solubility knowledge of curatives in rubbers to improve the properties of unreinforced 50 / 50 w/w blends of SBR/EPDM (SE) and NBR/EPDM (NE). Different mixing procedures are performed based on the same overall recipe for each rubber blend. Large improvements are achieved for the SE blends, not for the NE blends. The surface modification of both sulfur and CBS through plasma polymerization with acetylene, perfluorohexane, and acrylic acid are described. As a result of the plasma surface treatment, the surface energies of sulfur and CBS are decreased and brought closer to the range of the rubber polymers involved in this study.

40|$|Aluminium and {{stainless}} steels {{are susceptible to}} pitting corrosion in sea water. Mild steel is susceptible to corrosion in general. Titanium however, has good corrosion resistance in chloride solutions and thus is not susceptible to pitting in sea water. The following is {{an assessment of the}} corrosion resistance of Titanium powder coatings. Potentiostatic electrochemical experiments were carried out on three substrates (stainless steel, mild steel and Aluminium) coated using two spray methods (plasma and HVOF). A discussion of the results was given with reference to the polarisation curves that were created, SEM images, XRD results, estimates of porosity, and Pourbaix diagrams. It was concluded that the <b>plasma</b> <b>coating</b> provides the best corrosion resistance {{due to the fact that}} it had less porosity than HVOF and that it is made up of Titanium oxides. Also, the corrosion mechanism for the coatings is pitting of the substrates at the end of pores.
