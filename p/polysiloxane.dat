The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E

Their cytotoxic effects were studied by indirect and direct tests. The indirect tests were performed by incubating impression materials in serum free cell culture medium to prepare the soluble extracts. Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were incubated with extract dilutions (25, 50, 75 and 100 %) for 24 h. The extracts of polyether materials caused a decrease of cellular viability, evaluated by light microscopy, by cell counting and by MTT test. The extracts of vinyl <b>polysiloxanes</b> materials induced a slight effect on cellular number and viability. The direct tests were performed by placing the impression materials in the centre of Petri dishes while Balb/c 3 T 3 were settling. The cellular proliferation was drastically reduced by polyethers and it was unaffected by the presence of vinyl <b>polysiloxanes.</b> These results show that: (a) the polyether materials are more toxic than vinyl <b>polysiloxanes</b> in our experimental conditions, (b) the impression materials are cytotoxic to the same degree in all assay methods...|$|R
