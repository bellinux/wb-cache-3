40|$|A common {{misconception}} in the thermoforming {{community is}} that, prior to conducting a thermoforming simulation, significant material testing must be completed {{to develop a}} complex visco-elastic material model. Published research reports over the last twenty years, as well as work {{by the author of}} this white paper, show that {{for the vast majority of}} thermoformable polymers a very simple hyperelastic (rubber-like) material model will work sufficiently well.

Background: Thermoforming Using Vacuum or <b>Pressure</b> (Not <b>Plug</b> Assisted) With just a few exceptions, thermoformable polymers will exhibit similar material behavior during the forming process, if they are uniformly heated to within their forming temperature window. Nearly all of the thermoformable polymers will stretch and thin in a very similar manner.

40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{control in}} millimeter-wide fractures {{has been a}} challenge in well drilling all the time. Low pressure-bearing capacity of a plugging zone will result in excessive consumption of lost circulation materials (LCMs) and extra down time. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted on the plugging of millimeter-wide fractures to evaluate the plugging effects {{of different types of}} LCM including rigid granules, elastic particles and fiber. Maximum <b>plugging</b> <b>pressure,</b> total loss volume before sealing and plugging time were taken as the evaluation index of the LCM plugging effect. According to the experimental results, the synergistic plugging mechanisms of different LCM combinations were also analyzed. Experimental results showed that the total loss volume of the plugging zone formed by rigid and elastic particle combination was generally greater than 400  mL, and the maximum <b>plugging</b> <b>pressure</b> of the <b>plugging</b> zone formed by elastic particle and fiber combination was generally less than 6  MPa. In contrast, the plugging zone formed by the combination of the three types of LCMs has the maximum <b>plugging</b> <b>pressure</b> of up to 13  MPa and total loss volume before sealing of 75  mL. In the synergistic plugging process, rigid granules form a frame with high pressure-bearing capacity in the narrower parts of the fractures; elastic particles generate elastic force through elastic deformation to increase the friction between a fracture and a plugging zone to make the plugging zone more stable; fibers filling in the pore space between the particles increase the tightness and integrity of the plugging zone. The experimental results can provide guidance for the optimal design of LCMs used in the field...|$|R

From two cores of Lower Tuscaloosa Formation, three sandstone lithofacies were identified for mechanical testing based on permeability and lithology. These include: chlorite-cemented conglomeratic sandstone (Facies A); quartz-cemented fine sandstone (Facies B); and quartz- and calcite-cemented very fine sandstone (Facies C). We performed {{a suite of}} compression tests for each lithofacies at 100 °C and pore pressure of 30 MPa, including hydrostatic compression and triaxial tests at several confining <b>pressures.</b> <b>Plugs</b> were saturated with supercritical CO 2 -saturated brine. Chemical environment affected the mechanical response of all three lithofacies, which experience initial plastic yielding at stresses far below estimated in situ stress. Measured elastic moduli degradation defines a secondary yield surface coinciding with in situ stress for Facies B and C. Facies A shows measurable volumetric creep strain and a failure envelope below estimates of in situ stress, linked to damage of chlorite cements by acidic pore solutions. The substantial weakening of a particular lithofacies by CO 2 demonstrates a possible chemical-mechanical coupling during injection at Cranfield with implications for CO 2 injection, reservoir permeability stimulation, and enhanced oil recovery...|$|R

40|$|Summary. This is an {{experimental}} comparison Of two axi-symmetric, isentropic plug nozzles. In {{one of these}} (Model No. 1) the afterbody is cylindricaland a secondary flow is bled into the annular base. The other (Model No. 2) has a parabolic afterbody with no base or bleed. In both cases the expansion is all-external and the design pressure ratio is 14. These models were tested over a range of primary and secondary flows at Moo = 0, 0 " 9 and 2. 0. In the case of Model No. 1 measurements include the primary and secondary flow rates, the base <b>pressure</b> and the <b>plug</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution. The overall thrust was determined by a balance and analysed into its components; namely, the nozzle thrust and the drag of the bleed system. With Model No. 2 only the primary flow rate and overall thrust were measured. Both nozzles are efficient at the cruising condition (M ~ = 2 - 0) and both are exceptionally flexible with regard to off-design operation (Moo = 0. 9 and 0).

40|$|International audienceA plug of wetting {{liquid is}} driven at {{constant}} pressure through a bifurcation in a microchannel. For a plug advancing {{in a straight}} channel, {{we find that the}} viscous dissipation in the bulk may be estimated using Poiseuille's law while Bretherton and Tanner's laws model the additional dissipation occurring at the rear and front interfaces. At a second stage, we focus on the behavior of the plug flowing through a T-junction. Experiments show the existence of a threshold pressure, below which the plug remains blocked at the entrance of the junction. Above this required <b>pressure,</b> the <b>plug</b> enters the bifurcation and either ruptures or splits into two daughter plugs, depending on the applied pressure and on the initial length of the plug.
