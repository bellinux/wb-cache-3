40|$|Abstract: We present {{algorithms}} for computing all <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> two {{and three}} fingers that cage a given polygonal object with n edges in the plane. A polygon is caged when {{it is impossible to}} take the polygon to infinity without penetrating one of the fingers. Using a classification into squeezing and stretching cagings, we provide an algorithm that reports all caging <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> two disc fingers in O(n 2 log n) time. Our result extends and improves a recent solution for point fingers. In addition, we construct a data structure requiring O(n 2) storage that can answer in O(log n) whether two fingers in a query placement cage the polygon. We also study caging with three point fingers. Given the <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> two so-called base fingers, we report all <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> the third finger so that the three fingers jointly cage the polygon. Using the fact that the boundary of the set <b>of</b> <b>placements</b> for the third finger consists of equilibrium grasps, we present an algorithm that reports all <b>placements</b> <b>of</b> the third finger in O(n 6 log 2 n) deterministic time and O(n 6 log n(log log n) 3) expected time. Our results extend previous solutions that only apply to convex polygons. ...|$|R
