The germinal response following the various treatments was compared with the responses obtained with heat activation. It was concluded that the optimal time for activation with 30 mM sodium <b>perborate</b> at room temperature was about 4 hr.

Results of experiments designed to demonstrate deactivation by slow oxidation showed that spores activated with sodium <b>perborate</b> were not deactivated by slow oxidation, whereas those activated by heat were. A deactivation study using mercaptoethanol as the deactivation agent showed that both methods of activation could be deactivated after a 24 -hr exposure, but this deactivation was reversible by extending the exposure to mercaptoethanol.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} staining {{as a result}} of the chlorhexidine use and the role of sodium <b>perborate</b> in removing stains; in addition, the amount of decreases in plaque and gingival inflammation and the role of sodium <b>perborate</b> in chlorhexidine efficacy in removing plaque and decreasing gingival inflammation were evaluated. Materials & Methods: In the present randomized clinical trial 40 patients (20 - 30 years old) referring to the Department of Periodontics, who had mild-to-moderate gingivitis were randomly divided into two groups with a parallel study design and were evaluated in a double-blind scheme. At baseline the patients underwent scaling, root planning and polishing procedures and brushed their teeth daily for two weeks. After two weeks, plaque indexes (PI), gingival indexes (GI) and bleeding indexes (BI) were determined and recorded. In the control group 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash and in the experimental group 0. 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash containing 0. 2 % sodium <b>perborate</b> were used for 30 seconds. The subjects refrained from tooth brushing during this period. After 14 days the above-mentioned indexes were again determined and recorded, along with staining indexes. Also staining potential of mouthwash and chlorhexidine mouthwash containing sodium <b>perborate</b> was analysed with spectrophotometric devices. Data was analyzed by t-test. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in PI, BI and GI between the control and experimental groups, although there were more decreases in PI, GI and BI in the experimental group compared to the control group. Regarding the intensity of staining, there was a significant decrease in the intensity and extent of staining on tooth surfaces and gingivitis in the experimental group compared to the control group (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: The use of chlorhexidine mouthwash containing sodium <b>perborate</b> significantly decreases the amount and extent of stains but has no inhibitory effect on chlorhexidine potential to reduce plaque and gingivitis.

40|$|AbstractAmong current {{approaches}} for removing boron, chemical precipitation {{is widely used}} for treating wastewater that contain a high boron concentration. The need for heating and very large amounts of coagulant limits the efficiency of this method. Accordingly, this work developed a chemical oxo-preceipitation (COP) method, which uses hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as the oxidant and barium hydroxide (Ba(OH) 2) as the precipitant to improve considerably the chemical precipitation of wastewater with {{a high concentration of}} boron at room temperature. Under suitable conditions (pHi 9, mole ratio of H 2 O 2 /B= 2, and mole ratio of Ba/B= 0. 8), boron can be efficiently removed from solution by forming amorphous precipitates of barium <b>perborate.</b> After four hours, amorphous barium <b>perborate</b> was transformed to a particular species with a crystalline phase. Consequently, the boron concentration was reduced from 1000 mg/L to 2 mg/L in six hours.

Methods: Twenty crowns of bovine incisors were cut into slabs that were randomly distributed in six experimental groups (n = 5), {{according to the}} bleaching agent used: G 1 - sodium <b>perborate</b> + water, G 2 - sodium <b>perborate</b> + 2 % chlorhexidine gel, G 3 - sodium <b>perborate</b> + 30 % hydrogen peroxide, G 4 - 30 % hydrogen peroxide, G 5 - 37 % carbamide peroxide and G 6 - gel base without carbamide. Two Control Groups were used: C 1 with distilled water and C 2 with 2 % chlorhexidine gel. The specimens were immersed in the respective test bleaching agent and incubated at 37 °C for seven days. Following, they were prepared for scanning electron microscopy and five images from each tooth segment were recorded and analyzed for surface morphological alterations, by three previously calibrated examiners. Inter-examiner agreement was verified using the Kappa test. The rank averages obtained for the groups were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance at 5 % significance level. Results: The analysis of the scores obtained indicated that all tested materials caused some morphological alteration on dentin, except for sodium <b>perborate</b> + water (G 1) and Control Groups 1 and 2.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The authors {{conducted}} an in vitro study {{to investigate the}} influence of several internal bleaching regimens on the composite-to-composite shear bond strength of a dental core buildup material. METHODS: The authors fabricated 72 specimens from a resin-based composite core buildup and assigned them randomly to six groups (four experimental and two control groups) (n = 12 per group), according to the following bleaching agents: sodium <b>perborate</b> mixed with distilled water (SP/W); sodium <b>perborate</b> mixed with 3 percent hydrogen peroxide (SP/HP- 3); sodium <b>perborate</b> mixed with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide (SP/HP- 30); 35 percent hydrogen peroxide (HP- 35). After the 12 -day bleaching procedures, the authors applied a calcium hydroxide dressing for two weeks. The two control groups consisted of unbleached specimens that either did not receive (C 1) or did receive (C 2) the calcium hydroxide dressing. The authors cleaned and silanized the resin-based composite specimens and coated them with an intermediate adhesive resin before applying fresh composite material. They measured composite surface roughness and shear bond strength and performed statistical analyses of the data. RESULTS: Unbleached specimens in groups C 1 and C 2 exhibited significantly lower composite-to-composite bond strength and significantly lower surface roughness than did specimens in groups SP/W and SP/HP- 3. Bond strength in group HP- 35 was significantly lower than that in group SP/W. CONCLUSION: Internal bleaching regimens that involve the use of sodium <b>perborate</b> mixed with water or 3 percent hydrogen peroxide might increase the composite-to-composite interfacial bond strength.
