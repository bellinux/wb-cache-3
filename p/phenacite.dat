It would make a promising ceramic {{if not for the}} difficulty of working with and sintering it: it is chemically near-totally inert, and even above 1000°C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. It is very hard (9 on the Mohs hardness scale), dissociates only at 1900°C at 1atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185g/cm3), because of its compact structure similar to that of <b>phenacite</b> (Be2SiO4). A similar refractory material is Si2N2O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450°C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si–O–Si linkages to each other.|$|E
2500|$|The orthosilicates MSiO (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO4 are neso-silicates. Be2SiO4 (<b>phenacite)</b> {{is rather}} unusual as both BeII and SiIV occupy {{tetrahedral}} four-coordinated sites; the other divalent cations instead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace {{each other as}} in olivine, (Mg,Fe,Mn)2SiO4. Zircon, ZrSiO4, demands eight-coordination of the ZrIV cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84pm). Also significant are the garnets, , in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe). Regular coordination is not always present: for example, it is not found in Ca2SiO4, which mixes six- and eight-coordinate sites for CaII. Soro-silicates, involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units, are quite rare: metasilicates involving cyclic [...] "2n−" [...] units of corner-abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known.|$|E

5000|$|Phenakite or <b>phenacite</b> is {{a fairly}} rare nesosilicate mineral {{consisting}} of beryllium orthosilicate, Be2SiO4. Occasionally used as a gemstone, phenakite occurs as isolated crystals, which are rhombohedral with parallel-faced hemihedrism, and are either lenticular or prismatic in habit: the lenticular habit {{is determined by the}} development of faces of several obtuse rhombohedra and the absence of prism faces. There is no cleavage, and the fracture is conchoidal. The Mohs hardness is high, being 7.5 - 8; the specific gravity is 2.96. The crystals are sometimes perfectly colorless and transparent, but more often they are greyish or yellowish and only translucent; occasionally they are pale rose-red. In general appearance the mineral is not unlike quartz, for which indeed it has been mistaken. It is used a gemstone. Its name comes from the Greek phenakos, meaning [...] "deceiver" [...] due to its close visual similarity to quartz.|$|E

While many features in energy-loss spectra are common to all of the ma-terials, remarkable extra intensity was observed for Forsterite.

For all compounds the Grüneisen parameter increases {{as a function of}} the reduced temperature approaching a constant value at high temperatures (T/ 0. 8). The high temperature limit of the Grüneisen parameter of the wurtzite type materials MgSiN 2 and AlN is about the same (0. 98 and 0. 95, respectively) whereas these are much higher than that of the <b>phenacite</b> -Si 3 N 4 (0. 63).

The structural type of this vanadate {{is characterized by}} a three-dimensional arrangement of tetrahedra sharing apices in an LiZnVO 4 network. This arrangement contains three different tetrahedra, namely one [VO 4] and two disordered mixed-site [Li/ZnO 4] tetrahedra. The resulting lattice gives rise to hexagonal channels running along the [0001] direction. Both sites in the mixed-site [Li/ZnO 4] tetrahedra are occupied by a statistical mixture of lithium and zinc with a 1 : 1 ratio. Therefore, LiZnVO 4 appears to be the first vanadate known to crystallize with a disordered <b>phenacite</b> structure. Moreover, the resulting values of calculated bond valences (Li = 1. 083, Zn = 2. 062 and V = 5. 185) tend to confirm the structural model...|$|E
40|$|The tin- bearing granites in the State of Goias, Brazil, form {{two groups}} of {{different}} ages: 1770 My for the Sucuri and Soledade massifs, 1658 - 1614 My. for the Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa and Serra Branca massifs. The geology of the province suggests that these granites were emplaced in a rift context. The Sucuri and Soledade massifs are emplaced in gneisses of Archean age, the others massifs are intrusive in the Serra da Mesa Group, a sedimentary formation composed of pelites and greywackes. This Group was metamorphosed in the amphibolite facies (kyanite- almandine- biotite paragenesis). According to several thermobarometric tools, the temperature was around 540 °C and the pressure between 5 and 7 kBar. The age of the sediments {{is supposed to be}} lower Proterozoic, in accordance with the age proposed for the Serra Dourada massif (1653 My [...] The Serra Dourada massif is composed of four rock types. The petrographic, mineralogic observations and geochemical data reveal a main trend, composed of an amphibole- bearing facies, a biotite- bearing facies, and a fine grained porphyritic facies.. Garnet- bearing granites do not show any relations with the main trend. The contents of these granites in Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La, Ga, and their MgO/TiO 2 ratio (around 1) {{are similar to those of}} the anorogenic granites of South Western United States and Gabo suite of Australia. However, niobium shows a compatible behaviour in Serra Dourada, in contrast to its incompatible behaviour in many anorogenic granites [...] . // [...] . The compositional variations of the beryllium minerals observed in skarns may be explained by the following processes : -either a late arrival of silica- rich solutions (high Si/Al ratio, presence of <b>phenacite</b> or helvite) within early formed alumina- rich parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl), - or a limited mobility of Al relatively to Si, which would induce a limited extension of the aluminous parageneses (musgravite, chrysoberyl). The activity of aluminum plays an essential role in the stability of the beryllium minerals : <b>phenacite</b> and/or helvite are stable when it is low, and beryl, chrysoberyl or musgravite when it is high. However, the increase of activity of other elements (Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, alkalis) that would induce the formation of minerals incorporating alumina (garnet or felspars) would be unfavourable to the formation of beryl. Helvite is thus typically stable in calcic skarns, and it is associated with <b>phenacite</b> in the rocks submitted to alkaline metasomatism. Beryl, on the contrary, normally appears when acidic fluids separates from highly evolved granitic magmas (aplopegmatitic stage). The zonation of helvite crystals in albitites (genthelvite core, danalite border) reflects the decrease of alkalinity of the fluids. This zonation on the crystal scale is also observed on the outcrop scale: helvite composition varies from Ge 64 Da 10 He 26 in the internal zone to Ge 23 Da 50 He 26, in the external zone. The same variation is observed in an albitized siderophyllite vein, from Ge 25 Da 42 He 33 in a slightly albitized zone to Ge 55 Da 39 He 22 in a highly albitized one. The formation of genthelvite is favoured, as compared with the other members of the helvite group, by alkaline conditions. The compositional variations of helvite in the Sucuri massif would result from variations in fs 2 and f 02, in the fluids. Genthelvite is stable under alkaline and oxidizing conditions. Les granites stannifères de l'état de Goias forment deux groupes d'âge different. Les massifs de Sucuri et de Soledade ont un âge de 1770 Ma et les massifs de Serra Dourada, Serra da Mesa et Serra Branca ont respectivement 1653, 1614 et 1658 Ma. La géologie de cette province conduit à situer la mise en place de ces granites dans la zone de Rift. Les éléments traces Nb, Y, Zr, Ce, La et Ga et le rapport MgO/TiO 2 sont comparables à ceux des granites anorogéniques du sud-ouest des Etats-Unis et de la suite de Gabo en Australie. Les valeurs faibles du rapport Zr/Hf (23 à 28) des massifs étudiés permettent d'exclure une origine directe par fusion partielle, le rapport crustal par fusion est compris entre 30 et 40. La zonalité minéralogique (bordure à biotite et coeur à pyroxène) des lentilles à pyroxène du gisement de Mata Azul (massif de Serra Dourada) traduit le caractère métasomatique de ces roches et rappelle celles des endoskarns. Les études pétrographiques, minéralogiques et géochimiques ont mis en évidence l'importance du rôle du calcium et de la fugacité d'oxygène. A l'exception des albitites, la majorité des zones métasomatiques et les veines minéralisées sont localisées dans la partie apicale du granite fin au nord du massif de Sucuri. Les minéraux du béryllium (béryl, <b>phénacite</b> et helvite) sont présents dans la veine à quartz-muscovite, dans la veine à sidérophyllite. dans l'albitite, seules la <b>phénacite</b> et l'helvite sont présentes. Les variations de composition des minéraux de l'helvite dans le massif de Sucuri résulteraient des variations de la fugacité de soufre et de celle de l'oxygène et de l'alcalinité à l'intérieur du fluide...|$|E

Upon compression at ambient temperature, the structure undergoes progressive distortion resulting in pressure-induced amorphisation or metastable crystal-crystal phase transformations. The spinel-structured -Ge 3 N 4 phase is stabilised under high pressure-high temperature conditions: it represents the first solid state compound containing Ge in octahedral coordination to nitrogen. The spectra in the XANES region are clearly correlated with changes in the local coordination geometry. Analysis of the EXAFS data gives bond lengths in excellent agreement with X-ray powder structure refinement. The XAS/EXAFS technique is a powerful method for studying the coordination and local structure in Ge-containing nitride and oxynitride materials synthesised at high pressure, including in situ studies in the diamond anvil cell.

40|$|Two rare metal leucocratic granites, Perga and Kamennaya complexes, can be distinquished on the Ukrainian shield. The Perga complex {{consists}} of medium- and coarse grained, mainly porphyric, biotite, riebeckite and aegirine granites, granite porphyries, microclinites and albitites with rare metal mineralization (genthelvite, <b>phenacite,</b> tantalite, cassiterite and wolframite etc.). Granites from several stocks (up to 30 km 2) {{in the northwestern}} part of the shield, situated along the fracture zone, restricted the large Korosten pluton of rapakivi granites to the northwest. The age of these granites (Pb-Pb and U-Pb methods on zircon and monazite) practically coincide with the age of rapakivi granites being 1750 Ma. Within the Korosten complex of rapakivi granites we consider that zinnwaldite granites, which are characterized by fluorite and topazine mineralization, represent {{the final phase of}} pluton. These granites differ from the Perga ones by their low content of rare metals. The Kamennaya Mogila complex lies in the southeastern part of the Ukrainian shield. It {{consists of}} biotite and muscovite-biotite, medium- and coarse-grained (also porphyric, and occasionally greisining) granites with rare metal mineralization (cassiterite, columbite, molybdenite, wolframite and beryl). Granites form several stocks (5 - 30 km 2) situated 10 - 30 km to the west-northwest of the South-Kalchik gabbro-syenite-granite pluton. Granitoids in both of these complexes have similar isotopic ages (1800 Ma). Leucocratic subalkaline granites (the Novoyanisol type) are known within the pluton itself, occupying an intermediate position between the above mentioned in terms of mineral and geochemical composition. The gabbro-syenite-granite formation of the Nearazov region has a substantial similarity to the anorthosite-rapakivi-granite formation. In this respect the relation of each of them to rare metal granites is rather remarkable. This relation is, most probably, not only spatial, but also genetic.

40|$|International audienceU-Pb and Th-Pb dating of {{monazite}} from hydrothermal quartz veins ("alpine veins") {{from the}} Lauzière massif (North Belledonne) together with Ar / Ar ages of adularias {{from the same}} veins constrain {{the age of the}} last tectono-metamorphic events that affected the External Crystalline Massifs (ECM). Ages obtained are surprisingly young. The study of the structural context of the veins combined with our chronological data, allow us to propose a tectonic scenario of the northern ECM for the 15 - 5 Ma period which was poorly documented so far. The quartz veins are of two types: - (i) the oldest are poorly mineralized (chlorite and epidote), flat-lying veins. The quartz fibres (= extension direction) are near vertical and seem to be associated with a subvertical dissolution schistosity superimposed upon an early alpine deformation underlined by "mini-biotite". They bear a sub-horizontal stretching lineation. - (ii) the youngest veins are very rich in various minerals (anatase, rutile, <b>phénacite,</b> meneghinite, beryl, synchysite, [...] ). They are almost vertical. Their "en echelon" geometry as well as the horizontal attitude of their quartz fibres show a dextral strike-slip regime. Two groups of Th-Pb ages have been obtained: 11 to 10 Ma and 7 to 5 Ma. They were obtained from the most recent veins (vertical veins) sampled in different areas of the massif. The ca. 10 Ma ages are related to veins in the Lauzière granite and its metamorphic country-rocks at about 2 km from the eastern contact of the massif, while the ages of ca. 5 Ma correspond to veins occurring in mylonites along this contact. Adularias provided Ar / Ar ages at ca. 7 Ma. By contrast, a monazite from a vein of the Pelvoux massif (Plan du Lac) yielded a Th-Pb age of 17. 6 Ma but in a different structural setting. Except fission track ages, there are very little ages of this range published in the recent literature on the Alps. The latter concern always gold mineralized veins (NE Mont Blanc and SW Lepontine dome). The last compressive tectonic regime dated between 15 and 12 Ma is coeval with (i) the late "Roselend thrust" event, which is recorded in the Mont Blanc by shear-zones with vertical lineation, (ii) the last movements in the basal mylonites of the Swiss Nappes, (iii) the horizontal Alpine veins from the Mont Blanc and Belledonne massifs (with vertical quartz fibres) which are similar to the early veins of the Lauzière. On the contrary, the vertical veins of the Lauzière, dated between 11 and 5 Ma, correspond to a dextral strike slip regime. This suggests that most of the strike-slip tectonics along the ECM took place during two stages (ca. 10 Ma and ca. 7 - 5 Ma) and not only at 18 Ma as had been proposed previously. Our ages are consistent with the late Miocene-Pliocene overlap of the Digne thrust to the South and to part of the normal movement along the Simplon fault to the North. Thus, all the external crystalline massifs were tectonically active during the late Miocene. This suggests that tectonic events in the external alpine belt may have contributed to some extent to the geodynamical causes of the Messinian crisis...|$|E
