5|$|Helium leaks through cracks {{should not}} be {{confused}} with gas <b>permeation</b> through a bulk material. While helium has documented <b>permeation</b> constants (thus a calculable <b>permeation</b> rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the <b>permeation</b> of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E
25|$|Some reports {{note that}} the use of gloves has not {{prevented}} <b>permeation</b> of aziridine. It is therefore important that users check the breakthrough <b>permeation</b> times for gloves, and pay scrupulous attention to avoiding contamination when degloving. Workers handling azidrine are expected to be provided with, and required to wear and use, a half-mask filter-type respirator for dusts, mists and fumes.|$|E
25|$|Membranes {{can also}} be used to {{separate}} ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process. This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor <b>permeation</b> or pervaporation mode. Vapor <b>permeation</b> uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{in cases}} {{involving}} topical therapeutics, the role of MSM as an active agent, per se, versus its having a role in promoting skin <b>permeation</b> (in manner, akin to its solvent relative DMSO) must be characterized/controlled.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruthless}} {{pursuit of}} Nazi aims {{turned out to}} mean not, as Rosenberg had hoped, the <b>permeation</b> of German life with the new ideology; it meant concentration of the combined resources of party and state on total war.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{the surface}} {{functionality}} of the cellulose nanoparticle can also affect the permeability of nanocellulose films. Films constituted of negatively charged cellulose nanowhiskers could effectively reduce <b>permeation</b> of negatively charged ions, while leaving neutral ions virtually unaffected. Positively charged ions {{were found to}} accumulate in the membrane.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} area {{of research}} {{has been on the}} use of plasma polymer films as <b>permeation</b> membranes. The permeability characteristics of plasma polymers deposited on porous substrates are different than usual polymer films. The characteristics depend on the deposition and polymerization mechanism. Plasma polymers as membranes for separation of oxygen and nitrogen, ethanol and water, and water vapor <b>permeation</b> have all been studied. The application of plasma polymerized thin films as reverse osmosis membranes has received considerable attention as well. Yasuda et al. have shown membranes prepared with plasma polymerization made from nitrogen containing monomers can yield up to 98% salt rejection with a flux of 6.4 gallons/ft2 a day. Further research has shown that varying the monomers of the membrane offer other properties as well, such as chlorine resistance.|$|E
25|$|THF {{is often}} used in polymer science. For example, {{it can be used}} to {{dissolve}} polymers prior to determining their molecular mass using gel <b>permeation</b> chromatography. THF dissolves PVC as well, and thus it is the main ingredient in PVC adhesives. It can be used to liquefy old PVC cement and {{is often used}} industrially to degrease metal parts.|$|E
25|$|Many socialist intellectuals, {{particularly}} those influenced by Christian socialism and similar {{notions of the}} ethical need for a restructuring of society, also saw the Liberals as the most obvious means for obtaining working-class representation. Within two years of its foundation in 1884, the gradualist Fabian Society officially committed itself to a policy of <b>permeation</b> of the Liberal Party.|$|E
25|$|Rameau was the {{greatest}} ballet composer of all times. The genius of his creation rests on one hand on his perfect artistic <b>permeation</b> by folk-dance types, {{on the other hand}} on the constant preservation of living contact with the practical requirements of the ballet stage, which prevented an estrangement between the expression of the body from the spirit of absolute music.|$|E
25|$|The permeabilities of plasma {{polymers}} {{also differ}} greatly {{from those of}} conventional polymers. Because {{of the absence of}} large-scale segmental mobility and the high degree of cross-linking within the polymers, the <b>permeation</b> of small molecules does not strictly follow the typical mechanisms of “solution-diffusion” or molecular-level sieve for such small permeants. Really the permeability characteristics of plasma polymers falls between these two ideal cases.|$|E
25|$|The International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning IRID in Japan and the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization KEK {{call the}} method they {{developed}} for Unit 1 the muon <b>permeation</b> method; 1,200 optical fibers for wavelength conversion light up when muons {{come into contact}} with them. After a month of data collection, it is hoped to reveal the location and amount of fuel debris still inside the reactor. The measurements began in February 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{enhanced}} performance {{may arise from}} a decrease in solvent <b>permeation</b> across the sealant due to {{the application of the}} polymer gel electrolyte. The polymer gel electrolyte is quasi-solid at room temperature, and becomes a viscous liquid (viscosity: 4.34 mPa·s) at 80°C compared with the traditional liquid electrolyte (viscosity: 0.91 mPa·s). The much improved stabilities of the device under both thermal stress and soaking with light has never before been seen in DSCs, and they match the durability criteria applied to solar cells for outdoor use, which makes these devices viable for practical application.|$|E
25|$|The main Mexican holiday is the Day of Independence, {{celebrated on}} September 16. Americans are more {{familiar}} with the Cinco de Mayo. Cinco de Mayo commemorates the date of the Battle of Puebla, in which Díaz participated, when a major victory was won against the French. Under the Porfiriato, the Mexican Consuls in the United States gave Cinco de Mayo more importance than the Day of Independence due to the President's personal involvement in the events. It is still widely celebrated in the United States, although largely due to cultural <b>permeation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compressed hydrogen, by comparison, {{is stored}} quite differently. Hydrogen gas has good energy density by weight, but poor energy density by volume versus hydrocarbons, hence it {{requires}} a larger tank to store. A large hydrogen tank will be heavier than the small hydrocarbon tank used to store {{the same amount of}} energy, all other factors remaining equal. Increasing gas pressure would improve the energy density by volume, making for smaller, but not lighter container tanks (see hydrogen tank). Compressed hydrogen costs 2.1% of the energy content to power the compressor. Higher compression without energy recovery will mean more energy lost to the compression step. Compressed hydrogen storage can exhibit very low <b>permeation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{pervaporation}} method uses a membrane {{that is more}} permeable to the one constituent than {{to another}} to separate the constituents of an azeotrope as it passes from liquid to vapor phase. The membrane is rigged to lie between the liquid and vapor phases. Another membrane method is vapor <b>permeation,</b> where the constituents pass through the membrane entirely in the vapor phase. In all membrane methods, the membrane separates the fluid passing through it into a permeate (that which passes through) and a retentate (that which is left behind). When the membrane is chosen so that is it more permeable to one constituent than another, then the permeate will be richer in that first constituent than the retentate.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{can also}} be found in the kidney. Although {{sulfatide}} is not necessary for the kidneys to maintain their function and structure, it does play an active role in different aspects of the kidney. For example, sulfatide is a ligand for L-selectin, which is a receptor that {{can be found in the}} kidneys. Specifically, L-selectin is a lymphoid receptor, and the binding between L-selectin and sulfatide in the kidney’s interstitium plays a major role in monocyte <b>permeation</b> and infiltration into the kidney. Additionally, sulfatide is also found in the glandular stomach epithelium and in the apical membranes of the distal kidney tubuli where Myelin and lymphocyte protein(MAL) is expressed. MAL forms complexes with sulfatide and other glycosphingolipids, and these complexes have been shown to play a role in apical sorting and stabilization of sphingoglycolipid enriched areas.|$|E
25|$|At Toyota’s Higashi-Fuji Technical Center, the Mirai {{has been}} {{subjected}} to extensive crash testing to evaluate a design specifically intended to address frontal, side and rear impacts and to provide excellent protection of vehicle occupants. A high level of collision safety has also been achieved to help protect the fuel cell stack and high-pressure tanks against body deformation. The high pressure hydrogen tanks have excellent hydrogen <b>permeation</b> prevention performance, strength, and durability. Hydrogen sensors provide warnings and can shut off tank main stop valves. The hydrogen tanks and other hydrogen-related parts are located outside the cabin to ensure that if hydrogen leaks, it will dissipate easily. The vehicle structure is enhanced with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers from Toray and designed to disperse and absorb impact energy across multiple parts to ensure a high-impact safety performance that protects the Toyota FC Stack and high-pressure hydrogen tanks during frontal, side or rear impacts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} to the Islamisation process in Southeast Asia. Another theory is trade. The expansion of trade among West Asia, India and Southeast Asia helped {{the spread of}} the religion as Muslim traders from Southern Yemen (Hadramout) brought Islam to the region with their large volume of trade. Many settled in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. This is evident in the Arab-Indonesian, Arab-Singaporean, and Arab-Malay populations who were at one time very prominent in each of their countries. The second theory is the role of missionaries or Sufis. The Sufi missionaries {{played a significant role in}} spreading the faith by introducing Islamic ideas to the region. Finally, the ruling classes embraced Islam and that further aided the <b>permeation</b> of the religion throughout the region. The ruler of the region's most important port, Malacca Sultanate, embraced Islam in the 15th century, heralding a period of accelerated conversion of Islam throughout the region as Islam provided a positive force among the ruling and trading classes.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the 1880s the Fabian Society {{remained}} small, {{its message}} of moderation frequently unheard among more strident voices. Its profile {{was raised in}} 1889 {{with the publication of}} Fabian Essays in Socialism, edited by Shaw who also provided two of the essays. The second of these, [...] "Transition", details the case for gradualism and <b>permeation,</b> asserting that [...] "the necessity for cautious and gradual change must be obvious to everyone". In 1890 Shaw produced Tract No. 13, What Socialism Is, a revision of an earlier tract in which Charlotte Wilson had defined socialism in anarchistic terms. In Shaw's new version, readers were assured that [...] "socialism can be brought about in a perfectly constitutional manner by democratic institutions".|$|E
500|$|The first {{preparation}} {{was reported}} in 1857 by Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and Friedrich Wöhler. [...] In their method, silicon was heated in a crucible placed inside another crucible packed with carbon to reduce <b>permeation</b> of oxygen to the inner crucible. [...] They reported a product they termed silicon nitride but without specifying its chemical composition. [...] Paul Schuetzenberger first reported a product with {{the composition of the}} tetranitride, [...] , in 1879 that was obtained by heating silicon with brasque (a paste made by mixing charcoal, coal, or coke with clay which is then used to line crucibles) in a blast furnace. [...] In 1910, Ludwig Weiss and Theodor Engelhardt heated silicon under pure nitrogen to produce [...] E. Friederich and L. Sittig made Si3N4 in 1925 via carbothermal reduction under nitrogen, that is, by heating silica, carbon, and nitrogen at 1250–1300°C.|$|E
500|$|El Greco's re-evaluation was {{not limited}} to scholars. According to Efi Foundoulaki, [...] "painters and theoreticians from the {{beginning}} of the 20th century 'discovered' a new El Greco but in process they also discovered and revealed their own selves". His expressiveness and colors influenced Eugène Delacroix and Édouard Manet. To the Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to rediscover. The first painter who appears to have noticed the structural code in the morphology of the mature El Greco was Paul Cézanne, one of the forerunners of cubism. Comparative morphological analyses of the two painters revealed their common elements, such as the distortion of the human body, the reddish and (in appearance only) unworked backgrounds and the similarities in the rendering of space. According to Brown, [...] "Cézanne and El Greco are spiritual brothers despite the centuries which separate them". Fry observed that Cézanne drew from [...] "his great discovery of the <b>permeation</b> of every part of the design with a uniform and continuous plastic theme".|$|E
500|$|The Proto-Germanic or Germanic {{cultures}} on Polish lands developed gradually and in {{a diverse}} way, beginning with the old local Lusatian and Pomeranian stock, influenced and augmented first by La Tène culture and the Celtic people, {{and then by the}} Jastorf culture and its tribes, which settled northwestern Poland beginning in the 4th century BC, and later migrated in the southeastern direction through and past the main stretch of Polish lands (mid-3rd century BC and afterwards). The disappearing Celtic people made a big impact in central Europe and left a lasting legacy. Their advanced culture catalyzed economic and other progress within the contemporary as well as future populations, which had often had little or no ethnic Celtic component. The archeological period is considered [...] "La Tène" [...] until the beginning of the Common Era. The beginnings of the powerful ascent of the Germanic people, who replaced the Celts, are not easy to discern (e.g. to what degree the Pomeranian culture lands became the Przeworsk culture lands by internal evolution, external population influx or just <b>permeation</b> by the new regional cultural trends).|$|E

Keeping the contents clean, fresh, sterile and safe {{for the duration of the}} intended shelf life is a primary function. A barrier is also implemented in cases where segregation of two materials prior to end use is required, as in the case of special paints, glues, medical fluids, etc. At the consumer end, the packaging barrier is broken or measured amounts of material are removed for mixing and subsequent end use.|$|E

2500|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC), {{also known}} as gel <b>permeation</b> chromatography or gel filtration chromatography, separates particles {{on the basis of}} molecular size (actually by a particle's Stokes radius). It is generally a low resolution chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, [...] "polishing" [...] step of the purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins. SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping these smaller molecules in the pores of a particle. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores as they are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column quicker than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} competing process uses membranes to desalt saline water, principally applying {{reverse osmosis}} (RO). The RO membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and applied [...] pressure (on the membrane feed side) to preferentially induce water <b>permeation</b> through the membrane while rejecting salts.

Desalination processes {{are driven by}} either thermal (e.g., distillation) or electrical (e.g., RO) as the primary energy types. Energy cost in desalination processes varies considerably depending on water salinity, plant size and process type. At present the cost of seawater desalination, for example, is higher than traditional water sources, but {{it is expected that}} costs will continue to decrease with technology improvements that include, but are not limited to, reduction in plants footprint, improvements to plant operation and optimization, more effective feed pretreatment, and lower cost energy sources.|$|E
