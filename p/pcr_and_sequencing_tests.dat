40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to confirm the {{existence}} of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae carrying the blaNDM- 1 gene in clinics in Hainan province, China. Collected clinical bacterial isolates that were Enterobacteriaceae strains suspected of producing carbapen-emase were used as experimental strains. Drug resistance to imipenem, meropenem and other antibacterial agents was tested. Imipenem/imipenem inhibitor (IP/IPI) E-testing was conducted to identify the bacterial strains that produced metallo-β-lactamases. The blaNDM- 1 drug resistance gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (<b>PCR),</b> <b>and</b> agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) <b>and</b> <b>sequencing</b> were conducted to identify the products. The species of the strains carrying the blaNDM- 1 gene were determined using a biochemical identification system. Through the IP/IPI E-test, 21 of the 30 collected Enterobacteriaceae strains were found to be positive, indicating that 70 % of the strains produced metallo-β-lactamases. Following blaNDM- 1 gene <b>PCR</b> amplification, AGE <b>and</b> <b>sequencing</b> <b>tests</b> confirmed that nine of the strains carried the blaNDM- 1 drug resistance gene. The biochemical identification system indicated that four of the strains were Klebsiella pneumoniae, two were Escherichia coli, two were Enterobacter cloacae and one was Enterobacter aerogenes. Drug susceptibility testing in vitro demonstrated that the strains were 100 % resistant to a broad spectrum antibiotic plus lactamase inhibitor, cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, they had high sensitivity rates to polymyxin B and tigecycline of 100 and 88. 9 %, respectively. The sensitivity rate to amikacin was also high at 77. 8 %, whereas sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and genta-micin was moderate at rates of 44. 4 and 33. 3 % respectively. This clinical study of Enterobacteriaceae strains that carry the blaNDM- 1 gene in Hainan shows a bacterial tolerance that is different from that in previous studies, which requires further in-depth study...|$|R
40|$|Acanthamoeba- {{bacteria}} interactions enable pathogenic {{bacteria to}} tolerate harsh conditions {{and lead to}} transmission to the susceptible host. The present study was aimed to address the presence of bacterial endosymbionts of Acanthamoeba isolated from recreational water sources of Tehran, Iran. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this is the first study regarding occurrence of bacteria in environmental Acanthamoeba spp. in Iran. A total of 75 samples of recreational water sources were collected. Samples were cultured on non- nutrient agar 1. 5 % plates. Positive Acanthamoeba spp. were axenically grown. DNA extraction <b>and</b> <b>PCR</b> reaction was performed using JDP 1 - 2 primers. All positive samples of Acanthamoeba were examined for the presence of endosymbionts using staining and molecular methods. The PCR products were then sequenced in order to determine the genotypes of Acanthamoeba and bacteria genera. Out of 75 samples, 16 (21. 3 %) plates were positive for Acanthamoeba according to the morphological criteria. Molecular analysis revealed that Acanthamoeba belonged to T 4 and T 5 genotypes. Five isolates (35. 7 %) were positive for bacterial endosymbionts using staining method <b>and</b> <b>PCR</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Sequencing</b> of PCR products confirmed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Agrobacterium tumefasiens. The presence of Acanthamoeba bearing pathogenic endosymbionts in water sources leads us to public health issues including improved sanitation and decontamination measures in recreational water sources in order to prevent amoebae-related infection. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report regarding the isolation of A. tumefasiens from Acanthamoeba in Iran and worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objective: Shigella are Gram {{negative}} bacteria {{capable of}} inducing their entry into non-phagocytic cells via secretion of various effector proteins called invasion plasmid antigens (Ipas). The {{most important of}} them is VirG protein. Live attenuated Shigella vaccines have indicated promise in inducing protective immune responses in human clinical trials. In current situation, constructions of Shigella vaccine candidate strains based on classical allelic exchange systems are considered. The aim {{of this research was}} engineered and constructed pDS 132 ::∆virG as a suicide plasmid for targeted deletion regions of virG gene by using allele exchange method in Shigella flexneri 2 a. Method & Materials: In this applied study, species and serotype of shigella was confirmed by using serological and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests. Detection primers of virG gene were designed and cloned to pGEM- 5 zf vector <b>and</b> finally, <b>sequencing</b> was done. According to virG restriction enzyme map, 1751 bp of virG gene was removed by using of HincП restriction enzyme and the ∆virG was successfully constructed. The pGEM∆virG vector was digested by use of SphI and SalI enzymes and then cloned to pSD 132 as suicide vector. Precision of process were verified through phenotype and genotype experiment. Results: The Shigella flexneri type 2 a strain was verified by serological <b>and</b> <b>PCR</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Sequence</b> of the virG gene in native strain was sequentially identical with the strains submitted in the Gene-Bank database. Since the pDS 132 ::∆virG contains 1484 bp which derived from virG gene, therefore, it can be utilized for interference in virG gene as specific suicide vector in shigella flexneri 2 a. Conclusion: Application of suicide systems facilitated mutant construction in more specific and effective method in comparison with the other early techniques such as serial passage...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{microbiological}} diagnostic procedures depends on pre-analytic conditions. We compared {{the results of}} 16 S rRNA gene <b>PCR</b> <b>and</b> <b>sequencing</b> from automatically incubated blood culture materials from tropical Ghana {{with the results of}} cultural growth after automated incubation. Real-time 16 S rRNA gene <b>PCR</b> <b>and</b> subsequent <b>sequencing</b> were applied to 1500 retained blood culture samples of Ghanaian patients admitted to a hospital with an unknown febrile illness after enrichment by automated culture. Out of all 1500 samples, 191 were culture-positive and 98 isolates were considered etiologically relevant. Out of the 191 culture-positive samples, 16 S rRNA gene <b>PCR</b> <b>and</b> <b>sequencing</b> led to concordant results in 65 cases at species level and an additional 62 cases at genus level. PCR was positive in further 360 out of 1309 culture-negative samples, sequencing results of which suggested etiologically relevant pathogen detections in 62 instances, detections of uncertain relevance in 50 instances, and DNA contamination due to sample preparation in 248 instances. In two instances, PCR failed to detect contaminants from the skin flora that were culturally detectable. Pre-analytical errors caused many Enterobacteriaceae to be missed by culture. Potentially correctable pre-analytical conditions and not the fastidious nature of the bacteria caused most of the discrepancies. Although 16 S rRNA gene <b>PCR</b> <b>and</b> <b>sequencing</b> in addition to culture led to an increase in detections of presumably etiologically relevant blood culture pathogens, the application of this procedure to samples from the tropics was hampered by a high contamination rate. Careful interpretation of diagnostic results is required...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceBackground. Many {{soldiers}} in Napoleon's Grand Army died {{of infectious diseases}} during its retreat from Russia. Because soldiers were commonly infested with body lice, it has been speculated that louse-borne infectious diseases, such as epidemic typhus (caused by Rickettsia prowazekii), were common. Methods. We investigated this possibility during recent excavations of a mass grave of Napoleon's {{soldiers in}} Vilnius, Lithuania. Segments of 5 body lice, identified morphologically and by polymerase chain reaction (<b>PCR)</b> amplification <b>and</b> <b>sequencing,</b> were found in earth from the grave that also contained fragments of soldiers' uniforms. Results. DNA of Bartonella quintana (the agent of trench fever) was identified by <b>PCR</b> <b>and</b> <b>sequencing</b> in 3 of the lice. Similarly, <b>PCR</b> <b>and</b> <b>sequencing</b> of dental pulp from the remains of 35 soldiers revealed DNA of B. quintana in 7 soldiers and DNA of R. prowazekii in 3 other soldiers. Conclusions. Our results show that louse-borne infectious diseases affected nearly one-third of Napoleon's soldiers buried in Vilnius and indicate that these diseases {{might have been a}} major factor in the French retreat from Russia...|$|R
