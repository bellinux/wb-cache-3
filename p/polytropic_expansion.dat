40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pressure}} drops {{on the performance}} characteristics of the air standard Otto cycle are reported. The pressure drops are assumed as constant values independent of the engine size. It {{has been shown that}} the pressure drops to about 60 % of the maximum pressure in the ideal cycle (Curto-Risso et al., 2008). Three different models are studied: constant pressure model, reversible adiabatic expansion model and <b>polytropic</b> <b>expansion</b> model. The findings of this study show that, at this level of pressure drop, the maximum efficiency of the Otto cycle is reduced by 15 % approximately based on the constant pressure model. The combined effect of pressure drop with other modes of irreversibility, for example, internal irreversibility and heat leaks, could reduce the maximum efficiency into very low values (approximately 30 %). The reversible adiabatic model predicts reduction of 13 % in efficiency at 40 % pressure drop levels but at the price of zero power production. On the other hand, the <b>polytropic</b> <b>expansion</b> model predicts 40 % reduction in efficiency for the same level of pressure drop (40 %). All three models show that the power output is very sensitive to pressure drop...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of fluid film compressibility on the performance of fluid film bearings. A new version of the Reynolds equation was developed, using a <b>polytropic</b> <b>expansion,</b> for both steady-state and dynamic conditions. Polytropic exponents from 1 (isothermal) to 1000 (approaching an incompressible liquid) were evaluated for two bearing numbers, selected from a range of practical interest for cryogenic application, and without cavitation. Bearing loads were insensitive to fluid compressibility for low bearing numbers, as was expected. The effect of compressibility on attitude angle was significant, even when the bearing number was low. A small amount of fluid compressibility was enough to obtain stable running conditions. Incompressible liquid lacked stability at all conditions. Fluid compressibility can be used to control the bearing dynamic coefficients, thereby influencing the dynamic behavior of the rotor-bearing system...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the years}} many {{investigations}} of the gas temperature at the exhaust valve have been made. Nevertheless the modeling of the gas temperature still remains an unsolved problem. This master thesis approaches the problem by attempting to model the exhaust gas temperature by using the standard sensors equipped in SI engines, together with an in-cylinder pressure sensor which is {{needed in order to}} develop certain models. The concept in the master thesis is based upon a parameterization of the ideal Otto cycle with tuning parameters which all have physical meanings. Input variables required for the parameterization model is obtained from a fix point iteration method. This method was developed in order to improve the estimates of residual gas fraction, residual gas temperature and variables dependent of those, such as temperature at intake valve closing. The mean value model of the temperature, at the exhaust valve, is based upon the assumption of the ideal gas law, and that the burned gases undergoe a <b>polytropic</b> <b>expansion</b> into the exhaust manifold. Input variables to the entire model are intake manifold pressure, exhaust manifold pressure, intake manifold temperature, engine speed, air mass flow, cylinder pressure, air-to-fuel equivalence ratio, volume, and ignition timing. A useful aspect with modeling the exhaust gas temperature is the possibility to implement it in turbo modeling. By modeling the exhaust gas temperature the control of the turbo can be enhanced, {{due to the fact that}} energy is temperature dependent. Another useful aspect with the project is that the model can be utilized in diagnostics, to avoid hardware redundency in the creation of the desired residuals...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{to simulate the}} steady- and dynamic-state behaviour of an existing water-to-water electric-motor driven heat-pump has been evolved. The condenser area on the working fluid side has been divided into two sections: namely, condensing section and sub-cooling section, while the evaporator area has been divided into an evaporating section and a superheating section. The compression has been assumed to be <b>polytropic</b> and the <b>expansion</b> isenthalpic. ...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} strategies, such as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI), {{have been}} identified as one method to achieve future emissions and fuel economy regulations for diesel engines. These advanced combustion strategies require precise inputs to the combustion process to maintain stable combustion, maximize fuel efficiency, and minimize emissions. Given that the inputs to the combustion process can be considered outputs of the gas exchange process, an accurate understanding of the dynamics of the gas exchange process is critical to accurate control of the combustion process. ^ The work presented in this thesis focuses on modeling for estimation and the estimation of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) flow. In the process of developing a candidate estimation strategy for the EGR flow, extensive efforts were focused on the development of a physically-based, control-oriented, gas exchange model; specifically, the development of an exhaust enthalpy model for application in the gas exchange model. The exhaust enthalpy model is utilized to determine the temperature of gas flow out of the cylinder. This is accomplished by first determining the conditions in the cylinder when the intake valve close (IVC) then assuming a polytropic compression process to top dead center (TDC). To maintain simplicity in the model, fuel injection is neglected, and it is assumed that combustion begins at TDC in a constant pressure process until the end of combustion (EOC). Upon completion of combustion, the expansion process is modeled as a <b>polytropic</b> <b>expansion</b> process until the exhaust valves open (EVO). The proposed model for exhaust gas enthalpy was extensively experimentally validated against 193 data points and is shown to accurately predict the exhaust gas temperature, generally well within 10 % error. ^ Ultimately, the gas exchange model, including the exhaust gas enthalpy model, was utilized in the development of an estimation strategy for EGR flow. The estimation strategy utilizes the exhaust manifold pressure state equation and feedback from the exhaust manifold pressure sensor, as well as models of the EGR flow, charge flow, and turbine flow to estimate the EGR flow. Preliminary validation of the estimator has been accomplished utilizing both the gas exchange model and GT-POWER simulations, with the results demonstrating that with accurate models for charge flow and turbine flow, the estimator can accurately predict the EGR flow. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{expansion}} {{of a gas}} within a piston-cylinder arrangement is studied {{in order to obtain}} {{a better understanding of the}} heat transfer which occurs during this process. While the situation of heat transfer during the {{expansion of}} a gas has received considerable attention, the process is still not very well understood. In particular, the time dependence of heat transfer has not been well studied, with many researchers instead focused on average heat transfer rates. Additionally, many of the proposed models are not in agreement with each other and are usually dependent on experimentally determined coefficients which have been found to vary widely between test geometries and operating conditions. Therefore, the expansion process is analyzed in order to determine a model for the time dependence of heat transfer during the expansion. A model is developed for the transient heat transfer by assuming that the expansion behaves in a polytropic manner. This leads to a heat transfer model written in terms of an unknown polytropic exponent, n. By examining the physical significance of this parameter, it is proposed that the polytropic exponent can be related to a ratio of the time scales associated with the expansion process, such as a characteristic Peclet number. Experiments are conducted to test the proposed heat transfer model and to establish a relationship for the polytropic exponent. The tests are performed using an apparatus that consists of a single piston-cylinder, which allows for pressure-volume data to be collected during the expansion of a hot gas. These experiments justify the <b>polytropic</b> <b>expansion</b> assumption, and from these results models are developed for the polytropic exponent. Heat transfer data are also collected from these experiments through applying an energy balance on the gas during expansion. These heat transfer data are used to compare the Nusselt number predicted by the proposed model with the experimentally determined Nusselt number. It is found that the proposed model agrees very well with the experimental data, and accurately captures the time dependence of the heat transfer characteristics. The proposed model also accurately handles variations in the heat transfer characteristics due to the different test conditions studied. By capturing the transient effects of heat transfer during the expansion process, the proposed model should be a more accurate tool in determining heat loss during the expansion of a gas than previously developed models...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{prototype}} external heat engine based on the Ericsson cycle, {{as an alternative to the}} internal combustion engine, to be used as a small-scale power source for rural Africa. Subsequently test and evaluate its viability and potential to fulﬁl the requirements of such an application. Despite the wide range of possible prime movers, it appears there is still a need for a simple, low-tech, low-output power plant for developing countries. This created an opportunity to revisit the origins of basic engine design in order to seek an alternative solution to the modern internal combustion engine. The hot air or external heat engine developed in the l 800 's provides an attractive alternative as it has a number of advantages over the modem internal combustion engine. A hot air engine is a cyclical heat engine that uses an external heat source, heat exchangers, pistons and a gaseous working ﬂuid contained within the engine to convert heat to mechanical work by volumetric expansion. The project looked at old and new engines in an attempt to capture the best of both. Two experimental engines were constructed during the course of this project, the ﬁrst engine was built to provide insight into the functioning of an unconventional external heat engine and to test the validity of theoretical predictions made using a thermodynamic computer model. This engine was designed to function off a cycle consisting of a polytropic compression, a <b>polytropic</b> <b>expansion</b> with heat addition and a constant volume heat rejection process, achieved using a two-stroke principal to exchange the hot exhaust gas with cold recharge gas. Based on experience gained from this model, the second generation engine was designed to circumvent the problems experienced with the ﬁrst engine. It functioned off a near Ericsson cycle, with the compression and expansion truncated for practical purposes and valve control being achieved with solenoid valves controlled by a computer. A thermodynamic computer model similar to the one used for the first engine was employed to optimise the design of this engine. Experimental investigations were carried out with the Ericsson engine to examine how closely the actual cycle resembled that predicted by the thermodynamic model and to determine engine performance. The power and mean effective pressure produced by the engine were determined and compared with friction data. Hence the potential of this engine to meet the criteria necessary to function as a small-scale rural power source was judged and resultant conclusions as to the engines feasibility were drawn. The actual pressure-volume diagrams obtained closely conformed to the theoretical expectations for the cycle and the truncated Ericsson cycle functioned sufficiently well. However, the friction in the system was too high a percentage of the total engine output and therefore the engine was unable to operate unaided. Although the hot air engine has the potential to provide cheap power efﬁciently, in practice these engines need to be highly pressurised and run at temperatures close to their material limit in order to obtain useful work from them. Therefore, although with the use of low friction seals and high pressurisation the engine could potentially produce the 5 kW design target, due to the complexity these efforts would add to the engine it is recommended that other options be explored for rural power generation in Africa...|$|E
