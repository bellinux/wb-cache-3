It, like nearly all these philosophies, has an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices for what Hinduism considers four <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of life: virtue (dharma), material prosperity (artha), desire (kama) and the fourth and final aim being moksha, the spiritual liberation or release from cycles of rebirth (samsara). Traditional Advaita Vedanta centers on the study of the sruti especially the Principal Upanishads, along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
6000|$|I use {{the word}} [...] "colouring" [...] without {{reference}} to any particular vehicle of colour, for the laws of good painting are the same, whatever liquid is employed to dissolve the pigments. But the technical management of oil is more difficult than that of water-colour, and the impossibility of using it with safety among books or prints, and its unavailableness for note-book sketches and memoranda, are sufficient reasons for not introducing it in a course of practice intended chiefly for students of literature. On the contrary, in the exercises of artists, oil should be the vehicle of colour employed from the first. The extended practice of water-colour painting, as a separate skill, is in every way harmful to the arts: its pleasant slightness and plausible dexterity divert {{the genius of the}} painter from its <b>proper</b> <b>aims,</b> and withdraw the attention of the public from excellence of higher claim; nor ought any man, who has the consciousness of ability for good work, to be ignorant of, or indolent in employing, the methods of making its results permanent as long as the laws of Nature allow. It is surely a severe lesson to us in this matter, that the best works of Turner could not be shown to the public for six months without being destroyed,--and that his most ambitious ones for the most part perished, even before they could be shown. I will break through my law of reticence, however, so far as to tell you that I have hope of one day interesting you greatly (with the help of the Florentine masters), {{in the study of the}} arts of moulding and painting porcelain; and to induce some of you to use your future power of patronage in encouraging the various branches of this art, and turning the attention of the workmen of Italy from the vulgar tricks of minute and perishable mosaic to the exquisite subtilties of form and colour possible in the perfectly ductile, afterwards unalterable clay. And one of the ultimate results of such craftsmanship might be the production of pictures as brilliant as painted glass,--as delicate as the most subtle water-colours, and more permanent than the Pyramids.|$|E

50|$|The Ashramas {{system is}} one {{facet of the}} complex Dharma concept in Hinduism. It is {{integrated}} {{with the concept of}} Purushartha, or four <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of life in Hindu philosophy, namely, Dharma (piety, morality, duties), Artha (wealth, health, means of life), Kama (love, relationships, emotions) and Moksha (liberation, freedom, self-realization). Each of the four Ashramas of life are a form of personal and social environment, each stage with ethical guidelines, duties and responsibilities, for the individual and for the society. Each Ashrama stage places different levels of emphasis on the four proper goals of life, with different stages viewed as steps to the attainment of the ideal in Hindu philosophy, namely Moksha.|$|E
5000|$|Hindu {{literature}} variously discuss ethics as {{one or more}} of four topics: (1) Gunas that is inner {{tendencies of}} conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) Purushartha that is <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of life for every individual for self-development and happiness (dharma, artha, kama and moksha); (3) Ashramas that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) Varnasramas that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society. Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism. Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes: (1) ethics {{is an essential part of}} dharma concept, (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible, and (3) Ethics cannot always be dualistically or non-dualistically reduced from first principles, ethics is closely related to moksha (self realization and spiritual freedom) with Vivekacudamani stating, [...] "individuals with self knowledge and spiritual freedom are inherently self examining and ethical" [...] and [...] "ethics, freedom and knowledge require each other". In addition to the above four topics in Hindu ethics, scholars state that the karma doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.|$|E

5000|$|In chapter 2, Aristotle {{asserts that}} there is one highest aim, eudaimonia (traditionally {{translated}} as [...] "happiness"), and it must be the same as the aim politics should have, because what is best for an individual is less beautiful (kalos) and divine (theios) than what is good for a people (ethnos) or city (polis). Politics rules over practical life so the <b>proper</b> <b>aim</b> of politics should include the <b>proper</b> <b>aim</b> of all other pursuits, so that [...] "this end would be the human good (tanthrōpinon agathon)". The human good is a practical target, and contrasts with Plato's references to [...] "the Good itself".

40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{development in}} the fields of biomedicine and the diffusion of sophisticated technologies has led to a rethinking of medical practice. In particular, human enhancement makes this re-examination urgent because in general it refers to enhancing healthy human beings with medical means to improve their abilities and traits. In other words, through human enhancement there is an application of medical knowledge and technologies to issues that are not originally thought as medical ones: medicine is not simply used to overcome biological pathologies, but to actually improve human capacities. Nevertheless, {{it would be wrong to}} exclusively explore this aspect within the conversation about the <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of medical practice, neglecting the purposes of society. Indeed, medicine does not exist in isolation and it must be in dialogue with the society it serves. If that is true, what kind of relationship can be established between the <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of medicine and the purposes of society? Is there any order of priority? Should medicine be constantly redefined on the basis of social needs/desires? To discuss these issues, the paper is developed in three stages: first, by focusing on the therapy/enhancement distinction and its limitations; second, by referring to the ends/goals of medicine distinction proposed by Edmund D. Pellegrino; third, by analysing the latter distinction as regards the debate on human enhancement...|$|E
40|$|Rather than {{appealing}} to penal parsimony as a constraint on the otherwise insatiable {{demands of the}} criminal justice system, we should develop a positive account of the <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of criminal law which shows parsimony, or moderation, to be integral to those aims. We can do this by developing a republican conception of criminal law as a law that citizens impose on themselves: such a law will be modest in its scope, and will provide a criminal process of trial and punishment that addresses those subjected to it with the respect due to them as citizens...|$|E

The Riksbank, left with the task of implementing this policy, turned to three renowned economists for advice, Gustav Cassel, David Davidson and Eli Heckscher.

One that has been very little studied is the interrogation. In this analysis, interrogation is classified as a subspecies of information-seeking dialogue, and the goals, conversational rules, participants, and techniques of the interrogation are identified. The result is a normative model of the interrogation. A main problem addressed is whether argumentation in the model can be correct in the model, or should be evaluated as inherently negative.

40|$|At {{the moment}} that “incentives” for {{creation}} meet “preferences” for the same, the economic account of copyright loses its explanatory power. This piece explores {{the ways in which}} the desire to create can be excessive, beyond rationality, and free from the need for economic incentive. Psychological and sociological concepts can do more to explain creative impulses than classical economics. As a result, a copyright law that treats creative activity as a product of economic incentives can miss the mark and harm what it aims to promote. The idea of abundance—even overabundance—in creativity can help define the proper scope of copyright law, especially in fair use. I explore these ideas by examining how creators think about what they do. As it turns out, commercially and critically successful creators resemble creators who avoid the general marketplace and create unauthorized derivative works (fanworks). The role of love, desire, and other passions in creation has lessons for the <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of copyright, the meaning of fair use, and conceptions of exploitation in markets...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to articulate the <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> and limits of political philosophy by expanding upon John Rawls’s idea of a realistic utopia and applying it to various debates in contemporary political philosophy. First, I defend the importance of ideal theory in constructing a theory of justice and respond to various critics, such as Amartya Sen and others, who argue that ideal theory is neither necessary nor sufficient for our work to advance justice in society. Second, I argue that empirical facts must be included in our reasoning about fundamental principles of justice, contrary to theorists such as G. A. Cohen who argues that political theorizing should proceed independently of such facts. Finally, I conclude with some reflecting thoughts {{on the importance of}} articulating a conception of justice that avoids hopelessly utopian ideals. In doing so, I defend the vision of a realistically utopian society as one that both answers our most fundamental interests and also provides us with the best chance of realizing justice in the world. ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{democratic}} society, schools must go beyond teaching fundamental skills. Public {{schools in the}} United States today are under enormous pressure to show—through improved test scores—that they are providing every student with a thorough and efficient education. The stated intention of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is to accomplish this goal and reverse years of failure to educate many of our inner-city and minority children. But even if we accept that the motives behind NCLB are benign, the law seems fatally flawed. Some critics have declared NCLB an unfunded mandate because it makes costly demands without providing the resources to meet them. Others point to its bureaucratic complexity; its unattainable main goal (100 percent of students proficient {{in reading and math}} by 2014); its motivationally undesirable methods (threats, punishments, and per-nicious comparisons); its overdependence on standardized tests; its demoralizing effects; and its corrupting influences on administrators, teachers, and students. All these criticisms are important, but NCLB has a more funda-mental problem: its failure to address, or even ask, the basic questions raised in this issue of Educational Leadership: What are the <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of education? How do public schools serve {{a democratic}} society? What does it mean to educate the whole child...|$|E
40|$|In {{at least}} some of their forms, Cost-Benefit {{techniques}} for the evaluation of environmental projects and policies treat the preferences of citizens as the sole determinants of the value of outcomes. There are two salient ways in which this supposition might be defended. The first is metaethical and appeals to considerations about how we must understand talk of environmental and other values. The second is political and appeals to considerations about democratic legitimacy and the <b>proper</b> <b>aims</b> of public policy. Metaethical considerations, I argue, are something of a red herring here. Roughly subjectivist understandings of our talk of values may be appealingly metaphysically unassuming, but in their most plausible formulations they do not support a view of preferences as the sole determinants of value. Political considerations, on the other hand, are to be taken very seriously. They offer, however, no straightforward rationale for any crudely preferentialist measure of social value. Findings obtained from the use of cost-benefit techniques might sometimes have a legitimate role as an input into, but not as a substitute for, political deliberation. Questions about the scope and limits of such legitimacy are properly addressed in political and not in metaethical terms. ethics, social philosophy, value, preference, cost-benefit analysis...|$|E

50|$|The {{solution}} was automation, {{in the form}} of a mechanical computer, the Kerrison Predictor.
