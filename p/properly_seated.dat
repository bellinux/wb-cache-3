25|$|It was {{believed}} that the leak was in the crossfeed flange area – a problem with associated seals. On 18 October 2010, after an afternoon review, engineers were asked to double-check the torque on six bolts around the suspected leaky flange fitting and tighten if necessary. Subsequent leak tests showed again signs of seepage, and the task of solving the issue required the draining of {{both the left and}} right OMS tanks of the shuttle and a unique in-situ repair at the pad to avoid a rollback. On 23 October 2010, engineers completed the removal and replacement of the two seals on the right OMS crossfeed flange, after the education (a vacuum-related procedure, used to completely clear the plumbing of the toxic MMH) of the plumbing was completed ahead of the schedule by over a day. Later, testing indicated that the new seals were <b>properly</b> <b>seated</b> and holding pressure with no signs of additional seepage. Normal pad operations commenced soon after allowing managers to press forward with the confirmation of a 1 November 2010 target launch date, with fuel reloading into the OMS tanks beginning on the morning of 24 October 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Priming {{the case}} is the most {{dangerous}} step of the loading process, since the primers are pressure-sensitive. The use of safety glasses or goggles during priming operations can provide valuable protection in the rare event that an accidental detonation takes place. Seating a Boxer primer not only places the primer in the case, it also seats the anvil of the primer down onto the priming compound, in effect arming the primer. A correctly seated primer will sit slightly {{below the surface of the}} case. A primer that protrudes from the case may cause a number of problems, including what is known as a slam fire, which is the firing of a case before the action is properly locked when chambering a round. [...] This may either damage the gun, and/or injure the shooter. [...] A protruding primer will also tend to hang when feeding, and the anvil will not be seated correctly so the primer may not fire when hit by the firing pin. [...] Primer pockets may need to be cleaned with a primer pocket brush to remove deposits that prevent the primer from being <b>properly</b> <b>seated.</b> [...] Berdan primers must also be seated carefully, and since the anvil is part of the case, the anvil must be inspected before the primer is seated.

Instead, a set of minor changes were made, intended to ensure that the latches were <b>properly</b> <b>seated</b> and the locking handle could not be operated if they weren't. These changes were limited to strengthening some of the locking system's parts, and adding a small window to allow handlers to visually inspect the latches.

50|$|Occupational {{therapists}} and physical therapists {{are involved in}} helping children with RTT function optimally at school. One of their primary concerns is regarding the child’s seating and positioning in the school environment. As RTT highly impacts a child physically, they often require customized seating, whether {{it is in the}} form of a wheelchair or customized chair and desk combinations. The OT or PT consults and provides the equipment necessary to make children stable and comfortable in their seats. This helps children with RTT focus on learning and classroom activities, instead of expending energy trying to stay seated upright and balanced. Ultimately, being <b>properly</b> <b>seated</b> may facilitate increased social skills; this is because a child is now able to maintain eye contact with their peers, look around the classroom, and engage with their social environment.|$|E

50|$|The 30-round {{magazines}} introduced for {{use with}} the selective-fire M2 Carbine would not be reliably retained by the magazine catch made for the original M1 Carbine {{which was designed to}} retain a 15-round magazine, so the much heavier (when loaded) 30-round magazine would not be <b>properly</b> <b>seated</b> in the M1 Carbine magazine well. The loaded 30-round magazine would typically cant (impairing feed reliability) or even fall out, which helps explain why the 30-round magazines have a poor reliability record (they are also more prone to damage due to their added length and weight when loaded as thin steel is used to make them). Thus early production M1 Carbines must be fitted with the type IV magazine catch used on the M2 Carbine (and late production M1 Carbines) {{if it is to be}} used with 30-round magazines. The type IV magazine catch will have a leg on the left side to correspond with the additional nub on the 30-round magazines. It is also desirable to load 30-round magazines with only 25 rounds to protect their springs from metal fatigue, which can occur if they are left fully loaded for long periods.|$|E
50|$|A sample bailer is {{generally}} around a meter long, {{and has a}} hollow tube (the barrel) usually around 40 mm in diameter, with a 'ball check' {{on the bottom and}} an opening at the top. This tool is beat downwards into the as yet unknown obstruction using the mechanical jars and weight above of the wireline toolstring. Generally, after a predetermined amount of 'hits', hopefully allowing a usable sample of solids to fill the barrel. When the tool is pulled upwards, the solids usually (hopefully) settle the ball check onto its 'seat', which will keep the solids in the barrel during the return trip to surface, where the solids can be inspected to determine what the downhole obstruction was. This procedure can be 'hit and miss', the success depending on how readily the solid was accepted into the barrel, and if the ball check was <b>properly</b> <b>seated</b> on the return trip to surface. If the ball check is not seated (sometimes a large, hard piece of solid will sit in between the ball and seat) downhole fluids tend to 'wash' the sample out of the bottom of the sample bailer, leaving the inspectors at surface wondering if the tool actually collected a sample. Persistence {{is generally}} a good rule of thumb with this tool.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{weapon of}} {{practically}} all cataphract forces throughout history was the lance. Cataphract lances (known in Greek as a Kontos ("oar") or in Latin as a Contus) appeared {{much like the}} Hellenistic armies' sarissae used by the famed Greek phalanxes as an anti-cavalry weapon. They were roughly four meters in length, with a capped point made of iron, bronze, or even animal bone and usually wielded with both hands. Most had a chain attached to the horse's neck {{and at the end}} by a fastening attached to the horse's hind leg, which supported the use of the lance by transferring the full momentum of a horse's gallop to the thrust of the charge. Though they lacked stirrups, the traditional Roman saddle had four horns with which to secure the rider; enabling a soldier to stay seated upon the full impact. During the Sassanid era, the Persian military developed ever more secure saddles to [...] "fasten" [...] the rider to the horse's body, much like the later knightly saddles of Medieval Europe.

50|$|Intel CPU sockets use the {{so-called}} Independent Loading Mechanism (ILM) retention device {{that holds the}} CPU in place while applying an exact amount of force required for a CPU to be <b>properly</b> <b>seated.</b> As part of their design, ILMs have differently placed protrusions which are intended to mate with cutouts in CPU packagings. These protrusions, also known as ILM keying, have the purpose of preventing installation of incompatible CPUs into otherwise physically compatible sockets, and preventing ILMs to be mounted with a 180-degree rotation relative to the CPU socket.Different variants (or generations) of the LGA 2011 socket and associated CPUs come with different ILM keying, which {{makes it possible to}} install CPUs only into generation-matching sockets. CPUs that are intended to be mounted into LGA 2011-0 (R), LGA 2011-1 (R2) or LGA 2011-v3 (R3) sockets are all mechanically compatible regarding their dimensions and ball pattern pitches, but the designations of contacts are different between generations of the LGA 2011 socket and CPUs, which makes them electrically and logically incompatible. Original LGA 2011 socket is used for Sandy Bridge-E/EP and Ivy Bridge-E/EP processors, while LGA 2011-1 is used for Ivy Bridge-EX (Xeon E7 v2) and Haswell-EX (Xeon E7 V3) CPUs, which were released in February 2014 and May 2015, respectively.
