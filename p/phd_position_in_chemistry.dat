40|$|Equilibrium theory {{occupies}} {{an important}} <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>chemistry</b> {{and it is}} traditionally based on thermodynamics. A novel mathematical approach to chemical equilibrium theory for gaseous systems at constant temperature and pressure is developed. Six theorems are presented logically which illustrate the power of mathematics to explain chemical observations and these are combined logically to create a coherent system. This mathematical treatment provides more insight into chemical equilibrium and creates more tools {{that can be used}} to investigate complex situations. Although some of the issues covered have previously been given in the literature, new mathematical representations are provided. Compared to traditional treatments, the new approach relies on straightforward mathematics and less on thermodynamics, thus, giving a new and complementary perspective on equilibrium theory. It provides a new theoretical basis for a thorough and deep presentation of traditional chemical equilibrium. This work demonstrates that new research in a traditional field such as equilibrium theory, generally thought to have been completed many years ago, can still offer new insights and that more efficient ways to present the contents can be established.

40|$|The proton nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance signal of the His 57 -Asp 102 hydrogen bonded proton in the charge relay system of chymotrypsinogen A and chymotrypsin Aδ has been monitored to {{determine the influence of}} substrate analogues and competitive inhibitors on the electronic state of the active site regions. Borate ion, benzene boronic acid and 2 -phenylethylboronic acid, when bound to chymotrypsin at pH 9. 5 shift the resonance position of the His-Asp hydrogen bonded proton to - 15. 9, - 16. 3 and - 17. 2 parts per million, respectively. These positions are intermediate between the low <b>pH</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the free enzyme of - 18. 0 parts per million and the high <b>pH</b> <b>position</b> of - 14. 9 parts per million. The presence of these analogues prevents the His-Asp proton resonance from titrating in the region of pH 6 to 9. 5. Similar low field shifts are observed for the hydrogen bonded proton resonance of subtilisin BPN’ when complexed with these boronic acids. The results support the chemical and crystallographic data which show that negatively charged tetrahedral adducts of the boronic acid substrate analogues are formed at the active sites of these enzymes. When combined with similar nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} data for the binding of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan to chymotrypsin Aδ, they suggest that a direct interaction occurs between the active site histidine and the atom occupying the leaving group position of the substrate, presumably a hydrogen bond. The His-Asp proton resonance was also monitored in complexes of chymotrypsin Aδ with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor over the pH range 4 to 9. In the complex the low field proton resonance had a field position of - 14. 9 parts per million over the pH range 4 to 9 indicating that His 57 is in the neutral form, similar to the active enzyme at high pH. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{photoinduced}} {{electron transfer}} reactions occupy a central <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the <b>chemistry</b> of life [1] their application to organic synthesis started {{only a few}} decades ago [2]. At first glance this is somewhat surprising since analogous reactions via neutral radicals are already {{known for a long time}} [3]. The reason for this delayed development of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reactions may be simply related to the role of photochemistry <b>in</b> <b>chemistry</b> <b>in</b> general. Although the beginnings of modern organic photochemistry were laid more than 100 years ago [4], the fundamental understanding of electron transfer in general [5] and of PET processes in particular [1] developed relatively late in the middle of the twentieth century. Therefore, many photochemical transformations that are initiated by electron transfer were originally thought to proceed via homolytic steps. Meanwhile, the basis of photoinduced electron transfer as well as the mechanisms of fundamental processes such as PET-sensitization, co-sensitization or medium and salt effects are widely understood [6]. As a consequence the number of applications of PET reactions in organic synthesis has increased dramatically as noticeable from a series of summarizing reviews and book chapters [2, 7]. Among these applications are for example cycloadditions [8], fragmentations [9], macrocyclizations [10], and addition reactions [9], respectively. In order to keep this chapter within an acceptable length we will restrict ourselves to intramolecular cyclization reactions of radical ions.

With a decades-long history of {{development}} of aqueous separation methods for used nuclear fuel (UNF), management of neptunium remains an unresolved issue because of its not clearly defined redox speciation. Neptunium is present in two, pentavalent (V) and hexavalent (VI) oxidation states, both in their dioxocation O=Np=O neptunyl form, which differ greatly in their solvent extraction behavior. While the neptunium(VI) dioxocation is being very well extracted, the dioxocation of pentavalent neptunium is practically non-extractable by an organic solvent.
