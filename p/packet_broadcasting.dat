30|$|The {{advantage}} of this scheme is that when a node is awake, it is guaranteed that all its neighbors are awake as well. Consequently, {{it is easier to}} send/receive <b>packets.</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> a message to all neighbors is also simpler in scheduled rendezvous schemes. RI-MAC [28] is a receiver-initiated asynchronous duty cycle MAC protocol for WSN. It uses a receiver-initiated data transmission in order to proficiently operate over a wide range of traffic loads. It attempts to minimize the time a sender and the receiver occupy the medium to find a rendezvous time for exchanging data, while still decoupling the sender and receiver’s duty cycle schedules. A dis{{advantage of}} such MAC protocol is the requirement to maintain strict synchronization because clock drifting may deeply affect the rendezvous time.|$|R

Mobile Ad-hoc network is an autonomous system of mobile wireless nodes connected dynamically without any preexisting infrastructure.

40|$|Energy is a scarce {{resource}} in Wireless Mobile Adhoc networks (MANETs). Adhoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) [6] routing protocol is a reactive protocol used in MANETs. To achieve energy efficiency, Expanding ring search technique {{is used in}} MANETs to reduce the network overhead by minimizing the number of Route Request (RREQ) <b>packets</b> <b>broadcasting</b> throughout the network. If the destination node is very far from the source node, Expanding ring search (ERS) [8][9] technique will take much iteration to find the destination node and thus increases the routing overhead. Because of the battery constraints, protocols have to make efficient to conserve the battery. In order to minimize this routing overhead, we propose a new technique called as Cluster Source Initiated AODV routing protocol. Our approach conserves {{the energy of the}} nodes by avoiding the redundant rebroadcasting of RREQ by selecting cluster head from each group. The deployed nodes in the network are sub-divided into number of clusters and each cluster has its own cluster head. The source node is considered as cluster head in that cluster and it broadcasts RREQ to the members of that particular cluster. The cluster nodes which have a shortest path to the next cluster heads will broadcast the RREQ to next cluster head. Then the intermediate cluster head will broadcast the RREQ to its cluster members. This process is repeated till RREQ reaches destination node. Simulations are performed to study the performance of Cluster Source Initiated AODV routing protocol using Network Simulator – 2 (NS 2).

40|$|Almost all {{existing}} broadcasting algorithms assume {{an ideal}} physical layer, {{in which a}} successful transmission is guaranteed if the distance between communicating nodes {{is less than a}} certain threshold, e. g., a transmission range. However, wireless communication links normally suffer from the characteristics of realistic physical layer, which significantly reduce the reliability of broadcasting among the nodes. This work addresses the minimal broadcasting problem in multi-hop wireless networks with a realistic physical layer. Given a probability p*, the problem is to design a distributed broadcasting algorithm such that each node in the network receives the <b>broadcasting</b> <b>packet</b> with probability no less than p* and the number of retransmissions is minimized. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose a distributed greedy algorithm which maximizes the gain cost ratio at each node. We prove that the proposed algorithm guarantees that each node receives the <b>broadcasting</b> <b>packet</b> with probability no less than p*, and analyze upper bound on the number of total retransmissions in the network. Simulation results show that our algorithm can provide near 100 % coverage to the wireless network with a realistic physical layer, and reduce the number of retransmissions compared with modified traditional flooding schemes k-Flooding (pure flooding with multiple times) and ACK-Flooding (pure flooding with acknowledgement).

40|$|Abstract. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{have been}} widely used in {{motoring}} and collecting interests of en-vironment information. Packet flooding or broadcasting is an essential function for establishing a communication path from sink node to a region of sensor nodes. However, flooding operation consumes power and bandwidth resources and raises the packet collision and contention problems, which reduce the success rate of packet trans-missions and consume energy. This article proposes an efficient broadcasting protocol {{to reduce the number of}} sensor nodes that forward the query request, hence improves the packet delivery rate and saves bandwidth and power consumptions. Sensor node that received the query request will dynamically transfers the coordinate system according to the zone-ID of source node and determines whether it would forward the request or not in a distributed manner. Compared with the CBM and traditional flooding operation, experimental results show that the proposed zone-based broadcasting protocol decreases the bandwidth and power consumptions, reduces the packet collisions, and achieves high success rate of <b>packet</b> <b>broadcasting...</b>|$|E

Examples are mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and mesh networks. Most wireless multi-hop networks also need network-wide broadcasting. Just like unicast routing, this is only possible if some of the nodes relay the <b>broadcasting</b> <b>packet</b> so that all nodes can be reached.

40|$|Multi-Hop Time Reservation Using Adaptive Control for Energy Efficiency (MH-TRACE) is a {{distributed}} MAC {{protocol for}} energy efficient real-time <b>packet</b> <b>broadcasting</b> in a multi-hop radio network. In MH-TRACE, {{the network is}} dynamically partitioned into clusters without using any global information except global clock synchronization. The clustering algorithm is simple and robust enough {{to ensure that the}} gain from clustering is much higher than the clustering overhead, even in the presence of node mobility. In MH-TRACE, time is organized into superframes, which consist of several time frames. Each cluster chooses a frame for transmitting control packets and for the transmission of data from nodes in the cluster. However, each node in the network can receive all the desired packets in its receive range without any restriction based on the formed clusters. Each node learns about future data transmissions in its receive range from information summarization (IS) packets sent prior to data transmission by each transmitting node. Therefore, each node creates its own listening cluster and receives the packets it wants. By avoiding energy dissipation for receiving unwanted data packets or for waiting in idle mode, MH-TRACE guarantees the network to be highly energy efficient. Furthermore, since data transmission is contention free, the throughput of MH-TRACE is better than the throughput of CSMA type protocols under high traffic loads...|$|E

Furthermore, TRACE uses dynamic scheduling of data transmissions and data summarization prior to data transmission to achieve energy efficiency, which is crucial for battery operated lightweight radios. In addition, energy dissipation is evenly distributed among the nodes by switching network controllers when the energy from the current controller is lower than other nodes in the network, and reliability is achieved through automatic controller backup features. TRACE can support multiple levels of quality-of-service, and minimum bandwidth and maximum delay for voice packets are guaranteed to be within certain bounds.
