50|$|The more genes {{involved}} in the cross, the more {{the distribution of the}} genotypes will resemble a normal, or Gaussian distribution. This shows that multifactorial inheritance is polygenic, and genetic frequencies can be predicted by way of a <b>polyhybrid</b> Mendelian cross. Phenotypic frequencies are a different matter, especially if they are complicated by environmental factors.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{survey of}} the synthesis, {{properties}} and applications of fluoroelastomers is reported falling into two main parts. After describing commercially available (per) fluorocarbon elastomers, fluoro-phosphazenes and silicones, recent data on hybrid fluorosilicones containing longer chains (often fluorinated) between silicon atoms are supplied. The second part deals with well-architectured fluoroelastomers. First, fluorinated thermoplastic elastomers obtained either by sequential iodine transfer polymerisation of fluoroalkenes (leading to triblock copolymers) or by a two-step procedure involving a monomer bearing peroxide that generated macroperoxides which thus produced graft copolymers. Then, multiblock copolymers were achieved either from telechelic perfluoropolyethers or from polyhydrosilylation of telechelic non-conjugated diene polyimides with fluorinated <b>polyhybrid</b> siloxane bearing Siâ€“H end groups leading to exceptional materials...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of the occurrence and distribution of phthalate esters in the alimentary canal of a <b>polyhybrid</b> of Tilapia gave evidence of different and selective patterns of distribution in the organ tissues: the phthalate esters were shown to be concentrated in the stomach and anterior intestine. The restricted distribution of phthalate esters can have implications for the physiology of the digestive system. The phthalates, stored in the oxyntic cells of the gastric tubular glands, probably interfere with the digestive process. The strategic location of the enterocytes in the anterior intestine implies that they can hamper the reabsorption of digestion products. The endocrine disrupting effects known for these chemicals are probably related to the absorption of them via the alimentary canal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMorphometry {{is a very}} powerful, {{though often}} {{laborious}} and time-consuming, tool for the identification of bee species and subspecies. In an attempt to develop a simplified methodology for such work, we marked five easily identified landmarks of digitalized images of the right forewing radial cell in 50 workers of each of three different racial groups of Apis mellifera. Software was developed to calculate angles between the landmarks, cell area, continuous curvature, and arc lengths (total of 11 characters). Based on multivariate analysis, significant differences were detected between commercial USA Italian bees, German Carniolan bees and Africanized honey bees (a <b>polyhybrid</b> that is predominantly Apis mellifera scutellata). A single wing cell carried enough information to discriminate nearly 99 % of the individuals. Most of the classifications gave P > 0. 99, and only three Africanized bees were misclassified. We concluded that the features measured in a single wing cell are sufficient to discriminate these racial groups...|$|E
