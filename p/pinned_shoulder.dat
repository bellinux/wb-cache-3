40|$|Abstract. The coupled thermo-flowing 3 D {{steady-state}} {{model of}} {{friction stir welding}} model is established based on fluid mechanics. With analyzing the impact of <b>pin</b> <b>shoulder</b> and <b>pin</b> on heat producing, the model considers the influence of pin on the heat producing processing. The model applies viscoplastic constitutive equations to describe the material, and turbulence model to simulate the material flowing behavior. With the additional turbulence kinetic energy equations and flow boundary condition equations, the model is established. With Comsol Multiphysics finite analysis software, a process simulation was carried out, and the results reflect that the model can reveal the steady state characteristics of thermo and material flowing behavior of friction stir welding...|$|R

40|$|The {{innovative}} {{process of}} Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has generated tremendous interest {{since its inception}} about {{a decade or so}} ago since the first patent in 1991 by TWI of Cambridge, England. This interest has been seen in many recent international conferences and publications on the subject and relevant published literature. Still the process needs both intensive basic study of deformation mechanisms during this FSW process and analysis and feasibility study to evaluate production methods that will yield high quality strong welds from the stirring action of the appropriate pin tool into the weld plate materials. Development of production processes is a complex task that involves effects of material thickness, materials weldability, pin tool design, pin height, and <b>pin</b> <b>shoulder</b> diameter and related control conditions. The frictional heating with rotational speeds of the pin tool as it plunges into the material and the ensuing plastic flow arising during the traverse of the welding faying surfaces provide the known special advantages of the FSW process in the area of this new advanced joining technology...|$|R

40|$|This thesis report investigates how the {{parameters}} of friction stir welding tools {{affect the quality of}} welds. Specifically, the joining of 5 mm 6061 -T 6 aluminium alloy with four different tools was carried out and a relationship between tool parameters and weld quality was then determined. The four types of tools include; a flat shoulder with cylindrical threaded <b>pin,</b> flat <b>shoulder</b> with triangular <b>pin,</b> spiral <b>shoulder</b> with threaded triflute <b>pin</b> and concave <b>shoulder</b> with threaded <b>pin.</b> The design of the friction stir welding tools are based on literature reviewed. To analyse the quality of the welds microstructure, bend and hardness tests were conducted. The experimental setup consists of a milling machine with an adjustable spindle speed and transverse feed rate which was used to undertake friction stir welding. The welding parameters of spindle speed and transverse feed rate were kept constant throughout testing which allows only the tool geometry to affect the outcome of the welds. Welds made with the triflute, cylindrical and concave tools were of a satisfactory condition whereas the triangular tool failed. Results from post weld analysis indicate that the triflute and concave tools have a coarse grain microstructure which leads to a lower hardness and a more ductile failure during the bend test. The cylindrical tool resulted in a fine grained microstructure and thus has a higher hardness and brittle failure. The triangular tool failed to produce a satisfactory weld due to failure in the pin which sheared off. Micro crack defects were found in all weld samples as well as a wormhole in welds made using the cylindrical tool and lack of root penetration with the triflute tool...|$|R
