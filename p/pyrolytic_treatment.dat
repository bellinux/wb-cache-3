50|$|Although {{specifically}} designed for simulating internal combustion engines, the modularity of the code facilitates easy modifications for solving a variety of hydrodynamics problems involving chemical reactions. The versatility and range of features have made KIVA programs attractive {{to a variety of}} non-engine applications as well; these range from convection towers to modeling silicon dioxide condensation in high pressure oxidation chambers. Other applications have included the analysis of flows in automotive catalytic converters, power plant smokestack cleaning, <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>treatment</b> of biomass, design of fire suppression systems, Pulsed Detonation Engines (PDEs), stationary burners, aerosol dispersion, and design of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems.

40|$|Metallopolymers with {{different}} metal centers, pendant groups and linkages exhibit diverse structures and properties, thus {{giving rise to}} versatile applications, e. g., as emissive and photovoltaic materials, optical limiters, materials for nano-electronics, information storage, nanopatterning and sensing, macromolecular catalysts and artificial enzymes, and stimuli-responsive materials. Recently, metallopolymers as precursors to generate monometallic or metal alloy nanoparticles are of great interest owing to their advantages of ease of processability, atomic level mixing, and stoichiometric control over composition. By {{taking advantage of the}} template effect of porphyrin compounds, a series of monometallic and heterobimetallic polymers are synthesized which are characterized by NMR, IR, HRMS, EA, GPC and TGA, respectively. Photophysical properties of these metallopolymers are also studied by UV-vis spectroscopy. <b>Pyrolytic</b> <b>treatment</b> of these metallopolymers generates various magnetic monometallic and metal alloy nanoparticles which can be used in data storage, catalysis, biomedicine, etc. Department of Applied Physic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{modified}} oil sludge (MOS) was a novel sorbent in groundwater remediation, {{and it has}} a carbon content of 37 - 50 % and a huge adsorption capacity after its <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>treatment.</b> This study highlights the adsorption potential of MOS to remove organic contaminants in groundwater. Batch-type experiments about the adsorption and desorption characteristics of MOS to MTBE, TCE and benzene were conducted. Results showed that the adsorption removal rate of TCE and benzene were up to 99 %, and was lower for MTBE (88 - 93 %) due to its high water solubility, but the maximum adsorption capacity of MOS to MTBE was still larger (14. 3 - 33. 3 mg/g). The desorption quantities of TCE and benzene was 0. 4 % and 1 %, respectively; but was larger for MTBE (10 %), and similar trend was also found for the desorption hysteresis coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of carbogenic nanoparticles (C-dots) {{as a new}} class of photoluminescent (PL) nanoemitters is directly related to their economical preparation, non-toxic nature, versatility and tuneability. C-dots are typically prepared by <b>pyrolytic</b> or oxidative <b>treatment</b> of suitable precursors. While the surface functionalities critically affect the dispesrsibility and the emission intensity of C-dots in a given environment, it {{is the nature of the}} carbogenic core that actually imparts their intrinsic PL properties. Depending on the synthetic approach and the starting materials, the structure of the carbogenic core can vary from highly graphitic all the way to completely amorphous. This critical review focuses on correlating the functions of C-dots with the graphitic or amorphous nature of their carbogenic cores. The systematic classification on that basis can provide insights on the origins of their intriguing photophysical behaviour and can contribute in realising their full potential in challenging applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} enable a {{sustainable}} supply, {{the recovery of}} raw materials from secondary resources offers promising potential. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) {{is a source of}} various metals and polymers, but also includes hazardous substances. Therefore, a process for a thermo-chemical treatment of different fractions from WEEE were developed and optimized. With the aim to dehalogenate pyrolysis products and recover base and precious metals from shredder residues as well as gallium, indium and tantalum from Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) and tantalum capacitors, three thermochemical technology approaches were developed. From shredder residues, not only a concentrate of char and metals was produced, but also liquid and gaseous fuels. The char-metal mixture can be utilized directly in integrated copper smelters in order to recycle contained metals. Special attention was given on how formations of dioxins and furans (PXDD/F) can be suppressed and on how already formed PXDD/F can be decomposed continuously. Regarding LCD, the developed technology is able to extract > 99 wt. -% of indium selectively from LCD by using waste polyvinylchloride (PVC). For the last mentioned feedstock, a combination of <b>pyrolytic</b> and mechanical <b>treatment</b> was developed and optimized, which is able to form a concentrate of nearly 80 wt. -% tantalum...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{some work}} {{carried out in}} the relatively new area of step-growth photopolymerization of carbonyl compounds. The possibility of extending the photoreductive polymerization of aromatic diketones (leading to the synthesis of polybenzopinacols) to the photochemical synthesis of pentaphenylglycerols and higher analogues was investigated; however examination of the model photochemical reaction between benzophenone and triphenylglycol established that this glycol (and the related 1, 2, 2, 2 -tetraphenylethanol) is not a hydrogen donor for triplet benzophenone. In an attempt to examine the possibility of extending the photoreductive addition of benzophenone to diphenylmethane to polymer synthesis, m-dibenzoyl- benzene and m- and p-dibenzylbenzenes were prepared and characterized. Irradiation of the diketone in the presence of an equiraolar amount of either of the dibenzylbenzenes afforded low molecular weight products, shown by (^ 1) H and 13 c n. m. r. spectroscopy to contain benzoplnacol, tetraphenylethane and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetraphenylethanol type of units, in addition to benzophenone-type carbonyl and benzyl groups. Results obtained from the <b>pyrolytic</b> decomposition or <b>treatment</b> with dehydrating agents of one of the products were consistent with the proposed structure. Irradiation of tere- or iso-phthalaldehyde in the solid state yielded mostly starting materials whereas branched low molecular weight products were obtained from the irradiation of either of these aromatic dialdehydes {{in the presence of the}} hydrogen-donating isopropanol. An investigation on the structure of the 'photopolymer' produced on irradiating benzaldehyde in the liquid phase, by means of conventional spectroscopic analyses did not lead to a convincing structural hypothesis. 'Classical' chemical reactions proved to be more useful in this case; it was thus shown that the 'photopolymer', which has the same elemental composition as benzaldehyde but a molecular weight 9 - 11 times as high, can be acetylated, oxidized and is reactive towards sulphuric acid; it is furthermore stable to irradiation in benzene solution at 300 nm in the absence of air and non-photo- reducible in isopropanol; it is however reduced by either sodium borohydrlde or sodium bis(2 -methoxyethoxy) -aluminium hydride giving rise to a different structure in each case. Finally an extension of the Paterno-Buchi reaction of perfluoro compounds to polymer synthesis was attempted by examining the cycloaddition of perfluoroglutarylfluoride to two perfluoroolefins under a variety of experimental conditions. This work was largely unsuccessful and the rationalization of the results obtained will be found in the last Chapter of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Low-rank {{solid fuels}} (lignite and peat) are {{characterized}} by a high oxygen content on a DAF basis, {{a large proportion of}} which belongs to carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. These groups being thermally labile, the oxygen content of low rank coals can be decreased (and their heat content per unit mass correspondingly increased) by subjecting them to simple <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>treatment.</b> It has been found that the behavior of certain types of lignite and peat {{is similar to that of}} simple carboxylic acids in that the thermal decarboxylation process can be catalyzed by specific metal ions. Thus when lignite and peat, in the presence of small amounts of copper, are pyrolyzed at low temperatures (160 degree - 200 degree C) they readily undergo decarboxylation and dehydration and their higher heating values on a DAF basis show increases on the order of 30 %. When uncatalyzed, these same reactions require temperatures in excess of 300 degree C...|$|E
40|$|EN] This paper {{reports the}} <b>pyrolytic</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{granulated}} scrap tires (GST) {{in a pilot}} distillation unit at moderate temperature (550 °C) and atmospheric pressure, to produce oil, char and gas products. Tire-derived oil is a complex mixture of organic C 5 –C 24 compounds, including a very large proportion of aromatic compounds. This oil has a high gross calorific value (∼ 43 MJ kg− 1) and N and S contents of 0. 4 % and 0. 6 %, respectively, falling within the specifications of certain heating fuels. The distillation gas is composed of hydrocarbons; methane and n-butane are the most abundant, investing the distillation gas with a very high gross calorific value (∼ 68 MJ N m− 3). This gas is transformed into electric power by a co-generation turbine. The distillation char is mostly made of carbon but with significant inorganic impurities (∼ 12 wt%). The quality of the solid residue of the process is {{comparable to that of}} some commercial chars. The quantity of residual solids, and the qualities of the gas, liquid and solid fractions, are similar to those obtained by conventional pyrolytic treatments of waste tires. However, the simplicity of the proposed technology and its low investment costs make it a very attractive alternative. This work was carried out with the financial support of ENRECO 2000 Ltd.
