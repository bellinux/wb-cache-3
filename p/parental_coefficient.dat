40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{contributions to}} research in Bayesian modeling and shrinkage in the wavelet domain. Wavelets are {{a powerful tool}} to describe phenomena rapidly changing in time, and wavelet-based modeling has become a standard technique {{in many areas of}} statistics, and more broadly, in sciences and engineering. Bayesian modeling and estimation in the wavelet domain have found useful applications in nonparametric regression, image denoising, and many other areas. In this thesis, we build on the existing techniques and propose new methods for applications in nonparametric regression, image denoising, and partially linear models. The thesis consists of an overview chapter and four main topics. In Chapter 1, we provide an overview of recent developments and the current status of Bayesian wavelet shrinkage research. The chapter contains an extensive literature review consisting of almost 100 references. The main focus of the overview chapter is on nonparametric regression, where the observations come from an unknown function contaminated with Gaussian noise. We present many methods which employ model-based and adaptive shrinkage of the wavelet coefficients through Bayes rules. These includes new developments such as dependence models, complex wavelets, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategies. Some applications of Bayesian wavelet shrinkage, such as curve classification, are discussed. In Chapter 2, we propose the Gibbs Sampling Wavelet Smoother (GSWS), an adaptive wavelet denoising methodology. We use the traditional mixture prior on the wavelet coefficients, but also formulate a fully Bayesian hierarchical model in the wavelet domain accounting for the uncertainty of the prior parameters by placing hyperpriors on them. Since a closed-form solution to the Bayes estimator does not exist, the procedure is computational, in which the posterior mean is computed via MCMC simulations. We show how to efficiently develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm for the proposed model. The developed procedure is fully Bayesian, is adaptive to the underlying signal, and provides good denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Application of the method is illustrated on a real data set arising from the analysis of metabolic pathways, where an iterative shrinkage procedure is developed to preserve the mass balance of the metabolites in the system. We also show how the methodology can be extended to complex wavelet bases. In Chapter 3, we propose a wavelet-based denoising methodology based on a Bayesian hierarchical model using a double Weibull prior. The interesting feature is that in contrast to the mixture priors traditionally used by some state-of-the-art methods, the wavelet coefficients are modeled by a single density. Two estimators are developed, one based on the posterior mean and the other based on the larger posterior mode; and we show how to calculate these estimators efficiently. The methodology provides good denoising performance, comparable even to state-of-the-art methods that use a mixture prior and an empirical Bayes setting of hyperparameters; this is demonstrated by simulations on standard test functions. An application to a real-word data set is also considered. In Chapter 4, we propose a wavelet shrinkage method based on a neighborhood of wavelet coefficients, which includes two neighboring coefficients and a <b>parental</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The methodology is called Lambda-neighborhood wavelet shrinkage, motivated by the shape of the considered neighborhood. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model using a contaminated exponential prior on the total mean energy in the Lambda-neighborhood. The hyperparameters in the model are estimated by the empirical Bayes method, and the posterior mean, median, and Bayes factor are obtained and used in the estimation of the total mean energy. Shrinkage of the neighboring coefficients is based on the ratio of the estimated and observed energy. The proposed methodology is comparable and often superior to several established wavelet denoising methods that utilize neighboring information, which is demonstrated by extensive simulations. An application to a real-world data set from inductance plethysmography is considered, and an extension to image denoising is discussed. In Chapter 5, we propose a wavelet-based methodology for estimation and variable selection in partially linear models. The inference is conducted in the wavelet domain, which provides a sparse and localized decomposition appropriate for nonparametric components with various degrees of smoothness. A hierarchical Bayes model is formulated on the parameters of this representation, where the estimation and variable selection is performed by a Gibbs sampling procedure. For both the parametric and nonparametric part of the model we are using point-mass-at-zero contamination priors with a double exponential spread distribution. In this sense we extend the model of Chapter 2 to partially linear models. Only a few papers in the area of partially linear wavelet models exist, and we show that the proposed methodology is often superior to the existing methods with respect to the task of estimating model parameters. Moreover, the method is able to perform Bayesian variable selection by a stochastic search for the parametric part of the model.

40|$|Using isozyme {{variation}} in a naturally pollinated seed family for 10 wild Phaseolus lunatus L. (Lima bean) populations, ranging in sizes from 10 to 60 reproductive individuals, we estimated levels of outcrossing (t) and <b>parental</b> inbreeding <b>coefficient</b> (F). We also {{examined the relationship}} between outcrossing rate and population size. Average estimates of the single-locus outcrossing rate (ts) ranged from 0. 024 to 0. 246 (mean 0. 09170. 065). Estimates of the multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) ranged from 0. 027 to 0. 268, and averaged 0. 09670. 071. Inbreeding coefficients based on genotypic frequencies of maternal plants were positive and significantly greater than zero (F 0. 504), suggesting an excess of homozygotes in all the populations studied. There was indirect evidence of nonrandom mating for outcrosses and this was mainly attributed to self-fertilisation since the averaged difference between tm and ts, which provides a measure of biparental inbreeding, represents only 1 % of the autogamy rate. No significant correlation was observed between outcrossing rate and population size. Estimates of t showed significant heterogeneity among populations and factors explaining this tendency are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{mating system}} of Centaurea solstitialis L. was {{investigated}} in relation to its colonization of North America. A preliminary investigation of its reproductive biology suggested that the species is a pollinator-dependent outbreeder, and probably self-incompatible. Quantitative analysis of the mating system parameters was performed using progeny arrays assayed for nine allozyme markers. Multilocus outcrossing rates (t(m)) ranged from 0. 948 to 0. 990 among eight populations. Moderate levels of biparental inbreeding (≃ 6 per cent apparent selfing) were detected in most populations. The correlation of outcrossed paternity within progeny arrays (r(p)) ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 64 among populations, indicating differences in modes of outcross pollination. A geographically marginal population, San Diego, showed the only significant <b>parental</b> inbreeding <b>coefficient</b> (F = 0. 27), as well as highest r(p), suggesting microevolutionary changes of mating system following founder events. One other population exhibited significant variation of individual plant outcrossing rate, with a correlation of selfing within progeny arrays of r(s) = 0. 65, indicating variation of self-incompatibility. Mating system variation in colonizing, self-incompatible species is valuable for understanding the evolution of self-incompatibility systems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{decline in}} {{population}} size {{can lead to the}} loss of allelic variation, increased inbreeding, and the accumulation of genetic load through drift. We estimated the fitness consequences of these processes in offspring of controlled within-population crosses from 13 populations of the self-incompatible, clonal plant Ranunculus reptans. We used allozyme allelic richness as a proxy for long-term population size, which was positively correlated with current population size. Crosses between plants of smaller populations {{were less likely to be}} compatible. Inbreeding load, assessed as the slope of the relationship between offspring performance and <b>parental</b> kinship <b>coefficients,</b> was not related to population size, suggesting that deleterious mutations had not been purged from small populations. Offspring from smaller populations were on average more inbred, so inbreeding depression in clonal fitness was higher in small populations. We estimated variation in drift load from the mean fitness of outbred offspring and found enhanced drift load affecting female fertility within small populations. We conclude that self-incompatibility systems do not necessarily prevent small populations from suffering from inbreeding depression and drift load and may exacerbate the challenge of finding suitable mates...|$|R
40|$|Disease-mediated {{inbreeding}} depression {{is a potential}} cost of living in groups with kin, but its general magnitude in wild populations is unclear. We examined the relationships between inbreeding, survival and disease for 312 offspring, produced by 35 parental pairs, in a large, open population of cooperatively breeding American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Genetic analyses of parentage, <b>parental</b> relatedness <b>coefficients</b> and pedigree information suggested that 23 per cent of parental dyads were first- or second-order kin. Heterozygosity–heterozygosity correlations suggested that a microsatellite-based index of individual heterozygosity predicted individual genome-wide heterozygosity in this population. After excluding birds that died traumatically, survival probability was lower for relatively inbred birds during the 2 – 50 months after banding: the hazard rate for the most inbred birds was 170 per cent higher than that for the least inbred birds across the range of inbreeding index values. Birds that died with disease symptoms had higher inbreeding indices than birds with other fates. Our results suggest that avoidance of close inbreeding {{and the absence of}} {{inbreeding depression}} in large, open populations should not be assumed in taxa with kin-based social systems, and that microsatellite-based indices of individual heterozygosity can be an appropriate tool for examining the inbreeding depression in populations where incest and close inbreeding occur...|$|R
40|$|Mixed-mating animals self-fertilize a {{proportion}} of their offspring. Outcrossing rate may covary with the ecological and historical factors affecting the population. Theory predicts that outcrossing is favored when inbreeding depres-sion is high and when individual heterozygosity is important. Self-fertilization is predicted to be favored when costs of male function, or mate finding are high, for example, when empty patches are colonized by few individuals. In this study, we assessed primary (after hatching) and secondary (after juvenile mortality) outcrossing rates of two mixed-mating snail populations. Our purpose {{was to assess the}} variation in mating-system parameters and estimate significance of inbreeding depression for secondary outcrossing rate (the realized outcrossing rate of parents that produce the next generation). Secondary outcrossing rate was higher than the primary outcrossing rate in one of the two populations, suggesting considerable inbreeding depression. In the other study population, secondary outcrossing rates were found to increase when initially low, or decrease when initially high, depending on the family. Moderate outcrossing rates were found to be more stable. <b>Parental</b> inbreeding <b>coefficients</b> were close to zero in both populations. Outcrossing rate was much more variable among families in the population with the lower average outcrossing rate, suggesting that individuals differed considerably in their mating system. Our results add to recent studies suggesting that populations of mixed-mating animals may differ in their mating system parameters and expression of inbreeding depression...|$|R
30|$|In a {{preliminary}} set of analyses, we estimated for each country a logistic regression prediction model {{for which the}} criterion was a high score in both Literacy and Numeracy. Specifically, the dichotomous criterion equaled 1, {{if and only if}} the respondent achieved Level 3 or above on both the Literacy and Numeracy scales, and 0 otherwise. Such individuals are generally considered to have the foundational skills needed to achieve some degree of success in the modern world (Kirsch (2001), pp. 39 – 44). The explanatory factors were Age, Gender, Parental Education, and Educational Attainment. We found that across all countries the strongest predictors were the different levels of Educational Attainment followed by the lowest level of <b>Parental</b> Education. The <b>coefficients</b> of Age and Gender were not significant. Thus, it appears that the relationship between Parental Education and Literacy and Numeracy is largely, but not entirely, mediated through Educational Attainment.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were {{to examine the relationship between}} accelerometer-derived physical activity (PA) in preschoolers and their parents, and to investigate other potential child and parental associates of child PA. Families of children aged 2 - 5 yrs were recruited in Auckland, New Zealand, from October 2006 to July 2007. Consenting children and parents had their height, weight, and waist circumference measured and were asked to wear accelerometers over 7 consecutive days, measuring PA in 15. s epochs. Accelerometer data were gathered from 78 children, 62 mothers and 20 fathers over a median of 6. 5 - 7 days, and converted to estimated daily PA rates for each individual using negative binomial generalised estimating equation (GEE) modelling. Potential associates of children 2 ̆ 7 s daily PA rates were then assessed using normal GEE models with exchangeable correlation structures.

40|$|Euganean Hills are a magmatic {{district}} {{belonging to}} the Veneto Volcanic Province, whose magmatism developed during an extensional tectonic regime within the Alpine orogenesis in an intra-plate setting (the Adria microplate). Mafic and ultramafic cumulus enclaves occur within the Euganean trachytes. We estimated the trace element composition of liquids in equilibrium with cumulus minerals, employing a set of partition <b>coefficients.</b> <b>Parental</b> melts of cumulus clinopyroxenes are characterized by a marked enrichment in LILE, Th and U relative to N-MORB. Conversely, HREE and HFSE concentrations resemble N-MORB contents. These geochemical signatures are typical of subduction-related magmas, and also characterized the parental melts of Adamello cumulates. Conversely, Veneto Volcanic Province mafic lavas show geochemical patterns typical of anorogenic magmas. Therefore, those rocks are not cogenetic with Euganean cumulates, which are interpreted as crystallized from Alpine subduction-related basaltic magmas. These cumulates were subsequently dismembered and transported to shallower levels by ascending lavas related to the Veneto Volcanic Province magmatism. Therefore, magmatic products related to Alpine subduction are more widespread beneath the Adria microplate than previously known...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between advanced maternal and paternal ages at birth and increased mortality among adult offspring is often attributed to parental reproductive aging, e. g., declining oocyte or sperm quality. Less {{attention has been}} paid to alternative mechanisms, including parental socio-demographic characteristics or the timing of parental death. Moreover, it is not known if the parental age-adult mortality association is mediated by socioeconomic attainment of the children, or if it varies over the lifecourse of the adult children. We used register-based data drawn from the Finnish 1950 census (sample size 89, 737; mortality follow-up 1971 - 2008) and discrete-time survival regression with logit link to analyze these alternative mechanisms in the parental age-offspring mortality association when the children were aged 35 - 49 and 50 - 72. Consistent with prior literature, we found that adult children of older parents had increased mortality relative to adults whose parents were aged 25 - 29 at the time of birth. For example, maternal and paternal ages 40 - 49 were associated with mortality odds ratios (ORs) of 1. 31 (p <. 001) and 1. 22 (p <. 01), respectively, for offspring mortality at ages 35 - 49. At ages 50 - 72 advanced parental age also predicted higher mortality, though not as strongly. Adjustment for parental socio-demographic characteristics (education, occupation, family size, household crowding, language) weakened the associations only slightly. Adjustment for parental survival, measured by whether the parents were alive when the child reached age 35, reduced the advanced <b>parental</b> age <b>coefficients</b> substantially and to statistically insignificant levels. These results indicate that the mechanism behind the advanced parental age-adult offspring mortality association is mainly social, reflecting early parental loss and parental characteristics, rather than physiological mechanisms reflecting reproductive aging...|$|R

Heritability <b>coefficients</b> (<b>parental</b> full-sib method) of single cocoon weight (CW), shell weight (SW), pupal weight (PW) and shell ratio (SR) were estimated to be 0. 209 ± 0. 123, 0. 228 ± 0. 129, 0. 174 ± 0. 109 and 0. 044 ± 0. 042 in the Japanese race; and 0. 196 ± 0. 1 l 8, 0. 234 ± 0. 132, 0. 159 ± 0. 103 and 0. 00, in the Chinese race, respectively. Genetic and phenotypic correlation between CW & SW were 0. 645 & 0. 957, CW & PW, 0. 962 & 0. 982, CW & SR - 0. 351 & 0. 123, SW & PW, 0. 496 & 0. 871, SW & SR, 0. 265 & 0. 457, PW & SR, - 0. 446 & 0. 169, respectively.

40|$|The National Research Council (1993), {{called for}} the {{development}} of clear definitions of neglect and psychological abuse to increase our knowledge base. In order to accomplish this task, psychometrically reliable and valid measures, based on sound theoretical and conceptual frameworks, must be utilized. Towards that end, the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory (CAMI) was developed. The CAMI is a retrospective self-report measure that assesses adults for multiple forms of child abuse (i. e., sexual, physical, psychological, neglect, witnessing domestic violence). The primary objective of the current {{study was to examine the}} psychometric properties of the CAMI Psychological Abuse and Neglect subscales. ^ Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) identified five subcategories that may help to operationalize and define the term psychological abuse. The CAMI Psychological Abuse scale was administered to two different samples and the resulting factor structures were nearly equivalent across the two samples. Represented in the factor structures were items that depict Emotional Responsiveness, Terrorizing/Spurning, Isolating, Demanding/Rigid, and Corrupting <b>parental</b> behaviors. Alpha <b>coefficients</b> were within acceptable limits and results suggested that the factors were internally sound. ^ The results of EFA using the data generated from the CAMI Neglect scale were less clear cut. Several subcategories of neglect were identified in the two samples including Safety Concerns, Basic Needs Neglect, Cleanliness, Medical/Educational Neglect, and Supervisory Neglect. However, results suggested that many of the factors were not internally sound and were difficult to interpret. ^ Operationalizing and defining the subcategories of psychological abuse and neglect will help to disentangling the relationship between these two forms of child abuse and other forms of child maltreatment. Along those lines, clear definitions of all forms of child maltreatment will aid in the development of effective interventions and treatment approaches. Knowing the problematic behavior will help to pinpoint specific targets for change. This also makes clear the value of developing psychometrically sound instruments such as the CAMI so that comprehensive assessments can be accomplished. ...|$|R
