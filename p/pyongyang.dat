5|$|In counterattacks {{against the}} KPAF, the UN responded on July 15 with {{an attack on}} Kimpo, {{destroying}} {{two or three of}} the seven Yak-7s there and damaging the runway at the airfield. On July 18, Task Force 77 attacked <b>Pyongyang</b> and <b>Pyongyang</b> East Airfields, destroying 14 North Korean aircraft and damaging 13 more. The next day, Task Force 77 attacked Yonpo and destroyed 15 more North Korean aircraft there, and three more at Sondok. That day near Pyonggang F-80s of the 8th Fighter-Bomber Group destroyed another 14 North Korean fighters and one bomber, and damaging seven others. On July 20, another strike by 14 B-29s destroyed the runways at <b>Pyongyang</b> and Onjong-ni.

5|$|On 15 June 1952, Overton led {{a bombing}} raid over <b>Pyongyang</b> {{to destroy a}} series of targets near the <b>Pyongyang</b> Air Base. The targets had been un{{successful}}ly bombed earlier by a similar strike force, but Overton's group was successful in destroying {{almost all of the}} targets while none of his aircraft took major damage from the 48 antiaircraft and 100 automatic weapons, and without harming the many nearby UN prisoner of war concentrations.|$|E

5|$|During the 1593 Siege of <b>Pyongyang,</b> 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese were at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592â€“98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
5|$|Han {{was born}} on 3 August 1900 in Hamhung, {{in the north of}} Korea. His father was a county magistrate.

He emigrated to Manchuria in 1925 but returned to Seoul in the south in 1927. In 1944, he returned to his native Hamhung. After the liberation of Korea he settled in <b>Pyongyang.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1593 Siege of <b>Pyongyang,</b> 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon to bombard an equally large Japanese army. Despite both forces having similar numbers, the Japanese were defeated in one day, due to the Ming advantage in firepower. Throughout the Seven Year War in Korea, the Chinese coalition used artillery widely, in both land and naval battles.|$|E

5|$|By October 1950, the United Nations (UN) {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of the}} Pusan Perimeter in the extreme south of Korea and begun an aggressive northward advance towards the Sino-Korean border, chasing the retreating Korean People's Army (KPA). The US 1st Cavalry Division entered <b>Pyongyang</b> on 19 October, while the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) were rushing towards the Yalu River in all directions. As part of the Thanksgiving Offensive to end the war, Major General Frank W. Milburn, commander of the US I Corps, ordered the ROK 1st Infantry Division to secure the Sup'ung Dam on the Yalu River by advancing through Unsan.|$|E
5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in <b>Pyongyang.</b> Today, Cho is {{regarded}} as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry, or indeed poetry in general, or even North Korean literature as a whole. In the mid-1950s many Soviet Koreans, including Cho's close friends, were discredited in purges. According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E

5|$|In October 1952, Chinese forces {{conducted}} a large offensive against IX Corps' sector, against the hilly countryside around the Iron Triangle region of Chorwon, Kumhwa, and <b>Pyongyang.</b> The 38th CPV Field Army sent heavy assaults against the South Korean forces guarding Hill 395 in the Battle of White Horse. At the same time, Chinese forces attacked Arrowhead Hill, {{which was held}} by the 2nd Infantry Division two miles away. Both hills changed hands several times, but after two weeks and almost 10,000 casualties, the Chinese were unsuccessful in capturing either objective and withdrew.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{during the}} {{operation}} approximately 4,000 men {{and more than}} 600tons of equipment and supplies were dropped by the Americans at Sukchon and Sunchon on 20 October and the days that followed, including twelve 105mm howitzers, 39 jeeps, 38 1/4-ton trailers, four 90mm antiaircraft guns, four 3/4-ton trucks, as well as ammunition, fuel, water, rations, and other supplies. Although sound in concept, the operation may have had more chance of success had a complete airborne division been employed. The following morning US 1/187 RCT captured the high ground north of Sukchon and established a blocking position on the main highway running north. However, strong North Korean rearguard forces held the next line of hills to the north. While at Sunchon, American troops from US 2/187 RCT had heard reports {{that a number of}} American prisoners had been murdered nearby by their North Korean captors as the KPA retreated. It became apparent that the train carrying the prisoners north from <b>Pyongyang</b> had halted in a railway tunnel on the 20th to conceal itself as US 187 RCT jumped into the area, and that while there, many of the men aboard had been shot by the North Korean soldiers guarding them as they waited for their evening meal. Sixty-six bodies were later recovered, {{as well as those of}} seven more who were found to have died of disease or malnutrition. Twenty-three starving and emaciated American survivors were found nearby; however, many were badly wounded and two later died. The American paratroopers were subsequently ordered to return to <b>Pyongyang.</b>|$|E
5|$|North Korean airpower {{ceased to}} resist UN forces after July 20, except for {{isolated}} engagements. On August 5 and 6 the final airstrikes against {{the remainder of}} North Korean aircraft at the <b>Pyongyang</b> airfields destroyed another 18 combat aircraft and seven more were damaged. By this point the North Korean Air Force was considered to have been destroyed, losing 110 aircraft and only possessing 35, with only 18 operable. Through August and September, the North Koreans could only muster at most 16 sorties a day, most by isolated, single aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) {{was held}} in the February 8 House of Culture in <b>Pyongyang,</b> North Korea, from 10â€“14 October 1980.

The congress saw the reappointment of Kim Il-sung as WPK General Secretary and the Presidium of the Politburo established as the highest organ of the party between congresses.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and <b>Pyongyang,</b> courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War {{to an end and}} suggesting the possibility of his return to the country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E
