40|$|Search {{for driving}} forces behind {{economic}} development in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> of the EU From a recent OECD analysis, it appeared that there were dynamic <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> which showed an employment performance {{above the national average}} during the 1980 s, and that there were also <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> whose employment growth lagged behind. This observation directly prompts the following question: why do some <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> show a higher employment performance than others? Can the sectoral mix of employment explain these differences? Or are these differences mainly the result of factors like local resources, natural and cultural amenities, entrepreneurial tradition, work ethics, public or private networks? This study aims to provide answers to this question by giving a thorough analysis of how economic development theories conceptualize the driving forces behind {{economic development in}} <b>rural</b> <b>regions.</b> The insights achieved in this analysis can help policy makers in the design of strategies towards encouraging economic development in <b>rural</b> <b>regions.</b> In order to achieve this aim, the focus of this study will be on the following four objectives: a Analysis of regional economic growth theories, which can be used for the explanation of economic development in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU; b Analysis of development trajectories in selected <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU, and examination of applied development strategies in those regions; c Pattern-matching in order to analyze whether development trajectories identified under (b) accord with {{one or more of the}} theories discussed under (a); d Design of a guideline for economic development strategies for <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU. <b>Rural</b> <b>regions</b> are the basic research units in this study. These can be described in terms of a territorial unit with one or more small or medium sized cities surrounded by large areas of open space, with a regional economy and with a relatively low population density. Usually, the size of a <b>rural</b> <b>region</b> reflects that of a labour market area. By examining the debates in the multidisciplinary field of rural studies and in regional economics, we compose an overview of theories on economic development in <b>rural</b> <b>regions.</b> From this overview we will select a number of theories for further analysis. We use the method of ‘pattern-matching’ to test whether these theories predict the development trajectories in 18 case studies in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU. As case studies we used those which were carried out in the scope of the RUREMPLO project. Based on the findings of the pattern-matching and the experiences in the case study regions, we formulate recommendations for economic development strategies for <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU. Finally, this study is restricted to economic developments since the beginning of the 1980 s. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore joint place {{branding}} in <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> focusing on cooperation between the various stakeholders involved and on the salient features of <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> that are used in the place branding process. Branding is conceptualized as a social process where brand value is co-created by the stakeholders. Place branding is seen as a participative process, bringing stakeholders together with the aim to strengthen the identity of the place. The fundamental question is how to build long-term commitment in a group of key stakeholders. Many sources discuss place branding for large cities, but <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> have received little attention. The process of place branding was investigated for three <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in Finland. The cooperation in the network of actors was addressed through focus group interviews. Place branding in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> is a process needing the combined effort of various stakeholders. Although public organizations are needed to create the preconditions for a joint approach, the efforts of private operators engaged in mutually beneficial relationships are at the heart of successful place branding. The findings show that the establishment of a body to coordinate actions is essential for any place branding effort. It is also suggested that the meaning of landscape is especially important for place branding in <b>rural</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} it is {{examined}} whether <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> in the EU {{with a relatively}} high (low) employment growth in the 1980 s and early 1990 s have some common socio-economic characterics, which {{can contribute to the}} explanation of their employment performance. We have grouped the socio-economic characterics around the headings "local resources", "economic activities" and "supply of labour". We base our analysis on 465 regions in the EU 15, which we have divided into three groups: most <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> intermediate regions and most urban regions. Within each of these groups we have made a further distinction into leading (i. e. high non-agricultural employment growth) and lagging (i. e. low non-agricultural employment growth) regions. The analysis shows that leading <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> have both growth of industrial employment and services employment and show a population growth as well, whereas in lagging <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> population growth stagnates. Besides, leading <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> tend to have a lower unemployment rate than lagging regions and tend to have a higher infrastructure endowment (highways, railways and waterways). On the other hand for quite a number of socio-economic indicators hardly any differences have been found between leading and lagging <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> like participation rates, education level of the population, average firm size, share of female employed in total employment and the share of farm holders with other gainful activities...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> {{is a result}} of multiple (spatial) interactions between socio-economic and biophysical processes. These interactions differ largely between <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> as processes within the region are different and they also respond differently to the pressures the region is facing from outside. In particular, the diversity of farmers’ decision-making in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> may have an important influence on how the region responds to endogenous and exogenous processes. This response can affect the use and the structure of the landscape. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore how future responses of farmers’ decision-making to endogenous and exogenous processes can affect the regional landscape structure. This is achieved by implementing different future scenarios in an agent-based modelling approach for a <b>rural</b> <b>region</b> in the Netherlands. The results show how the response of farming to global or regional processes either polarise or interconnect agriculture and semi-nature areas in the <b>rural</b> <b>region.</b> The results also demonstrate how different types of decision-making can influence passively or actively the structure of the landscape.

40|$|Introduction In {{the course}} of the Fair project "Agriculture and {{employment}} in <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> of the EU" (RUREMPLO; CT 96 1766) 18 <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> of the European Union have been studied, 9 of them with an above average employment development (leading regions), and 9 with a below average employment development (lagging regions). The objective of the studies was to find out crucial factors for different success in creating new jobs. For most countries the territorial level was NUTS 3 -regions, and the investigation period was 1980 - 1996. The definition of "rural " follows the OECD methodology, which is based on population density. According to this methodology, three types of regions are distinguished: Most rural, intermediate and most urban regions. In Austria two <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> have been analysed: Osttirol, as an example for a leading <b>rural</b> <b>region,</b> and Liezen, as an example for a lagging one. The objective {{of this paper is to}} give a summary of the two case studies. Results are base...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theories}} on regional creative capacity often focus on urban regions without {{taking into account}} <b>rural</b> <b>regions.</b> In addition, the application of such analyses to <b>rural</b> <b>regions</b> may lead to misrepresentation or misunderstanding of rural creative capacity.

In the light of the perspective from the empirical literature review on the evaluation of creative capacity in <b>rural</b> <b>regions,</b> various empirical measurements seem to misrepresent or underestimate the creative capacity of <b>rural</b> <b>regions.</b> Therefore, there is a clear need to use the locality in relation to its dynamics, i. e. tacit knowledge, cultural heritage and social and physical environment as the main and basic measurement unit for creative capacity analysis. 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
