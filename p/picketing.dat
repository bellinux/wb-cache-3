5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his {{business}} and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, <b>picketing</b> toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for <b>picketing</b> toddy shops in Erode. When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E
50|$|<b>Picket</b> fences are {{a type of}} fence {{often used}} decoratively for {{domestic}} boundaries, distinguished by their evenly spaced vertical boards, the <b>pickets,</b> attached to horizontal rails. <b>Picket</b> fences are particularly popular in the United States, with the white <b>picket</b> fence coming to symbolize the ideal middle-class suburban life. Until the introduction of advertising in the 1980s, cricket fields were usually surrounded by <b>picket</b> fences.|$|R

In 2007, readers of The Advocate included Gittings on a list of their 40 favorite gay and lesbian heroes.|$|E
5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the bench to lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly based on this performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed the picket line during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area union members joined the Buccaneers regulars in <b>picketing</b> the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and joining them.|$|E
5|$|The Tamil {{speaking}} Muslims in the Madras presidency {{supported the}} agitation (in {{contrast to the}} Urdu speaking Muslims, who supported the propagation of Hindi). The agitation was marked by fasts, protest marches, processions, <b>picketing</b> of schools teaching Hindi and government offices, anti-Hindi conferences, observing an anti-Hindi day (1 July and 3 December 1938) and black flag demonstrations. It {{was active in the}} Tamil speaking districts of the Presidency – Ramnad, Tirunelveli, Salem, Tanjore and North Arcot. During the course of the agitation, two protesters -Thalamuthu and Natarajan – lost their lives in police custody.|$|E
5000|$|There {{had been}} some {{violence}} on miners' <b>picket</b> lines during the unofficial strike of 1969 and the official strike of 1972. [...] Aware of the damage {{that could be done}} to the Labour Party's electoral prospects by media coverage of picket-line violence, the NUM instituted strict controls over <b>pickets.</b> [...] <b>Pickets</b> had to wear armbands saying [...] "Official picket" [...] and had to be authorised by areas. [...] Unlike in 1972, students were discouraged from joining miners' <b>picket</b> lines. [...] Every <b>picket</b> line had to be authorised by the local NUM area with a chief <b>picket</b> to ensure that no violence took place.|$|R
50|$|A mass <b>picket</b> is {{an attempt}} to bring as many people as {{possible}} to a <b>picket</b> line to demonstrate support for the cause. It is primarily used when only one workplace is being <b>picketed</b> or for a symbolically or practically important workplace. Due to the numbers involved, a mass <b>picket</b> may turn into a potentially unlawful blockade.|$|R
50|$|WBC <b>pickets</b> {{approximately}} six locations every day, {{including many}} in Topeka and some events farther afield. On Sundays, up to 15 churches may receive <b>pickets.</b> By their own count, WBC has <b>picketed</b> in all 50 U.S. states.|$|R
5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down strikes, and large groups of people <b>picketing</b> outside of the Pittston coal mines. This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E
5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of anything in three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of <b>picketing</b> and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E
5|$|In late 2003, it was {{discovered}} that Texan businessman Allen Stanford had given both Joseph and fellow minister Gaston Browne cheques worth 100,000 East Caribbean dollars. While Browne denied suggestions that this had constituted bribery, claiming that the money had gone towards community projects, Leader of the Opposition Baldwin Spencer demanded that both ministers resign. Both ministers were part of a team negotiating with Stanford over a land exchange in St. John's, and the news led to protesters <b>picketing</b> their offices. Prime Minister Lester Bird affirmed his support in both ministers, and despite a motion of censure brought by the opposition and more protests, Stanford publicly made a second set of donations to Joseph and Browne.|$|E

5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw <b>picketing</b> of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E
5|$|The first anti-Hindi {{imposition}} agitation {{was launched}} in 1937, {{in opposition to the}} introduction of compulsory teaching of Hindi in the schools of Madras Presidency by the first Indian National Congress government led by C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji). This move was immediately opposed by E. V. Ramasamy (Periyar) and the opposition Justice Party (later Dravidar Kazhagam). The agitation, which lasted three years, was multifaceted and involved fasts, conferences, marches, <b>picketing</b> and protests. The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1,198 persons including women and children. Mandatory Hindi education was later withdrawn by the British Governor of Madras Lord Erskine in February 1940 after the resignation of the Congress Government in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The remark {{originates}} from {{an interview}} conducted by journalist Maureen Cleave, who included the statement in a March 1966 {{article for the}} London Evening Standard, which drew no public reaction at the time. When Datebook, a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests {{broke out in the}} Southern United States. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's US tour in August 1966, and Lennon and Brian Epstein attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a <b>picketing</b> by the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E

5|$|The {{cancellation}} of Enterprise was protested by {{fans of the}} series. Actions included around a hundred fans <b>picketing</b> the gates of Paramount Studios. The response to the cancellation was organised on websites such as TrekUnited.com. They raised money which {{was intended to be}} used for new Star Trek programming, with $48,000 raised within a month of the cancellation. The website sought to raise $32 million to pay for a full fifth season of the show, but failed to get close only gaining some $87,000 from general donors plus $3 million of anonymous donations from investors who work in the American spaceflight industry. Rallies were also held elsewhere around the world, and a full page advertisement supporting the show was taken out in the Los Angeles Times. The money was refunded after an unsuccessful campaign, with reportedly only one accidental contact between TrekUnited and Paramount.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Stevens {{arrived in}} Washington {{to take part}} in the June <b>picketing</b> of the Senate. She did not plan to stay, but Alice Paul {{convinced}} her to do so. She was hired by the NAWSA, and was assigned to the newly formed Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CUWS), which had been created by Alice Paul and Mary Ritter Beard. At that time, the Congressional Union was a subdivision of the NAWSA, though it operated independently. Stevens was hired to serve as executive secretary in Washington, D. C., as well as serve as regional organizer and was assigned the eastern district. Paul had divided the nation into quadrants of twelve states each and assigned Stevens to the eastern area, Mabel Vernon to the middle west, Anne Martin to the far west, and Maud Younger to the south. The regional organizers were tasked with educating groups about the suffrage bills that were in Congress and garnering support from each state for ratifying national suffrage. Rather than follow the previous strategy of achieving enfranchisement on a state-by-state basis, the Congressional Union Strategy was full federal approval. This issue, caused a rift in the suffrage movement at the 1913 Convention, causing Paul and her supporters to break ties with the NAWSA and become an independent organization.|$|E
25|$|There are not {{too many}} {{instances}} of limiting primary <b>picketing.</b> Typically, the debate has been over whether secondary <b>picketing</b> can be restricted; this practice of <b>picketing</b> businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute {{has in the past}} been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary <b>picketing</b> is BCGEU v. BC (1988) where employees at the British Columbia Supreme Court, who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.|$|E
50|$|Another tactic is to organise highly-mobile <b>pickets,</b> who {{can turn}} up {{at any of}} a company's {{locations}} on short notice. The flying <b>pickets</b> are particularly effective against multifacility businesses that could otherwise pursue legal prior restraint and shift operations among facilities if {{the location of the}} <b>picket</b> were known with certainty ahead of time. The first recorded use of flying <b>pickets</b> was during the 1969 miners' strike in Britain.|$|R
