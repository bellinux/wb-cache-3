Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast.

Long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family. <b>Prestige</b> <b>goods</b> obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies.

Accordingly, their prime material was acquired as loot or gift or brought to Moravia by merchants. Archaeological research also evidences the import of <b>prestige</b> <b>goods,</b> including silk, brocade and glass vessels. According to Štefan and Macháček, the Moravians primarily provided slaves, acquired as prisoners of war during their raids in the neighbouring regions, in exchange for these luxury goods. For instance, Archbishop Thietmar of Salzburg accused the Moravians of [...] "bringing noble men and honest women into slavery" [...] during their campaigns in Pannonia. Slave trading is also well documtented: the First Legend of Naum narrates that many of Methodius's disciples [...] "were sold for money to the Jews" [...] after 885, and the [...] Raffelstetten Customs Regulations makes mention of slaves delivered from Moravia to the west.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{cross-sectional}} {{study of a}} cohort of 197 clinical dental students in the four accredited dental schools in Nigeria was conducted to determine the sociodemographic characteristics of these dental students and their motives for the choice of dentistry. The {{results indicate that the}} number of female dental students in Nigeria is increasing, which reflects a trend well established in virtually all other nations. The vast majority of Nigerian dental students (97 percent) qualified for school based on their perfor-mance on the University Matriculation Examination. About one-third, 32. 5 percent, indicated that dentistry was their first choice for a career. This choice was greatly influenced by family in 50 percent of this group of students. There were several factors that strongly influenced career choice among students who indicated that dentistry was their first choice: interest, <b>prestige,</b> <b>good</b> employment opportunity abroad, and regular work hours. The need to go into a prestigious and financially lucrative profession similar to medicine were the commonest reasons identified by the group of students for whom dentistry was not the first career choice. The motives for choosing dentistry as a career in this group of students seem to relate to an image of dentistry as a vehicle for the achievement of personal goals. It is recommended that high school students be encouraged to see dentistry first hand. This is because in countries such as Nigeria {{it is not unusual for}} a potential dental student to have never visited the dentist...|$|R
