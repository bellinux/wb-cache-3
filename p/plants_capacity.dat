Resistant <b>plants</b> <b>capacity</b> to hold out the physiological and biochemical changes under the periodical drought stress may demonstrate the adaptive response explained by the phenological plasticity. In previous reports, a tolerant genotype produced 18 – 44 % more grain than a susceptible genotype under severe cyclic water limiting conditions due to osmotic adjustment (Izanloo et al. 2008). Similarly, in our research and through the entire experiment, the most tolerant genotype produced 10.6 – 30.15 % grains more than the most susceptible genotype under constant stress exposure and periodic stress exposure, respectively. Which indicates that considering resistance response under periodic drought stress helps to build a robust drought tolerance assessment and capture superior drought genotypes.|$|E

40|$|As {{the shares}} of {{variable}} renewable generation in power systems increase, so does the need for, inter alia, flexible balancing mechanisms. These mechanisms help ensure the reliable operation of the electricity system by compensating for fluctuations in supply or demand. However, a focus on short-term balancing is sometimes neglected when assessing future capacity expansions with long-term energy system models. Developing heuristics that can simulate short-term system issues {{is one way of}} augmenting the functionality of such models. To this end, we present an extended functionality to the Open Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS), which captures the impacts of short-term variability of supply and demand on system adequacy and security. Specifically, we modelled the system adequacy as the share of wind energy is increased. Further, we enable the modelling of operating reserve capacities required for balancing services. The dynamics introduced through these model enhancements are presented in an application case study. This application indicates that introducing short-term constraints in long-term energy models may considerably influence the dispatch of power <b>plants,</b> <b>capacity</b> investments, and, ultimately, the policy recommendations derived from such models...|$|E

Managing load with increasing wind penetration may call for operational ranges that conventional systems cannot readily access.

Taking into account different days of wind generation, integrated system behavior has been analyzed comparing different strategies: i) an in-house control strategy and ii) an optimal control strategy based on Dynamic Programming. The latter requires a careful approach to system modeling, aimed at reducing its complexity and the consequent computational load. The challenge is to implement only the smallest set of state and control variables needed to define the optimization problem.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} wheat (Triticum aestivum) TaADF gene expression level is correlated with the <b>plants</b> <b>capacity</b> to tolerate freezing. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene encodes a protein homologous {{to members of the}} actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) /cofilin family. We report here on the characterization of the recombinant TaADF protein. Assays for ADF activity showed that TaADF is capable of sequestering actin, preventing nucleotide exchange, and inducing actin depolymerization. In vitro phosphorylation studies showed that TaADF is a substrate for a wheat 52 -kD kinase. The activity of this kinase is modulated by low temperature during the acclimation period. Western-blot analyses revealed that TaADF is expressed only in cold-acclimated Gramineae species and that the accumulation level is much higher in the freezing-tolerant wheat cultivars compared with the less tolerant ones. This accumulation was found to be regulated by a factor(s) encoded by a gene(s) located on chromosome 5 A, the chromosome most often found to be associated with cold hardiness. The induction of an active ADF during cold acclimation and the correlation with an increased freezing tolerance suggest that the protein may be required for the cytoskeletal rearrangements that may occur upon low temperature exposure. These remodelings might be important for the enhancement of freezing tolerance...|$|E
