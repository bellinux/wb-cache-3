Unlocked by progressing through the story, the party navigates through multiple floors, activating switches and devices to solve puzzles and advance while avoiding traps and encountering or avoiding enemies represented by sprites on the field. The dungeon map is displayed on the GamePad. Once cleared, dungeons can be replayed at any time. Friendly NPC mirages also act as merchants within dungeons. Battles are triggered when an enemy touches the party touched. The player can attack a Mirage on the field to stun it, allowing them to perform a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack</b> or avoid battle.|$|E
5|$|German foreign {{intelligence}} gathering, large-scale Allied trench raids and observed troop concentrations west of Arras {{made it clear}} to the Germans that a spring offensive near Arras was being planned. In February 1917, a German-born Canadian soldier deserted to the German side and helped confirm many of the suspicions held by the Germans, providing them {{with a great deal of}} useful information. By March 1917, the German forces were aware that a major attack was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge. General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von Bachmeister, commanding the German 79th Reserve Division, reported in late-March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an echelon formation and were preparing for a major attack. The Germans quickly developed plans to launch a pre-emptive operation, following the adage that the best defence is a good offence, intent on capturing the northern section of the Zouave Valley along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front. Heavy Canadian Corps artillery fire ultimately prevented the Germans from executing their <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E

At the time when the government of PM Levi Eshkol seemed to be hesitating whether or not to launch a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack</b> on the Egyptian armies concentrating in the Sinai, Peled was among a group of generals who demanded that the government start a war, and threatened to resign if it did not.|$|E

His stated goal was to force them to accept peace, but he acknowledged that he would launch a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack</b> on the natives if they refused. His army stopped near present-day Terre Haute to construct Fort Harrison to guard an important position on the Wabash River. While at Fort Harrison, Harrison received orders from Secretary of War William Eustis authorizing him to use force if necessary to disperse the Indians at Prophetstown.|$|E

For the replacement for Blue Steel he opted for Britain to join the American Skybolt missile project. From the same year Macmillan permitted the US Navy to station Polaris submarines at Holy Loch, Scotland, as a replacement for Thor. When Skybolt was unilaterally cancelled by US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Macmillan negotiated with President Kennedy the purchase of Polaris missiles under the Nassau agreement in December 1962.|$|E

India, to where many of East Pakistan's exiled political leaders and refugees from the fighting had fled, provided support for the dissidents including arming and training a Bangladeshi irregular force (the Mukti Bahini). To relieve pressure on their forces in the east, in December 1971 Pakistani forces launched a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack</b> on India from the west, which was only partially successful and met with massive retaliation. Fighting on two fronts, Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after the surrender of her forces in the east and territorial losses in the west (later ceded back to Pakistan following the 1972 Simla Agreement).|$|E

25|$|The British {{gained an}} {{important}} post on American territory and won control over Michigan Territory and the Detroit region {{for most of}} the following year. Brock was hailed as a hero, and Tecumseh's influence over the confederation of natives was strengthened. Brock next intended to mount a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack</b> into New York State to forestall an American attack across the Niagara River. He was thwarted by an armistice arranged by Sir George Prevost. When this ended, the Americans attacked in October near Queenston. At the ensuing Battle of Queenston Heights, Brock was killed leading a hasty counter-attack to recover a battery which had been captured by the Americans. Under Brock's successor, Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, the British drove the Americans from their positions on the heights, and captured several hundred American soldiers. Nevertheless, the loss of Brock is generally reckoned to have been a severe blow to the British.|$|E

The landing at Wakde was opposed by nearly twice as many Japanese troops than had been expected. When Krueger discovered that the Japanese were massing for {{an assault on the}} American position, he ordered a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack.</b> [...] "Krueger", wrote Edward Drea, [...] "was too good a soldier to stand pat and wait for a Japanese attack." [...] Official historian Robert Ross Smith noted that [...] "This decision, based upon the scanty, incomplete information concerning Japanese strength and dispositions available to General Krueger at the time, was destined to precipitate a protracted and bitter fight." [...] However, even if Krueger had known the true size of the Japanese force, he might still, under the circumstances, have taken the same approach.|$|E

He was promoted to Vice Admiral of the Blue on 1 January 1801, and travelled to Plymouth, where on 22 January he was granted {{the freedom of the}} city, and on 29 January Emma gave birth to their daughter, Horatia. Nelson was delighted, but subsequently disappointed when he was instructed to move his flag from [...] to [...] in preparation for a planned expedition to the Baltic. Tired of British ships imposing a blockade against French trade and stopping and searching their merchantmen, the Russian, Prussian, Danish and Swedish governments had formed an alliance to break the blockade. Nelson joined Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's fleet at Yarmouth, from where they sailed for the Danish coast in March. On their arrival, Parker was inclined to blockade Denmark and control the entrance to the Baltic, but Nelson urged a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack</b> on the Danish fleet at harbour in Copenhagen. He convinced Parker to allow him to make an assault, and was given significant reinforcements. Parker himself would wait in the Kattegat, covering Nelson's fleet in case of the arrival of the Swedish or Russian fleets.|$|E

500|$|The Sunday Times, meanwhile, {{attempted}} {{to undermine the}} programme's credibility with its own investigative journalism. Citing [...] "official sources", the paper told its readers that This Weeks account of the shootings was [...] "crucially flawed", and [...] "bore no resemblance to what happened". It went on to claim {{that several of the}} programme's witnesses felt that [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had misrepresented their statements. It stated that the documentary's technical advisor, Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, was aggrieved that two of his [...] "key opinions" [...] had been omitted from the version broadcast—specifically that what Proetta interpreted as a gesture of surrender may have been an involuntary reaction to the bullets striking the suspects' bodies, and that the IRA members could still have detonated a bomb in another vehicle parked on the Spanish side of the border. The latter opinion was omitted because the This Week team saw little for the IRA to gain by detonating a bomb on Spanish soil, while the former was included in the broadcast. Josie Celecia, it alleged, had dismissed Proetta's account as [...] "ridiculous", while Stephen Bullock had contradicted Proetta's statement that she had seen plain-clothed soldiers arriving in a police car—testimony The Sunday Times believed [...] "destroyed" [...] Proetta's evidence. Both witnesses complained in letters to other newspapers. Through these, it emerged that Bullock had dismissed only one detail in Proetta's evidence as [...] "ridiculous", while he and Proetta had been referring to two distinct police cars in their statements. The Sunday Times omitted Styles' belief that the shootings were a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack.</b> Styles' view was one of [...] "two active service units waging war [...] taking [...] out quickly, cleanly, and without other people being hurt—that seems to be the only way".

2500|$|Hudal {{was most}} {{concerned}} {{with the rise of}} the international Communist movement and worker parties in Austria. Fear of [...] "Bolshevism" [...] was his starting point, but this feeling turned into an aggressive political doctrine towards Russia: [...] "Essential to understanding Hudal's politics is his fear that Bolshevist military forces would invade Italy through Eastern Europe or the Balkans and would be unstoppable until they destroyed the Church. Like many within the Church, he embraced the bulwark theory, which placed hope in a strong German-Austrian military shield to protect Rome. This protection involved a <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attack</b> on communism, Hudal believed, and so he felt an urgent need for a Christian army from Central Europe to invade Russia and eliminate the Bolshevist threat to Rome".|$|E

The Spaniards were trapped between two Aztec forces and 68 were captured alive. Ten of these Spanish captives were immediately sacrificed at the Temple and their severed heads were thrown back to the Spaniards. The others were sacrificed at the Great Temple that night, which could be seen from the Spanish camps. The sacrificed Spaniards were flayed and their faces [...] with beards attached [...] were tanned and sent to allied towns, both to solicit assistance and to warn against betraying the alliance.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} Just War Theory in its current state is anachronistic and {{requires}} modernising. I set out how the domain of war has changed over time, specifically with new threats from {{weapons of mass destruction}} and non-state actors.

I make the case based on the changing nature of threats, and, extend the notion of self-defence to include preventive action. I highlight the epistemic problem in today’s war environment regarding the ‘last resort’ condition of the Just War Theory, and argue that if <b>pre-emptive</b> <b>attacks</b> are permissible, then based on the same epistemic logic, preventive wars are also permissible...|$|R

Yiftah S.
