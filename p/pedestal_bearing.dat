40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{finite element model}} of dual-rotor system with pedestal looseness stemming from loosened bolts. Dynamic model including <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> looseness is established based on the dual-rotor test rig. Three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar rigid motion of loose <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> is fully considered and collision recovery coefficient is also introduced in the model. Based on the Timoshenko beam elements, using the finite element method, rigid body kinematics, and the Newmark-β algorithm for numerical simulation, dynamic characteristics of {{the inner and outer}} rotors and the <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> plane rigid body motion under <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> looseness condition are studied. Meanwhile, the looseness experiments under two different speed combinations are carried out, and the experimental results are basically the same. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results, indicating that vibration displacement waveforms of loosened rotor have “clipping” phenomenon. When the <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> looseness fault occurs, the inner and outer rotors vibration spectrum not only contains the difference and sum frequency of the two rotors’ fundamental frequency but also contains 2 X and 3 X component of rotor with loosened support, and so forth; low frequency spectrum is more, containing dividing component, and so forth; the rotor displacement spectrums also contain fewer combination frequency components, and so forth; when one side of the inner rotor <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> is loosened, the inner rotor axis trajectory is drawn into similar-ellipse shape...|$|R

In the free state, the housing is modeled as a rotor with equivalent masses including <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestals,</b> motor stator and rear end cover. As a consequence, a double rotor dynamics can be modeled for high speed motorized spindles by a bearing element which connects the housing and <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestals.</b> In the work state, the housing is fixed {{and the system}} becomes a bearing-rotor dynamical model. An excitation-measurement test {{in the free state}} is designed to analyze the cross spectral density and auto spectral density of input and output signals. Then the frequency response function of system and coherence function of input and output signals which are used to analyze the inherent characteristics of the double- rotor model can be obtained. The other vibration test in the work state is designed to research the dynamical supporting characteristics of bearings and the effects from bearings on the inherent characteristics of the system. The good agreement between the experimental data and theoretical results indicates that the dynamical model in two states is capable of accurately predicting the dynamic behavior of high speed motorized spindles...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{tests have}} been carried out in a Francis turbine {{suffering}} from inlet edge cavitation erosion on the runner blades. The tests have comprised an onboard accelerometer mounted on the shaft in radial direction just above the turbine guide bearing. Simultaneously, vibrations in fixed parts have also been monitored such as turbine guide <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> and guide vane. Besides, an acoustic emission sensor has been located next to the fixed accelerometer in the <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal.</b> The machine has been operated at various output loads and the corresponding signals have been recorded and analyzed following traditional cavitation detection techniques such as amplitude demodulation of high frequency bands. This permits to investigate the erosion process from a location which is directly connected to the blades. The advantage of such a situation is that the influence of the fluid film bearing and of the rotating frame of reference are avoided compared with measurements from a fixed position.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of the {{excessive}} vibration in rotating machines is the rotor mass unbalance. If a machine vibration due to mass unbalance exceeds the alarm limits, then it may lead to machine failure. Therefore, rotating machines should be regularly checked to ensure that they are properly balanced. Currently, industries use the influence coefficient (IC) balancing technique for in situ machine balancing. The accepted practice is to use the vibration measurements in both vertical and horizontal directions at the machine-bearing pedestals together with the tachometer signal to estimate the machine rotor unbalance (both mass and phase angle). It is generally believed that the use of the machine vibration measurements in the vertical and horizontal directions represents better machine dynamics, and hence the estimated unbalance is likely to be more accurate. However, this paper applies the same concept of the IC method but with a reduced number of vibration sensors (one sensor per <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> at 45 ° instead of two sensors at the vertical and horizontal directions). The use of one sensor per <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> at 45 ° from both vertical and horizontal directions is likely to have responses from both directions. The {{reduction in the number of}} sensors by half will definitely save the instruments and their maintenance cost and reduce the computational effort in the signal processing significantly. The proposed concept is applied on a small-size laboratory rig with two balancing planes. The paper presents the unbalance estimations by using the measured vibration responses in both the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously and using vibration responses measured at 45 °...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with enhancing analysis tools for evaluating the non-linear dynamics of rotor bearing systems and in particular those where non-linearity is {{likely to result in}} aperiodic or chaotic behaviour, such as rolling element bearing systems. The tool to be enhanced was the transfer matrix approach which has been extensively used in the past for analysing linear rotor bearing systems. However, its use for evaluating non-linear behaviour has been virtually non-existent. Hence, the major aim of the thesis is to extend transfer matrix capabilities to handle non-linear systems. To this end a harmonic balance transfer matrix technique capable of analysing non-linear systems with multiple <b>pedestal</b> supported <b>bearings</b> was first developed. However, this approach is restricted to periodic response. To enable the analysis of non-linear systems with non-periodic response and provide a stability check for the harmonic balance technique, a transient transfer matrix has also been developed. The softwares for both of these newly developed transfer matrix techniques have been successfully verified for various non-linear rotor bearing systems using an established system matrix based transient rotordynamics software as the yardstick. These developments have been published in refereed journals. To investigate systems with rolling element bearings, appropriate bearing modelling which incorporates angular contact and rolling element inertia needed to be developed and incorporated into transient analysis softwares. Theoretical results from this were compared to data obtained from an experimental test rig which was designed to represent the salient features of an F/A- 18 aircraft mounted accessory drive. The rig allowed for variation of bearing preload, unbalance loading and bearing support stiffness and could be run up to 17, 000 rpm. Full details of the design and commissioning are presented. Results showed better agreement than linear analyses but significant differences were encountered. Errors were largely due to estimated bearing parameters, in particular bearing damping, which was found to be a sensitive variable, so that agreement between theory and experiment was mainly qualitative. Other sources of error were those associated with experimental measurement and limitations of the bearing modelling. Further improvement of the bearing model is needed if better quantitative agreement is to be obtained between the predictions and experiment...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 92 The {{design of}} a 66, 000 hp {{electric}} motor to drive an air compressor presented significant design challenges. Using conventional assumptions in assessing the bearing support and foundation stiffness yielded a scenario {{where it would be}} impractical to achieve a 20 percent separation margin between operating speed and the lateral critical speeds of the motor. Structural stiffnesses well above conventional values were required in order to achieve the specified separation margin. Finite element studies were performed on the <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestals</b> and motor base. As a result of the studies, it was deemed necessary to perform a modal finite element study on the complete motor assembly. Eventually, it was decided that a modal analysis would be performed on the entire drive train (motor, gear, compressor, and foundation). These studies confirmed that the structural stiffness needed was achievable. Factory and field tests substantiated the analysis. Another challenge in this design was the ability of the motor to accelerate a drive train with a polar inertia in excess of 355, 000 lb? -ft^ 2. The rotor construction is such {{that there is not a}} discrete amortisseur. On startup, currents are induced in the rotor pole face, which lead to significant heating. Surface temperatures in excess of 400 ?C (750 ?F) were calculated. Plastic deformation of the rotor pole face will occur at this temperature due to large thermal strains. Consistency of the shaft forging mechanical properties is paramount if shaft bending is to be avoided. A stringent forging specification was written, which limited the number of forging suppliers who could meet the requirements. Finite element studies were performed to calculate the stresses and plastic strains. High temperature mechanical testing was performed on the forging material to confirm that the stress-strain hysteresis loop would close after repeated cycling. Furthermore, care needed to be taken to ensure that the rotor winding and insulation system was protected from damaging temperatures. Once again, factory and field test confirmed the analytical work...|$|R
