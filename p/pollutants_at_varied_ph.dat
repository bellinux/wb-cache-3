40|$|A {{mechanism}} of retention of sulfonamides in the micellar liquid chromatography, based on similar models verified for other compounds, was proposed. The magnitudes of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of sulfonamides were estimated for differ-ent concentrations of surfactant in the mobile phase and <b>at</b> <b>varied</b> <b>pH.</b> With increasing SDS concentrations {{and at a}} constant pH, {{a decrease in the}} hydrophobic interaction intensity was noted. When <b>pH</b> is <b>varied,</b> the values of the constant, describing the hy-drophobicity of the sulfonamides, remained at an approximately same level (taking into account the standard deviation values). Greater differences were observed in the con-stants related to the electrostatic interactions informing about the increase or decrease in retention, following from ionic interactions. For each sulfonamide, the molar fraction of the ionic fractions present in the mobile phase was calculated from the formula derived, which permitted determination of the type of electrostatic interactions, varying with the eluent’s changing pH. On the basis of the chromatographic data collected, it was established that reten-tion of sulfonamides in the SDS micellar system depends on the hydrophobic and elec-trostatic interactions.

The extent and sensitive range of brushes conformational transition induced by divalent ions are found to be grater and broader than that caused by monovalent ions at similar ionic strength, indicating stronger effects on screening, osmotic pressure and bridging interaction.

In this study, chondrocytes were isolated from bovine articular cartilage, embedded in agarose gel, and cultured <b>at</b> <b>varied</b> <b>pH</b> levels (7. 3 - 6. 6). Rate of lactate production, total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen synthesis, as well as total cell numbers and cell viability were evaluated after culturing for up to 7 days.

Also, a biphasic response to extracellular pH in regard to total GAG synthesis was observed; the maximum synthesis was seen at pH 7. 2. However, the collagen synthesis was not pH-dependent within the pH range explored. In addition, within the conditions studied, total cell numbers and cell viability were not significantly affected by extracellular pH. In conclusion, even minor changes in extracellular pH could markedly affect the metabolic activities and biosynthetic ability of chondrocytes.

40|$|Clumped-isotope” {{thermometry}} is {{an emerging}} tool {{to probe the}} temperature history of surface and subsurface environments based on measurements of the proportion of ^(13) C and ^(18) O isotopes bound to each other within carbonate minerals in ^(13) C^(18) O^(16) O_ 2 ^(2 −) groups (heavy isotope “clumps”). Although most clumped isotope geothermometry implicitly presumes carbonate crystals have attained lattice equilibrium (i. e., thermodynamic equilibrium for a mineral, which is independent of solution chemistry), several factors other than temperature, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) speciation may influence mineral isotopic signatures. Therefore we used a combination of approaches to understand the potential influence of different variables on the clumped isotope (and oxygen isotope) composition of minerals. We conducted witherite precipitation experiments at a single temperature and <b>at</b> <b>varied</b> <b>pH</b> to empirically determine ^(13) C–^(18) O bond ordering (Δ_(47)) and δ^(18) O of CO_ 3 ^(2 −) and HCO_ 3 ^− molecules at a 25 °C equilibrium. Ab initio cluster models based on density functional theory were used to predict equilibrium ^(13) C–^(18) O bond abundances and δ^(18) O of different DIC species and minerals {{as a function of}} temperature. Experiments and theory indicate Δ_(47) and δ^(18) O compositions of CO_ 3 ^(2 −) and HCO_ 3 ^− ions are significantly different from each other. Experiments constrain the Δ_(47) –δ^(18) O slope for a pH effect (0. 011 ± 0. 001; 12 ⩾ pH ⩾ 7). Rapidly-growing temperate corals exhibit disequilibrium mineral isotopic signatures with a Δ_(47) –δ^(18) O slope of 0. 011 ± 0. 003, consistent with a pH effect. Our theoretical calculations for carbonate minerals indicate equilibrium lattice calcite values for Δ_(47) and δ^(18) O are intermediate between HCO_ 3 ^− and CO_ 3 ^(2 −). We analyzed synthetic calcites grown at temperatures ranging from 0. 5 to 50 °C with and without the enzyme carbonic anhydrase present. This enzyme catalyzes oxygen isotopic exchange between DIC species and is present in many natural systems. The two types of experiments yielded statistically indistinguishable results, and these measurements yield a calibration that overlaps with our theoretical predictions for calcite at equilibrium. The slow-growing Devils Hole calcite exhibits Δ_(47) and δ^(18) O values consistent with lattice equilibrium. Factors influencing DIC speciation (pH, salinity) and the timescale for DIC equilibration, as well as reactions at the mineral–solution interface, have the potential to influence clumped-isotope signatures and the δ^(18) O of carbonate minerals. In fast-growing carbonate minerals, solution chemistry may be an important factor, particularly over extremes of pH and salinity. If a crystal grows too rapidly to reach an internal equilibrium (i. e., achieve the value for the temperature-dependent mineral lattice equilibrium), it may record the clumped-isotope signature of a DIC species (e. g., the temperature-dependent equilibrium of HCO_ 3 ^−) or a mixture of DIC species, and hence record a disequilibrium mineral composition. For extremely slow-growing crystals, and for rapidly-grown samples grown at a pH where HCO_ 3 ^− dominates the DIC pool at equilibrium, effects of solution chemistry are likely to be relatively small or negligible. In summary, growth environment, solution chemistry, surface equilibria, and precipitation rate may all play a role in dictating whether a crystal achieves equilibrium or disequilibrium clumped-isotope signatures...|$|R
