5|$|His {{covering}} note {{asked for a}} statement of policy to be made {{as soon as possible}} and that the cabinet ought to focus on three questions: (1) whether or not pledges to the Arabs conflict with the Balfour declaration; (2) if not, whether the new government should continue the policy set down by the old government in the 1922 White Paper; and (3) if not, what alternative <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> adopted.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{expiration}} of the NEP in 1990, {{there was much}} debate over whether the <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> renewed, replaced, or scrapped altogether. The government organised an official review of the NEP in the {{years leading up to}} its expiration. The NEP had been faced with a number of criticisms throughout its lifetime, most of them related to political corruption and other inefficiencies.|$|E
5|$|He helped {{establish}} the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which {{was formed in}} the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and industrialists. It investigated whether a national science <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> formulated and led to the eventual creation of the Australian Science and Technology Council. He also laid the foundations of the Australian Biological Resources Study. When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Burnet Lecture and Medal, which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.|$|E

His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> derived from specific case studies.|$|E
5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> adequately proactive).|$|E

25|$|One {{approach}} {{considers the}} problem {{from the perspective of}} who benefits most from the public good. This approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes. The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good, where those who use the public good must pay for it. Some people will benefit more from the public good than others, thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes. A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good, although some estimates of the distribution of {{the costs and benefits of}} global warming have been made – see above. Additionally, this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> shared.|$|E
25|$|With {{the failure}} to {{establish}} a political consensus after the January 1910 general election, the Liberals called a second general election in December. The Conservative leadership decided that a good test of {{the popularity of the}} tariff reform programme would be to have a prominent tariff reformer stand for election in a disputed seat. They considered Law a prime candidate, and after debating it for a month he guardedly agreed, enthusiastic about the idea but worried about the effect of a defeat on the Party. Law was selected as the candidate for Manchester North West, and became drawn into party debates about how strong a tariff reform <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> put in their manifesto. Law personally felt that duties on foodstuffs should be excluded, something agreed to by Alexander Acland-Hood, Edward Carson and others {{at a meeting of the}} Constitutional Club on 8 November 1910, but they failed to reach a consensus and the idea of including or excluding food duties continued to be something that divided the party.|$|E

30|$|Finally, it {{is worth}} {{highlighting}} the importance of cost-effective policies. Most EV incentives have a high cost. Inefficient <b>policies</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> avoided, including those which may be unduly harmful {{to other parts of}} society, like, e.g., bus lane access which could severely delay buses if not implemented properly. Cost-effective <b>policies</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the first to be introduced, and the last to be withdrawn. An important area for further study is, therefore, to establish robust models and empirical evidence of how the different incentives affect market shares.|$|R

25|$|Among {{several factors}} causing the high {{death toll from}} the tsunami, one was the {{unexpectedly}} large size of the water surge. The tsunami walls at several of the affected cities were based on much smaller tsunami heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami {{thought that they were}} located on high enough ground to be safe. According to conclusion made by a special committee designated by Japanese government on disaster prevention, the tsunami prevention policy by then was made to tackle only those tsunami that have been scientifically proved to occur repeatedly, and it advised in the future the <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> changed to tackle the highest possible tsunami. As there are tsunami walls that have been overtopped by this tsunami, it have also been suggested that, other than to construct those tsunami wall up to a height that can prevent those relatively frequent tsunami, it is still necessary to teach citizens protected by those tsunami wall how to evacuate in case the largest scale tsunami come and attack those places.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the First World War, the British (as well as {{continental}} European) {{tradition was}} to bury officers {{who died on}} the battlefield in individual graves and common soldiers in mass graves. The Great War changed this sentiment, {{as it was a}} total war, one in which nations engaged in the complete mobilization of all available resources, modes of production, and population in order to fight. Subsequently, as the war continued, there was a growing expectation among the people of the United Kingdom that foot soldiers as well as officers should not only be buried singly but commemorated. Many British families had already tried to visit the graves of loved ones, and could not locate them. Numerous letters appeared in newspapers decrying the problem, and Ware realized the British war effort was heading toward a public relations disaster. Ware, too, felt that the experience of war in the trenches was reducing socio-economic and class barriers. He firmly believed that British <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> to treat all war dead alike, regardless of class or ability to pay. Wealthy families should not be able to repatriate their dead, inter remains privately in France, nor erect ornate memorials over their loved ones.|$|E
500|$|On 6 May 1948, Kenney {{spoke to}} a crowd in Bangor, Maine, telling them that the US {{was likely to be}} {{attacked}} by the Soviet Union as soon as the latter had enough atomic bombs. In Washington, D.C., a group of senators including Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. complained of Kenney's [...] "belligerent" [...] speech, and previous ones in the same vein by Symington, saying that matters of foreign <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left to the president and the secretary of state, not to leaders of the United States Air Force (USAF). Another controversy that Kenney became embroiled in concerned the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. He was less than impressed with this expensive and under-performing aircraft, preferring the Boeing B-50 Superfortress, an upgraded version of the B-29 instead. The USAF, however, had staked much of its credibility on the B-36, something that Kenney did not seem to appreciate.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War the first schemes for {{international}} organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support, particularly in Great Britain and the United States. Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, a British political scientist, coined the term [...] "League of Nations" [...] in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation. Together with Lord Bryce, he played {{a leading role in the}} founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group, later the League of Nations Union. The group became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure group within the then governing Liberal Party. In Dickinson's 1915 pamphlet After the War he wrote of his [...] "League of Peace" [...] as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation. He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war and thus could write that, [...] "the impossibility of war, I believe, would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign <b>policy</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> known to and controlled by public opinion." [...] The ‘Proposals’ of the Bryce Group were circulated widely, both in England and the US, where they had a profound influence on the nascent international movement.|$|E

30|$|A {{large part}} of the wage {{differential}} between males and females, which is due to discrimination, indicates that human capital of females could not be realized as completely as that of males. <b>Policies</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> planned for more accessible employment opportunities for females. Equal employment opportunities and anti-discriminations legislations <b>should</b> <b>be</b> followed strictly. <b>Policies</b> <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> aimed to encourage women’s education particularly in rural areas. Kingdon (1998) advocates that policies to discourage gender-discrimination in the labor market will increase the rates of return to females’ education and enhance their incentives to invest in education. Educating females has some other benefits like reduced infant mortality and lower fertility. A large endowments difference between social groups indicates {{that there is a need}} to promote educational opportunities for socially backward sections of the population. The government should also ensure that the disadvantaged groups of the society get full participation in schooling as they have high incidence of illiteracy. Therefore, <b>policies</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> aimed to reduce inequalities in access to education.|$|R
