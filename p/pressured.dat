5|$|Funding for Green Line {{construction}} {{fell into}} place in 1985. <b>Pressured</b> by the previous year's Congressional action, the Reagan administration sought to provide WMATA with $250 {{million a year for}} four years to expand the system to , a plan which would not fund construction of the system beyond the proposed Southern Avenue Station.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pressure</b> {{exchanger}} transfers <b>pressure</b> {{energy from}} a high <b>pressure</b> fluid stream to a low <b>pressure</b> fluid stream. Many industrial processes operate at elevated <b>pressures</b> and have high <b>pressure</b> waste streams. One way of providing a high <b>pressure</b> fluid to such a process is to transfer the waste <b>pressure</b> to a low <b>pressure</b> stream using a <b>pressure</b> exchanger.|$|R
5000|$|The Bernoulli {{equation}} {{applicable to}} incompressible flow {{shows that the}} stagnation <b>pressure</b> {{is equal to the}} dynamic <b>pressure</b> plus static <b>pressure.</b> Total <b>pressure</b> is also equal to dynamic <b>pressure</b> plus static <b>pressure</b> so, in incompressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> is equal to total <b>pressure.</b> (In compressible flows, stagnation <b>pressure</b> is also equal to total <b>pressure</b> providing the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Blood <b>pressure</b> is a gauge <b>pressure,</b> {{which means}} it is {{measured}} relative to ambient <b>pressure.</b> To calculate blood <b>pressure,</b> {{it has to be}} summed to ambient <b>pressure</b> for calculating when blood will boil. This is similar to a flat automobile tire: even with zero gauge <b>pressure,</b> a flat tire at altitude of the Armstrong limit would still have an absolute <b>pressure</b> (<b>pressure</b> relative to a perfect vacuum) of , that is, it will have the ambient <b>pressure</b> at the altitude where the 6.3 kPA <b>pressure</b> level occurs (about 18 km), both inside and out of it. If one inflates the tire to non-zero gauge <b>pressure,</b> this internal <b>pressure</b> is in addition to those [...] of ambient <b>pressure.</b> This means that for an individual with a diastolic low blood <b>pressure,</b> typically , the person's blood <b>pressure</b> would be , the sum of the blood <b>pressure</b> and the ambient <b>pressure.</b> This <b>pressure</b> is more than twice the ambient <b>pressure</b> at the Armstrong limit. This extra <b>pressure</b> is more than sufficient to prevent blood from outright boiling at 18 km while the heart is still beating.|$|R

30|$|However, {{when the}} {{difference}} (skeleton <b>pressure)</b> between the overburden <b>pressure</b> and fluid <b>pressure</b> (pore <b>pressure,</b> formation <b>pressure)</b> is decreased, the elastic {{parameters of the}} skeleton decrease and their corresponding velocities are decreased as well. In such case, the fluid <b>pressure</b> is increased on {{the expense of the}} skeleton <b>pressure,</b> and abnormal high <b>pressure</b> is generated.|$|R
50|$|In physiology, intrapleural <b>pressure</b> (also called intrathoracic <b>pressure)</b> {{refers to}} the <b>pressure</b> within the pleural cavity. Normally, the <b>pressure</b> within the pleural cavity is {{slightly}} less than the atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> in {{what is known as}} negative <b>pressure.</b> When the pleural cavity is damaged/ruptured and the intrapleural <b>pressure</b> becomes equal to or exceeds the atmospheric <b>pressure,</b> pneumothorax may ensue.|$|R
40|$|Mean {{arterial}} <b>pressure</b> and intracranial <b>pressure</b> {{were measured}} serially in six infants with intracranial hypertension (intracranial <b>pressure</b> greater than 20 mm Hg), and cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> was calculated from their difference. Overall, mean arterial <b>pressure</b> increased with rising intracranial <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 20 mm Hg/mm Hg. This caused a fall in cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> with increasing intracranial <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 80 mm Hg/mm Hg overall, although cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> was well maintained in one infant. Thus {{the rise in}} blood <b>pressure</b> was usually insufficient {{to compensate for the}} increase in intracranial <b>pressure.</b> In infants with acute encephalopathy vigorous blood <b>pressure</b> support is as important as lowering intracranial <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
5|$|Speech {{assessment}} {{also contributes}} to assessment of mood, for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid, loud and <b>pressured</b> speech; {{on the other hand}} depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow, quiet and hesitant manner.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine success {{had another}} corollary: {{deliverance}} from constant Arab {{pressure on the}} eastern frontier allowed the Byzantine government to concentrate on affairs in Europe, and, in particular, neighboring Bulgaria.

50|$|Some <b>pressure</b> cookers {{have a lower}} {{or higher}} maximum <b>pressure</b> than 1 bar/15 psi (gauge) or can be {{adjusted}} to different <b>pressures</b> for some recipes; cooking times will increase or decrease accordingly. This is typically done by having different regulator weights or different <b>pressure</b> settings. If the recipe is devised for a higher <b>pressure</b> and the <b>pressure</b> cooker does not reach that <b>pressure,</b> the cooking time can be increased slightly to compensate. Electric <b>pressure</b> cookers operate at lower <b>pressures</b> than stovetop <b>pressure</b> cookers.|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—Stroke-related tissue <b>pressure</b> {{increase}} in the core and penumbra determines regional cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> (rCPP) defined as a difference between local inflow <b>pressure</b> and venous or tissue <b>pressure,</b> whichever is higher. We previously showed that venous <b>pressure</b> reduction below the <b>pressure</b> in the core causes blood flow diversion–cerebral venous steal. Now we investigated how transition to collateral circulation after complete arterial occlusion affects rCPP distribution. Methods—We modified parallel Starling resistor model to simulate transition to collateral inflow after complete main stem occlusion. We decreased venous <b>pressure</b> from the arterial <b>pressure</b> to zero and investigated how arterial and venous <b>pressure</b> elevation augments rCPP. Results—When core <b>pressure</b> exceeded venous, rCPPinflow <b>pressure</b> in the core. Venous <b>pressure</b> decrease from arterial <b>pressure</b> to <b>pressure</b> in the core caused smaller inflow <b>pressure</b> to drop augmenting rCPP. Further drop of venous <b>pressure</b> decreased rCPP in the core but augmented rCPP in penumbra. After transition to collateral circulation, lowering venous <b>pressure</b> below <b>pressure</b> in the penumbra further decreased rCPP and collaterals themselves became a pathway for steal. Venous <b>pressure</b> level at which rCPP in the core becomes zero we termed the “point of no reflow. ” Transition from direct to collateral circulation resulted in decreased inflow <b>pressure,</b> decreased rCPP, and a shift of point of no reflow to higher venous loading values. Arterial <b>pressure</b> augmentation increased rCPP, but only after venous <b>pressure</b> exceeded point of n...|$|R

5|$|Ahidjo {{stepped down}} on 4 November 1982 and left power to his {{constitutional}} successor, Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies <b>pressured</b> him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|But in {{addition}} to being militarily exhausted, the Commonwealth was now <b>pressured</b> by several European diplomacies to suspend further military activities, to allow Gustavus Adolphus to intervene in the Holy Roman Empire. The Truce of Altmark left Livonia north of the Daugava and all Prussian and Livonian seaports except for Danzig, Puck, Königsberg, and Libau in hands of the Swedes, who were also allowed to charge duty on trade through Danzig.|$|E
5|$|In 1502, {{the whole}} Muslim {{community}} of Teruel (part of Aragon bordered with Castile) converted en masse to Christianity, {{even though the}} 1502 edict of conversion for Castilian Muslims {{did not apply to}} them. Harvey suggested that they were <b>pressured</b> by the Castilians across the border, but historian Trevor Dadson argued that this conversion was unforced, caused instead by centuries of contact with their Christian neighbors and a desire for an equal status with the Christians.|$|E
