These consequences mainly included determining the potential for erroneous extraction of the axial dispersion coefficient and/or the LDF mass transfer coefficient from experimental data, especially when non-plug flow conditions prevailed in the bed. Two adsorbent/adsorbate cases were considered, i. e., carbon dioxide and water vapor in zeolite 5 A, because they both experimentally exhibited significant non-plug flow behavior, and the water-zeolite 5 A system exhibited unusual concentration front sharpening that destroyed the expected constant pattern behavior (CPB) when modeled with the 1 -D axially dispersed <b>plug</b> flow <b>model.</b> Overall, this work showed {{that it was possible}} to extract accurate mass transfer and dispersion information from experimental breakthrough curves using a 1 -D axial dispersed <b>plug</b> flow <b>model</b> when they were measured both inside and outside the bed.

40|$|Tight {{regulation}} of the balance between apoptosis and survival is essential in angiogenesis. The ETS transcription factor Erg is required for endothelial tube formation in vitro. Inhibition of Erg expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), using antisense oligonucleotides, resulted in detachment of cell-cell contacts and increased cell death. Inhibition of Erg expression by antisense in HUVECs also lowered expression of the adhesion molecule vascular endothelial (VE) –cadherin, a key regulator of endothelial intercellular junctions and survival. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we showed that Erg binds to the VE-cadherin promoter. Furthermore, Erg was found to enhance VE-cadherin promoter activity in a transactivation assay. Apoptosis induced by inhibition of Erg was partly rescued by overexpression of VE-cadherin–GFP, suggesting that VE-cadherin {{is involved in the}} Erg-dependent survival signals.

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{requirements}} for tumor growth {{is the ability to}} recruit a blood supply, a process known as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis begins early in the progression of cervical disease from mild to severe dysplasia and on to invasive cancer. We have previously reported that expression of human papillomavirus type 16 E 6 and E 7 (HPV 16 E 6 E 7) proteins in primary foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) decreases expression of two inhibitors and increases expression of two angiogenic inducers [Toussaint-Smith, E., Donner, D. B., Roman, A., 2004. Expression of human papillomavirus type 16 E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins in primary foreskin keratinocytes is sufficient to alter the expression of angiogenic factors. Oncogene 23, 2988 – 2995]. Here we report that HPV-induced early changes in the keratinocyte phenotype are sufficient to alter endothelial cell behavior both in vitro and in vivo. Conditioned media from HPV 16 E 6 E 7 expressing HFKs as well as from human cervical keratinocytes containing the intact HPV 16 were able to stimulate proliferation and migration of human microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, introduction of the conditioned media into immunocompetent mice using a Matrigel <b>plug</b> <b>model</b> resulted in a clear angiogenic response.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} treat cartilage defects is the implantation of stratified cell-laden hydrogel implants that mimic native cartilage. To fabricate such constructs, three-dimensional (3 D) bioprinting techniques are promising, as they allow accurate deposition of (cell-laden) biomaterials, the so-called bio-inks, {{as well as}} biological cues and reinforcement structures. Several hydrogels have been suggested as bio-inks, including hydrogels based on gelatin-methacryloyl (gelMA) with gellan gum or triblock copolymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and partially methacrylated poly(N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide mono/dilactate (polyHPMA-lac). However, tobioprintsuccessful constructs with a high resolution, the bio-ink properties are crucial. Therefore, the main aim {{was to investigate the}} application of gelMA and polyHPMA-lac-PEG based hydrogels, as bio-ink platforms for the 3 D bioprinting of cell-laden organized cartilage implants. Here, the optimal cartilage bio-ink properties are based on the ability to print the material with high shape-fidelity and the ability of the material to support chondrogenesis. To accomplish this, the rheological properties governing the printability and cell encapsulation of gelMA/gellan hydrogels were investigated. Secondly, the possibility to improve the bio-ink properties of gelMA and polyHPMA-lac-PEG hydrogels, by the incorporation of additives or reinforcement was explored. More specifically, the bio-ink and construct properties after addition of gellan gum or methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) in gelMA hydrogels, and HAMA, methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (CSMA), or poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) reinforcement in polyHPMA-lac-PEG hydrogels were investigated. Zone-specific matrix production was explored for chondrocytes, articular cartilage progenitor cells (ACPCs), and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in gelMA/gellan(/HAMA) hydrogels. Finally, the optimal spatial positioning of chondrocytes in hydrogel constructs for cartilage repair was investigated using an ex vivo osteochondral <b>plug</b> <b>model.</b> The feasibility of bioprinting and cell encapsulation with gelMA/gellan was governed by the yield stress. The printability and construct stiffness after crosslinking was enhanced for gelMA hydrogels by the incorporation of gellan gum and/or HAMA. These characteristics were improved for polyHPMA-lac-PEG hydrogels with the incorporation of HAMA or to a lesser extent CSMA. Co-printing of a hydrogel with PCL provided porous constructs with Young’s moduli comparable to those of native cartilage. The chondrogenic potential of embedded chondrocytes could only be improved with specific concentrations of HAMA. For the generation of stratified implants, ACPCs were found to be the most suitable cell type to produce superficial zone-like matrix. Additionally, the highest amount of cartilage-like tissue was produced by MSCs, which are therefore interesting for the fabrication of middle/deep zone cartilage. A homogeneous spatial cell distribution within hydrogel constructs was beneficial for defect filling with hyaline-like cartilage, while a dense cell layer {{at the bottom of the}} defect improved construct integration in full thickness cartilage defects in the <b>plug</b> <b>model.</b> Altogether, the work in this thesis resulted in two optimized cartilage bio-inks: gelMA/gellan/HAMA and polyHPMA-lac-PEG/HAMA hydrogels. Although several steps towards the bioprinting of organized cartilage implants have been made, some challenges still need to be overcome, such as finding the optimal combination of factors to stimulate zone-specific cartilage production by embedded cells. However, the results of this thesis encourage further development of organized cartilage implants using gelMA/gellan/HAMA and polyHPMA-lac-PEG/HAMA bio-inks...|$|E

A detailed chemical kinetic model consisting of 2216 reactions with 257 species {{ranging in size from}} the hydrogen radical to coronene was used to predict the chemistries of HCOG reforming and was coupled with a <b>plug</b> <b>model</b> and one-dimensional (1 D) flow with axial diffusion model. The HCOG was a multi-component gas mixture derived from coal dry distillation, and was approximated with more than 40 compounds: H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 hydrocarbons, H 2 O, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons up to coronene. The measured gas temperature profiles were reproduced successfully by solving the energy balance equation accounting for the heat change induced by chemical reactions and heat losses to the surroundings. The approach was evaluated critically by comparing the computed results with experimental data for exit products such as H 2, CO, CO 2, and CH 4, in addition to the total exit gas flow rate. The axial diffusion model slightly improves the predictions of H 2, CO, and CO 2, but significantly improves those of CH 4 and total exit flow rate. The improvements in the model predictions were due primarily to the improved temperature predictions by accounting for axial diffusion in the flow model...|$|E

We initially found that HIMF promotes vascular tubule formation in a matrigel <b>plug</b> <b>model.</b> In this study, we investigated the mechanisms which HIMF enhances expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in lung tissues and epithelial cells. Methods Recombinant HIMF protein was intratracheally instilled into adult mouse lungs, VEGF expression was examined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot. The promoter-luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR, and Western blot were performed to examine the effects of HIMF on VEGF expression in mouse lung epithelial cell line MLE- 12. The activation of NF-kappa B (NF-κB) and phosphorylation of Akt, IKK and IκBα were examined by luciferase assay and Western blot, respectively. Results Intratracheal instillation of HIMF protein resulted in significant increase of VEGF, mainly localized to airway epithelial and alveolar type II cells. Deletion of NF-κB binding sites within VEGF promoter abolished HIMF-induced VEGF expression in MLE- 12 cells, suggesting that activation of NF-κB is essential for VEGF upregulation induced by HIMF. Stimulation of lung epithelial cells by HIMF resulted in phosphorylation of IKK and IκBα, leading to activation of NF-κB. In addition, HIMF strongly induced Akt phosphorylation, and suppression of Akt activation by specific inhibitors and dominant negative mutants for PI- 3 K, and IKK or IκBα blocked HIMF-induced NF-κB activation and attenuated HIMF-induced VEGF production. Conclusion These results suggest that HIMF enhances VEGF production in mouse lung epithelial cells in a PI- 3 K/Akt-NF-κB signaling pathway-dependent manner, and may play critical roles in pulmonary angiogenesis. </p...|$|E

Materials and Methods: This experimental study has been done on 24 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice which were randomly divided into four groups: Normal diet (ND) or control, ND + ghrelin, high-fat-diet (HFD) or obese and HFD + ghrelin (n = 6 /group). Obese and control groups received HFD or standard diet for 14 weeks. Then, growth factor reduced matrigel plug (500 ΅l) containing bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor; 100 ng) with or without ghrelin (100 ΅g/kg) was injected subcutaneously in the mid-ventral abdominal region of each mice. After 10 days, blood samples were taken and matrigel plugs were removed under anesthesia and angiogenic response was assessed by immunohisochemical staining. Results: HFD significantly increased angiogenesis in matrigel plug as expressed as the number of CD 31 -positive cells than standard diet (43 ΁ 5 vs. 13 ΁ 2. 5 CD 31 + cells/field).

40|$|Deciphering the {{extracellular}} {{signals that}} regulate SMC differentiation from stem cells {{is vital to}} further {{our understanding of the}} pathogenesis of vascular disease and for development of cell-based therapies and tissue engineering. Hyaluronan (HA) has emerged as {{an important component of the}} stem cell niche, however its role during stem cell differentiation is a complicated and inadequately defined process. This study aimed to investigate the role of HA in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation toward a SMC lineage. ESCs were seeded on collagen-IV in differentiation medium to generate ESC-derived SMCs (esSMCs). Differentiation coincided with increased HA synthase (HAS) 2 expression, accumulation of extracellular HA and its assembly into pericellular matrices. Inhibition of HA synthesis by 4 -methylumbelliferone (4 MU), removal of the HA coat by hyaluronidase (HYAL) or HAS 2 knockdown led to abrogation of SMC gene expression. HA activates ERK 1 / 2 and suppresses EGFR signaling pathways via its principle receptor, CD 44. EGFR inactivation coincided with increased binding to CD 44, which was further augmented by addition of high molecular weight (HMW) -HA either exogenously or via HAS 2 overexpression through adenoviral gene transfer. HMW-HA-stimulated esSMCs displayed a functional role in vascular tissue engineering ex vivo, vasculogenesis in a matrigel <b>plug</b> <b>model</b> and SMC accumulation in neointimal lesions of vein grafts in mice.

Angiogenesis has been shown to regulate progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The mechanism through which this happens has not been elucidated. We isolated and characterized exosomes from K 562 CML cells and evaluated their effects on human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Fluorescent-labeled exosomes were nternalized by HUVECs during tubular differentiation on Matrigel. Exosome localization was perinuclear early in differentiation, moving peripherally in cells undergoing elongation and connection. Exosomes move within and between nanotubular structures connecting the remodeling endothelial cells. They stimulated angiotube formation over a serum/growth factor-limited medium control,doubling total cumulative tube length (P = 0. 003). Treatment of K 562 cells with two clinically active tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib, reduced their total exosome release (P. 009); equivalent concentrations of drug-treated exosomes induced a similar extent of tubular differentiation. However, dasatinib treatment of HUVECs markedly inhibited HUVEC response to drug control CML exosomes (P. 002). In an in vivo mouse matrigel <b>plug</b> <b>model</b> angiogenesis was induced by K 562 exosomes and abrogated by oral dasatinib treatment (P. 01).
