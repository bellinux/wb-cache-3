40|$|Introduction In {{distributed}} systems and applications, {{there are often}} archetypical reader, writer, and producer-consumer data sharing patterns or idioms. Therefore, in addition to general-purpose data sharing, it is advantageous for {{distributed systems}} to exibly and eciently support common idioms. Flexibility includes the ability to implement dierent idioms with minimal and localized changes to the source code. Eciency includes exploiting the semantics of the idiom to optimize performance. For example, all message-passing systems provide general-purpose mechanisms to send and receive data across distributed nodes. However, some systems (e. g., Message Passing Interface) also support commonly occurring group operations, such as all-to-all communication. The higher-level functions are implemented using the lower-level mechanisms.

40|$|Este trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar a atividade {{residual}} da mistura comercial (imazethapyr+imazapic) sobre azevém semeado em sucessão em áreas antes cultivadas com arroz Clearfield® (CL) por um, dois ou três anos consecutivos. Os experimentos foram conduzidos em campo, no município de Capão do Leão, RS. O arroz cv. IRGA 422 CL foi considerado cultura principal, e o azevém, variedade indefinida, cultura sucessora. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. Os tratamentos foram arranjados em esquema fatorial, em que o fator A, dentro da mesma safra, comparou resíduos de (imazethapyr+imazapic) em um, dois e três anos de cultivo de arroz CL, e o fator B avaliou o efeito de dose sobre a atividade residual do herbicida. Os blocos foram constituídos por quatro unidades experimentais, que haviam recebido a mistura (imazethapyr+imazapic) nas doses de 0; 25 + 75; 37, 5 + 112, 5; e 50 + 150 g ha- 1, acrescidos de Dash a 0, 5 % v/v. A análise conjunta dos dados, gerados nos três ambientes (A 1, A 2 e A 3), acusou interação entre dose herbicida (imazethapyr+imazapic) e ambientes para as variáveis-resposta estatura de plantas e rendimento biológico. Para as variáveis peso de grãos e poder germinativo, as diferenças ocorreram somente entre as doses do herbicida. Os resultados demonstram que todas as variáveis-resposta avaliadas foram alteradas negativamente pela presença de resíduos da mistura (imazethapyr+imazapic) no solo, sendo maiores as injúrias com o incremento da dose. Foi observado que o cultivo de arroz irrigado no sistema CL deixa resíduos dos herbicidas (imazethapyr+imazapic) no solo, capazes de causar danos ao azevém cultivado em sucessão. Além disso, o sistema de sucessão envolvendo o arroz CL e azevém requer intervalos superiores a 180 dias entre a aplicação inicial do herbicida na primeira cultura e a semeadura do cultivo sucessor. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the residual activity of the <b>prepackage</b> mix of the herbicide Only (imazethapyr+imazapic) in a Clearfield (CL) rice production system during one, two or three rice seasons. The study was carried out in the field at Centro Agropecuário da Palma/Universidade Federal de Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) was planted after CL rice, cv. IRGA 422 CL. CL rice was considered as the main crop (summer) and ryegrass was planted following CL rice. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, with four replications. The treatments were arranged as a factorial: factor A, during the same season, compared herbicide residues during one, two or three years of CL rice and factor B, for herbicide rates. Herbicide (imazethapyr+imazapic) was applied at (0; 25 + 75; 37, 5 + 112, 5; 50 + 150) g ha- 1 with surfactant Dash being added at 0. 5 % v/v. The results showed interaction between CL rice seasons and the herbicide rate for the variables plant height and biomass. All variables tested were affected by herbicide (imazethapyr+imazapic) residue and the effect was more severe at higher rates. Grain weight and germination percentage were only affected by the herbicide rates.

The advantage is that no parallel plate modes can propagate between the perfect electric conductor (PEC) ground plane and the PMC lid plate if the spacing is smaller than an effective quarter of wavelength.

40|$|ABSTRACT Discrete {{waves in}} the voltage-clamped {{photoreceptor}} of Limulus are remarkably similar in all essential properties {{to those found in}} an unclamped cell. The latency distribution of discrete waves is not affected by considerable changes in the holding potential in a voltage-clamped cell. Both large and small waves occur in voltage-clamped and unclamped cells and in approximately the same proportion. Large and small waves also share the same latency distributions and spectral sensitivity. We suggest that small waves may result from the activation of damaged membrane areas. Large waves have an average amplitude of approximately 5 nA in voltage-clamped photoreceptors. It probably requires several square microns of cell membrane to support this much photocurrent. Thus the amplification inherent in the discrete wave process may involve spatial spread of activation from unimolecular dimensions to several square microns of cell membrane surface. Neither local current flow, nor <b>prepackaging</b> of any transmitter substance appears {{to be involved in the}} amplification process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{adeno-associated virus}} (AAV) {{terminal}} repeats (TR) are cis required, and the AAV encoded Rep 78 protein is trans required, for AAV DNA replication. The Rep 78 protein recognizes and interacts {{with at least}} three regions within the TR DNA. The major binding site, with the highest affinity for Rep 78 binding, is within the TR stem (nt 36 - 16) and includes the ‘core’ GAGC trimer (GAGC 3, nt 33 - 22; Fig. 2) sequence. In this study mutations were made within the GAGC trimer and these mutants assayed {{for their ability to}} allow for AAV double stranded (ds DNA, <b>prepackaging</b> DNA replication), and single stranded DNA (ss DNA, due to virion packaging) replication. Here, it is shown that when the two inside GAGC motifs are mutated, with only motif no. 1 left intact (see Fig. 2), the resulting AAV (mutA) genome was significantly defective for both ds DNA (17 % of wild type) and ss DNA (9 %). If the TRs contained only the two outside motifs intact (mutB), motifs no. 1 and 2, the AAV genome had a significant but reduced level of both ds (50 %) and ss (34 %) DNA replication. Finally, if only the middle motif no. 2 was mutated, with motifs no. 1 and 3 left intact (mutC), the resulting DNA replication for both ds and ss forms was essentially wild type (80 % that of wild type). These data suggest that the GAGC trimer plays a role in AAV DNA replication, and that GAGC motif no. 3 is the most important of the three motifs for both ds and ss DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|During {{development}} and learning, synapses increase their strength by adding neurotransmitter receptors to the postsynapse. The current model of postsynaptic receptor addition is the "diffusion-trap". In this model, receptors insert extrasynaptically and then diffuse into the postsynapse, {{where they are}} trapped via interaction with scaffold molecules. Here we propose a new model for postsynaptic receptor addition: the "preassemble-insert" model. In this model, extrasynaptic receptors endocytose, preassemble with scaffold, and then insert directly to the postsynapse without a diffusion step. Hence receptor-scaffold packages are inserted as immobile units in the postsynapse. To investigate postsynaptic receptor diffusion-trapping and preassembly-insertion, we use the agrin model of AChR clustering, live cell imaging, FRAP, and single molecule tracking. We find that AChRs diffuse into clusters during formation, but directly insert during strengthening. Inserted AChRs transcytose from the surface plasma membrane via caveolin- 3 t-tubules, and then exocytose via a Rab 27 a vesicular compartment, in a MyosinVa dependant manner. During caveolin- 3 ttubule transcytosis, AChRs preassemble with the scaffold molecule rapsyn in a transport package, and caveolin- 3 trafficking is required for AChR-rapsyn packaging. Insertion of preassembled AChR-rapsyn packages is required for AChR cluster strengthening, but not formation. a-Dystroglycan does not preassemble with AChR-rapsyn, and clusters independently of the caveolin- 3 t-tubule pathway. However, a-dystroglycan is required for caveolin- 3 t-tubule organelle recruitment and polarization towards the cluster, which permits the insertion of AChR-rapsyn packages. Finally, we confirm caveolin- 3 and Rab 27 a trafficking in vivo, and correlate t-tubule recruitment with NMJ strengthening. We also report <b>prepackaging</b> of Glur 1 -stargazin at CNS synapses after chemical LTP. The "diffusion-trap" has predominated {{as the model for}} postsynaptic receptor addition, and is a generalized mechanism for the addition of transmembrane protein to cell-cell junctions.

One of the major enterprises of the homemaker in past years was to plan, produce or purchase, preserve, and prepare food daily for the family. The role of the homemaker today has changed from one of producer to one of purchaser. Hence, at least weekly, the selection of food at the market place involves not only {{the best use of}} her time but wise expenditure of her food budget.

Each individual home-maker has to answer this question for herself and her family. Studies on differences in cost and nutritive value of certain convenience foods have not kept pace with the rapid increase in the number and kind of these convenience foods. A recent study giving average prices which was representative for the United States has been reported by Shays and Durham, 1963. Additional information on what is available in Utah grocery stores and on the effect of buiit-in convenience on cost is needed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the purchaser, cost and nutritive value of specific convenience foods.
