5|$|A 1942 <b>piece,</b> The Old Checkered House, 1862 was {{appraised}} at the Memphis 2004 Antiques Roadshow. It was not {{as common}} as her winter landscapes.

5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced <b>piece</b> littered with sixteenth note figures. The <b>piece</b> {{was not intended}} {{to be associated with the}} Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark <b>piece</b> with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page <b>piece</b> entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic <b>piece</b> from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Artist Matthew Ritchie was {{commissioned}} to create {{much of the}} building's artwork. One <b>piece</b> is a metal sculpture located on the exterior in the courtyard that mimics the nearby Willamette River's watershed, and includes metal spheres attached to the line shaped metal. The other main <b>piece</b> of art is a <b>piece</b> with two lightboxes on the interior that display different images as one moves along the display that uses lenticular glass.

5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent <b>piece</b> in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent <b>piece</b> in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent <b>piece</b> in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E
5000|$|Arimaa {{is played}} on an 8×8 board with four trap squares. There are six kinds of <b>pieces,</b> ranging from {{elephant}} (strongest) to rabbit (weakest). Stronger <b>pieces</b> can push or pull weaker <b>pieces,</b> and stronger <b>pieces</b> freeze weaker <b>pieces.</b> <b>Pieces</b> can {{be captured by}} dislodging them onto a trap square when they have no orthogonally adjacent friendly <b>pieces.</b> There are three ways to win the game: ...|$|R

5|$|En passant is {{a unique}} {{privilege}} of pawns: pieces cannot capture en passant. It is the only capture in chess in which the capturing <b>piece</b> does not replace the captured <b>piece</b> on its square.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A <b>piece</b> is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy <b>piece</b> replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured <b>piece</b> is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} of Hexic is to rotate hexagonal <b>pieces</b> of various colours and clear {{them from the}} playfield by forming clusters or flowers. Clusters are formed when three <b>pieces</b> of the same colour touch each other. <b>Pieces</b> above the cleared <b>pieces</b> fall, potentially forming more clusters and causing chain reactions, and new <b>pieces</b> appear {{at the top of}} the playfield. Bonuses are awarded for clearing more than three <b>pieces</b> at a time, and some <b>pieces</b> contain bonus stars, which yield extra points and can clear larger groups of <b>pieces</b> depending on how they are cleared.|$|R
50|$|All players help to {{scramble}} the 32 <b>pieces</b> face down and distribute the <b>pieces</b> evenly to themselves. If {{the number of}} players is three, {{the winner of the}} previous game or a volunteer receives 12 <b>pieces</b> and the other two players receive 10 <b>pieces</b> each. Like a Mahjong game, each player arranges his/her <b>pieces</b> into one line with half of the <b>pieces</b> {{on top of the other}} half. Figure below shows how 3 players arrange their <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
5|$|Given to the City of London by Moore and the Contemporary Art Society in 1967, Knife Edge Two <b>Piece</b> 1962–65 is {{displayed}} in Abingdon Street Gardens, opposite the Houses of Parliament, where its regular {{appearance in the}} background of televised news reports from Westminster makes it Moore's most prominent <b>piece</b> in Britain.

5|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} {{to place the}} work within a particular genre. MTV compared the song's style to the group Devo and new wave music. El País described the <b>piece</b> as an electropop song {{that contributed to the}} viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. Dose described it as an electro jam session which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The Los Angeles Times called the <b>piece</b> a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described the <b>piece</b> as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song for dancing. New Musical Express recommended the <b>piece,</b> and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the <b>piece</b> as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that the end product was comedic. The Arizona Daily Star described the <b>piece</b> as a pop music dance song.|$|E
5|$|The Pavane (1887) was {{conceived}} and originally written as an orchestral <b>piece.</b> Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In {{the form of}} an ancient dance, the <b>piece</b> was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a <b>piece</b> of German romanticism.|$|E
5|$|The second romance, in A minor, {{an exuberant}} <b>piece,</b> {{has a strong}} semiquaver figure {{supporting}} the theme, and running high into the treble and low into the bass. This was later {{to become one of}} Fauré's most recognisable characteristics. After a lively display, the <b>piece</b> ends quietly.|$|E
50|$|Each {{player has}} {{a set of}} 90 <b>pieces</b> of 34 {{different}} types. The <b>pieces</b> are round and flattened like go stones. In all, the players must remember 65 different moves.

50|$|In Murray's variant, the <b>pieces</b> have {{different}} colors with different point values. The number of <b>pieces</b> per color are divided as follows: 1 green for every 2 red, for every 3 yellow, for every 4 white.

5|$|A <b>piece</b> of {{a garment}} signed by Ivan Alexander and {{interwoven}} with gold {{was discovered in}} a noble's grave near Pirot in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade.

5|$|A player {{capturing}} a <b>piece</b> immediately passes that <b>piece</b> to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps {{these pieces}} in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the <b>piece.</b> Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the <b>piece</b> delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
