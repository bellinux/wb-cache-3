Perturbation training is performed on an unstable or moving surface to improve with the muscle and joint kinematics to prevent injuries, gait, and postural stability.The novelty of perturbation training is that it focuses on speed of processing and execution of limb movements, as well as rapid re-stabilization. This differs from ‘traditional’ balance training programs using voluntary movements. This training is specific to the demands of balance recovery reactions to prevent a fall following a ‘real life’ loss of balance.|$|E

We present a wearable, unobtrusive system for real-time gait monitoring, which consists of an inertial wearable sensor and wireless headset for the delivery of acoustic cues. The system recognizes FOG episodes with minimum latency and delivers acoustic cues to unfreeze the gait. We present design of a system for the detection and unfreezing of gait (deFOG), and preliminary results of the feasibility study. In a limited test run of 4 test cases the system was able to detect freezing of gait with average latency of 332 ms, and maximum latency of 580 ms.

40|$|The {{objective}} of {{exercise in the}} treatment of osteoporosis is to improve axial stability through improvement of muscle strength. Therefore, a back extension exercise program specific to one's musculoskeletal competence and pain can be performed in a sitting position and later advanced to the prone position. When fragility is resolved, back extension is performed against resistance applied to the upper back. To decrease pain and immobility in acute vertebral fracture, use of spinal orthoses become inevitable. Therapeutic exercise should address osteoporosis-related deformities of axial posture, which can increase risk of fall and fracture. Strengthening of the major appendicular muscles decreases fragility. The effect of strengthening exercise is augmented by proper intake of cholecalciferol and calcium. Thus, the role of a therapeutic exercise program is to increase muscle strength safely, decrease immobility-related complications, and <b>prevent</b> <b>fall</b> and fracture. As with pharmacotherapy, therapeutic exercises are individualized. status: publishe...|$|E

Balance-Based Torso-Weighting (BBTW) is a non-exercise intervention that improves functional measures among adults with multiple sclerosis, yet the effectiveness of BBTW has not been assessed among older adults without progressive neurological disorders. We conducted a double-blind, randomized study to analyze the effect of BBTW on functional measures and falls efficacy among community-dwelling, mobility limited older adults after 5 days of wearing BalanceWear® for 4 hours per day.

SETTING: Two industrial towns {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-nine elderly people (average age 77) living at home with a high risk of falling. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received Tai Chi Chuan training for 1 hour twice a week for 13 weeks; the control group received usual care. Both groups received a brochure containing general information on how to <b>prevent</b> <b>fall</b> incidents. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was the number of falls over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were balance, fear of falling, blood pressure, heart rate at rest, forced expiratory volume during the first second, peak expiratory flow, physical activity, and functional status. RESULTS: After 12 months, no lower fall risk in the Tai Chi Chuan group was observed than in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio= 1. 16; 95 % confidence interval= 0. 84 - 1. 60), and there were no significant intervention effects on the secondary outcome measures.

But, correlation between balance ability and joint stiffness is still remains unknown. In this study, joint stiffening strategy at ankle and hip were observed under different sensory manipulations and its correlation with conventional clinical test (Functional Reach Test) for balance ability was investigated. In order to create unstable condition, two different surface perturbations (tilt up-tilt (TT) down and forward-backward (FB)) at four different frequencies (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8 Hz) were introduced. Furthermore, four different sensory manipulation conditions (include vision and vestibular system) were applied to the subject and they were asked to maintain their position as possible. The results suggested that joint stiffness were high during difficult balance situation. Less balance people generated high average joint stiffness compared to balance people. Besides, adaptation of posture control system under repetitive external perturbation also suggested less during sensory limited condition.

40|$|Hip {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most serious consequences of falls in the elderly. Martial arts (MA) fall techniques may reduce hip fracture risk, as they are known to reduce hip impact forces by approximately 30 % in experienced fallers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether hip impact forces and velocities in MA falls would be smaller than in a 'natural' fall arrest strategy (Block) in young adults (without any prior experience) after a 30 -min training session in sideways MA fall techniques. Ten subjects fell sideways from kneeling height. In order to identify experience-related differences, additional EMG data of both fall types were collected in inexperienced (n= 10) and experienced fallers (n= 5). Compared to Block falls, MA falls had significantly smaller hip impact forces (- 17 %) and velocities (- 7 %). EMG results revealed experience-related differences in the execution of the MA fall, indicative of less pronounced trunk rotation in the inexperienced fallers. This may explain their smaller reduction of impact forces compared to experienced fallers. In conclusion, the finding that a substantial reduction in impact forces can be achieved after a short training in MA techniques is very promising with respect to their use in interventions to <b>prevent</b> <b>fall</b> injuries. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} <b>prevent</b> <b>fall</b> related {{injuries}} and their consequences, {{one needs to}} be able to predict the outcome of a given balance perturbation: a possible Balance Recovery (BR) or an unavoidable fall? Given that results from the existing experimental studies are difficult to compare and to generalize, we propose to address this question with a numerical tool. Built on existing concepts from the biomechanics and robotics literature, it includes the optimal use of BR reactions and particularly the possibility to perform a recovery step. It allows estimating 1) the possibility to recover a steady balance from a given initial state or perturbation using at most one recovery step; 2) the set of recovery steps leading to a BR. Using standard sets of parameters for young and elderly population, we assessed this modelós predictions against experimental data from the literature in the anterior direction. Two classical representations of the human body (inverted pendulum (IP) vs. linear inverted pendulum (LIP)) were also compared. The results showed that the model correctly predicted the possibility to recover using a single protective step (1 -Step BR threshold) and the characteristics (step length and time) of the protective step for both the young and the elderly. This tool has a real potential in the field of fall prevention to detect risky situation. It could also be used to get insights into the neuromuscular mechanisms involved in the BR process...|$|E
