As it moves, it is shown to be an extreme {{close-up}} of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still. As the camera begins to <b>pan</b> <b>right</b> and up, it is discernable as a wall; we are outside a building (an old factory situated in Lower Manhattan). It is summer, though {{it is hard to}} tell. The camera’s movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually, it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall.|$|E

Tom zooms after him, but stops abruptly when Jerry holds up a spoon and frying <b>pan</b> <b>right</b> next to Spike, ready to bang. Jerry even pokes and whacks the cat with the spoon, but when Tom turns to attack, Jerry renews the threat. Tom sneaks around the corner, and grabs the noisemakers from behind. Jerry's next trick {{is to set up}} a lamp cord to trip Tom. Tom does trip and falls toward a table full of wine glasses. From midair, he fantastically manages to push the table away {{and replace it with a}} pillow, on which he falls quietly. As Jerry gets ready to fire a large rifle, Tom races to stick his fingers in the gun barrels first, after which Jerry fires. As Tom examines his throbbing fingers, Jerry prepares to push a colossal grandfather clock to the floor. Tom can do nothing but stick his fingers in Spike's ears and hope it muffles the crash, which it amazingly does. Jerry begins to drop light bulbs off the mantelpiece, but Tom acrobatically catches them all. But Jerry plugs his tail into the light socket, lighting poor Tom like a Christmas tree, and pushes a roller skate under the cat's foot for final measure, sending him crashing into Spike! ...|$|E

40|$|The Virtual Walkabout {{resource}} aims {{to provide}} {{not only a}} tool for expressing the spatial relationships of archaeological landscapes, buildings and artefacts but also a resource for learning and teaching through a simple fieldwork project. The Virtual Walkabout archives contain a series of still, 2 -dimensional photographic images that collectively try to express the experience of walking around an archaeological site or monument. The images are presented in their Virtual order from a given point of departure, and are connected {{by a series of}} moves, forwards, backwards, pan left, <b>pan</b> <b>right,</b> step left or step right. The Virtual Walkabout archives derive from an original idea of Prof Clive Ruggles who provided the initial set of images from the sites of Beaghmore and Avebury. In addition, the Virtual Walkabout includes a generator tool which can be used to generate walkabouts from any archaeological site, provided the images are arranged, processed and indexed as appropriate. The Walkabout Generator is supported by a short tutorial which is intended to encourage students to undertake their own simple fieldwork project and presents many of the common problems that fieldworkers face but which students often overlook. Lecturers and tutors are invited to use the walkabout to prepare students for fieldwork. Students and those using the walkabout are encouraged to submit their own virtual walkabouts for possible archiving with the ADS. The site is easily navigable through the standard ADS interface and users are required to accept the ADS terms and conditions prior to accessing the resource. The site requires a JavaScript enabled browser to view the archived walkabouts and a digital camera or standard camera and scanner together with image processing software are required to create a virtual walkabout...|$|E

40|$|Views {{and pans}} among {{the ruins of}} San Francisco after the {{earthquake}} and fire. A scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0100] The camera, positioned at {{the southwest corner of}} Mission and 5 th streets, makes a hurried and jerky pan from the east side of 5 th Street eastward to the south side of Mission Street. At the start of the pan, the ruined Lincoln School building is seen, with the dark profile of the Flood Building behind it on Market Street. The camera <b>pans</b> <b>right</b> on a long row of windows in the ruined west wall of the Emporium department store [0130]. The tent in the foreground is probably a temporary "office" of the business formerly on the site. The <b>pan</b> continues further <b>right</b> and looks northeast down Mission Street. [0338] The Rialto Building stands in the distance. The camera <b>pans</b> farther <b>right,</b> to another tent and a sign [...] "Safes opened 105 5 th Street" [0420]. Many safes fused shut {{in the heat of the}} fire and others had to be cooled for weeks before being opened. [0441] The camera is at the southwest corner of 4 th and Market streets, looking northeast across Market Street in afternoon light. The Mutual Savings Bank (two blank walls) is in the background at Geary/Kearny and Market streets. The street traffic is part of the afternoon commute down Market Street to the Ferry Building. [1638] The camera captures a traffic jam on Market Street. The view is probably north, across Market Street just east of California Street. [1835] The view is northwest, near the southwest corner of East and Market streets, just west of the Ferry Building. [2075] In the hazy background are Nob Hill and the south slope of Russian Hill (right). [2135] The view is approximately the same as the previous segment, with a streetcar beginning its run up Market Street. In the hazy distance unburnt dwellings on the summit of Russian Hill are visible. Nob Hill is in the distance, with the rectangular silhouette of the Fairmont Hotel. [3000] In this very brief scene the camera focuses on workers removing debris. The view is east on Mission Street between 4 th and 3 rd streets, just east of St. Patrick's Church, part of which is visible at left. [3075] The camera pans to show the demolition of the facade of St. Patrick's Church. The camera is southwest of the church on Mission Street between 4 th and 3 rd streets. After a brief view of ruins along Market Street, the camera <b>pans</b> <b>right</b> (eastward) past two men near a fire engine [3270], to the church facade being demolished [3957].

50|$|After {{a credit}} sequence, Carousel opens on {{a police officer}} {{kneeling}} on a parked police car. The camera pans across and travels past an armoured van in mid-explosion. It continues {{to the entrance of}} a hospital, where two officers are engaged in a firefight with a criminal in a clown mask, while a further two are dragging a clown out of a station wagon. The camera passes into the hospital to a reception desk, where a clown is kicking an officer through a glass window while others come up behind him. The camera rotates upwards to reveal another clown/officer pair in midair after falling from a balcony above. The camera travels up to the second floor, through an explosion into a corridor filled with clowns and officers, with several civilians cowering against the floor. Passing a ward where more figures are shooting at each other, the camera reaches a clown carrying a sack of cash who has just been shot in the back, before <b>panning</b> <b>right</b> to reveal a team of officers around a man stripped to his underwear. The camera exits the window and returns to ground level, to the pointing officer on the car (revealed to be number 219) at the start. It scrolls past the officer, who hides a clown mask and a sack of cash, revealing that he is in fact one of the criminals. The piece then begins a fresh loop from the beginning.|$|R
