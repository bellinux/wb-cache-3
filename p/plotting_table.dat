25|$|The {{system had}} some weaknesses. The line was {{composed}} {{of a series of}} contiguous boxes. The boundaries were defined by the limitations of the Würzburg radar. The awkwardness of the plotting system used within each box prior to 1942 and the absence of an air-mounted IFF (Identification Friend or Foe), meant that only one fighter at a time could be controlled from the ground. One Würzburg controlled the fighter, the other tracked the bomber. The two plots were not represented on a single radarscope; they came from two different individual operators, each of whom projected a different coloured circle on a <b>plotting</b> <b>table.</b> The controller radioed directions to the fighter on the basis of data provided by the <b>plotting</b> <b>table.</b> Until IFF became available, blips could not be identified.|$|E
25|$|Aerospace System Operators (ASOps or Scopies) were {{responsible}} for the tracking and identification of every flight - military and civil, that entered or left the UK Air Defence Region (UKADR). This was a labour-intensive task in the days before automatic initiation and tracking systems, but a big improvement on the <b>plotting</b> <b>table</b> and small perspex plaques with information written on them. The School of Fighter Control continued to teach plotting and writing backwards until 1990.|$|E
25|$|After forming up, {{the sector}} {{controller}} asked the squadron {{to set up}} their pip-squeak system {{so they could be}} tracked. Once their location was measured and transferred to the sector <b>plotting</b> <b>table,</b> the controller would relay instructions to the formation leader. Vectoring was accomplished using the methods developed in the Biggin Hill exercises in 1935, with the sector commander comparing the location of the friendly aircraft with the hostile plots being transferred from group and arranging the interception. As the fighters were faster and often reached the interception point first, they orbited the location, giving them time to climb and seek an advantageous position.|$|E

25|$|Staff in {{a typical}} Battery Observation Post {{measured}} bearing and range to the target. This information was plotted on a <b>plotting</b> <b>table,</b> which converted target data into gun data of azimuth and elevation, which in turn was called continuously to the sight setters on the guns. The standard rangefinder used was a vertical base rangefinder, whose effective range depended upon the height above sea level. For the rangefinder to be useful to the maximum range of the guns, {{it was necessary for}} it to be mounted as high as possible above sea level. The topography of False Cape favoured a vertical base rangefinder, set high on the ridge behind the gun emplacements.|$|E
25|$|To {{counter air}} raids on London during World War I, E. B. Ashmore {{constructed}} a system {{known as the}} London Air Defence Area (LADA). Ashmore put defensive weapons into three rings around the city, searchlights and anti-aircraft artillery in the outer ring, fighter aircraft in the middle ring, and the innermost ring in the city contained more anti-aircraft guns. Ashmore set up a large <b>plotting</b> <b>table</b> at Horse Guards in London. Information from spotters was relayed to this central room where wooden blocks were placed on a large map to indicate the location of aircraft and other information.

500|$|This {{information}} was simultaneously {{sent to the}} headquarters of each Group where it was cross-checked through a filter room before being sent through to another operations room, housed in an underground bunker.
