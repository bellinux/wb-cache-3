50|$|Tearing is {{the act of}} {{breaking}} apart a material by force, {{without the aid of}} a cutting tool. A tear in a piece of paper, fabric, or some other similar object {{may be the result of}} the intentional effort with one's bare hands, or be accidental. Unlike a cut, which is generally on a straight or patterned line controlled by a tool such as scissors, a tear is generally uneven and, for the most part, unplanned. An exception is a tear along a <b>perforated</b> <b>line,</b> as found on a roll of toilet paper or paper towels, which has been previously partially cut, so the effort of tearing will probably produce a straight line.|$|E

It was Welex who had developed the explosive lined shaped charge used for well perforation. As now competitors to Welex, GO was unable to buy perforating charges and in turn developed their own, with a lawsuit by Welex being the result. In 1962, the court's ruling went in favor of GO, but only after the United States Justice Department stepped in and eased the apparent constraint of trade. Being forced to manufacture their own <b>perforating</b> <b>line</b> was apparently a positive step for GO, as they grew {{to be the largest}} supplier of jet charges in the world. The Perforating Supply Company (PSC) was formed as a subsidiary of GO, and made perforating supplies readily available to other independent wireline companies. Over the next six years, many perforating companies were started, with GO providing both the technical and financial aid.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{all these}} billboards were painted in large studios. The image was {{projected}} on {{the series of}} paper panels {{that made up the}} billboard. Line drawings were done, then traced with a pounce wheel that created <b>perforated</b> <b>lines.</b> The patterns were then [...] "pounced" [...] onto the board with a chalk filled pounce bag, marking the outlines of the figures or objects. Using oil paints, artists would use large brushes to paint the image. Once the panels were installed using hydraulic cranes, artists would go up on the installed billboard and touch up the edges between panels. These large, painted billboards were especially popular in Los Angeles where historic firms such as Foster & Kleiser and Pacific Outdoor Advertising dominated the industry. Eventually, these painted billboards gave way to graphic reproduction, but hand-painted billboards are still in use in some areas where only a single board or two is required. The [...] "Sunset Strip" [...] in Los Angeles is one area where hand-painted billboards can still be found, usually to advertise upcoming films or albums.|$|R

5000|$|On the {{occasion}} of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC, Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted [...] "Color Your Own" [...] postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor. There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme [...] "From gratitude springs happiness". Each postcard consists of the actual picture card with an attached small strip, which can be torn off at the <b>perforated</b> <b>line.</b> The back side is divided, with the message part also divided into two. The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each - the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude ("What are we grateful for") on {{the upper part of the}} message area for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick an US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower message area and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine water and salt distribution patterns in a soil irrigated by pairs of double-chamber, perforated polyethylene tubes. The study consisted of two experiments: a water distribution experiment and a salt distribution experiment. Both experiments were conducted at the same site with experimental plots having two <b>perforated</b> <b>lines</b> 9 m long, spaced 0. 60 m. The tubing had outer orifices 0. 5 mm in diameter spaced 0. 30 m along the tubes. The water distribution experiment consisted of water application to the bare soil for periods of time of 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours. After each test a trench was dug normal to the irrigation tubes and samples were taken to determine soil moisture on a dry weight basis. Moisture profiles are presented for the various tests. The salt distribution experiment was conducted in the Fall of 1973 and repeated in the Spring of 1974. It consisted of four irrigation treatments comprising two irrigation levels and two levels of salt in the irrigation water (327 and 2000 milligrams per liter of salts). Experimental plots were planted with lettuce and soil samples taken after planting and after harvesting the lettuce. Soil samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract, pH, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and nitrates. Saturation extract conductivity profiles in the soil are presented for different treatments. After planting and after harvest concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, nitrates and pH values are also shown. Seasonal water application and lettuce yields are presented for both trials Water movement in the soil was 2 to 3 times greater in the horizontal than in the vertical direction. Wetted soil volume showed a high positive correlation with both the volume of water applied and with time of application. Salt accumulation occurred mainly at the soil surface between the irrigation tubes and away from the main root zone of the plants. The surface accumulation was followed by a leached zone. There {{were no significant differences in}} yield among plots receiving different treatments. Seasonal water application was less than half of the seasonal amount of water normally applied for furrow irrigated lettuce in the Tucson area. It was higher than experimental determinations of seasonal consumptive use for lettuce at Mesa, Arizona. The study indicated that trickle irrigation with water of high salt content is likely to cause a high surface concentration of salts. Application of extra amounts of water by the trickle system, or another method, is recommended to leach the salts to a depth below the crop root zone...|$|R
40|$|An {{innovative}} interim {{surface barrier}} was constructed {{as a demonstration}} project at the Hanford Site's TY Tank Farm. The purpose of the demonstration barrier is to stop rainwater and snowmelt from entering the soils within the tank farm and driving contamination from past leaks and spills toward the ground water.

Approximately 2, 400 cubic yards of fill material {{were added to the}} tank farm to create a sloped surface that will gravity drain precipitation to collection points where it will be routed through buried drain lines to an evapotranspiration basin adjacent to the farm. The evapotranspiration basin is a lined basin with a network of <b>perforated</b> drain <b>lines</b> covered with soil and planted with native grasses.

40|$|An equivalent, but variant {{form of the}} Riemann {{functional}} equation is explored, and several discoveries are made. Properties of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) from which a necessary and sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} zeros in the critical strip are deduced. This in turn, by an indirect route, eventually produces a simple, solvable, differential equation for arg(ζ(s)) on the critical line s= 1 / 2 +iρ, the consequences of which are explored, and the "LogZeta" function is introduced. A singular linear transform between the real and imaginary components of ζ and ζ^' on the critical line is derived, and an implicit relationship for locating a zero (ρ=ρ_ 0) on the critical line is found between the arguments of ζ(1 / 2 +iρ) and ζ^'(1 / 2 +iρ). Notably, the Volchkov criterion, a Riemann Hypothesis (RH) equivalent is analytically evaluated and verified to be half equivalent to RH, but RH is not proven. Numerical results are presented, some of which lead to the identification of anomalous zeros, whose existence in turn suggests that well-established, traditional derivations such as the Volchkov criterion and counting theorems require re-examination. It is proven that the derivative ζ^'(1 / 2 +iρ) will never vanish on the <b>perforated</b> critical <b>line</b> (ρ≠ρ_ 0). Traditional asymptotic and counting results are obtained in an untraditional manner, yielding insight into the nature of ζ(1 / 2 +iρ) as well as very accurate asymptotic estimates for distribution bounds and the density of zeros on the critical line.

Before setting the trial, the slugs were adapted to laboratory conditions. The testing was conducted using {{a modified version of}} the method proposed by Godan (1983) and Wiktor (1989). The slugs were kept in arenas under controlled conditions (20 - 24 oC temperature, 80 - 90 % relative air humidity, no air stream, diffuse daylight). Smaller(15. 5 x 15. 5 x 7 cm) and larger (28 x 17. 5 x 7 cm) arenas were used, depending on slug numbers, and different rates of food and bait were administered.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of suspended sediment and stream discharge, and their interrelationships, on intake rates in the Santa Cruz River. A lysimeter-flume, 100 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, was constructed at the Field Laboratory. The interior boundaries of the unit were lined with butyl rubber to prevent leakage. A <b>perforated</b> pipe <b>line</b> was installed {{in the bottom of}} the lysimeter-flume to permit drainage of percolating water. The unit was filled with representative materials from the contiguous river bed. Cortrol sections were installed immediately before and after the flume to promote stabilization of flow conditions through the unit. A six-inch Parshall flume was located at the inlet of the upstream control section for measuring application rates during testing. A steel hopper, constructed and installed near the upstream control section, was used to store and meter sediment into the applied water in controlled amounts. The water supply for testing was obtained from the Field Laboratory. Three flow rates, 300 gpm, 450 gpm and 600 gpm, and three sediment concentrations, 10, 000 ppm, 20, 000 ppm, and 30, 000 ppm, were selected for experimentation. The nine possible treatment combinations from these application rates were replicated twice, so that a total of 18 trials {{were conducted}}, The combinations were tested in random order. During each trial, water and suspended sediment were metered onto the lysimeter-flume at the required rates. Infiltration rates were determined by measuring the discharge from the interior drain line. Recharge rates varied from 4. 2 feet/day to 5. 0 feet/day in the streambed model. In general, the effects of discharge and suspended sediment in Santa Cruz materials were similar to those reported for Rillito Creek materials. Increasing discharge rates appeared to increase infiltration rates indirectly through the effect of stream velocity on bed erosion and sedimentation. Increasing suspended sediment concentrations were found to be highly significant in reducing infiltration rates...|$|R
60|$|The {{evidence}} of recent elevation is here more satisfactory. The bay of San Carlos is {{in most parts}} bounded by precipitous cliffs from about ten to forty feet in height, their bases being separated from the present line of tidal action by a talus, a few feet in height, covered with vegetation. In one sheltered creek (west of P. Arena), instead of a loose talus, there was a bare sloping bank of tertiary mudstone, <b>perforated,</b> above the <b>line</b> of the highest tides, by numerous shells of a Pholas now common in the harbour. The upper extremities of these shells, standing upright in their holes with grass growing out of them, were abraded {{about a quarter of}} an inch, to the same level with the surrounding worn strata. In other parts, I observed (as at Pudeto) a great beach, formed of comminuted shells, twenty feet above the present shore. In other parts again, there were small caves worn into the foot of the low cliffs, and protected from the waves by the talus with its vegetation: one such cave, which I examined, had its mouth about twenty feet, and its bottom, which was filled with sand containing fragments of shells and legs of crabs, from eight to ten feet above high-water mark. From these several facts, and from the appearance of the upraised shells, I inferred that the elevation had been quite recent; and on inquiring from Mr. Williams, the Portmaster, {{he told me he was}} convinced that the land had risen, or the sea fallen, four feet within the last four years. During this period, there had been one severe earthquake, but no particular change of level was then observed; from the habits of the people who all keep boats in the protected creeks, it is absolutely impossible that a rise of four feet could have taken place suddenly and been unperceived. Mr. Williams believes that the change has been quite gradual. Without the elevatory movement continues at a quick rate, there can be no doubt that the sea will soon destroy the talus of earth at the foot of the cliffs round the bay, and will then reach its former lateral extension, but not of course its former level: some of the inhabitants assured me that one such talus, with a footpath on it, was even already sensibly decreasing in width.|$|R
40|$|The {{seeds of}} many plant species form seed {{banks in the}} soil to {{synchronise}} seedling emergence with the occurrence of favourable conditions for plant establishment. This adaptation to reduce seedling mortality does however come at a cost, as it increases the probability of mortality at the seed stage, for example through decomposition by micro-organisms, among which saprophytic fungi deserve special mention. Within this PhD project, two literature reviews were carried out to document {{the current state of}} research regarding the influence of these fungi on the demography of buried seeds, and regarding the interactions between soil fungi and the soil mesofauna. Based on these literature reviews, hypotheses were derived to be tested in the experimental part of my PhD project. Seed burial studies carried out across a range of ecosystems to compare the demographic fates of fungicide-treated seeds and of untreated seeds have demonstrated a negative effect of such fungi on the longevity of buried seeds. Soil fungi themselves are consumed by a wide range of soil-dwelling animals. It seems possible that the fungivorous soil mesofauna, through its feeding activity, may be able to reduce fungal attack of seeds buried in the soil, and thus to increase seed survival. In two experiments I investigated whether this can indeed be the case. The first experiment was carried out under constant environmental conditions conducive to both the growth of soil fungi and the reproduction of collembolans, {{and at the same time}} inhibitive to seed germination. This experiment was conducted in Petri dish Ã Â¯Ã Â¿Ã Â½microcosmsÃ Â¯Ã Â¿Ã Â½ containing soil and the seeds of four different grassland plant species. At the beginning of a five-week incubation period, individuals of the collembolan Protaphorura fimata were added to a subset of Petri dishes. This resulted in an increase in the number of viable ungerminated seeds at the end of the experiment in three of the species, Centaurea nigra, Dactylis glomerata and Origanum vulgare. In a subsequent field experiment I used <b>perforated</b> steel cylinders <b>lined</b> with gauze and filled with defaunated soil and seeds of 3 grassland plant species as experimental mesocosms, which were buried in autumn. I tested whether similar results to those observed in the first experiment under lab conditions would be found with respect to seedling emergence under field conditions. Again, P. fimata was added to a subset of these mesocosms. Both in C. nigra and in O. vulgare seedling emergence was significantly higher in the presence of added P. fimata. The results of these two experiments allow the conclusion that the fungivorous soil mesofauna may potentially affect plant species composition by promoting some species via a reduction in fungal-induced seed mortality, but not others. In a third experiment I investigated whether methodological variations with respect to use and combination of different fungicides would be able to affect levels of seed mortality attributed to fungal-induced seed decomposition, and also whether dormancy levels, and thus the readiness of seeds to germinate, would be affected by fungicide treatments. For this purpose, in autumn the seeds of three grassland plant species were treated with up to three different fungicides (captan, iprodione and mancozeb) alone and in combination - an untreated control treatment was also included - and buried in the field using seed bags made of nylon stockings. In the following spring, after retrieval of the seed bags, I used germination tests and tetrazolium viability testing to determine levels of seed mortality during the burial period. In two species, Daucus carota and Anthriscus sylvestris, the combination of two fungicides generally resulted in a lower mortality than use of a single fungicide. However, in Daucus the use of all three fungicides in combination generally resulted in a slightly higher mortality than the use of just two fungicides in combination. The use of mancozeb resulted in a longer-lasting increase in dormancy levels in Daucus, whereas a similar effect on seed dormancy in Centaurea nigra was more short-lived. As these effects on seed mortality and dormancy were both species-specific and fungicide-specific, I recommend to conduct pilot studies to investigate such fungicide effects before an actual seed burial study is carried out, and to do so particularly when a study is designed with the aim to measure in situ seedling emergence...|$|R
