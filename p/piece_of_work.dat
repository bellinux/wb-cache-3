5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> they do. It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At {{the end of a}} <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on family trees {{leads to the}} pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

He learned that arranging shots is one of the most important stages of the film making and that even if the editor has a weak <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> he must transfer it by cutting, deleting and adjusting the tempo to a coherent and attractive piece of art.|$|E
25|$|A notable <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> {{translated}} into English is the Wen Xuan, an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature.

Thus the literary translator must {{be familiar with the}} writings, lives, and thought {{of a large number of}} its 130 authors, making the Wen Xuan one of the most difficult literary works to translate.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} for authors and researchers, whether individually or in a team, to spot every mistake or flaw in a complicated <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> This {{is not necessarily a}} reflection on those concerned, but because with a new and perhaps eclectic subject, an opportunity for improvement may be more obvious to someone with special expertise or who simply looks at it with a fresh eye. Therefore, showing work to others increases the probability that weaknesses will be identified and improved. For both grant-funding and publication in a scholarly journal, it is also normally a requirement that the subject is both novel and substantial.|$|E
25|$|Wood-carving {{examples}} of the first eleven centuries of AD are extremely rare. The carved panels of the main doors of St Sabina on the Aventine Hill, Rome, are very interesting specimens of early Christian relief sculpture in wood, dating, as the dresses show, from the 5th century. The doors {{are made up of}} a large number of small square panels, each minutely carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament. A very fine fragment of Byzantine art (11th or 12th centuries) is preserved in a monastery at Mount Athos in Macedonia. It consists of two panels (one above the other) of relief sculpture, surmounted by a semicircular arch of conventional foliage springing from columns ornamented with animals in foliage of spiral form. The capitals and bases are square, each face being carved with a figure. It is a wonderfully fine <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> conceived in the best decorative spirit.|$|E

25|$|The WAAC {{commissioned}} Knight {{to paint}} a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories as the Ministry of Supply were concerned {{at the level of}} disaffection and absenteeism among women in the factories. The resulting painting, made in the autumn of 1942, {{is one of the largest}} oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. It was painted in the Royal Ordnance Factory in Newport, South Wales and shows a young woman, Ruby Loftus, performing a highly skilled <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> on an industrial lathe. The component being worked is the breech ring of a double-barrelled, anti-aircraft gun designed to fire twenty rounds per minute. Any lack of precision in forming the breech ring could result in the gun being destroyed when fired. In peace-time this task would only be performed by a man with eight or nine years' experience but 21-year-old Ruby Loftus mastered the technique after only a year or two of training.|$|E
25|$|Hartnell reprised {{the role}} of the Doctor in Doctor Who during the tenth anniversary story The Three Doctors (1972–73). When Hartnell's wife Heather found out about his planned involvement, she {{informed}} the crew of the show that his failing memory and weakening health prevented him from starring in the special. An agreement was made between the crew and Heather that Hartnell would only be required to sit down during the shoot and read his lines from cue cards. His appearance in this story was his final <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> as an actor. His health had worsened during the early 1970s, and in December 1974 he was admitted to hospital permanently. In early 1975 he suffered a series of strokes brought on by cerebrovascular disease, and died in his sleep of heart failure on 23 April 1975, at the age of 67. He was cremated and his ashes are buried at the Kent and Sussex Crematorium and Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|By 1882 {{nearly half}} the library was {{unrecorded}} in a catalog except {{in the shape of}} brief entries noted in manuscript in interleaved copies of the Cogswell catalog, and cards begun by Brevoort in 1876. A new author catalog was decided on, to include titles of all works received since the first catalog was published, and for this work Charles Alexander Nelson was hired in 1881. Nelson was a Harvard graduate fitted for this new task by service in the Harvard library and by a wide experience in the Boston book trade. The new printed catalog covered up to 1880. It had a fuller quotation of titles than the first one, a more extensive analysis of the contents of collected or comprehensive works, and greater attention to securing full names of authors. It appeared in four volumes, 1886–1888. As a catalog and as a printed book, it was a thoroughly satisfactory <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The entire cost of printing was borne by John Jacob Astor III and amounted to nearly $40,000. With the publication complete, Nelson left the library in 1888.|$|E
