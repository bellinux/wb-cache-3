I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionary</b> from my bag and looked them out.|$|E
5000|$|The Pentaglot Dictionary (Chinese: 御製五體清文鑑, Yuzhi Wuti Qing Wenjian; {{the term}} 清文, Qingwen, [...] "Qing {{language}}", was {{another name for}} the Manchu language in Chinese), also known as the Manchu <b>Polyglot</b> <b>Dictionary,</b> was a dictionary of major imperial languages compiled in the late Qianlong era of the Qing dynasty (also said to be compiled in 1794). The work contains Manchu lexemes and their translations into various administrative languages such as Tibetan, Mongolian, post-classical or vernacular Chagatai (Eastern Turki, now known as Modern Uyghur since 1921) and Chinese.|$|E
50|$|On 11 March 1812, {{a devastating}} fire caused mass {{destruction}} in the printing office. Important documents, account papers, manuscripts, 14 types in Eastern languages, a bulk of types sent from England, 12 hundred reams of paper and other essential raw materials were gutted. The manuscripts of the translation of the Ramayana were also destroyed and the project was never resumed. The manuscripts of the <b>Polyglot</b> <b>Dictionary</b> and the blue print of the Telinga Grammar were also destroyed. Luckily the presses themselves were unharmed. It is estimated that property worth Rs 70,000 was lost.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} {{a survey of the}} early <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionaries</b> which paired Polish with English, {{based on the premise that}} the polyglots can be {{considered}} as predeces-sors of bilingual dictionaries proper. Following this rationale, the authoress examines chronologically the first three of the multilingual endeavours: Ambrogio Calepino’s Dictionarium undecim linguarum … (1590), Hieronymus Megiser’s Thesaurus poly-glottus: vel, dictionarium multilingue … (1603), and Georg Henisch’s Teütsche Sprach und Weissheit. Thesaurus linguae and sapientiae Germanicae … (1616). The focus is primarily on the linguistic material of the polyglots, but the assumed aims and readership are also tackled briefly. As bilingual wordbooks have traditionally catered to the needs of users of one or both of the respective languages, the <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionaries</b> are addition-ally looked at from the perspective of Polish-English language contact in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. 1...|$|R
50|$|Two further <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionaries</b> followed, the Lexicon nosologicum polyglotton omnium morborum … , {{a medical}} {{dictionary}} in ten languages, published by Nemnich himself in 1801, and the Comtoir-Lexicon in Neun Sprachen of 1803. Again, an English {{version of the}} latter was prepared; it was printed in Hamburg and published in 1803 as Counting house lexicon in nine languages.|$|R
50|$|Nemnich was a {{compulsive}} observer and collector of facts but he lacked depth and originality {{and the ability}} to analyse his facts. His visits to Britain and other European countries reveal him in this light rather than as an industrial spy or as a political economist. He was obviously a natural linguist, a gift which he put to good use in his various <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionaries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} these was his Allgemeines Polyglotten-Lexicon der Natur-Geschichte (Universal <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionary</b> of natural history). It {{takes the form of}} a list of German terms in all {{branches}} of natural history with their corresponding terms in eight other European languages. It was published in parts, comprising in all about 2,400 pages, between 1793 and 1798. With the exception of the first part, all were published by Nemnich himself, a practice that he was frequently to adopt with subsequent publications. This was followed by a commercial dictionary in twelve languages, the Waaren-lexicon (Dictionary of wares) of 1797-1802. In parallel with the German edition an English version (for which subscriptions were solicited in the press in 1796) was also prepared for the British market and published in December 1798.|$|E
50|$|From the {{printing}} press at the mission came translations of the Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects. Many of these languages had never been printed before; William Ward had to create punches for the type by hand. Carey had begun translating literature and sacred writings from the original Sanskrit into English to make them accessible to his own countryman. On 11 March 1812, {{a fire in the}} print shop caused £10,000 in damages and lost work. Amongst the losses were many irreplaceable manuscripts, including much of Carey's translation of Sanskrit literature and a <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionary</b> of Sanskrit and related languages, which would have been a seminal philological work had it been completed. However, the press itself and the punches were saved, and the mission was able to continue printing in six months. In Carey's lifetime, the mission printed and distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages and dialects.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{application}} of aiding in international commercial correspondence translation has needed {{no end of}} databases and dictionaries. This paper introduces the application dictionaries and the specific problems. a. The <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionary</b> When a <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionary</b> is drawn up, problems that do not exist when bilingual dictionaries are drawn up occur. These problems are connected with the existence of synonyms and homonyms. If we start with a word for which {{we want to find}} the translation in several languages, the following situation may occur: the word may have several synonyms which do not all have an identical meaning or several series of synonyms may be derived from this- synonyms that are different among them. An example that can show the complexity of the problem is the word "house". It has several synonyms: residence, home, building, house, family, household, dynasty, marriage etc. Other synonymous series derive from the word "house " and they are represented by the words: Lord's House, pawnshop, madhouse, healt...|$|E

40|$|Back in {{the early}} 1950 s anyone who {{happened}} {{to work in the}} library of the Department of Botany at the British Museum would be startled every now and again by a fierce volley of expletives that emanated from somewhere on the upper floor. Traced to their source, these would be found to have come from a little, cross-looking, very old man bent over an array of open books and scraps of paper in what appeared at first sight to be a state of total confusion. He was a one-time member of the staff, long since retired, the more curious visitors would be gently informed, who was toiling away at a <b>polyglot</b> <b>dictionary</b> of botanical terms, which, alas, there was no likelihood of his completing before he was taken from this world. And that, sad to say, did in due course {{turn out to be the}} case. The old man was a certain Antony Gepp, who in his time had done distinguished work as the Department's specialist in algology. And unless I am seriously mistaken, a Miss Branfill whose name features in the earliest list of members of our ancestor, the Botanical Society of London, was none other than his mother. A girl of sixteen then, she was to marry at twenty-nine, give birth to him when in her fortieth year- and leave him to live on until he was well into his nineties. Thus some of us here today have been privileged to touch hands, as it were, with the founders of th...|$|E
