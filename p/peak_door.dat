30|$|In these simulations, {{both the}} {{existing}} rolling stock (Comeng) and the new concept carriage are populated to {{the capacity of the}} simulation with 250 passengers seated and standing. There are no datasets indicating the exact numbers of passenger exchanges, boarding, alighting and standees, so a number of simulations were created, incrementally increasing the percentage of passengers alighting and boarding. The percentage increments are based upon an existing study originally contracted by the Melbourne Transport Operating Company, in which Weston’s formula was used to calculate a graphical distribution of anticipated dwell times. In each simulation, the number of passengers either boarding or alighting is increased by 5  %. The distribution of these passengers, both within the carriage and on the platform, is randomly driven by the Unity software and so no two simulations can be exactly repeated. For each of the conditions, both carriages fall within the generally accepted dwell time of 20  s; however, the <b>peak</b> <b>door</b> two-corridor solution (Fig.  7) gives consistently quicker passenger exchanges. Only for very small numbers (5  % equating to 14 patrons) were exchange times roughly comparable. As the number of passengers in the boarding and alighting exchange increased, the extra door and corridor space had an observable impact on dwell time reduction.|$|E
30|$|The {{operational}} {{mechanism by}} which these <b>peak</b> <b>doors</b> are implemented would be aligned with the start and finish of services. A change in the prevailing culture of passenger expectation would be required for patrons to come to expect extra doors to be operative at certain times of the day. This concept opens up the notion of internal space being flexible beyond the use of folding seating. For most of the day, the services can manage a dispersed patronage through the carriage, and, with the exceptions of some accessibility issues, only at peak times do crowding, poor dispersal and lengthened dwell times reflect negatively on the carriage design. The use of <b>peak</b> <b>doors,</b> utilised only temporarily, overcomes {{the issue of the}} loss of seats due to multiple vestibule spaces.|$|R

Due {{to the need for}} more capital a new company was incorporated in 1906 and a new plant completed by 1908. A <b>peak</b> on <b>Door</b> Jam Mountain, above the hamlet and plant, is named after him. The Loder name is still connected with the area.|$|R

5000|$|Snow {{based his}} villainous Magical Mimics on the Phanfasms in Baum's Emerald City. In the {{eleventh}} chapter of that book, Baum states that [...] "the Erbs {{are the most}} powerful and merciless of all evil spirits, and the Phanfasms of Phantastico belong to the race of Erbs." [...] Snow makes his Mimics another type of Erb; they live within the hollows of Mount Illuso, a <b>peak</b> next <b>door</b> to Mount Phantastico. Like the Phanfasms, the Mimics are ugly and malevolent shape-shifters; they have the additional trick of being able to copy the appearance of humans, simply by stepping into their shadows. People duplicated in this way are paralyzed by the magic, but remain conscious.|$|R
50|$|The {{particle}} filter central to MCL can approximate multiple {{different kinds of}} probability distributions, since it is a non-parametric representation. Some other Bayesian localization algorithms, such as the Kalman filter (and variants, the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter), assume the belief of the robot is close to being a Gaussian distribution and do not perform well for situations where the belief is multimodal. For example, a robot in a long corridor with many similar-looking doors may arrive at a belief that has a <b>peak</b> for each <b>door,</b> but the robot is unable to distinguish which door it is at. In such situations, the {{particle filter}} can give better performance than parametric filters.|$|R

40|$|The Green Train (in Swedish ‖Gröna Tåget‖) is a {{high-speed}} train concept, that is economical, environmentally friendly and attractive to travellers. It is suited to specific Nordic conditions with a harsh winter climate, often varying demand and mixed passenger and freight operations on non-perfect track. The main proposal is a train for {{speeds up to}} 250 km/h equipped with carbody tilt for short travelling times on electrified mainlines. The concept {{is intended to be}} a flexible platform for long-distance and fast regional passenger trains, interoperable in Scandinavia, i. e. Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The Gröna Tåget programme delivers a collection of ideas, proposals and technical solutions for rail operators, infrastructure managers and industry. This is part A of the final report, dealing with market, economy and service aspects, with an emphasis on the areas where research has been done within the Gröna Tåget research and development programme. Passenger valuations and economy in train traffic exposed to competition are controlling factors {{in the design of the}} train concept. One important measure to achieve better economy in the train traffic with 15 % lower total costs and the possibility to reduce fares is to use wide-bodied trains that can accommodate more seats with good comfort. Travel on some studied routes in Sweden may increase by 30 % compared to today’sexpress trains through shorter travelling times, lower fares and more direct connections, which are possible with shorter, flexible trainsets. Gröna Tåget will be designed to give good punctuality even during <b>peak</b> load periods. <b>Doors,</b> interior design, luggage handling and vestibules with lifts for disabled travellers must be dimensioned for full trains. A well-considered design reduces dwell times and delays. Capacity utilisation on the lines increases with greater speed differences between express trains and slower trains in mixed traffic. Punctual stops and skip-stop operation for regional trains are a few of the measures that compensate for the increase in capacity utilisation and reduce disruptions. QC 20120124 Gröna Tåge...|$|R
