40|$|Image {{retargeting}} technique attracts {{more and}} more attention for convenient image display on mobile devices. However, current methods can't well balance the retargeting efficiency and effectiveness, which limits their applications on the mobile devices with low computing ability. In this paper, we propose a novel image retargeting approach by combining uniform sampling and structure-aware curve-edge grid representation. We first decompose the original image into curve-edge grids by dynamic programming, and then generate the target image by uniformly sampling the pixels within the grids. The simplicity of retargeting <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> strategy enables our approach to easily achieve good computational efficiency. Furthermore, the constraint of curve-edge grid representation ensures important content emphasis and image structure preservation in the target image. Experiments on different images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, in cattle herds in the United Kingdom is increasing, resulting in substantial economic losses. The European badger (Meles meles) is implicated as a wildlife reservoir {{and is the}} subject of control measures aimed at reducing incidence in cattle populations. Understanding the epidemiology of M. bovis in badger populations is essential to direct control interventions and understand disease spread; however, accurate diagnosis in live animals is challenging and currently uses invasive methods. Here we present a non-invasive diagnostic <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> regime using field sampling of latrines and detection of M. bovis with qPCR, the results of which strongly correlate with the results of immunoassay testing in the field at the social group level. This method allows M. bovis infection in badger populations to be monitored without trapping and provides additional information on the quantity of bacterial DNA shed. Our approach may therefore provide valuable insights into the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis in badger populations and inform disease control interventions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Video stimulated recall (VSR) is {{a method}} of {{enhancing}} participants' accounts of the consultation using a video recording of the event to encourage and prompt recall in a post consultation interview. VSR is used in education and education research, {{and to a lesser}} extent in medical and nursing research. Little is known about the sort of research questions that lend themselves best to the use of VSR or the impact of the specific VSR procedure on study quality. This systematic review describes studies in primary care that have used the method and aims to identify the strengths, weaknesses and role of VSR. Methods. A systematic literature search has been conducted to identify primary care consultation research using VSR. Two authors undertook data extraction and quality appraisal of identified papers and a narrative synthesis has been conducted to draw together the findings. In addition, theory on classifying VSR procedures derived from other disciplines is used as a lens through which to assess the relevance of VSR technique. Results: Twenty eight publications were identified that reported VSR in primary care doctor-patient consultation research. VSR was identified as a useful method to explore specific events within the consultation, mundane or routine occurrences, non-spoken events and appears to particularly add value to doctor's post consultation accounts. However, studies frequently had insufficient description of methods to properly evaluate both the quality of the study, and the influence of VSR technique on findings. Conclusions: VSR is particularly useful for study of specific consultation events when a 'within case' approach is used in analysis, comparing and contrasting findings from the consultation and post-consultation interview. Alignment of the choice of VSR <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>sampling</b> to the study research question was established as particularly important in the quality of studies. Future researchers may consider the role of process evaluation to understand further the impact of research design on data yielded and the acceptability of the method to participants...|$|E

40|$|We {{established}} our bio-repository in October 2002. One of {{the unique}} aspects of our bio-repository {{is that it is}} based on post-clinical test samples. Although the post-clinical test sample-based storage is beneficial because ample clinical information is available for each <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>samples</b> are to be refreshed regularly, many bio-bankers are hesitant to store them because of the possible problems of de-identification <b>procedures</b> <b>and</b> <b>sample</b> quality. Currently, we have two different types of sample, not de-identified status and de-identified status. Most of the samples for storage are not de-identified status. A portion of the samples are transferred to new tubes before and after being frozen, without clinical patient identifi-cations and the status is de-identified. This tube transfer is the only de-identification pro-cedure in our bio-repository so far. After a procedure of de-identification, these samples are stored. The de-identified samples are collected under various project-based schemes. The quality standards of our samples are established by two factors: pre-analytical quality control efforts, and record keeping of sample history by sample tracking system. All the samples have been phlebotomized under strict control of pre-analytical requirements. By record keeping of sample history with the sample tracking system, we can tell the exact temperature and elapsed time in various situations since the phlebotomy procedure or on arrival at the clinical laboratory. In this article, we will disclose how we have dealt with the de-identification <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>sample</b> quality.

This feature enables to model a layer of any thickness by a single element and drastically reduces the cost of computation. The effect of non-locality on the dispersion relation and in turn on the wave response is compared with local (classical) elasticity solutions. A <b>procedure</b> <b>and</b> <b>sample</b> example is outlined to estimate the magnitude of the non-locality parameter by comparing the dispersion relation with lattice dynamics.
