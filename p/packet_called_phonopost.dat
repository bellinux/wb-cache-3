40|$|International {{audience}} In this paper, {{we study}} joint radio resource man- agement (JRRM) in heterogeneous networks and we propose {{a way of}} achieving optimality. We consider a micro, pico or femto cell with two co-localized radio access technologies (RAT), e. g. WLAN and HSDPA. RAT are mainly characterized by the data rates they offer at a given distance of the access point (resp. base station). Dual-technology mobile stations (MS) are initiating downlink <b>packet</b> <b>calls</b> in the considered cell. A network controlled joint RRM algorithm is responsible to assign MS to a RAT, while {{taking into account the}} joint spatial distribution of already accepted MS, the current load of each RAT, the location of the newly accepted <b>packet</b> <b>call</b> and its influence on the global performance. Two classes of JRRM algorithms are considered. In a study based on the Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) theory, we show how to obtain optimal policies for each of these classes. Optimality is here defined through a utility function accounting for user satisfaction and blocking. </p...|$|R
