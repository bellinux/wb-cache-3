5|$|In medieval times, the Sánchez de Badajoz family {{dominated}} {{the area as}} the lords of Barcarrota, near Badajoz, acquiring the property in 1369 when it was granted to Fernán Sánchez de Badajoz by Enrique II. They temporarily lost Barcarrota after a tiff with the Portuguese but soon regained control. Fernán Sánchez's grandson of the same name, son of Garci Sánchez de Badajoz, was both lord of Barcarrota and Mayor of Badajoz in 1434. Garci Sánchez de Badajoz, <b>probably</b> <b>his</b> son, was a notable writer, {{and one of his}} descendants, Diego Sánchez de Badajoz, was also a notable playwright; his Recopilación en metro was published posthumously in 1554.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer and {{in the autumn of}} 1296, between the death of Bishop William Fraser and the arrival of the new Bishop of St Andrews William de Lamberton, Nicholas was placed in charge of the diocese of St Andrews as Official. Nicholas {{thereafter}} can be found exercising a senior role in Scottish affairs, and by early 1301 he was Chancellor of Scotland. In his late 60s or (more <b>probably)</b> <b>his</b> 70s by this stage, Nicholas was an extremely old man, yet in 1307 he became Bishop of Dunblane. He held this position until his death in either 1319 or 1320.|$|E
5000|$|La Tour's {{early work}} shows {{influences}} from Caravaggio, <b>probably</b> via <b>his</b> Dutch followers, and the genre scenes of cheats—as in The Fortune Teller —and fighting beggars clearly {{derive from the}} Dutch Caravaggisti, and <b>probably</b> also <b>his</b> fellow-Lorrainer, Jacques Bellange. These are believed to date from relatively early in his career.|$|R

5|$|Strabo {{married into}} equally illustrious families. He may have married a {{daughter}} of Quintus Aelius Tubero, allying himself with the more prestigious Aelian gens. Lucius Seius Tubero, who became suffect consul in AD 18, was <b>probably</b> <b>his</b> son. Strabo's last wife was Cosconia Gallita, sister of Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis (suffect consul in AD 10) and Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio (suffect consul in AD 2) and perhaps half-sister of Quintus Junius Blaesus (suffect consul in AD 10). Sejanus {{could have been a}} child of this marriage. He was later adopted into the Aelian gens by Gaius Aelius Gallus, and by Roman custom became known as Lucius Aelius Seianus or simply as Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren was a {{prolific}} artist and produced thousands of original paintings {{in a number}} of diverse styles. This wide range in painting and drawing styles often irritated art critics. Some of his typical works are classical still lifes in convincing 17th century manner, Impressionistic paintings of people frolicking on lakes or beaches, jocular drawings where the subject is drawn with rather odd features, Surrealistic paintings with combined fore- and backgrounds. Van Meegeren's portraits, however, are <b>probably</b> <b>his</b> finest works.|$|E
5|$|I. C. Filitti {{studied at}} Saint Sava National College, {{where he was}} colleagues with future {{politician}} (and adversary) Ion G. Duca. He was an eminent student, who earned top distinctions annually, {{and moved on to}} study at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. His first ever published work as a historian was a French-language tome, Le Rôle diplomatique des phanariotes de 1700 à 1821 ("The Diplomatic Role of Phanariotes from 1700 to 1821"). Signed Jean C. Filitti, it was <b>probably</b> <b>his</b> Licence ès Lettres, and, although receiving good reviews, was never listed by its author in his official résumés. He became a Doctor of Law in 1904, when he published the first draft of his study about Regulamentul Organic as the first ever Romanian constitution.|$|E

5|$|LeDuc {{made his}} AWA {{television}} debut on August 2, 1975 defeating Angel Rivera. LeDuc was given wins over Buddy Wolff and Boris Breznikoff (Nicolai Volkoff) before forming {{the team with}} Larry Hennig. Leduc and Hennig first teamed on September 12, 1975 in Denver, Colorado losing to Jimmy and Johnny Valiant. Leduc and Hennig feuded with the Valiant Brothers for several months before entering a feud with Baron Von Raschke and Mad Dog Vachon. Jos and Larry also received a few title shots against AWA tag champs Blackjack Lanza and Bobby Duncum in August 1976. <b>Probably</b> <b>his</b> most memorable accomplishment while working for the promotion was a bus-pulling stunt filmed in Minneapolis that was also used in promo videos while appearing in the Memphis and Atlanta territories, among others. LeDuc departed the AWA in September 1976.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Greater Poland felt quite safe when he {{was invited}} to a meeting {{organized}} by Henry IV Probus. The meeting took place probably on 9 February 1281 in one of the Silesian villages; however, the Duke of Wrocław had another plan – he broke all the rules of hospitality, imprisoned the three princes who where invited (Przemysł II, Henry V the Fat of Legnica, and Henry III of Głogów), and forced them to make political concessions. This action was made even more outrageous by the fact that only four years earlier Przemysł II and Henry III risked their lives and armies to save Henry IV Probus in the Battle of Stolec, which ended with victory of Henry V the Fat, the third guest of this meeting. Historians speculate that the reason for the Duke of Wrocław to make this radical move was <b>probably</b> <b>his</b> desire to increase his influence over the neighboring principalities as part of his own plans for a royal coronation.|$|E
