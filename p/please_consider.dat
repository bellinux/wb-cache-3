2500|$|Mayo said, at {{the close}} of her Senate Committee testimony, [...] "I was burned by sexual abuse in the early 70’s; we’re being burned by the false {{accusation}} of it now. An internet lynch mob can go on forever, but the law should protect innocent people from legal charges they can’t defend, like those from the distant past. The current statute gives survivors sufficient time for litigation, and a lifetime to bring charges to criminal court. Survivors and non-survivors alike need legal protection. The law as it stands, does both. Until you’ve experienced your life ripped open by false accusations, <b>please</b> <b>consider</b> that what happened to us can happen to anyone. That puts this proposal squarely in the category of more-harm-than-good." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 December 1941, the Pacific War {{broke out}} when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Curtin {{addressed}} {{the nation on}} the radio, saying, [...] "Men and women of Australia...we are at war with Japan. This is the gravest hour of our history.

[...] Curtin cabled US President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill on 23 December, saying, [...] "The fall of Singapore would mean the isolation of the Philippines, the fall of the Netherlands East Indies and attempts to smother all other bases. It is in your power to meet the situation...we would gladly accept United States commanders in the Pacific area. <b>Please</b> <b>consider</b> this as a matter of urgency." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lady Zhen bore Cao Pi {{a son and}} a daughter. Their son, Cao Rui, {{later became}} the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Their daughter, whose {{personal}} name was not recorded in history, was referred to as [...] "Princess Dongxiang" [...] (東鄉公主; literally [...] "Princess of the East District") in historical records. Lady Zhen remained humble even though Cao Pi deeply fancied her. She provided encouragement to Cao Pi's other wives who were also adored by him, and comforted those whom he less favoured. She also often urged Cao Pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants, citing the example of the mythical Yellow Emperor. Cao Pi was very pleased. Once, Cao Pi wanted to send Lady Ren (任氏), one of his concubines who fell out favour with him, back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her. When Lady Zhen heard about it, she told her husband, [...] "Lady Ren comes from a reputable clan. I can't match her in terms of moral character and looks. Why do you want to send her away?" [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "She is unruly, impulsive and disobedient. She has made me angry many times before. I'm sending her away." [...] Lady Zhen wept and pleaded with her husband, [...] "Everyone knows that you love and adore me, and they'll think that you're sending Lady Ren away because of me. I fear that I'll be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me. <b>Please</b> <b>consider</b> your decision again carefully." [...] Cao Pi ignored her and sent Lady Ren away.|$|E

5000|$|The {{creator of}} the show, Die Hard screenwriter Steven E. de Souza, {{described}} the series as [...] "a cross between The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents".
