For non-resectable cases, the 5-year survival rate is 0% where {{the disease is}} inoperable because distal lymph nodes show metastases, and less than 5% in general.

40|$|Exposure of rat <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> to an N 2 -gassed buffer {{markedly}} increased 86 Rb outflow.

Pinacidil, cromakalim and diazoxide provoked a sustained increase in 86 Rb outflow. The stimulatory effect of pinacidil was not impaired {{in the absence}} of extracellular Ca 2 + but was completely abolished by glibenclamide. These observations are compatible with the involvement of a metabolic process in the control of the K+ permeability, namely with the existence in rat <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> of ATP-sensitive K+ channels.

50|$|The <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> {{are found}} within the abdomen and carry blood through to the liver. Portal {{hypertension}} is associated with cirrhosis or disease of the liver, or other conditions such as an obstructing clot (Budd Chiari syndrome) or compression from tumours or tuberculosis lesions. When the pressure increases in the <b>portal</b> <b>veins,</b> a collateral circulation develops, causing visible veins such as oesophageal varices.|$|R
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{systematic}} {{examination of the}} livers was developed, based on identification of the hepatic and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> in sixteen dogs. The right medial, quadrate, left medial and lateral hepatic veins and the hepatic branches of the <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> were easily located with the dog in dorsal recumbency. The right lateral and caudate hepatic veins were identified more easily from the right side with the transducer positioned between the ninth to the eleventh intercostal spaces. Visibility was affected by the fullness of the stomach but this effect could be minimized by changing {{the position of the}} transducer to select a more suitable anatomical approach. Identification of the two systems depended on their echogenicity, the anatomical position of the main branches and their pattern of distribution. As in humans, the <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> were in general, more echogenic than the hepatic veins and the hepatic veins could be traced from their junctions with the caudal vena cava. Identification of the branches of the hepatic and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> was complicated by the anatomical shape, the nutritional status and respiratory stage of the animal. A systemic approach based on a knowledge of the distribution patterns produced by the hepatic and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> ensures that all liver lobes are identified and all important structures are assessed.

5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the <b>portal</b> <b>vein.</b> Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E

On activation by high-K+ solution, JO 2 increased with tension in a similar way in both groups. In contrast, JLA, about 0. 85 mu mol/min per g, did not differ, and decreased with tension development. JO 2 of relaxed <b>portal</b> <b>veins,</b> about 1. 5 mu mol/min per g dry wt, and the increase in JO 2 with contraction were not different between SHR and WKY, but the JO 2 -active stress relation was steeper in spontaneous activity than in Kv+ contractures. JLA was similar in SHR and WKY <b>portal</b> <b>veins,</b> about 1 mu mol/min per g, and unlike behavior of the aortas, it increased with tension. Thus it is evident that SHR show increased arterial metabolism, which is not accounted for by an increased energy demand of the contractile system...|$|R

40|$|Background: Liver {{disease of}} unknown cause in HIV-infected persons is rare but {{increasingly}} being reported. Noncirrhotic portal hypertension {{is the main}} feature in a subset of these patients, in whom gastrointestinal bleeding is the most frequent and potentially life-threatening clinical presentation. Methods: We describe the epidemiological, clinical and histological features of 12 HIV-positive individuals presenting with noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Results: An interpretable liver biopsy was available in 11, and cirrhosis was absent in all patients. Three patients had nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver, whereas eight showed morphological features previously described as ‘hepatoportal sclerosis’. In four of the later group, a distinctive lesion was noted characterized by massive absence of <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> along with focal fibrous obliteration of small <b>portal</b> <b>veins.</b> All patients had been treated with didanosine for long periods and inflammatory and thrombotic processes hypothetically triggered by this purine analogue in the hepatic microvasculature might result in this form of obliterative portal venopathy.
