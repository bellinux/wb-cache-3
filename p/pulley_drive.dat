50|$|The Stringbike is {{a bicycle}} {{that uses a}} rope and <b>pulley</b> <b>drive</b> system instead of a {{traditional}} bicycle chain and sprockets. It uses two Dyneema ropes attached to pulleys attached to swinging lever and cam mechanisms, {{one on each side}} of the bike. These mechanisms replace the round sprockets found on chain-driven bikes. Unlike some traditional 10-speed gears using a derailleur, there is no slippage when changing gear ratios. The Stringbike uses a 19 gear ratio system with no duplicates and a total gear range of 3.5 to 1. The transmission ratio can be changed with a shifting knob located on the right-side handle grip. Gear ratios can be changed even when the bicycle is almost stationary.|$|E

5000|$|Following the American Civil War, mills grew larger. They {{were built}} in the {{southern}} states of South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi where cheap labour and plentiful water power made operations profitable. Cotton could be processed into fabric where it grew, saving transportation costs. The mills were usually combination mills, (spinning and weaving) that were water powered and used a slow burn design technique. They used a belt and <b>pulley</b> <b>drive</b> system, and heavier ring frames rather than mules. At this point they only spun and wove coarse counts. The mills were mainly in open country and mill towns were formed to support them. New England mills found it increasingly difficult to compete, and as in Lancashire, went into gradual decline until bankrupted during the Great Depression. Cotton mills and their owners dominated the economy and politics of the Piedmont well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|In {{belt drive}} applications, the tension {{fluctuation}} caused by transverse vibration has important consequences on belt and bearing lifetime. Additionally, pulley oscillations induce tension fluctuations {{that are a}} source of parametric instabilities that create transverse vibration. This paper focuses on an experimental investigation of an industrial axially moving belt subjected to multi-frequency parametric excitation. The experimental results validate a corresponding theoretical analysis previously developed. First, a stationary parametrically excited beam is considered. A simply supported, Euler-Bernoulli beam is subjected to mono-frequency sinusoidal tension fluctuation via a shaker and torque arm assembly on one pulley of a two <b>pulley</b> <b>drive.</b> The transverse vibration from parametric instability is measured for varying amplitude and frequency of tension fluctuation and compared with theoretical predictions. In industrial applications, excitation sources are not at a single frequency as in the previous case, especially in an automotive engine. Engine firing and driven accessories cause multi-frequency speed and tension fluctuation. A specific test bench was built to reproduce this kind of excitation. The set-up is composed of four pulleys linked together by an automotive multi-ribbed belt. The driving shaft is driven by an electric motor, and the driven shaft is linked to a hydraulic pump. The internal design of the pump creates torque fluctuation when it rotates, which induces tension fluctuation in the belt drive. Angular positions are measured by optical encoders mounted on the pulleys, belt tension by a piezo-electric sensor on a pulley support, and lateral vibration by a laser displacement sensor. Data acquisition is based on the principle of angular sampling and is applied {{here for the first time}} on non-discrete geometry. This technique is particularly useful for rotating system with variable speed, as the samples always have the same size and the angular resolution remains the same. A speed sweep is performed on this test bench. Results demonstrate that when a second source of excitation exists at a lower frequency than the major one causing the instability, the entire instability region shifts to lower frequency,instead of occurring at twice a natural frequency. While this phenomenon is not classical, the experimental observations confirm the theoretical results. This experiment also demonstrates unexpected sources of excitation from changing belt characteristics (longitudinal stiffness and friction coefficient) along the belt length. These variation can also excite parametric instability...|$|E

50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, driving <b>pulleys,</b> <b>driven</b> directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys</b> were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the <b>drive</b> <b>pulleys</b> expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|R

40|$|Serpentine {{belt drive}} systems {{are widely used}} in {{automobiles}} due to their compactness and long life. These systems are composed of a belt, a driving <b>pulley,</b> <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> and a spring-loaded tensioner. The <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys</b> may include such accessories as the alternator, air conditioner, or power steering pump. Serpentine belt drives experience {{many different types of}} steady state motions and transient vibrations due to the different parameters in the system. As a result of this, it is important to create a mathematical model that allows the designer to extract information about the system such as the natural frequency and the mode shapes. The accuracy of the model will depend primarily on the assumptions used. In particular, a key assumption is whether transverse and rotational motions of the belt are coupled due to the motion of the automatic belt tensioner. This coupling is often neglected by authors who model only longitudinal belt response and in effect decouple the transverse and rotational motions. Using a solution based upon coupled motion as well as a solution employing rotational motion only, the importance of this coupling will be assessed. Both solution results will be compared against published experimental data. In addition, a parametric study will be performed to determine the ability of the coupled and decoupled models to accurately predict changes in system natural frequencies and mode shapes due to changes in system parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the design of}} a light-weight novel flexible-joint arm for light-weight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can be used both for safe physical interaction with the environment and it represents also a preliminary step in the direction of performing quick motions for tasks such as hammering or throwing. The actuator consists of an active <b>pulley</b> <b>driven</b> by a rotational servo motor, a passive pulley which is attached to a rigid link, and the elastic connections (springs) between these two pulleys. We identify the physical parameters of the system, and use an optimal control strategy to maximize its velocity by taking advantage of elastic components. The prototype can be extended to a light-weight variable stiffness actuator. The flexible-joint arm is applied on a quadrotor, to be used in aerial physical interaction tasks, which implies that the elastic components can also be used for stable interaction absorbing the interactive disturbances which might damage the flying system and its hardware. The design is validated through several experiments, and future developments are discussed in the paper. I...|$|R
50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} V-belt pulleys that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a V-belt running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the overall gear ratio. As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> with a spring loaded <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley.</b> The V-belt needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|R
