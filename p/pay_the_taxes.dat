5|$|The Earps {{moved back}} to San Francisco in 1891 in part so Sadie could be closer to her {{half-sister}} Henrietta's family. Earp developed {{a reputation as a}} sportsman and a gambler. He held onto his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes.</b> He was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but by 1896, he could no longer afford to own them. He raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her. From 1891 to 1897, they lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race.|$|E
25|$|In January 1686, a {{rebellion}} broke out amongst the disgruntled people of Madras over the stringent taxation. The clerks, weavers and dubashes under {{the pay of}} the Company revolted and threatened to boycott their jobs. William Gyfford responded sternly and placed all the entrances to the city under heavy guard. A proclamation was issued and read out to the public. According to this proclamation, the administration threatened to banish all those who refused to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes.</b> The grain merchants of the city were threatened with confiscation of their goods {{if they did not}} sell their grain. The next day (4 January 1686), a compromise was reached by which the inhabitants of Madras submitted and agreed to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E

25|$|In his {{statement}} to the Senate Budget Committee, Mulvaney {{admitted that he had}} failed to pay $15,000 in payroll taxes from 2000-04 for a nanny he had hired to care for his triplets. Mulvaney said he did not <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> because he viewed the woman as a babysitter rather than as a household employee. After filling out a questionnaire from the Trump transition team, he realized the lapse and began the process of paying back taxes and fees. Senate Democrats noted that Republicans had previously insisted that past Democratic nominees' failure to pay taxes for their household employees was disqualifying, including former Health and Human Services nominee Tom Daschle in 2009.|$|E
25|$|He {{introduced}} {{ideas that}} indirectly challenged the discriminatory taxes imposed by Islamic authorities. For example, Aurangzeb had imposed taxes on non-Muslims that {{were collected from}} the Sikhs as well, for example the jizya (poll tax on non-Muslims), pilgrim tax and Bhaddar tax – the last being a {{tax to be paid}} by anyone following the Hindu ritual of shaving the head after the death of a loved one and cremation. Guru Gobind Singh declared that Khalsa do not need to continue this practice, because Bhaddar is not dharam, but a bharam (illusion). Not shaving the head also meant not having to <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> by Sikhs who lived in Delhi {{and other parts of the}} Mughal Empire. However, the new code of conduct also led to internal disagreements between Sikhs in the 18th century, particularly between the Nanakpanthi and the Khalsa.|$|E

500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes.</b> ... You do {{this all the time}} in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all the times I paid my taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as of the time of the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} structure of Western Europe {{changed with the}} end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as [...] "invasions", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the Western Roman elites to support the army or <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> <b>taxes</b> that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aetius (d. 454), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of Western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the Roman state. Material artefacts left by the Romans and the invaders are often similar, and tribal items were often modelled on Roman objects. Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on Roman intellectual traditions. An important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities. Many of the new political entities no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rents. This meant there was less need for large tax revenues and so the taxation systems decayed. Warfare was common between and within the kingdoms. Slavery declined as the supply weakened, and society became more rural.|$|E
