5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the <b>perineum.</b> It carries {{sensation}} from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and <b>perineum,</b> as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue. It may appear {{at the site of}} the cancer but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lower back, the external genitalia or <b>perineum.</b>|$|E
5|$|A pudendal nerve block, {{also known}} as a saddle nerve block, is a local {{anesthesia}} technique used in a obstetric procedure to anesthetize the <b>perineum</b> during labor. In this procedure, an anesthetic agent such as lidocaine is injected through the inner wall of the vagina about the pudendal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Branches also {{innervate}} {{muscles of}} the <b>perineum</b> and the pelvic floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external anal sphincter (via the inferior anal branch), and male or female external urethral sphincter.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{preparations}} of zinc {{include those}} {{used on the}} skin, often {{in the form of}} zinc oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn in the summer and windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (<b>perineum)</b> with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.|$|E
5|$|The early Buddhist texts {{describe}} meditative {{practices and}} states, {{some of which}} the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition. The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate {{for the purposes of}} controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, {{there is no mention of}} the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as in true khecarī mudrā. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the <b>perineum</b> with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.|$|E
5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue {{has been removed}} to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the {{opposite sides of the}} labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the <b>perineum,</b> and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's <b>perineum.</b> If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his <b>perineum</b> and force rose stems along his urethra to be {{forcibly}} pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of Susan Smith, a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
25|$|Recto-anal intussusceptions {{commonly}} {{give more}} severe symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, need for digital evacuation of stool, need for {{support of the}} <b>perineum</b> during defecation, urgency, frequency or intermittent fecal incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Examination of the vulva {{is part of}} the {{gynecologic}} {{evaluation and}} should include a thorough inspection of the <b>perineum,</b> including areas around the clitoris and urethra, and palpation of the Bartholin's glands.|$|E
25|$|Trauma: Injury to {{the birth}} canal which {{includes}} the uterus, cervix, vagina and the <b>perineum</b> which can happen even if the delivery is monitored properly. The bleeding is substantial as all these organs become more vascular during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial ejaculation {{control technique}} {{is to put}} pressure on the <b>perineum,</b> about halfway between the scrotum and the anus, just before ejaculating. This can, however, redirect semen into the bladder (referred to as retrograde ejaculation).|$|E
25|$|Perianal gland tumor (also called hepatoid tumor) {{is a type}} of tumor {{found near}} the anus in dogs that arises from {{specialized}} glandular tissue found in the <b>perineum.</b> They are most common in intact (not neutered) male dogs.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} genitalia {{of a woman}} are collectively {{known as}} the vulva. This comprises the labia majora (outer labia), the labia minora (inner labia), the clitoris, the urethra, and the vagina. The labia majora extend from the mons pubis to the <b>perineum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two HPV {{vaccines}} (Gardasil and Cervarix) {{reduce the}} risk of cancerous or precancerous changes of the cervix and <b>perineum</b> by about 93% and 62%, respectively. The vaccines are between 92% and 100% effective against HPV 16 and 18 up to at least 8 years.|$|E
25|$|After {{the general}} {{assessment}} {{and treatment of}} serious injuries, further evaluation may {{include the use of}} additional diagnostic testing such as x-rays, CT or MRI image studies and blood work. The presence of infection is determined by sampling of body fluids from the mouth, throat, vagina, <b>perineum,</b> and anus.|$|E
25|$|Necrotizing {{fasciitis}} (NF), {{commonly known}} as flesh-eating disease, is an infection that results {{in the death of}} the body's soft tissue. It is a severe disease of sudden onset that spreads rapidly. Symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, severe pain, fever, and vomiting. The most commonly affected areas are the limbs and <b>perineum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Typically, a lesion {{presents}} in {{the form}} of a lump or ulcer on the labia majora and may be associated with itching, irritation, local bleeding or discharge, in addition to pain with urination or pain during sexual intercourse. The labia minora, clitoris, <b>perineum</b> and mons are less commonly involved. Due to modesty or embarrassment, patients may put off seeing a doctor.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk {{includes}} the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity (the space enclosed by the bony pelvis), the pelvic floor, below the pelvic cavity, and the <b>perineum,</b> below the pelvic floor. The pelvic skeleton is formed {{in the area of}} the back, by the sacrum and the coccyx and anteriorly and to the left and right sides, by a pair of hip bones.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} gland {{is one of}} the organs that contributes fluid to semen. As the prostate is touch-sensitive, some directly stimulate it using a well-lubricated finger or dildo inserted through the anus into the rectum. Stimulating the prostate from outside, via pressure on the <b>perineum,</b> can be pleasurable as well. Some men also enjoy anal stimulation, with fingers or otherwise, without any prostate stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Burou {{underwent}} {{medical training}} at the Algiers University of Medicine. He specialized in gynecology and obstetrics at the Maternity of Mustapha Hospital in Algiers and became “Chef de Clinique” at Parnet Hospital in the Algiers suburb of Hussein Dey. During his training Burou took {{a special interest in}} anatomy, and later colleagues were reportedly highly impressed by his detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the <b>perineum</b> and pelvis.|$|E
25|$|In males, the {{beginning}} of the excitement phase is observed when the penis becomes partially erect, often after only a few seconds of erotic stimulation. The erection may be partially lost and regained repeatedly during an extended excitement phase. Both testicles become drawn upward toward the <b>perineum,</b> notably in circumcised males where less skin is available to accommodate the erection. Also, the scrotum can tense and thicken during the erection process.|$|E
25|$|Women may sexually stimulate a man's anus by {{fingering}} the exterior or interior {{areas of the}} anus; they may also stimulate the <b>perineum</b> (which, for males, is between {{the base of the}} scrotum and the anus), massage the prostate or engage in anilingus. Sex toys, such as a dildo, may also be used. The practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a strap-on dildo for sexual activity is called pegging.|$|E
25|$|The {{prolapse}} may be obvious, or it {{may require}} straining and squatting to produce it. The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures. Sometimes {{it is necessary to}} observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen (the <b>perineum</b> can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet). A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.|$|E
25|$|Stage 4 {{looks more}} male than female, {{with an empty}} scrotum and a phallus {{the size of a}} normal penis, but not quite free enough of the <b>perineum</b> to be pulled onto the abdomen toward the {{umbilicus}} (i.e., what is termed a chordee in a male). The single small urethral/vaginal opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus would be considered a hypospadias in a male. X-rays taken after dye injection into this opening reveal the internal connection with the upper vagina and uterus. This common opening can predispose to urinary obstruction and infection.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{approaches}} in rectal prolapse {{can be either}} perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via incision around the anus and <b>perineum</b> (the area between the genitals and the anus). Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the abdomen and gaining surgical access to the pelvic cavity. Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both. Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the prostate, or prostatectomy, is a common {{treatment}} either for early stage prostate cancer or for cancer that has {{failed to respond to}} radiation therapy. The most common type is radical retropubic prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an abdominal incision. Another type is radical perineal prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an incision in the <b>perineum,</b> the skin between the scrotum and anus. Radical prostatectomy can also be performed laparoscopically, through a series of small (1cm) incisions in the abdomen, with or without the assistance of a surgical robot.|$|E
25|$|Cryosurgery {{is another}} method of {{treating}} prostate cancer {{in which the}} prostate gland is exposed to freezing temperatures. Cryosurgery is less invasive than radical prostatectomy, and general anesthesia is less commonly used. Under ultrasound guidance, a method invented by Dr. Gary Onik, metal rods are inserted through {{the skin of the}} <b>perineum</b> into the prostate. Highly purified argon gas is used to cool the rods, freezing the surrounding tissue at −186 °C (−302 °F). As the water within the prostate cells freezes, the cells die. The urethra is protected from freezing by a catheter filled with warm liquid. Impotence occurs up to ninety percent of the time.|$|E
25|$|The pelvic {{region of}} the trunk is {{the lower part of}} the trunk, between the abdomen and the thighs. It {{includes}} several structures: the bony pelvis, the pelvic cavity, the pelvic floor, and the <b>perineum.</b> The bony pelvis (pelvic skeleton) is the part of the skeleton embedded in the pelvic {{region of the}} trunk. It is subdivided into the pelvic girdle and the pelvic spine. The pelvic girdle is composed of the appendicular hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) oriented in a ring, and connects the pelvic region of the spine to the lower limbs. The pelvic spine consists of the sacrum and coccyx.|$|E
25|$|Management {{decisions}} {{are more difficult}} for a moderately or severely undervirilized genetic male whose testes are in the abdomen and whose genitalia look {{at least as much}} female as male. Male sex can assigned and major reconstructive surgery done to close the midline of the <b>perineum</b> and move the testes into a constructed scrotum. Female sex can be assigned and the testes removed and vagina enlarged surgically. A recently advocated third choice would be to assign either sex and defer surgery to adolescence. Each approach carries its own disadvantages and risks. Children and their families are different enough that none of the courses is appropriate for all.|$|E
25|$|The human vagina is {{an elastic}} muscular canal that {{extends from the}} vulva to the cervix. It is reddish pink in color, and it connects the outer vulva to the cervix of the uterus. The part of the vagina {{surrounding}} the cervix is called the fornix. The opening of the vagina lies near {{the middle of the}} <b>perineum,</b> between the opening of the urethra and the anus. The vaginal canal then travels upwards and backwards, between the urethra at the front, and the rectum at the back. Near the upper vagina, the cervix protrudes into the vagina on its front surface at approximately a 90 degree angle. The vaginal and urethral openings are protected by the labia.|$|E
25|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue, but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lumbar region. Lumbosacral plexopathy is often caused by recurrence of cancer in the presacral space, and may refer to the external genitalia or <b>perineum.</b> Local recurrence of cancer attached {{to the side of}} the pelvic wall may cause pain in one of the iliac fossae. Pain on walking that confines the patient to bed indicates possible cancer adherence to or invasion of the iliacus muscle. Pain in the hypogastrium (between the navel and pubic bone) is often found in cancers of the uterus and bladder, and sometimes in colorectal cancer especially if infiltrating or attached to either uterus or bladder.|$|E
25|$|Oxygenated blood {{enters the}} {{systemic}} circulation when leaving the left ventricle, through the aortic semilunar valve. The {{first part of}} the systemic circulation is the aorta, a massive and thick-walled artery. The aorta arches and gives branches supplying {{the upper part of the}} body after passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm at the level of thoracic ten vertebra, it enters the abdomen. Later it descends down and supplies branches to abdomen, pelvis, <b>perineum</b> and the lower limbs. The walls of aorta are elastic. This elasticity helps to maintain the blood pressure throughout the body. When the aorta receives almost five litres of blood from the heart, it recoils and is responsible for pulsating blood pressure. Moreover, as aorta branches into smaller arteries, their elasticity goes on decreasing and their compliance goes on increasing.|$|E
25|$|Vaginal tears {{can occur}} during childbirth, most {{often at the}} vaginal opening as the baby's head passes through, {{especially}} if the baby descends quickly. Tears can involve the perineal skin or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. The midwife or obstetrician may decide to make a surgical cut to the <b>perineum</b> (episiotomy) to make the baby's birth easier and prevent severe tears that {{can be difficult to}} repair. A 2017 Cochrane review compared episiotomy as needed (restrictive) with routine episiotomy to determine the possible benefits and harms for mother and baby. The review found that restrictive episiotomy policies appeared to give a number of benefits compared with using routine episiotomy. Women experienced less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days with no difference in occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth.|$|E
25|$|It is {{most common}} that mucous {{membrane}} lesions {{of the oral}} cavity are presented first. They can involve the oropharynx, nasopharynx, tongue, and vermilion (red portion) of the lips. They are also known to develop in the conjunctiva of the eye, anogenital (<b>perineum)</b> region, and esophagus. Cutaneous lesions tend to follow the onset of mucosal lesions. The blisters often erupt in waves, usually affecting the upper trunk, head, neck, and proximal extremities. Pemphigoid-like lesions are seen more often on the extremities. Lichenoid lesions are more common among children, presenting on the trunk and limbs, ranging from small red scaly papules to extensive violet to brown papules extending to the face and neck. Within the spectrum of lichenoid presentations are wounds that have features of erythema multiforme and graft-vs.-host disease. Scaly lesions on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet have been noted {{to coincide with the}} lichenoid lesions. Lesions of varying morphology may present simultaneously and transform from one type to another as the disease progresses.|$|E
