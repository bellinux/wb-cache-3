40|$|The beam {{position}} monitor (BPM) {{was designed}} to provide a robust UHV feedthru and a reliable electromagnetic sensor. Stringent resolution requirements at low beam currents, bunch parameters, along with mechanical and chamber requirements produced challenges in the electrical, thermal, and structural design of the BPM's. Numerical modeling and experimental analyses were used to optimize the design. The higher order modes (HOM's) and beam impedance were modeled using MAFIA. Measurements agreed with the calculated 1 Ω transfer impedance at the 952 MHz signal processing frequency, and the first two HOM's found in MAFIA. Tests and analysis both showed the button signal power approaching 40 W. Temperature and stress distributions were analyzed using this power loading with ANSYS. An electronic grade CuNi was selected for the BPM to reliably weld into the copper chambers. <b>Pin</b> <b>seal</b> and compressive joints were considered for the insulator vacuum seals. Both glassy ceramic-to-metal and ceramic-to-metal seals were evaluated. I...|$|E

60|$|It {{is rather}} a {{discouraging}} reflection {{that one should}} travel {{three or four hours}} to get to such a desolate place as these mountain tops generally are; nothing but grass, rocks, and snow; a shanty, with a show case full of minerals, articles of carved wood, and engravings of the place for sale. In these show cases the Alps are brought to market as thoroughly as human ingenuity can do the thing. The chamois figures largely; there are pouches made of chamois skin, walking sticks and alpenstocks tipped with chamois horn; sometimes an entire skin, horns and all, hanging disconsolately downward. Then all manner of crystals, such as are found in the rocks, are served up--agate <b>pins,</b> rings, <b>seals,</b> bracelets, cups, and snuffboxes--all which are duly urged on your attention; so, instead of falling into a rapture at the sight of Mont Blanc, the regular routine for a Yankee is to begin a bargain for a walking stick or a snuffbox.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the fuel}} and {{cladding}} can swell. Cladding covers the fuel {{to form a}} fuel pin and can be deformed. It is normal {{to fill the gap}} between the fuel and the cladding with helium gas to permit better thermal contact between the fuel and the cladding. During use the amount of gas inside the fuel pin can increase because of the formation of noble gases (krypton and xenon) by the fission process. If a Loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) (e.g. Three Mile Island) or a Reactivity Initiated Accident (RIA) (e.g. Chernobyl or SL-1) occurs then the temperature of this gas can increase. As the fuel <b>pin</b> is <b>sealed</b> the pressure of the gas will increase (PV = nRT) and it is possible to deform and burst the cladding. It has been noticed that both corrosion and irradiation can alter the properties of the zirconium alloy commonly used as cladding, making it brittle. As a result, the experiments using unirradated zirconium alloy tubes can be misleading.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT! The goal of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the empirical failure mechanisms and sequence of cartridge actuated devices (CADs) experiencing failure of the glass-to-metal (G/M) seal. Impact loading was conducted with a drop weight machine at room temperature and 300 °F, and then empirically analyzed with high speed video. Resulting peak overload force, shear stress, and impulse were all calculated. The room temperature samples were found to absorb twice the impulse upon failure as the elevated temperature G/M seals. Closed-form and three-dimensional finite element analysis was used to determine the stress state and deformation upon loading. Furthermore, high speed data was collected for shock load detonation events to document the failure sequence of a G/M seal under such loading. The shock overload event was found to last 0. 82 µsec and propel an electrical feed-through-pin at a terminal velocity of 955 m/s. The core of a multiple <b>pin</b> G/M <b>seal</b> design was found to experience large accumulations of principal stress and deformation during pressure loading of the interior face. High speed video data discovered the G/M seal failed along the glass-to-pin interfac...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the project is to setup the {{manufacturing}} process and the economic study {{as well as the}} production plant layout and waste management of the gear box for industrial vehicle. The gear box contains 21 main parts and 11 parts will be explained in this project, including: Shaft 1, Shaft 2, Casing, Sliding part, Clutch fork, <b>Pin,</b> <b>Sealing</b> plate 1 - 2, Transmission Plate 2, Washer 2, Gear 1 and Gear 2. Firstly we have to do the marketing study in order to estimate the amount of the production we expect to sell in the first and the following years. The marketing study is done by analyzing the data from Spain and European database in industrial section together with the assumption based on reality. The results from this part are the expected production per year which can let us make the decision for the machine type and it will be used in economic study as well. Then the proper manufacturing process and specific tool’s type for each part will be decided and written on the Phase Document and the Summary of the Operation. These 2 documents are in the form that suitable to be used in reality effectively. Not only the manufacturing procedure, we also indicate the proper cutting condition and the calculations of cycle time, cutting force, machine power and the quality verification for each part. The data obtained by the calculation will be used to choose the specific model of machines, the amounts of machines and workers required to achieve the expected production. After we have the clear image of the production line, we shall advance to the economic study. The economic study is a good and reliable tool to indicate the profitability of the business. Every possible cost of the company will be taken into account and be presented as “ Hour Cost “. As well as the economic indicators such as Cash Flow, Period of Pay back, Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) will be presented {{to be sure that the}} investment of this business will be profitable. The final tasks are the production plant layout and the waste management. The production plant layout will be designed sketchily as well as the specific suitable location.

40|$|One of the {{uncertainties}} concerning {{the use of}} uranium- 10 wt. % molybdenum in the ORNL Fast Burst Reactor is the thermal-cycling behavior of this alloy. Accordingly, an experimental program was undertaken to determine whether transformation or distortion of gamma-phase uranium [...] 10 wt. % molybdenum can occur during simulated fast-burstreactor thermal cycling, and, should transformation occur, to establish the thermal cycling behavior of partially transformed uranium- - 10 wt. % molybdenum. Specimens were prepared by vacuum casting pins in coated- graphite molds, homogenizing the castings at 1650 deg F for 24 hr, and centerless grinding and cutting to 0. 158 -in. diameter by 1. 5 in. long. The <b>pins</b> were <b>sealed</b> in evacuated Vycor tubes, heated rapidly both {{above and below the}} gamma- transformation temperature. and then cooled slowly to simulate reactor thermal cycling. Measurements of the time required to initiate transformation by conventional isothermal methods were employed to insure that the alloy material behaved as indicated in the literature. Observation of changes in appearance, dimensions, density, resistivity, and metallographic structure were used to obtain the desired information. It was found that thermal cycling did not cause growth or distortion of either gamma-phase or partially transformed uranium [...] 10 wt. % molybdenum pins. Transformation of gamma phase to alpha + delta was not initiated by thermal cycling below the equilibrium gamma-transition temperature. (auth...|$|R

50|$|Before the {{pressure}} cooker lid is sealed airtight, the internal air {{has to be}} mostly replaced by steam. Steam has a much higher specific heat than air, {{and the presence of}} steam rather than air inside {{the pressure}} cooker is how it's able to transfer sufficient heat into the parts of the food that aren't submerged in liquid, such as a pot roast. If the lid is sealed before enough air has been removed, not enough heat can be transferred to the food, and food may be undercooked; the presence of air would make the food cook more like it's in an oven than a pressure cooker. To remove the air, steam is vented for several minutes to replace the volume of air inside the cooker. This is why a pressure cooker takes about 10 minutes to reach pressure. For pressure cookers with a weight, the weight is placed over the steam vent pipe while steam is being emitted, to ensure the air inside has escaped. The newer generation pressure cookers, which have no weights, automatically expel air from inside for several minutes before a coloured pop-up indicator <b>pin</b> rises to <b>seal</b> the lid airtight; pressure then builds in the now airtight cooker. If the pressure cooker is already hot or a stovetop pressure cooker is placed on a very strong heat source - such as induction on too high a setting, the lid can seal airtight too quickly before the air inside has been removed. In these situations, a slightly lower heat setting can be used to allow the water to boil slower in order to vent the air.|$|R
