40|$|Most {{deaths from}} ischaemic heart disease are sudden, occur outside hospital, and result from {{ventricular}} fibrillation.

A singe low-energy shock succeeded in removing ventricular fibrillation in 73 out of 82 episodes, and a further shock was successful in seven more episodes. Primary ventricular fibrillation probably always responds to low-energy electrical shocks, which challenges the conventional view that correction of ventricular fibrillation requires high-energy direct-current shock.

40|$|Background. The calcium {{sensitizer}} levosimendan {{protects against}} myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion injury in animal models. Methods. The present pilot study investigated whether a short infusion before {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) would protect the myocardium and improve postoperative haemodynamics. Twenty-four patients with stable angina undergoing elective CABG surgery were randomized to receive either placebo or levosimendan (24 mg kg 1) infused i. v. over a 10 min period just before placing the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass. Results. Perioperative haemodynamic variables, concentrations of cardiac troponin I over the 48 h postoperative period, and clinical outcomes were assessed. There were no adverse effects related to levosimendan. Compared with control patients, levosimendan-treated patients had lower postoperative troponin I concentrations (P 0. 05) and a higher cardiac index (P 0. 05). Conclusion. Patients receiving a short infusion of levosimendan before CABG showed evidence of <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage,</b> suggestive of a preconditioning effect.

40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com The pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) includes the rupture or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque with variable degrees of superimposed platelet aggregation inducing a thrombus [1]. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is often {{caused by a}} total coronary occlusion of the atherothrombotic plaque, whereas in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) the thrombus is mainly nonocclusive or transient occlusive causing <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> [2]. Conventional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) focuses on compressing the atherothrombotic plaque with the aim to normalize flow in the coronary artery and therefore restore perfusion of the ischemic myocardium [3]. However, embolization of atherothrombotic material may occur spontaneously after plaque rupture or due to mechanical crushing of the culprit lesion during PCI [4]. This results in obstruction of distal vessels or the microcirculation in the down-stream bed of the ischemia-related artery. Although normal epicardial flow may be achieved, this will lead to diminished myocardial perfusion, which is associated with larger Editorial comment on the article of Duan et al...|$|R
40|$|Background. Patients {{presenting}} with acutely decompensated {{heart failure}} (ADHF) and positive circulating cardiac troponins {{were found to}} be a high-risk cohort. The advent of high-sensitive troponins resulted in a detection of positive troponins in a great proportion of heart failure patients. However, the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon is not completely clear. Objectives. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the early evolution and clinical significance of high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) in ADHF. Methods. Retrospective, secondary analysis of a prospective study including 100 patients with ADHF. Results. Globally, high-sensitivity troponin T decreased from day 1 to day 3 (P = 0, 039). However, in the subgroup of patients who remained decompensated no significant differences in hsTnT from day 1 to day 3 were observed (P = 0, 955), whereas in successfully compensated patients a significant reduction in hsTnT levels was observed (P = 0, 025). High-sensitivity troponin T decrease was correlated with NTproBNP reduction (P = 0, 007). Patients with hsTnT increase had longer length of stay (P = 0, 033). Conclusions. Episodes of ADHF are associated with transient increases in the blood levels of hsTnT that are reduced with effective acute episode treatment. The decrease in hsTnT can translate <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> along with favourable ADHF treatment...|$|R
40|$|The cardiac {{persistent}} sodium current (IN aP) {{presents a}} novel target for cardiac ischaemic protection. Herein we investigated {{the effects of}} the IN aP blocker riluzole in a pig model of regional myocardial ischaemia. Landrace or Large White pigs were subjected to 3  h ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Pigs received either saline (500  mL/h, i. v.) throughout the experiment (control; n =  7) or riluzole (2  mg/kg in 2  mL propylene glycol in 100  mL saline, i. v.; RIL; n =  7) between 15 and 5  min prior to ligation. The arrhythmia score was calculated in 5  min epochs. <b>Myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> was assessed using epicardial image analysis and histological sectioning. In the control group, all seven pigs developed premature ventricular contractions (PVC), seven developed non-sustained arrhythmias and six of seven developed sustained arrhythmias. Of the sustained arrhythmias, 23 of 28 instances were initiated by R-on-T extrasytoles (extrasystoles within the vulnerable period that can trigger re-entrant arrhythmias). In the RIL group, all seven pigs developed PVC, six of seven developed non-sustained arrhythmias and only three developed sustained arrhythmias, of which two of five instances were R-on-T initiated. The riluzole-treated pigs exhibited <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> than pigs in the control group (65 % smaller surface area (P =  0. 008) on gross epicardial inspection, 51 % less oedema (P =  0. 01), 53 % less fibre waviness (P =  0. 029) assessed by haematoxylin and eosin staining and 79 % fewer fragmented nuclei (P =  0. 009) assessed by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labelling). In conclusion, riluzole significantly reduced Phase 2 (the period associated with irreversible damage) ischaemic R-on-T triggered and non-R-on-T arrhythmias and <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> occurring during the 3  h period of regional ischaemia.

30|$|In {{the current}} study, {{accelerated}} MIBI clearance {{was observed in}} ten patients (55  %), and segmental analysis showed that 14 of the 99 segments (14  %) exhibited accelerated MIBI clearance. Takeishi et al. reported that 15 of the 22 patients (68  %) with acute myocardial infarction showed accelerated MIBI clearance [5]. In their study, these patients had percutaneous transmural coronary angioplasty and thrombolytic therapy. The frequency of accelerated MIBI {{in the current study}} was lower than in Takeishi’s study. In their study, all patients who underwent angioplasty obtained TIMI grades 2 or 3 {{by the end of the}} revascularization procedure. The difference in the frequency of accelerated MIBI between the current study and Takeishi’s study may be due to differences in coronary intervention approach. In the current study, all patients underwent stent placement as the ACS treatment. In addition, all patients had obtained TIMI grade 3 by the end of the revascularization procedure. Given recent developments in treatment approaches, ACS treatments may have improved in comparison with those used in previous studies. Therefore, newer revascularization approaches may result in <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> and a lower frequency of accelerated MIBI clearance. Even with the lower frequency of accelerated MIBI clearance, the main finding of the current study agreed with the findings from the previous study, and the current study adds new pathophysiological insights over the previous study.|$|R
40|$|PurposeWhen {{compared}} with carotid endarterectomy (CEA), percutaneous carotid angioplasty with stent replacement (CAS) {{is a less}} invasive technique {{in the treatment of}} carotid stenosis. However, periprocedural hemodynamic instability still remains a challenge. This instability might lead to <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage,</b> which is now measured accurately by using cardiac troponin I (CTnI). MethodsThis study was designed to compare the periprocedural variation of CTnI in 150 consecutive patients scheduled to undergo CEA (n = 75) or CAS (n = 75). The levels of CTnI were measured until the third postoperative day in all patients. Short-term (1 month) and long-term (up to 5 years) postoperative cardiac outcome were assessed by means of chart review, regular follow-ups, and telephone calls. ResultsThere was not any statistically significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the demographic characteristics and preprocedural medical status. The incidence of increase of CTnI (> 0. 5 ng/mL) was significantly higher in the CEA group (13 %) {{compared with}} that in the CAS group (1 %; P =. 001). During the acute postprocedural period, the CAS group was significantly more prone to hypotension, requiring vasopressor therapy, whereas the CEA group had more hypertension, necessitating hypotensive medications (P <. 001). At 5 years, the overall incidence of major cardiac complications (nonfatal myocardial infarction and death related to cardiac origin) was significantly more frequent in the CEA group (20 % vs 5 %, P <. 01). ConclusionThe results of our study suggest that CAS yielded <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> in the short and long term when compared with CEA.

Methods In this randomized clinical trial study, 60 consecutive patients who were diagnosed to suffering from triple vessel coronary artery diseases were selected. CABG patients were assigned randomly into two groups; the first group received sooner and gradual myocardial reperfusion one-by-one top end venous anastomosis to the aorta (sequential aortic side biting technique) (n = 30) and the second group undergo proximal anastomoses constructed during a single period of aortic side biting (single aortic side biting technique) (n = 30). The serum levels of <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> biomarkers including creatine phosphokinase-MB (CPK-MB), Troponin I, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase (CAT) were measured preoperatively, postoperatively and 24 h after operation. Independent t- tests was used to compare results between groups. Results The level of all myocardial biomarkers increased after the operation. Those in study group had significantly lower levels of troponin I (P < 0. 001), CPK-MB (P = 0. 001), GPX (P = 0. 007), SOD (P = 0. 005), and CAT (P = 0. 015), 24 h after the operation when compared to control group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE – Minimal {{invasive}} {{mitral valve}} repair has become standard of care. It {{is a safe}} and durable alternative to conventional median sternotomy, resulting in less pain and faster recovery. The factors contributing to these advantages remain poorly understood. We studied the biological effects of full sternotomy compared to minithoracotomy for mitral valve surgery. METHODS – Single centre data from patients who underwent mitral valve surgery were retrospectively collected. Patients were divided in two groups based upon type of surgery: Full Sternotomy or Port-Access. Propensity score matching, based upon age, gender, BSA, NYHA, preoperative rhythm, and medical history was performed. Perioperative characteristics, including biochemical data of the first 10 days postoperatively (Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, Red blood cell count, Plateled count, White blood cell count, C-reactive protein, Creatinine, and Troponine) were collected for analysis. RESULTS – Each group of the matched cohort consisted of 126 patients. Port-Access was associated with significant longer cardiopulmonary bypass times, longer aortic cross-clamp times, shorter hospital and intensive care stay. The amount of blood transfused, and inotropic agents and vasopressors administered were lower in Port-Access. Analysis of biochemical characteristics show a faster recovery of blood cell counts, lower CRP levels and less increase in troponin levels after Port-Access surgery. CONCLUSIONS – Port-access mitral valve surgery, though associated with longer cardio-pulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times, results in faster haematological recovery, less inflammatory response, and <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage.</b> These factors {{may contribute to the}} faster recovery after minimal invasive mitral valve surgery. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{catheter}} ablation of arrhythmogenic {{sites is}} now being used {{for the treatment of}} ventricular tachycardias. However, the extent and type of the ablation lesion in relation to energy level are controversial and not well known. In 10 beagles, single cathodal shocks of 30 (4 dogs), 80 (2 dogs) or 250 J (4 dogs) were delivered to the endocardial ventricular wall (5 dogs left ventricular, 5 dogs right ventricular). One week after ablation the dogs were killed for histopathologic examination. In the left ventricular wall, ablation lesion volumes calculated from measured extensions in three perpendicular directions were 0. 4 and 0. 9 cc at 30 J, 1. 9 cc at 80 J and 2. 8 and 3. 4 cc at 250 J; in the right ventricular wall they were 0. 4 and 0. 5 cc at 30 J, 1. 3 cc at 80 J and 2. 5 and 4. 2 cc at 250 J. In the right ventricular wall all 30 to 250 J lesions were transmural, whereas in the left ventricular wall only 250 J lesions were transmural. AH lesions showed a necrotic area surrounded by granulation tissue with degenerated myofibrils. Thus, the size of the ablation lesion depends on delivered energy, whereas the pattern of histopathologic change is identical in the 30 to 250 J energy range. These results suggest that with accurate localization of the ar-rhythmogenic site one low energy shock may be successful with <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage...</b>|$|R
40|$|PurposeWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of isolated elevation of cTn on short-term outcomes of NSTE-MIMethodsFrom Oct 2010 to Oct 2013, 3799 patients with NSTE-MI were enrolled on a national multicenter registry. These patients were divided in 2 groups: BM+: elevation of cTn and other biomarkers of myocardial injury (n= 2445); BM-: elevation of cTn without rise in the other biomarkers (n= 948). The endpoints included in-hospital all-cause mortality and a composite endpoint of death, re-infarction, heart failure (Killip class > 2) and resuscitated cardiac arrest during hospitalization. Logistic regression modelling was used to compute adjusted odds ratio of death and of the composite endpoint. ResultsThe BM- patients were younger (66 ± 12 vs. 68 ± 13, p 1, p< 0. 001), left ventricular dysfunction (10. 4 % vs. 18. 4 % with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, p< 0. 001) and the composite endpoint (5. 1 % vs. 11. 9 %, p< 0. 001). In-hospital all-cause mortality was more common in those BM+ (3. 0 % vs. 0. 7 %, p< 0. 001). In a multivariable model, no significant association was found between BM- and in-hospital all-cause mortality (OR: 0. 568, 95 % CI: 0. 127 - 2. 549, p= 0. 461). Isolated elevation of cTn was associated with lower incidence of the composite endpoint (OR: 0. 474, 95 % CI: 0. 312 - 0. 722, p= 0. 001). ConclusionIn this observational nationwide study, patients with isolated cTn elevation showed a better short-term prognosis than those with elevation of all biomarkers of myocardial injury.

40|$|The authors {{recently}} {{described a}} group of diabetic patients with severe congestive heart failure, hypertension, and minimal coronary artery disease, who had significant myocardial degeneration apparently secondary to the combined effects {{of high blood pressure}} and diabetes on the heart. To evaluate the effects of hypertension and diabetes mellitus more fully, the authors studied four groups of rats with either no disease, streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, renovascular hypertension, or a combination of hypertension and diabetes. They employed semiquantitative light microscopy, which revealed significantly greater replacement fibrosis in the hypertensive-diabetic rats when compared with the other three groups. Interstitial fibrosis was increased in the hypertensive-diabetic animals, though it was just below the 5 % level of significance when compared with the hypertensives. Further analysis, however, revealed that those hypertensive-diabetic animals with the greatest relative cardiac hypertrophy, as measured by the heart weight/body weight ratio, had significantly increased interstitial fibrosis. Surprisingly, diabetes mellitus alone produced no morphologic light-microscopic alterations; yet 8 weeks of combined hypertension and diabetes mellitus led to myocardial degeneration similar to the human disease. These changes {{do not appear to be}} secondary to abnormalities of intramyocardial muscular vessels. Measurement of 3 parameters of vascular disease revealed that hypertensive animals with <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> had greater vascular changes than the more severely affected hypertensive-diabetics. This study provides evidence that the combination of diabetes mellitus and hypertension produces significantly greater myocardial lesions than either disease alone. The similarity of the lesions with those observed in human patients suggests that the hypertensive-diabetic rat is a useful model for elucidating the pathogenesis of clinical myocardial disease in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus...|$|R

To distinguish the transgene from endogenous elafin, constructs were made incorporating a FLAG sequence; the COOH-terminus FLAG-tagged elafin construct produced a stable, functionally active gene product and was used to create transgenic mice. Consistent with endothelin expression, abundant elafin mRNA was observed in transgenic F 1 embryos (embryonic day 13. 5) and in adult transgenic mice heart, trachea, aorta, kidney, lung, and skin, but not in liver, spleen, and intestine. Functional activity of the transgene was confirmed by heightened myocardial elastase inhibitory activity. No tissue abnormalities were detected by light microscopy or elastin content. However, injection of 10 plaque-forming units (PFU) of encephalomyocarditis virus resulted in death within 11 days in 10 out of 12 nontransgenic mice compared with one out of nine transgenic littermates. This reduced mortality was associated with better cardiac function and <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> inflammatory <b>damage.</b> Thus, elafin expression may confer a protective advantage in myocarditis and other inflammatory diseases...|$|R

First published December 24, 2010; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpheart. 01008. 2010. -The present study evaluated {{the impact of}} moderate exercise training on the cardiac tolerance to acute pressure overload. Male Wistar rats were randomly submitted to exercise training or sedentary lifestyle for 14 wk. At {{the end of this}} period, the animals were anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and submitted to hemodynamic evaluation with biventricular tip pressure manometers. Acute pressure overload was induced by banding the descending aorta to induce a 60 % increase of peak systolic left ventricular pressure during 120 min. This resulted in the following experimental groups: 1) sedentary without banding (SED + Sham), 2) sedentary with banding (SED + Band), and 3) exercise trained with banding (EX + Band). In response to aortic banding, SED + Band animals could not sustain the 60 % increase of peak systolic pressure for 120 min, even with additional narrowing of the banding. This was accompanied by a reduction of dP/dt(max) and dP/dt(min) and a prolongation of the time constant tau, indicating impaired systolic and diastolic function. This impairment was not observed in EX + Band (P lt; 0. 05 vs. SED + Band). Additionally, compared with SED + Band, EX + Band presented <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage,</b> exhibited attenuated protein expression of active caspase- 3 and NF-kappa B (P lt; 0. 016), and showed less protein carbonylation and nitration (P lt; 0. 05).

BackgroundThe link between good collateral supply related to <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> and fewer cardiac events has not been established prospectively beyond doubt. MethodsIn 403 patients with stable angina pectoris undergoing {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA) and quantitative collateral assessment, the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events ([MACE] cardiac death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris) and stable angina pectoris was monitored during follow-up. Collateral flow index (CFI) was determined using intracoronary pressure or Doppler guidewires. Mean aortic ([Pao] mm Hg) and distal coronary artery occlusive pressure ([Poccl] mm Hg) during balloon angioplasty (PTCA), or distal coronary flow velocity time integral during ([Voccl] cm) and after ([Vø-occl] cm) PTCA were measured continuously. Pressure-derived CFI was calculated as follows: (Poccl− 5) /(Pao− 5). Doppler-derived CFI: Voccl/Vø-occl. Patients were subdivided into a group with well (CFI ≥ 0. 25) and poorly developed collaterals (CFI < 0. 25). ResultsAverage follow-up was 94 ± 56 (15 to 202) weeks. There were 134 patients with CFI ≥ 0. 25 (61 ± 11 years) and 269 with CFI < 0. 25 (61 ± 10 years). The overall cardiac ischemic event rate (MACE and stable angina pectoris) during follow-up was 23 % in patients with CFI ≥ 0. 25 and 20 % in patients with CFI < 0. 25 (p = NS). However, only 2. 2 % of patients with good collateral flow suffered a major cardiac ischemic event, compared with 9. 0 % among patients with poorly developed collaterals (p = 0. 01). The incidence of stable angina pectoris was significantly higher in patients with well developed collaterals than in those with poorly developed collaterals (21 % vs. 12 %; p = 0. 01).

Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were prospectively collected. RESULTS: For the same median number of distal anastomoses, cardiopulmonary bypass duration and total ischemic arrest duration (57. 3 +/- 20. 5 versus 75 +/- 22. 1 minutes, p < 0. 001) were shorter in group 2 than in group 1.

The {{study focused on}} the influences of the time interval from the onset of chest pain to PTCR (PTCR-Time) and on the post-infarct left ventricular regional wall motion {{in conjunction with the}} serum levels of GOT, LDH and CPK and with PTCR-Time. PTCR success rate was 84. 0 %, and re-occlusion rate was 4. 0 %. The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 2, however, was observed in 7 (33. 3 %) of 21 cases with successful PTCR. There {{was no significant difference in}} PTCR-Time between the PTCR success and nonsuccess groups. Significant correlations were observed between the PTCR-Time and each peak value of standardized serum levels of LDH and CPK, and between the PTCR-Time and the post-infarct regional wall motion abnormality. There were also significant correlations between the standardized serum level of each of these three enzymes and the post-infarct regional wall motion abnormality. It was clearly demonstrated that the earlier the recannalization of the infarcted artery was achieved, the <b>less</b> extensive the <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> in quantitative and qualitative aspects. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Myocardial {{infarction}} {{remains a}} major health problem, despite recent improvements in detection and treatment. Infarct size {{is a major}} determinant of future mortality and morbidity. Management strategies aimed at limiting infarct size, beyond what is achieved with early revascularization in combination with platelet stabilization, could be of great prognostic importance. Although opening of the infarct-related artery is mostly beneficial, it also initiates harmful processes that contribute to the final infarct size, so called reperfusion injury. When performing studies aiming at myocardial protection, {{it is important to have}} methods that accurately quantify ischemic but viable myocardium and the final infarct size. Postconditioning, a method that consists of cycles of brief reperfusion and ischemia during early stages of revascularization, seems to limit reperfusion injury. Further knowledge is important for understanding how efficient this technique is and if the protection leads to long-lasting benefits. Methods and results: Study I investigated if postconditioning in addition to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) would limit infarct size and improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), compared with standard PCI. This was determined with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) after one week in 76 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There was no difference in infarct size and LVEF within the total study population. Postconditioning did, however, have a beneficial effect on final infarct size and LVEF in patients with the largest volumes of myocardium at risk (MaR). Study II investigated if the results from study I were consistent during long-term follow-up in 68 patients. In order to quantify infarct size and LVEF, the patients were re-examined with CMR at three and 12 months. There was no difference between patients who were postconditioned and those who underwent ordinary PCI in the complete study group. Postconditioned patients in the upper quartile of MaR did, however, still have <b>less</b> <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> and improved LVEF after one year. Study III compared MaR estimated with a new modified contrast-enhanced CMR sequence one week after admission with the reference standard method, myocardial perfusion singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT), in 16 patients with STEMI. There was a good correlation between the two methods. Study IV investigated 21 patients with STEMI one week after revascularization with CMR. T 2 -weighted (edema) images were compared with contrast-enhanced CMR sequence for the assessment of MaR. A strong agreement was found between the two methods. Conclusions: Postconditioning did not decrease infarct size or improve LVEF one week or 12 months after the procedure in all patients with first time STEMI subjected to this method. Patients with large MaR seemed, however, to have a consistent benefit over time in the form of smaller infarct sizes and improved LVEF. There is a strong agreement between the newly developed contrast-enhanced CMR sequence compared with both reference standard SPECT and T 2 -weighted edema images. The implication is that the new technique can be used for quantification of MaR and final infarct size in patients with STEMI, through a single investigation performed several days after the event...|$|R
40|$|<b>Myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> {{is known}} to occur {{relatively}} frequently in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, and {{although it is not}} often fatal it can have adverse effects, resulting in significantly longer patient stays.

Currently, there are no tests that can predict <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage,</b> only tests that can detect <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> once it has happened. Additionally, cardiac monitoring that may indicate early abnormal cardiac changes in a patient is expensive. Consequently, it is desirable for doctors, and support systems, to detect <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> from the standard parameters collected for ICU patients. In this study, we have developed a model to predict <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> based on cardiovascular derangements occurring before the damage.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPatients {{undergoing}} {{vascular surgery}} are {{at increased risk}} for developing cardiac complications. Majority of patients with perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> are asymptomatic. Our objective is to review the available literature addressing the prevalence and prognostic implications of perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> in vascular surgery patients. MethodsAn Internet-based literature search was performed using MEDLINE to identify all published reports on perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> in vascular surgery patients. Only those studies published from 2000 to 2010 evaluating <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> using troponin I or T, with or without symptoms of angina pectoris were included. ResultsThirteen studies evaluating the prevalence of perioperative myocardial ischaemia or infarction were included in the study. The incidence of perioperative myocardial ischaemia ranged from 14 % to 47 % and the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction ranged from 1 % to 26 %. In addition, 10 studies evaluating the prognostic value of perioperative myocardial ischaemia towards postoperative mortality or the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events were included. In the retrieved studies, hazard ratios varied from 1. 9 to 9. 0. ConclusionThe high prevalence and asymptomatic nature of perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage,</b> combined with a substantial influence on postoperative mortality of vascular surgery patients, underline the importance of early detection and adequate management of perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage.</b> This article provides an extended overview regarding the prevalence and prognostic value of perioperative myocardial ischaemia and infarction in vascular surgery patients.

Materials and methodsPreoperative ABI measurements were performed in 627 consecutive vascular surgery patients (carotid artery or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair). An ABI 1. 40 or (a history of) intermittent claudication were excluded. Serial troponin-T measurements were performed routinely {{before and after}} surgery. The main study endpoint was perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage,</b> the composite of myocardial ischaemia and infarction. Multivariate regression analyses, adjusted for conventional risk factors, {{evaluated the}} relation between asymptomatic low ABI and perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage.</b> ResultsIn total, 148 (23 %) patients had asymptomatic low ABI (mean 0. 73, standard deviation± 0. 13). Perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> was recorded in 107 (18 %) patients. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that asymptomatic low ABI was {{associated with an increased}} risk of perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> (odds ratio (OR) : 2. 4, 95 % CI: 1. 4 – 4. 2) Conclusions: This study demonstrated that asymptomatic low ABI has a prognostic value to predict perioperative <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> in vascular surgery patients, incremental to risk factors imbedded in conventional cardiac risk indices...|$|R

40|$|Anotace (abstract) Biomarkers {{diagnosing}} <b>myocardial</b> <b>damages</b> {{have recently}} been a very dynamically developing part of clinical biochemistry. Implementing of new biomarkers is very prompt; they are mostly implemented into practice without wider clinical and analytical experience. During a few years these are new methods to determine myoglobin, troponins (cTnI, cTnT), CK-MB mass, BNP etc. The effort of clinical biochemists and cardiologists is to cover all phases and levels of <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> in acute coronary syndromes by means of cardio markers. These investigations are dramatically changing the view of diagnosis, determination of prognosis and therapy in acute coronary syndromes. In my thesis I covered retrospective data analysis in patients with the pain in the chest, presented at an inpatient clinic. The value of <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> indicators and their dynamism was analysed from the definitive diagnosis point of view. I performed my own analysis at OKB Nemocnice Písek, a. s. (Hospital Písek, Inc.). The aim of my thesis was to cover the significance of particular <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> markers and find out if investigated set of markers is sufficient for correct and prompt diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. In terms of this thesis I {{tried to find out}} if the panel of cardiac markers contains excess values. In OKB Písek, a. s. the panel of <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> markers includes: myoglobin, troponin I, CK-MB mass and the marker of heart failure BNP. In the samples of fifty-six patients I analysed the presence of the above mentioned markers of <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> and heart failure. I examined only the markers which were determined by a physician. In the group of investigated patients with chest pain, measured values of troponins proved myocardial infarction in sixteen patients, values of CK-MB mass in sixteen patients and values of myoglobin in twelve patients. In the control group of twenty patients with chest pain the boundary values of troponin I were measured in two patients, without the increase of other <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> markers. High value of troponin I was measured in two patients in non-ischemic <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> (acute pericarditis), which agrees with data in scientific literature. The thesis shows that the level of troponin I reflects <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage</b> relatively accurately; troponin I is sufficiently cardio specific but is not a sufficiently early marker. For early management of acute myocardial infection it is important to determine myoglobin, which is detectable within two hours since the beginning of troubles but is not sufficiently cardio specific. The course of CK-MB mass elevation wave copies the course of troponin I elevation wave. That is why the investigation of this marker appears to be excessivet at current investigation of troponin I and myoglobin to prove <b>myocardial</b> <b>damage,</b> which is in agreement with scientific association recommendations...|$|R
