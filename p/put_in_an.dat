5|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 March 2013 that West Ham {{had signed a}} 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extra million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was {{to move into the}} stadium {{prior to the start of}} the 2016–17 season. Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Members of Task Force Manchu {{who escaped}} from Hill 209 brought back {{considerable}} intelligence information of North Korean {{activity in the}} vicinity of the Paekchin ferry crossing site. At the ferry site the North Koreans had <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> underwater bridge. A short distance downstream, each night they placed a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning. Carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night, an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site.|$|E

Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Mick Jagger in Montauk, New York (the eastern tip of Long Island), Lennon and Pang saw a Scottish-style cottage {{for sale}} {{close to the}} Montauk Point Lighthouse. Lennon asked {{a real estate broker}} to <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> offer for it in February 1975. Lennon and Pang were also {{planning}} on visiting Paul and Linda McCartney in New Orleans in February 1975, where Wings were recording the Venus and Mars album, but Lennon reconciled with Ono the day before the planned visit, after Ono said she had a new cure for Lennon's smoking habit.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was {{to build up a}} disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late because he had to work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to sit on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E

5|$|Kisnorbo {{was handed}} the {{captaincy}} {{in the absence}} of suspended captain Jonny Howson on 16 August against Hull City. Kisnorbo scored an own goal against West Ham United on 21 August. Kisnorbo's poor form continued when he was sent off and gave away a penalty for Leeds in the match against Bristol City on 17 September. As a result of the suspension, Kisnorbo missed the League Cup game against fierce rivals Manchester United. After a spell on the bench due to the partnership of Tom Lees and Darren O'Dea, Kisnorbo came on as a substitute replacing O'Dea in Leeds' 1–1 draw against Cardiff City on 30 October. After starting in the 5–0 loss against Blackpool, Kisnorbo <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> impressive performance against his old side Leicester City on 6 November to help earn Leeds a clean sheet in a 1–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully put the {{apartment}} under surveillance, but Colton has them {{taken off the}} job. Mulder finds Scully's necklace in Tooms' apartment and tries to call his partner, but her phone line has been cut. Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism. When Tooms is given food through a slot in the door, {{he stares at the}} thin slot and grins.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in 1934, McCabe scored 2,078 runs at 69.28 {{including}} eight centuries on the tour, {{more than}} any of his teammates. In the second match of the tour against Leicestershire, McCabe scored the century that had eluded him four years earlier, finishing 108 not out. He then scored 192 against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's, combining with Ponsford in a record partnership for the third wicket of 389, in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests; the MCC fielded almost a full-strength England team. McCabe <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> all round performance against Hampshire, scoring 79 and taking 4/79 in the first innings. In the next match, he scored 240, the highest of his career, against Surrey at The Oval. In the next match, the last fixture before the Tests, McCabe made 142 against Lancashire.|$|E

5|$|The feud between Edge and Kane {{came to an}} {{end when}} Edge was <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> angle with Matt Hardy. On the July 11 episode of Raw, Hardy, who at the time was {{unemployed}} by WWE, made a surprise appearance, interfering in a match between Edge and Kane. The following week, as both Edge and Lita were walking towards the ring before a scheduled Steel cage match against Kane, Hardy attacked Edge from behind. On the August 1 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon officially announced Hardy's return to WWE, adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam. The following week, Hardy made his in-ring return, defeating Snitsky. After the victory, Hardy was attacked by Edge, and was carried backstage. In retaliation, Hardy counterattacked Edge in the locker room. At SummerSlam, Edge was given the win in the match after Hardy hit the ring post and began to bleed profusely, which caused the referee to stop the match.|$|E
5|$|The squad {{turned in}} a decent ride in the stage 2 team time trial, {{finishing}} ninth of 22 teams. The result installed Vinokourov into 27th place, 32 seconds off the race lead. Vinokourov took third in stage 4 on the Mûr-de-Bretagne, one of only ten riders to finish together {{at the front of}} the race. He moved up six places to 18th with this result. In stage 8 on Super Besse, Vinokourov and 's Juan Antonio Flecha <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attack that constituted a clear bid to take the yellow jersey. Starting the day 32 seconds back of race leader Thor Hushovd, Vinokourov surged past Flecha and all remaining members of the morning breakaway other than eventual stage winner Rui Costa. He occupied second position on the road, holding a sufficient time gap that he could take the race leadership, until he was reabsorbed by the depleted front peloton and finished at the back of that group. The result did, however, move Vinokourov up to 11th.|$|E
5|$|Wooten {{initially}} {{wanted a}} night landing, {{which would give}} tactical surprise and maximise the time for unloading the landing ships before Japanese aircraft <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> appearance; {{but there would be}} no moon on 4 September, so Barbey was uncertain that {{he would be able to}} correctly locate the beaches. H-Hour was therefore set at 06:30, which was twenty minutes after sunrise. Because the air force had commitments to support the 7th Division's landing at Nadzab the following day, air cover would not be available in the afternoon. Barbey therefore wanted the ships to depart at 11:00. This raised the question of whether the ships could be unloaded in just 4½ hours. Barbey gave assurances that unloading would continue even under Japanese air attack. For Australian officers with memories of the Tobruk Ferry Service, where the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy had lost 25 ships keeping the port's garrison supplied, the US Navy's attitude was not good enough.|$|E

5|$|Again, the day's {{principal}} breakaway {{was given}} a large time gap. After , Andrey Amador, Davide Malacarne, Mathew Hayman, Fabian Wegmann and Jens Mouris had a lead of over 11 minutes. The parcours began to take its toll at this point, and as the chase ramped up in the peloton, the time gap fell precipitously. By the time the ascent of the Sasso Tetto began, Mouris was gapped off and lost {{more and more time}} as the day went on, eventually finishing 21 minutes behind the stage winner. Hayman and Wegmann kept the pace for a while, and Wegmann won the day's second climb, the Camerino at , but eventually only Amador and Malacarne were left out front. The second group on the road eventually reduced itself to just a select group of overall favorites and contenders. Amador attacked first on the finishing circuit, but Malacarne made the bridge. Instead of working together to stay away and let a two-up sprint decide the stage winner, Amador and Malacarne sat on one another's wheels and let their rapidly falling advantage dwindle even further. From the elite group of contenders, Pinotti <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attack on an uphill section of the finishing circuit that effectively gapped off race leader Robert Gesink, who had used up all of his support riders at this point. Gesink finished 17 seconds back on the day, losing the race leadership.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} monument, the Tour of Flanders, BMC was noted to be {{bringing}} a strong squad, headed by Ballan and Hincapie. Burghardt and Van Avermaet {{went on the}} attack in the early portions of the race, only to be brought back after a short while. When Fabian Cancellara <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attack on the Leberg, the day's fourteenth cobbled climb, and quickly took a sizable time gap, it was the BMC team which organized the chase to bring him back. They placed four riders into a seven-rider chase group and succeeded in bringing Cancellara back, something which has usually not happened to him in classics races. A further two riders had remained {{at the head of}} the peloton, giving them six riders at the front of the race when Cancellara was caught. Cancellara put in another move on the Muur van Geraardsbergen and was followed only by Sylvain Chavanel and eventual race winner Nick Nuyens. Hincapie finished with the group 5 seconds back for sixth place on the day. Kristoff rode to seventh place in the sprinters' classic Scheldeprijs later in April, back of three-time winner Mark Cavendish.|$|E
5|$|During the relief, the {{battalion}} suffered heavy shelling, which, {{after it had}} moved into trenches {{in front of the}} village along the sunken road to Courcellette, was followed by a brief German attack that was repulsed and resulted in {{the battalion}} capturing 20 Germans. In the days that followed, the battalion worked to improve their defensive line, digging saps towards the German trenches while patrols were sent out into no man's land. Late on 8 August, the 15th <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attack alongside a British battalion from the Suffolk Regiment, on their left. Amidst heavy shelling and machine-gun crossfire, the attack stalled following the loss of almost all of the officers in the assaulting companies; nevertheless, despite progress on their left, they succeeded in capturing part of the German line, but were ordered to withdraw the following day. On the night of 9 August, a second attack was put in, in concert with the 16th Battalion, which succeeded in securing part of the German line, despite heavy shelling. At noon the following day, the 15th was relieved as the 4th Brigade was withdrawn from the line and replaced by the 13th. Casualties during the battalion's first battle on the Western Front were high: 90 killed and 370 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for about fifteen minutes. The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Riley's father, Carl (Paul Opacic), takes an instant disliking to Mercedes. This causes tension between Mercedes and Carl and they have sex. Carl and Mercedes begin an affair and Riley later proposes to Mercedes, which she accepts. Carl's son and Riley's brother, Seth (Miles Higson), discovers the affair and threatens to tell Riley. Mercedes tells Seth that he cannot reveal the affair because she is pregnant with Riley's child. She later tells Myra that she lied and is not pregnant. Myra tells Mercedes to fake a miscarriage, which she refuses to do. Mercedes attends an awards ceremony with Riley, where he becomes intoxicated. He accepts an award and attempts to get Mercedes onto the podium, but her high heel becomes trapped in the step. As Riley pulls her, she loses her balance and falls to the ground. Myra then declares that Mercedes is having a miscarriage. Mercedes is taken to hospital, where she is told that she is in fact twelve weeks pregnant. She explains to Myra that she is unsure of the child's paternity. On her wedding day to Riley, she reveals her affair with Carl. Riley's grandfather, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), who is a serial killer, kidnaps Mercedes {{as a result of}} her behaviour and holds her captive in a basement, planning to kill her when the baby is born. While Mercedes is in the basement, Silas is arrested for four murders, leaving Mercedes trapped while she goes into labour. Lynsey asks Silas to tell them where Mercedes is, but he refuses. She taunts him until eventually he reveals her whereabouts. Riley finds Mercedes, who is about to give birth. Mercedes gives birth to a baby boy, who is <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> incubator because of breathing difficulties. Mercedes is hurt when, after the birth, Riley declares he wants nothing more to do with Mercedes or the baby. However, he later continues to visit Mercedes and the baby who Mercedes names Bobby. Mercedes returns to live with the McQueens and after Riley refuses to see Bobby, Mercedes agrees to do a paternity test. The results confirm that Riley is Bobby's biological father. Mercedes and Riley argue over Bobby until Riley is transferred to a football club in Leeds and Mercedes asks him to take Bobby with him.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Dr. Paul Browning (Joe Thompson), who assumes {{she is a}} prostitute and pays her afterwards. Mercedes becomes a cleaner in a {{hospital}} along with Lynsey. Mercedes meets Doctor Browning {{at the hospital and}} he asks to keep seeing and paying Mercedes, which she agrees to. Mercedes convinces Lynsey to help a patient who is DNR. Lynsey is blamed for the incident and Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning had not put the patient's DNR request into their file. Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning is married and threatens him, telling him she will tell his wife of their relationship should he report Lynsey. Mercedes joins an escorting website. She is contacted by a client and arranges to meet him at a hotel. Lynsey finds Mercedes and stops her going ahead with it. Mercedes becomes depressed and Jacqui meets Riley, telling him if Mercedes were to see Bobby then she would feel better. Riley later arrives back in Hollyoaks asking Mercedes to sign legal documents so he will have full custody of Bobby. Mercedes and Riley agree to attend mediation, but Mercedes does not turn up as she gets drunk. Mercedes sees an online news article showing a picture of Riley and Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) together and considers running away with Bobby, but instead attends Bobby's christening service and slaps Mitzeee. She witnesses Riley and Mitzeee kissing in the car park and later confronts them. Mercedes begins stalking Mitzeee who leaves the village temporarily. Mercedes learns Silas will not be put to trial and will be <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> institute for the insane. Mercedes tells people she is fine but begins having nightmares of her time imprisoned by Silas. Mercedes meets up with Doctor Browning and has sex with him.
