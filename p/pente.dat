5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing north {{in the direction of}} Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at <b>Pente</b> Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city's northeastern flank.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks {{employed}} Attic numeration, {{which was}} based on the system of the Egyptians and was later adapted and used by the Romans. Greek numerals one through four were vertical lines, as in the hieroglyphics. The symbol for five was the Greek letter Π (pi), which is the letter of the Greek word for five, <b>pente.</b> Numbers six through nine were <b>pente</b> with vertical lines next to it. Ten was represented by the letter (Δ) of the word for ten, deka, one hundred by the letter from the word for hundred, etc.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Pierre Raffarin {{was often}} teased for his optimistic aphorisms, known colloquially and {{ironically}} as raffarinades, {{the best known}} being La route est droite, mais la <b>pente</b> est forte ("The road is straight, but the slope is steep"). Some consider that the word raffarinade was created {{in reference to the}} other French word mazarinade. However, mazarinade refers to the songs that the frondeurs (French revolutionaries during the Régence of Queen Anne – Archduchess of Austria – and chief minister Cardinal de Mazarin, before king Louis XIV's personal reign) sang to mock the unpopular chief minister.|$|E

The show was hosted by Giorgos Capountzides and Zeta Makripoulia from the Greek television series Sto Para <b>Pente</b> and included a recap of Greece's entries from 1974 to 2005. Past entries such as [...] "Mathima Solfege", [...] "Stop", [...] "I Anixi", and [...] "I Would Die for You" [...] were shown on a large screen along with a video message by 2006 Eurovision host Maria Menounos, while Sakis Rouvas, Elena Paparizou, and Nana Mouskouri all sent personal messages via satellite.

2500|$|In many cases, {{the gender}} {{and number of}} a noun can be deduced from its ending: the basic pattern is [...] "-o" [...] / [...] "-os" [...] for {{masculine}} singular and plural, [...] "-a" [...] / [...] "-as" [...] for feminine. So, casa ("house"), mala ("suitcase"), pedra ("stone"), and inteligência ("intelligence") are feminine, while carro ("car"), saco ("bag"), tijolo ("brick"), and aborrecimento ("annoyance") are masculine. However, the complete rules are quite complex: for instance, nouns ending in -ção are usually feminine, except for augmentatives like bração ("big arm"). And there are many irregular exceptions. For words ending in other letters, there are few rules: flor ("flower"), gente ("folk"), nau ("ship"), maré ("tide") are feminine, while amor ("love"), <b>pente</b> ("comb"), pau ("stick"), café ("coffee") are masculine.|$|E
2500|$|P'ent'ay (from , also transliterated as Pentay or <b>Pente)</b> is an Amharic and Tigrinya {{language}} {{term for}} a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad. The term was coined in the late 1960s and {{was used as a}} pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience. Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches. The term P'ent'ay is a shortening of the word [...] "Pentecostal"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not. Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia. The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals. The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning [...] "Christ foundation") or Mennonite. Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity. But {{for the most part they}} are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.|$|E
6000|$|Northward of Copiapo, in {{latitude}} 26 degrees S., the old voyager Wafer found immense {{numbers of}} sea-shells some {{miles from the}} coast. (Burnett's [...] "Collection of Voyages" [...] volume 4 page 193.) At Cobija (latitude 22 degrees 34') M. d'Orbigny observed beds of gravel and broken shells, containing ten species of recent shells; he also found, on projecting points of porphyry, at a height of 300 feet, shells of Concholepas, Chiton, Calyptraea, Fissurella, and Patella, still attached to the spots on which they had lived. M. d'Orbigny argues from this fact, that the elevation must have been great and sudden ("Voyage, Part Geolog." [...] page 94. M. d'Orbigny (page 98), in summing up, says: [...] "S'il est certain (as he believes) que tous les terrains en <b>pente,</b> compris entre la mer et les montagnes sont l'ancien rivage de la mer, on doit supposer, pour l'ensemble, un exhaussement que ce ne serait pas moindre de deux cent metres; il faudrait supposer encore que ce soulevement n'a point ete graduel;...mais qu'il resulterait d'une seule et meme cause fortuite," [...] etc. Now, on this view, when the sea was forming the beach {{at the foot of}} the mountains, many shells of Concholepas, Chiton, Calyptraea, Fissurella, and Patella (which are known to live close to the beach), were attached to rocks at a depth of 300 feet, and at a depth of 600 feet several of these same shells were accumulating in great numbers in horizontal beds. From what I have myself seen in dredging, I believe this to be improbable in the highest degree, if not impossible; and I think everyone who has read Professor E. Forbes's excellent researches on the subject, will without hesitation agree in this conclusion.): to me it appears far more probable that the movement was gradual, with small starts as during the earthquakes of 1822 and 1835, by which whole beds of shells attached to the rocks were lifted above the subsequent reach of the waves. M. d'Orbigny also found rolled pebbles extending up the mountain to a height of at least six hundred feet. At Iquique (latitude 20 degrees 12' S.), in a great accumulation of sand, at a height estimated between one hundred and fifty and two hundred feet, I observed many large sea-shells which I thought could not have been blown up by the wind to that height. Mr. J.H. Blake has lately described these shells: he states that [...] "inland toward the mountains they form a compact uniform bed, scarcely a trace of the original shells being discernible; but as we approach the shore, the forms become gradually more distinct till we meet with the living shells on the coast." [...] ("Silliman's American Journal of Science" [...] volume 44 page 2.) This interesting observation, showing by the gradual decay of the shells how slowly and gradually the coast must have been uplifted, we shall presently see fully confirmed at Lima. At Arica (latitude 18 degrees 28'), M. d'Orbigny found a great range of sand-dunes, fourteen leagues in length, stretching towards Tacna, including recent shells and bones of Cetacea, and reaching up to a height of 300 feet above the sea. ("Voyage" [...] etc. page 101.) Lieutenant Freyer has given some more precise facts: he states (In a letter to Mr. Lyell [...] "Geological Proceedings" [...] volume 2 page 179.) that the Morro of Arica is about four hundred feet high; it is worn into obscure terraces, on the bare rock of which he found Balini and Milleporae adhering. At the height of between twenty and thirty feet the shells and corals were in a quite fresh state, but at fifty feet they were much abraded; there were, however, traces of organic remains at greater heights. On the road from Tacna to Arequipa, between Loquimbo and Moquegua, Mr. M. Hamilton found numerous recent sea shells in sand, at a considerable distance from the sea.
