40|$|The {{erythrocyte}} {{sedimentation rate}} (ESR) and the serum acute-phase proteins (APP), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, 9 th component of complement (C 9), and alpha, antitrypsin were measured on 231 occasions in 80 patients with ankylosing spondylitis and compared with those in 30 controls. APP levels did not correlate with clinical assessment of disease activity. However, there were significant correlations between CRP, C 9, and fibrinogen (p = less than 0. 01), suggesting that these APP may be more reliable indicators of disease activity. The mean values of the APP in those patients with a peripheral arthritis {{were significantly higher than}} in those with <b>pelvospondylitis</b> alone for ESR (p less than 0. 01), CRP (p less than 0. 01), and fibrinogen (p less than 0. 05). The only significant difference between those patients with an iritis and those with only <b>pelvospondylitis</b> was an elevated CRP in the iritis group (p less than 0. 01). This suggests that a peripheral arthritis is the most important cause of an elevated ESR or APP in ankylosing spondylitis. Serum immunoglobulins were also measured and they showed a significant elevation of IgA in all 3 patients groups, there being no difference between each group. Serum IgG was raised only in those patients with an iritis or peripheral arthritis, the IgM levels being within the normal range for all patient groups...|$|E
40|$|One-way mixed {{leucocyte}} reactions (MLR) {{were performed}} between blood leucocytes from control subjects or pairs {{of patients with}} one of the following diseases: multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis arthropatica, <b>pelvospondylitis,</b> SLE, or scleroderma. Cells from each subject were also simultaneously tested against cells from a healthy `standard' person. Impaired MLR were found in all these patient categories compared with a control group of both healthy individuals and patients with unrelated diseases. The results of the patientâ€“standard combinations indicated that the impaired MLR were not due to deficiencies in the patients' lymphocytes preventing stimulation of or response in MLR. One possibility is that the cause lies outside the lymphocytes, perhaps in an impaired macrophage function...|$|E
40|$|Human {{synovial}} joints {{display a}} characteristic anatomic distribution of arthritis e. g. rheumatoid arthritis primarily affects the metacarpophalangeal and proximal finger joints, but rarely the distal finger joints, while osteoarthritis {{occur in the}} distal and proximal finger joints. <b>Pelvospondylitis</b> has a selective localization to the spine and sacroiliac joints. Is this tropism due to differences between the cartilages at the molecular level? To substantiate this concept the present study provides a background detailed compositional analysis by relative quantification of extracellular matrix proteins in articular cartilages, meniscus, intervertebral disc, rib and tracheal cartilages on samples from 5 - 6 different individuals using an optimized approach for proteomics. Tissue extraction followed by trypsin digestion and 2 D LC-separations coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, relative quantification with isobaric labeling, iTRAQ, {{was used to compare}} the relative abundance of about 150 proteins. There were clear differences in protein patterns between different kinds of cartilages. Matrilin- 1 and epiphycan were specific for rib and trachea, while asporin was particularly abundant in the meniscus. Interestingly, lubricin was prominent in the intervertebral disc, especially in the nucleus pulposus. Fibromodulin and lumican showed distributions that were mirror images of one other. Analyses of the insoluble residues from guanidine extraction revealed that a fraction of several proteins remained unextracted e. g. asporin, CILP and COMP indicating crosslinking. Distinct differences in protein patterns may relate to different tissue mechanical properties, and to the intriguing tropism in different patterns of joint pathology...|$|E
