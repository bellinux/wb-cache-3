However, the ACLU opposes attempts to control political spending. The ACLU supported the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v.

40|$|In this paper, we {{amend the}} {{standard}} model of law enforcement, by introducing a marginal cost of <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> We derive the associated optimal enforcement policy. We show that, as the marginal cost of <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> increases, the objective of raising <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> gradually replaces that of deterring harmful activity and that the optimal policy varies accordingly. In particular, we prove that, when the harm caused by the illegal activity is sufficiently small, some overdeterrence will be optimal for sufficiently large marginal cost of <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> Cost of <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> Fine Probability of detection...|$|R

5|$|The {{project has}} been {{supported}} by some public officials, and received some <b>public</b> <b>funding,</b> but received criticism for its financial ties to the Church of Scientology, for exposing rescue workers to potential medical dangers, and for discouraging their use of orthodox medicine.

5|$|Through the 1950s {{increased}} funding advanced {{the place of}} sciences within the institution. In 1950, the university had completed the construction of three academic buildings for the sciences, all designed by local architect William Russell Souter. <b>Public</b> <b>funding</b> was eventually necessary to ensure the {{humanities and social sciences}} were given an equal place. Thus, in 1957 the University reorganized once again under The McMaster University Act, 1957, dissolving the two colleges. Its property was vested to McMaster and the university became a nondenominational institution eligible for <b>public</b> <b>funding.</b> The historic Baptist connection was continued through McMaster Divinity College, a separately chartered affiliated college of the university. Also in 1957, PhD programs were consolidated in a new Faculty of Graduate Studies. Construction of the McMaster Nuclear Reactor also began in 1957, and was the first university-based research reactor in the Commonwealth when it began operating in 1959.|$|E
5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the annual Scotland v England fixture in 1989, questions were raised as to whether Scottish football required a separate national stadium. Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative venue, while Murrayfield {{was about to be}} redeveloped without <b>public</b> <b>funding.</b> None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E

40|$|The {{marginal}} cost of <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> is the equilibrium price {{at the intersection}} of the appropriately-defined demand curve for and the supply curve of public expenditure. In a world with identical people and with no excess burden of taxation, that price would have to be 1. Otherwise the median voter's choice of a demogrant - or of its opposite, a head tax - fixes the {{marginal cost}} of <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> at the ratio of the mean income to the median income. A proof of this assertion is presented not for its realism, but because it calls attention to the interaction of the different influences upon the marginal cost of <b>public</b> <b>funds.</b> Marginal Cost of <b>Public</b> <b>Funds...</b>|$|R

The controversy involved her belief that abortion was tragic but should be legal, despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|An equestrian {{statue of}} the General was erected in Boulogne-sur-Mer; the statue was inaugurated on October 24, 1909, at a {{ceremony}} attended by several units from the Argentine military.

The statue is 10m high, on a 4m by 6m base; it is well known to locals. Located on the beach, it was virtually untouched by the numerous bombings campaigns during both world wars.|$|E

5|$|In June 2003 Wikipedia was {{transferred}} to a nascent non-profit organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, which was formed as a charitable institution to supervise Wikipedia and its associated wiki-based sites. When the foundation was established, its staff began to solicit <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> and Bomis turned Wikipedia over to the non-profit. All Bomis-owned hardware used to run Wikipedia-associated websites was donated to the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wales transferred Wikipedia-related copyrights from Bomis to the foundation. It was first headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, where Bomis was located. The foundation shifted Wikipedia's dependence away from Bomis, allowing it to purchase hardware for expansion.|$|E

5|$|Off the field, the Mariners' AL West {{championship}} {{as well as}} its memorable run in {{the postseason}} served as a catalyst for <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> for a new ballpark. Less than two weeks before the tiebreaker, the residents of King County, Washington (whose county seat is Seattle) voted against a sales tax increase to fund a new stadium, but shortly after their ALDS victory, the Washington State Legislature reconvened and approved a separate funding package for a new stadium.

5|$|Oslo Package 3 is a {{political}} agreement between all the major projects on what to spend <b>public</b> <b>funding</b> for transport in Oslo and Akershus on. The agreement was made in 2007, and consists of 53 billion Norwegian krone (NOK), which will be shared between investments in road infrastructure, public transport infrastructure, and operating subsidies for Ruter. Financing comes from the state, the counties and from toll roads. The agreement states the major investments which are planned during a 20-year period. In addition, the previous agreement, Oslo Package 2, still has funding for some smaller projects.|$|E
