40|$|Component {{deterioration}} {{due to a}} crack is of {{the highest}} importance for the engineering community. Fracture mechanics have mainly been used for studying and evaluating crack or defect nucleation and propagation. This article presents a methodology based on inducing a crack (cut) into mechanical components to characterise an induced residual stress field. This research work’s originality was aimed at highlighting fracture mechanics’ role in detecting possible component destruction by energetic analysis of crack propagation and evaluating service-life {{to be used as}} a technique for characterising the effect of prior loading history regarding a given material. The technique presented in this work is known worldwide as the crack compliance method, based on linear elastic fracture mechanics principles developed by Vaidyanathan and Finnie. Three studies are shown (bent beam, <b>pressurised</b> <b>pipe</b> and modified SEN specimen) where components were induced with a residual stress field. The way non-homogeneous loading could introduce a residual stress field is also presented; if residual stress field acting on a specimen has been characterised, then the mechanical process can be manipulated and a beneficial effect induced into the material...|$|E
40|$|An {{approximation}} of the friction factor of the Colebrook-White equation is proposed, which is {{expressed as a}} power-law function of the pipe diameter and the energy gradient and is combined with the Darcy-Weisbach equation, thus yielding an overall power-law equation for turbulent <b>pressurised</b> <b>pipe</b> flow. This is a generalised Manning equation, whose exponents are not unique but depend on the pipe roughness. The parameters of this equation are determined by minimising the approximation error and are given either in tabulated form or as mathematical expressions of roughness. The maximum approximation errors are much smaller than other errors resulting from uncertainty and misspecification of design and simulation quantities and also {{much smaller than the}} errors in the original Manning and the Hazen-Willians equations. Both these can be obtained as special cases of the proposed generalised equation by setting the exponent parameters constant. However, for large roughness the original Manning equation improves in performance and becomes practically equivalent with the proposed generalised equation. Thus its use, particularly when the networks operate with free surface flow is absolutely justified. In pressurised conditions the proposed generalised Manning equation can be a valid alternative to the combination of the Colebrook-White and Darcy-Weisbach equations, having the advantage of simplicity and speed of calculation both in manual and computer mode...|$|E

40|$|ONE OF THE {{key issues}} {{in the design and}} {{construction}} of any gas pipeline is the prevention of material fracture. Since the gas is generally transported under high operating pressures, it must be ensured that the gas pipeline is sufficiently tough to arrest the propagation of any potential fracture. For several decades, control of gas pipeline fracture propagation has been under scrutiny due to economic considerations and ecological and safety hazards related to <b>pressurised</b> <b>pipe</b> failure. The Battelle Two Curve approach has been widely used to determine the minimum material arrest toughness by comparing the gas decompression wave velocity with the fracture velocity, both as functions of the local gas pressure. Sufficient knowledge of the gas decompression behavior following the rupture is therefore crucial in determining running fracture arrest toughness levels. The decompression behaviour is influenced by the operating conditions, fluid composition and the material properties of the pipeline itself. This paper describes a two-dimensional decompression model developed using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS Fluent. The GERG- 2008 Equation of State has been implemented into this model to simulate the rapid decompression of common natural gas mixtures. The evolution of the decompression wave speed and phase changes under arbitrary initial conditions is reported. Comparison with experimental results obtained from shock tube tests showed good agreement between simulation and experiment...|$|E
40|$|Extruded unplasticised Poly(Vinyl Chloride) (uPVC) pipes are {{certified}} using <b>pressurised</b> <b>pipe</b> tests. During {{these tests}} the pipes {{are subjected to}} a certain temperature and internal pressure, while the time-to-failure, the time at which the internal pressure drops due to rupture or fracture, is measured. These tests are time consuming and are therefore costly. To circumvent these costs a model-based approach is proposed where the time-to-failure is predicted. The input parameters for this approach can be determined using short term measurements. The approach uses the observation that the timeto- failure kinetics of uPVC pipes subjected to an internal pressure is independent {{of the type of}} failure mode (ductile, semi-ductile or brittle). This supports our statement that the underlying mechanism that initiates failure is similar for these types of failure. Local deformation of the material up to a critical value of the anelastic strain is believed to determine the start of failure of the material. This critical strain appears to be constant for the testing conditions used during this study. A pressure modified Eyring expression is employed to calculate the strain rate resulting from the applied stress at a certain temperature. The time-to-failure follows from the calculated strain rate and the critical strain of the material. This approach has been verified against literature data and shown to hold quantitatively. Furthermore, the model seems to hold for different processing conditions...|$|E
40|$|A genetic {{algorithm}} optimisation {{study has been}} conducted for the proposed <b>pressurised</b> <b>pipe</b> distribution system for the rehabilitation of the Loxton Irrigation District. The original off-farm water distribution system was constructed soon after World War II and although {{more than half of}} it was piped it operated as an open channel system. Project managers -SA Water intended to use a {{genetic algorithm}} study to optimise design of the new distribution system, but expanded the study to assist in determining the optimum pumping and residual pressures. The minimum residual pressures considered in the study were 3 m, 20 m, 25 m, 30 m, 35 m and 40 m. The study investigated only costs that were likely to vary between the various residual pressure options. The results of the study were then used by the growers of the Loxton Irrigation District as a basis for their decision as to which pressure option to adopt for the new system. Total costs for the 3 m minimum residual pressure option are close to $ 34. 7 million, and range up to $ 45. 1 million for the 40 m minimum residual pressure option. As a result of the genetic algorithm optimisation study, the growers of the Loxton Irrigation District adopted a residual pressure of 35 m, even though they must pay 100 % of the incremental cost above a system with a residual pressure of 3 m. The decision was unanimous {{based on the fact that}} the 35 m residual pressure system would effectively not cost any more than the 3 m residual pressure system when on-farm expenses and the like were added into the equation.

40|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the classical}} equation for flow through an orifice assumes a fixed orifice area. However, pipe materials exhibit expansion behaviour with increasing pressure, which alters the size of orifices and results in greater leakage rates. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to study the behaviour of round holes and cracks in pipes through theoretical and experimental work. The results of the study include equations derived for increased flow through round holes in pressurized cylindrical shells and pipes. The theoretical models explain the increased flow experienced due to the leak area increasing. The models incorporate material properties, shell geometry and fluid properties for both uni-axially and bi-axially stressed pipe sections. Analytical results are compared with previous finite element investigations. In addition, an experimental study into the effects of pressure on a round hole in a class 6 uPVC pipe was conducted. Conclusions are made relating to the influence of material expansion to increased flow rate through openings in pressurised cylinders. The results compared positively with those of the theoretical equations. Conclusions are made relating to the influence of round hole or crack expansion to an increased flow rate through openings in <b>pressurised</b> <b>pipes.</b> Results include the effects of geometrical and material variables on the expansion of round holes. Better explanation of the increased flow through orifices, documented by practical observations, is presented. Results indicate that round hole area is linearly related to pressure. However, testing on longitudinal cracks resulted in a non-linear relationship between crack area and internal pipe pressure. Results indicate the expansion of round hole area is minimal. Leakage however is greatly affected over extended time periods by even the smallest increase in defect area. Critical pressures before brittle fracture obtained from testing on longitudinal cracks were compared to theoretical formulation. Results show a close relationship between current theory and experimentation. Prof. K. van Zy...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. (Civil Engineering) Abstract: Pipe {{material}} behaviour plays a {{major role}} in the crack opening of pressurised water distribution systems. Several studies have shown that the amount of water that leaks from a crack can be much more sensitive to pressure than theory suggests. The aim of this investigation is to understand the structural behaviour of longitudinal cracks in pipes under pressure. This is achieved by subjecting several plates with different length of cracks to tension and monitoring the opening of the cracks. A theoretical model for a longitudinal crack opening is derived using the orifice equation, as a function of the pressure, pipe material properties, pipe geometry and fluid properties for uni-axial stress state. Subsequently an equation describing the increase of the leakage flow rate as a function of the increase of the crack area in uni-axial stress state is determined. Results show that the material around the longitudinal crack exhibited elastic expansion behaviour due to hoop stresses induced by internal pressure in the pipe. Therefore, the crack opening area increases until the material exceeds its yield strength, causing a bulging of crack faces thus resulting in a significant increase of the leakage flow rate. Conclusions are made in relation to the influence of longitudinal crack expansion to an increase flow rate through longitudinal crack opening in <b>pressurised</b> <b>pipes.</b> Results include the effects of geometrical and material variables on the expansion of the longitudinal crack. A better explanation of the increased flow rate through longitudinal crack, demonstrated by experimental data is presented in this study as a theoretical model. The leakage exponents resulting from the derived flow rate equation show a linear relationship with pressure a low stress and an exponential relationship at high stress. Further investigations are recommended to derive a model of flow rate under varying internal pressure for an increase of crack length combined with an increase of crack propagation. A coefficient as a corrector factor should be determined in order to greatly improve the theoretical derived equation of the maximum deflection of rectangular plates with a central crack under uniaxial tensile stresses...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of transient cavitating flow in <b>pressurised</b> polyethylene <b>pipes,</b> which are characterized by viscoelastic rheological behaviour. A hydraulic transient solver that describes fluid transients in plastic pipes has been developed. This solver incorporates the description of dynamic effects related to the energy dissipation (unsteady friction), the rheological mechanical behaviour of the viscoelastic pipe and the cavitating pipe flow. The Discrete Vapour Cavity Model (DVCM) and the Discrete Gas Cavity Model (DGCM) {{have been used to}} describe transient cavitating flow. Such models assume that discrete air cavities are formed in fixed sections of the pipeline and consider a constant wave speed in pipe reaches between these cavities. The cavity dimension (and pressure) is allowed to grow and collapse according to the mass conservation principle. An extensive experimental programme has been carried out in an experimental set-up composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes, assembled at Instituto Superior Técnico of Lisbon, Portugal. The experimental facility is composed of a single pipeline with a total length of 203 m and inner diameter of 44 mm. The creep function of HDPE pipes was determined by using an inverse model based on transient pressure data collected during experimental runs without cavitating flow. Transient tests were carried out by the fast closure of the ball valves located at downstream end of the pipeline for the non-cavitating flow and at upstream for the cavitating flow.

40|$|Understanding {{the flow}} {{behaviour}} of inorganic-wood fibre slurries {{is important for}} developing new process equipment for the cement fibreboard industry. Little is reported in the technical literature and generally slurry flow knowledge {{is limited to a}} few engineers within the industry. Pipe friction loss characteristics and the settling behaviour of inorganic-wood fibre slurries were studied and data were obtained in <b>pressurised</b> horizontal <b>pipes</b> ranging from 25 to 100 mm diameter at flow velocities up to 8 m/s. The inorganic solids studied were cement and fine silica of size range 10 to 150 m. Solids concentrations ranged from 5 - 20 % and fibre concentrations from 0 - 2 %. Wood pulp fibre suspensions at low fibre concentrations form a structured carrier medium with the ability to support fine particulate solids. Unlike fibre-free suspensions, no permanent stationary deposit formed and therefore no minimum settling velocity exists. At low flow rates particles are trapped in the fibre plug and the friction loss is above water. At high flow rates the particles are still supported but the fibres dislodged from the central plug core damp turbulence and friction losses for the cement-silica-fibre system are less than water (drag reduction). The overall flow behaviour is similar to and consistent with previous data reported for coal-fibre slurries. Fibre concentration has a significant affect on the onset of drag reduction and friction loss increases with fibre concentration as with conventional fibre suspensions. Pipe diameter has a minimal effect on the onset of drag reduction but friction loss decreases with diameter as with conventional fluids...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} water loss from water {{distribution}} systems {{is an issue}} that faces municipalities worldwide. A large proportion of water loss is a result of leakage. With increasing water scarcity across the globe, it is imperative to conserve water resources, and hence reduce leakage in water distribution systems as best we can. Leaks develop in various different forms, and they form in pipes of all materials. It has been observed in numerous cases around the world that pipe material has been removed from the pipe surfaces adjacent to leaks in excavated failed water distribution pipe specimens. It was proposed by various researchers that this pipe material was being removed as a result of abrasive soil action caused by the pipe leak itself. When <b>pressurised</b> water distribution <b>pipes</b> fail, they emit high velocity jets of water into the surrounding soil bed. Research has shown that high velocity jets of water entering a granular soil bed have the ability to fluidise the bed, allowing the granular particles to move freely. This fluidisation mechanism is known as internal fluidisation. The concept of internal fluidisation offers an explanation for the erosion of pipe material adjacent to pipe leaks. In this study, the removal of pipe material adjacent to leaks due to internal fluidisation has been termed "leakage-induced pipe erosion. " This phenomenon has received minimal attention from researchers in the past. Leakage-induced pipe erosion has the potential to aggravate small existing leaks. There are two main implications of aggravating small leaks; firstly, where water authorities do not utilise active leak detection programmes, aggravating the initial leak conditions of small leaks can result in increased long term water losses. Secondly, in water distribution systems where the water authority does implement active leak detection programmes, aggravating small leaks increases the probability of finding and repairing them. This aim {{of this study was to}} experimentally investigate the influence of various factors on the leakage-induced erosion process. Five main factors were investigated, namely bedding material grain size, cover depth, leakage flow rate, initial leak orientation and pipe material. An experimental setup was designed and manufactured in order to provide a controlled environment in which to investigate the factors affecting leakage-induced pipe erosion...|$|R
