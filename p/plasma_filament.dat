Then, we show {{that the presence of}} oxygen is detrimental to the laser gain. To further confirm the presence of population inversion, we send a counter-propagating seeding pulse into the <b>plasma</b> <b>filament.</b> This leads to an amplification of the seeding pulse by two orders of magnitude. The crucial role of pump laser polarization indicates that the inelastic collisions between the energetic electrons and the neutral N 2 molecules are at the origin of population inversion between the relevant states...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDielectric barrier {{discharges}} (DBD) in air at {{atmospheric pressure}} and at low frequency are mainly constituted of thin transient <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> (or microdischarges) with radii {{of a few}} hundreds of micrometers. In this work, we consider a point-to-plane geometry with the dielectric covering the plane electrode. <b>Plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> are initiated by streamers, starting from the high-field region close to the point electrode. The <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> deposit charges on the dielectric plate which screen the electric field and lead to an extinction of the discharge filaments. In this work we experimentally demonstrate the synchronous start of several filaments in a time range of less than a few tens of nanoseconds and we show that the charges deposited on the dielectric have a strong impact on the discharge structure. This is validated using a simple electrostatic model. Then, {{the dynamics of the}} 2 D streamer propagation in the gas gap and its interaction with the dielectric plane is calculated.

40|$|Two {{examples}} {{of the use of}} differential geometry in plasma physics are given: The first is the computation and solution of the constraint equations obtained from the Riemann metric isometry of the twisted flux tube. In this case a constraint between the Frenet torsion and curvature is obtained for inhomogeneous helical magnetic flux tube axis. In the second one, geometrical and topological constraints on the current-carrying solar loops are obtained by assuming that the <b>plasma</b> <b>filament</b> is stable. This is analogous to early computations by Liley [(Plasma Physics (1964) ] in the case of hydromagnetic equilibria of magnetic surfaces. It is shown that exists a relationship between the ratio of the current components along and cross the <b>plasma</b> <b>filament</b> and the Frenet torsion and curvature. The computations are performed for the helical plasma filaments where torsion and curvature are proportional. The constraints imposed on the electric currents by the energy stability condition are used to solve the remaining magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations which in turn allows us to compute magnetic helicity and from them the twist and writhe topological numbers. Magnetic energy is also computed from the solutions of MHD equations. Comment: Departamento de Fisica Teorica-IF-UERJ-Rio-Brasil. submitted to physics of plasma...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAt {{atmospheric}} pressure, dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs) {{are mainly}} constituted of unstably triggered non-equilibrium transient <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments,</b> also called microdischarges. A self-organization of <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> and their {{interaction with the}} deposited charges upon the dielectric material has been tudied previously for frequencies {{on the order of}} a few kilohertz (for example see Guikema et al (2000 Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 3817) and Chirokov et al (2004 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 13 623 – 35)). In this paper we realized a DBD in the configuration cylinder-tip to dielectric plate biased by a low frequency power supply (50 Hz) in synthetic air. Using a CCD camera coupled with electrical diagnostics we observed collective behaviour of <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> in the gas gap, as already observed for symmetric surface dielectric barrier discharges (ASDBD) in Allegraud et al (2007 J.

We also show how the surface charge deposited upon the dielectric plate modifies the spatial organization of microdischarges in this experimental device.

40|$|We use a pin-grid {{electrode}} {{to introduce}} a corrugated electrical potential into a planar dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) system, so that the amplitude of the applied electric field has {{the profile of a}} two-dimensional square lattice. The lattice potential provides a template for the spatial distribution of <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> in the system and has pronounced effects on the patterns that can form. The positions at which filaments become localized within the lattice unit cell vary with the width of the discharge gap. The patterns that appear when filaments either overfill or under-fill the lattice are reminiscent of those observed in other physical systems involving 2 d lattices. We suggest that the connection between lattice-driven DBDs and other areas of physics may benefit from the further development of models that treat <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> as interacting particles.

Two mechanisms of nano-particles formation are depicted from aerosol size distributions and TEM analysis. 0. 1 - 10  mJ prevented spark discharges produce 10 - 100  nm droplets ejected from melted craters as well as nucleated primary particles and subsequent 10 - 100  nm agglomerates, by nucleation and coagulation in expanding vapor jets. With smaller energy per filament, 0. 1 - 10  J micro-discharges and 0. 1 - 100  J streamers, the initial local vapor fluxes emitted from spots of interaction between <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> and electrodes are reduced. Subsequent smaller primary particle density limits the local coagulation in the vapor plume since 2 - 10  nm non-agglomerated crystalline metal nano-particles are produced in mono-DBD with Au, Ag and Cu electrode. Besides, {{the evolution of the}} aerosol size from primary nano-particles to agglomerates with transit time suggests slow coagulation of these primary metal particles in mono-DBD. Aerosol properties depend on the energy per filament and on the electrode. The final size is controlled by plasma parameters and transit time in and after the plasma. The aim is to underline emerging applications of atmospheric pressure plasmas for the production of tailored particles with tunable size, composition and structure with non-thermal <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> to control the resulting properties of nano-powders and materials.

40|$|In this paper, we {{examined}} <b>plasma</b> structures (<b>filaments),</b> {{observed in the}} dayside magnetosphere but containing magnetosheath <b>plasma.</b> These <b>filaments</b> show the stable antisunward motion (while the ambient magnetospheric plasma moved in the opposite direction) {{and the existence of}} a strip of magnetospheric <b>plasma,</b> separating these <b>filaments</b> from the magnetosheath. These results, however, contradict both theoretical studies and simulations by Schindler (1979), Ma et al. (1991), Dai and Woodward (1994, 1998), and other researchers, who reported that the motion of such filaments through the magnetosphere is possible only when their magnetic field is directed very close to the ambient magnetic field, which is not the situation that is observed. In this study, we show that this seeming contradiction may be related to different events as the theoretical studies and simulations are related to the case when the filament magnetic field is about aligned with filament orientation, whereas the observations show that the magnetic field in these filaments may be rotating. In this case, the rotating magnetic field, changing incessantly its direction, drastically affects the penetration of <b>plasma</b> <b>filaments</b> into the magnetosphere. In this case, the filaments with rotating magnetic field, even if in each moment it is significantly inclined to the ambient magnetic field, may propagate through the magnetosphere, if their average (for the rotation period) magnetic field is aligned with the ambient magnetic field. This shows that neglecting the rotation of magnetic field in these filaments may lead to wrong results...|$|R

Here, we analyze the stability properties of rectangular arrays as a function of four parameters: relative phase of the generating beams, number of filaments, separation between them, and initial power. We find that arrays with alternating phase of filaments are more stable than similar arrays with all beams in phase. Additionally, we show that increasing the size of an array increases its stability, and that a proper choice of the beam separation and the initial power has to be made in order to obtain a dense and regular array of filaments...|$|E
