40|$|Hot dip {{galvanizing}} {{technology is}} now widely {{used as a}} method of protection for steel rebars. The corrosion behaviors of Q 235 carbon steel and hot galvanized steel in a Ca(OH) 2 solution with a pH from 10 to 13 was investigated by electrode potential and polarization curves testing. The results indicated that carbon steel and hot galvanized steel were all passivated in a strong alkaline solution. The electrode potential of hot dip galvanized steel was lower than that of carbon steel; thus, hot dip galvanized steel can provide very good anodic protection for carbon steel. However, when the pH value reached 12. 5, a polarity reversal occurred under the condition of a certain potential. Hot dip galvanized coating became a cathode, and the corrosion of carbon steel accelerated. The electrochemical behaviors and <b>passivation</b> <b>abilities</b> of hot dip galvanized steel and carbon steel were affected by pH. The higher the pH value was, the more easily they were passivated. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

Therefore to study the stress effect on its structure and protective properties is of significant interest. The aim of this work is to research the tensile stress influence on the passivation, indexes of corrosion, protective film structure and reveal reasons for promoting hydrogenation and emerging propensity for delayed fracture of titanium alloy VТ 22 in the marine air atmosphere. The fulfillеd research has shown that: - there is а tendency to reduce the <b>passivation</b> <b>abilities</b> of the alloy VТ 22 in synthetic marine water (3 % solution of NaCl) with increasing tensile stresses up to 1170 МPа, namely to reduce the potential of free corrosion {{and the rate of}} its сhange, thus the alloy remains absolutely (rather) resistant; - the protective film consists of a titanium hydroxide layer under which there is the titanium oxide layer adjoining to the alloy, basically providing the corrosion protection. - the factors providing hydrogenation of titanium alloys and formation in their surface zone fragile hydrides, causing the appearing propensity for delayed fracture, alongside with tensile stresses are: - substances promoting chemisorbtion of hydrogen available in the alloy and on its surface; - the cathodic polarization caused by the coupling; - the presence of the structural defects promoting the formation of pitting and local аcidifying of the environment surrounding the alloy. </p...|$|R

We successfully demonstrated that even using the less aggressive carbonate/methanol solution as the ON deprotection system, hybridization with the complementary ON target took place, thus confirming that ONs can be synthesized and deprotected on the PSi surface. However, the synthesis of mixed-sequence ONs using the carbonate/methanol solution in the final ON deprotection step would {{require the use of}} highly expensive ultra-mild nucleobase-protected phosphoramidites characterized by having non-standard very labile protecting groups. In the present paper, we describe the results of alternative PSi-friendly ON deprotection conditions during the in situ synthesis of mixed-sequence ONs on PSi supports by using standard phosphoramidite nucleoside monomers, without using ultra-mild reagents.|$|E

40|$|Diamond is a {{promising}} semiconductor material for high power, high voltage, high temperature and high frequency applications {{due to its}} remarkable material properties: it has the highest thermal conductivity, it is the hardest material, chemically inert, radiation hard and has the widest transparency in the electromagnetic spectrum. It also exhibits excellent electrical properties like high breakdown field, high mobilities and a wide bandgap.   Hence, it may find applications in extreme conditions {{out of reach for}} conventional semiconductor materials, e. g. in high power density systems, high temperature conditions, automotive and aerospace industries, and space applications.     With the recent progress in the growth of high purity single-crystalline CVD diamond, the realization of electronic devices is now possible. Natural and HPHT diamonds inevitably have too high a concentration of impurities and defects for electrical applications. To develop efficient electronic devices based on diamond, it is crucial to understand charge transport properties. Time-of-flight {{is one of the most}} powerful methods used to study charge transport properties like mobility, drift velocity and charge collection efficiency in highly resistive semiconductors, such as diamond. For commercial diamond devices to become a reality, it is necessary to have an effective surface passivation since the <b>passivation</b> determines the <b>ability</b> of a device to withstand high surface electric fields. Surface passivation studies on intrinsic SC-CVD diamond using materials like silicon oxide, silicon nitride and high-k materials have been conducted and observations reveal an increase in measured hole mobilities. Planar MOS capacitor structures form the basic building block of MOSFETs. Consequently, the understanding of MOS structures is crucial to make MOSFETs based on diamond. Planar MOS structures with aluminum oxide as gate dielectric were fabricated on boron doped diamond. The phenomenon of inversion was observed for the first time in diamond. In addition, low temperature hole transport in the range of 10 - 80 K has been investigated and the results are used to identify the type of scattering mechanisms affecting hole transport at these temperatures. To utilize the potential of diamonds properties and with diamond being the hardest and most chemically inert material, new processing technologies are needed to produce devices for electrical, optical or mechanical applications. Etching of diamond is one of the important processing steps required to make devices. Achieving an isotropic etch with a high etch rate is a challenge. Semi-isotropic etch profiles with smooth surfaces were obtained by using anisotropic etching technique by placing diamond samples in a Faraday cage and etch rates of approximately 80 nm/min were achieved. Valleytronics, which is a novel concept to encode information based on the valley quantum number of electrons has been investigated for the first time in diamond. Valley-polarized electrons with the longest relaxation time ever recorded in any material (300 ns) were observed. This is a first step towards demonstrating valleytronic devices...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{recombination}} velocity (S sub rec) for bare GaAs is typically as high as 10 to the 6 th power to 10 to the 7 th power cm/sec, which dramatically lowers the efficiency of GaAs solar cells. Early attempts to circumvent this problem by making an ultra thin junction (xj less than. 1 micron) proved unsuccessful when compared to lowering S sub rec by surface passivation. Present day GaAs solar cells use an GaAlAs window layer to passivate the top surface. The advantages of GaAlAs in surface passivation are its high bandgap energy and lattice matching to GaAs. Although GaAlAs is successful in reducing the {{surface recombination}} velocity, it has other inherent problems of chemical instability (Al readily oxidizes) and ohmic contact formation. The search for new, more stable window layer materials requires a means to compare their surface <b>passivation</b> <b>ability.</b> Therefore, a device structure is needed to easily test the performance of different passivating candidates.

In this study, liquid GC/MStechnique is used to detect their formation in electrolytes based on solvent mixtures of EC and differentlinear carbonates (DMC, DEC and EMC), after the first cycle in full cells composed of synthetic graphitepowder/commercial positive films. These compounds stem from linear carbonate electrochemical reduc-tion leading to alkoxide compounds and can be quantified using a selective bicyclic boron ester Lewisacid as an electrolyte additive. Moreover, a quantitative study on ethylene bis-carbonate compounds forwhich the generation profile is different depending on the linear carbonate type, shows that either inbatteries or in a simple chemical mixture of electrolyte and lithium alkoxide, their formation stops whenit reaches a threshold concentration due to the thermodynamic equilibrium.

While microcrystalline μc-Si:H is a good candidate for the emitter layer due to its high doping efficiency, intrinsic a-Si:H with its low interfacial defect density, high optical bandgap and good <b>passivation</b> <b>ability</b> makes it the ideal buffer layer to passivate the crystalline silicon interface. In this study, we report the film properties of intrinsic a-Si:H passivation layers deposited using RF (13. 56 MHz) PECVD, at different SiH 4 /H 2 gas flow ratios, pressures and temperatures.

40|$|Corrosion {{protection}} of steel by glass flake (GF) containing coatings {{is widely used}} in marine atmosphere. Eventhough, the coatings conttaining glass flake are highly corrosion resistant, their performance is decreased due {{to the presence of}} pinholes and coating defects. It is well established that polyaniline containing coating is able to protect the pinhole defects in the coatings due to passivating ability of polyaniline. Hence a study has been made on the corrosion protection ability of steel using polyaniline-glass flake composite containing coating with 10 % loading of glass flake in epoxy binder. The polyaniline glass flake composite (PGFC) was synthesized by chemical oxidation of aniline by ammonium persulphate in presence of glass flake.

Electrochemical polarization tests and free corrosion tests were performed in 0. 1  M HCl aqueous solution. The corrodkote test (ASTM B 380 - 97 R 02) was also performed, to evaluate the coatings qualitatively. The heat treatment improves the corrosion resistance of the Co- 28 Mo- 17 Cr- 3 Si coating and of the Ni- 20 Cr- 10 W- 9 Mo- 4 Cu- 1 C- 1 B- 1 Fe coating by enhancing their <b>passivation</b> <b>ability.</b> The precipitation of sub-micron sized secondary phases after the treatment may produce galvanic microcells at intralamellar scale, but the beneficial contribution provided by the healing of the very small but dangerous interlamellar defects (normally present in thermal spray coatings but not detectable using ordinary scanning electron microscopy) prevails. The effect on Ni- 32 Mo- 16 Cr- 3 Si- 2 Co coatings is more ambiguous: its sensitivity to crevice corrosion is worsened by the heat treatment. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Global {{photovoltaic}} (PV) market harvested {{rapid growth}} annually {{during the past}} two decades. As the primary part of this rapid growth, most of Silicon (Si) wafer-based solar cells employ screen printing(SP) technology for metallization on both polarities of P-type CZ Si wafers and the solar cell efficiency is around 18 %. This efficiency is significantly lower than that of high efficiency solar cells developed in research laboratory. The fabrication of high efficiency solar cells in laboratory usually involves multiple expensive processes and high quality silicon material which are not suitable for production. Compared to the complicated and expensive laboratory process for high efficiency solar cell, SP technology is a simple and robust process. However, such technology also has some disadvantages such as poor blue response, high shading issue, low aspect ratio of metal fingers and insufficient rear surface passivation. Selective emitter (SE) technology is one possible way to further increase solar cell efficiency by harvesting more blue light. SE technology is of high interest to the PV industry in recent past. One of the cost effective method of achieving SE is by using laser doping. The laser doped selective emitter (LDSE) solar cell developed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) combines laser doping and self-aligned light induced plating (LIP) technologies which make {{it one of the most}} feasible solutions for industrial selective emitter solar cell structure. The main advantage of LDSE technology is the simultaneously creation of dielectric layer patterning and localized heavy doping without an extra high temperature process or any other masking processes which are required by other technologies. In this thesis, LDSE technology was employed to improve the conversion efficiency of solar cells using a commercial available continuous wave (CW) green laser. The basic laser theory was reviewed and laser induced defects by CW laser were studied. The impact of different laser parameters and dielectric layer combinations on the morphology of laser scanned region was investigated. The process optimization of standard LDSE solar cells was presented. The focus of optimization was given to two key processes: laser doping and light induce plating in the LDSE solar cell process. Wide ranges of parameters were investigated in detail for each process, such that systematic improvements were demonstrated. The influences of different parameters on final solar cell devices were studied through the use of techniques such as light I-V curve, spectral response, scanning electron microscope, focus ion beam etc. As a result of optimizations, a final solar cell device with efficiency > 19 % was achieved on p-type 1 &# 937;cm Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafer. The other very important aspect of improving solar cell efficiency is the rear surface design. The aluminum (Al) back surface field (BSF) used in SP solar cells only has moderate passivation effect. Such Al BSF was identified as a limiting factor for standard LDSE solar cells. To overcome this problem, a stack dielectric layer of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) was developed. Such stack layer demonstrated excellent surface and bulk <b>passivation</b> <b>ability</b> on commercial grade p-type 1 &# 937;cm CZ Si wafer with carrier lifetime of 670 µs and implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) of 735 mV. The significance of rear surface passivation has been realized by researchers worldwide as a key approach for high efficiency solar cell designs and several dielectric layers were successfully developed to passivate Si surface and get high carrier lifetime. However, challenge lies in making local contact opening on the dielectric layers or forming local BSF (LBSF) without massive jeopardize <b>passivation</b> <b>ability</b> using industry suitable approach rather than expensive photolithograph which is normally employed in laboratory. As a local heating process, laser doping could achieve dopants diffusion and dielectric layer patterning in step without causing massive degradation in the <b>passivation</b> <b>ability</b> of dielectric layer. In this thesis, CW laser system was used to create double sided laser doped (DSLD) solar cell by performing phosphorous and boron laser doping to front and rear surface of industry p-type CZ Si wafer passivated by SiNx/SiO 2 stack layers on the front surface and SiO 2 /SiOxNy stack layers on the rear surface. By optimizing the thermal stability of the dielectric layers, emitter sheet resistance and the laser doping parameters, over 700 mV iVoc was achieved on CZ Si samples after laser process, prior to metallization. As proof-of-concept, DSLD solar cells were made on CZ samples. Open circuit voltage (Voc) in the range of 660 mV was achieved with high short circuit current density. However, at this stage, the solar cells efficiency is limited by low fill factor (FF). The origin of low FF was investigated and possible causes and solutions were discussed. At the end of this thesis, DSLD solar cells with Voc of 680 mV was achieved on p-type 1 &# 937;cm CZ silicon wafers by optimizing rear surface metallization process...|$|E
40|$|III-V {{semiconductors}} such as InAs {{have recently}} been employed {{in a variety of}} applications where the electronic and optical characteristics of traditional, silicon-based materials are inadequate. InAs has a narrow band gap and very high electron mobility in the near-surface region, which makes it very attractive for high performance transistors, optical applications, and chemical sensing. However, InAs forms an unstable surface oxide layer in ambient conditions, which can corrode over time and leach toxic indium and arsenic components. Current research has gone into making InAs more attractive for biological applications through passivation of the surface by adlayer adsorption. In particular, wet-chemical methods are current routes of exploration due to their simplicity, low cost, and flexibility in the type of passivating molecule. ^ This dissertation focuses on surface modifications of InAs using wet-chemical methods in order to further its use in biological applications. First, the adsorption of collagen binding peptides and mixed peptide/thiol adlayers onto InAs was assessed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) along with atomic force microscopy (AFM) data suggested that the peptides successfully adsorbed onto InAs, but were only able to block oxide regrowth to a relatively low extent. This low <b>passivation</b> <b>ability</b> is {{due to the lack of}} covalent bonds of the peptide to InAs, which are necessary to effectively block oxide regrowth. The addition of a thiol, in the form of mixed peptide/thiol adlayers greatly enhanced passivation of InAs while maintaining peptide presence on the surface. Thiols form tight, covalent bonds with InAs, which prevents oxide regrowth. The presence of the collagen-binding peptide on the surface opens the door to subsequent modification with collagen or polyelectrolyte-based adlayers. Next, the stability and toxicity of modified InAs substrates were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and zebrafish studies. InAs substrates modified with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based adlayer showed the highest stability in physiological conditions by leaching the lowest amounts of indium and arsenic. Modified substrates also showed no toxicity to zebrafish after incubation for 120 hours. Overall, these findings suggest that a variety of adlayers can be functionalized onto InAs surfaces and successfully passivate the surface, along with decreasing InAs toxicity. Finally, we demonstrate how surface modifications can be applied to a different III-V semiconductor, GaN, in order to modulate cellular adhesion. Modification of GaN with a laminin-derived peptide increases the adhesion of PC 12 neuronal cells and alters the physical morphology of the adhered cells. Additionally, no toxicity to cells is observed, further demonstrating the potential for employing III-V semiconductors in biological applications. ...|$|E
