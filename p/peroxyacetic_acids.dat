Only rinsing with 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite, <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> or contact with gaseous chlorine dioxide resulted in significantly higher reductions {{of the total}} plate count (1. 5 - 2. 5 log cfu/g) than the ones achieved by washing with tap water (0. 5 log cfu/g). However, those treatments giving the best results from a microbial point of view induced {{significant changes in the}} sensory quality. Regarding the effects on nutrient content, the mechanical effects caused by water washing already reduced the vitamin C content by 16 - 29 %. Contrary to washing with neutral electrolysed oxidising water and contact with chlorine dioxide gas, a supplementary decrease of the vitamin C content ranging between 9 and 28 % was observed, when <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> or 200 mg/L sodium hypochlorite were used. After the use of <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> or gaseous chlorine dioxide, the phenol content also showed a decreasing trend, although not statistically significant.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of the catalase-peroxidase of Burkholderia pseudomallei with <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> has been analyzed using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Two well-defined species were observed, the first defined {{by an increase in}} intensity and narrowing of the Soret band at 407 nm and a 10 -nm shift of the charge transfer band from 635 to 625 nm. These features are consistent with a ferric spectrum with a greater proportion of sixth-coordination character and are assigned to an FeIII-peroxyacetic acid complex. Complementary 9 -GHz EPR characterization of the changes in the ferric signal of the resting enzyme induced by the binding of acetate in the heme pocket substantiates the proposal.

Regardless, the entire plant has undergone intense sanitation, which began August 21. About 80 workers {{were involved in the}} cleanup, with additional outside experts and microbiologists supervising the operation. They used <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> quaternary ammonium compound, isopropyl alcohol, refrigeration gel and a granular compound to disinfect the parts of the apparatuses. About 600 employees were to attend a four-hour training session on Listeria and on cleanliness, and about 250 employees were laid off while the plant was being cleaned.|$|R
5000|$|The use of peroxyacids and {{peroxides}} when {{performing the}} Baeyer-Villiger oxidation {{can cause the}} undesirable oxidation of other functional groups. Alkenes and amines {{are a few of}} the groups that can be oxidized. For instance, alkenes in the substrate, particularly when electron-rich, may be oxidized to epoxides. However, methods have been developed that will allow for the tolerance of these functional groups. In 1962, G. B. Payne reported that the use of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a selenium catalyst will produce the epoxide from alkenyl ketones, while use of <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> will form the ester.|$|R
40|$|Peroxyacids are {{commonly}} used in chemical processing, synthesis and bleaching. Recently, they have been demonstrated to be very versatile for the epoxidation of unsaturated oil, aiming at the synthesis of polyepoxide (plasticizer, resins and adhesives). These processes are characterized by high yields and selectivity. However, due to their hazard and instability, the peroxy reactants are often obtained from the corresponding organic acid in situ by combination with hydrogen peroxide, {{in the presence of}} a mineral (sulphuric or phosphoric) acid as catalyst. In this paper, the kinetic of decomposition of the <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> in water phase have been studied by using simple thermal screening calorimetry, with or without the catalyst...|$|R
5000|$|TAED is an {{important}} component of laundry detergents that use [...] "active oxygen" [...] bleaching agents. Active oxygen bleaching agents include sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide. These compounds release hydrogen peroxide during the wash cycle. Hydrogen peroxide is however an inefficient bleach below 60 C. TAED and hydrogen peroxide react to form <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> a more efficient bleach, allowing lower temperature wash cycles, around 40 C. TAED was first used in a commercial laundry detergent in 1978 (Skip by Unilever). Currently, TAED is the main bleach activator used in European laundry detergents and has an estimated annual consumption of 75 kt.|$|R

This study was undertaken to evaluate enhanced Salmonella and E. coli inactivation on blueberries by washing with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in combination with other common antimicrobial agents, such as organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. The addition of 5000 ppm SDS in 500 ppm acetic acid, 200 ppm hydrogen peroxide, and 20 ppm <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> resulted in more than 4. 0 log 10 CFU/g reductions of Salmonella and E. coli. Low-temperature frozen storage had a significant impact (P< 0. 05) on microbial counts of both treated and untreated blueberries. None of the washings decreased the total phenolic, anthocyanins content and apparent quality, but frozen storage caused significant damage to the texture of both treated and untreated blueberries. A solution containing 500 ppm acetic acid plus 5000 ppm SDS, 200 ppm hydrogen peroxide in combination with 5000 ppm SDS, and 20 ppm <b>peroxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> coupled with 5000 ppm SDS holds promise in enhancing the safety of blueberries and frozen storage has the potential to enhance their effectiveness. However, these three washing solutions did not inactivate Salmonella and E. coli on strawberries presumably due to the rough surface of strawberries and the presence of numerous surface-borne achenes (seeds), which provide hidden areas for the bacteria to attach and are less accessible to sanitizing solutions. Thus, these experiments indicate that once strawberries were contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium and E. coli O 157 :H 7, there is a potential health hazard to cause illness for consumers.
