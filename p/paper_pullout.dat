40|$|A {{simplified}} shear design {{method is}} proposed for reinforced and prestressed concrete beams, based on {{analysis of the}} influencing factors and correlation with test results. The proposed method takes into account significant parameters influencing concrete contribution to shear capacity. Shear reinforcement contribution to shear capacity includes consideration of variable diagonal cracking angle. A non-iterative procedure and a simple formula for diagonal cracking angle, including effect of axial force, are proposed. The beneficial aspects of LRFD longitudinal reinforcement anchorage requirement and the maximum shear limit in LRFD are retained in this proposed method. Design examples are given. The example shows how Av/s is calculated and demonstrates to difference in results of the proposed method {{with those of the}} AASHTO LRFD, AASHTO Standard, and ACI- 318. ^ In a recently concluded investigation on shear limits in precast prestressed concrete girders for Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR), it was determined that the AASHTO LRFD limit of 0. 25 f′cbdv for maximum shear reinforcement is attainable as long as an adequate number of strands is anchored into the abutment diaphragms. In addition, extending strands in prestressed concrete girders beyond member ends and bending them into cast-in-place pier diaphragms can be a cost-effective method of controlling creep and shrinkage effects in bridges designed as simple spans for girder and deck weights and continuous spans for additional loads. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>pullout</b> capacity of 0. 5 in. and 0. 6 in. (12. 7 and 15. 2 mm) diameter strands is evaluated. Two numerical design examples are included together with design recommendations for determining the required number and length of strands that need to be bent and embedded into the diaphragms. ^ The current AASHTO LRFD and Standard Specifications require that 4 percent of the total prestressing force be used for the design of end zone reinforcement in pretensioned concrete girders. In addition, AASHTO LRFD requires that the end zone reinforcement be placed within a distance from the end equal to one-fifth of the girder depth, while AASHTO Standard requires that the same amount of steel be placed within one-fourth of the girder depth. This requirement creates excessive reinforcement congestion in the end zone. In this study, a literature review was conducted to document the development of end zone reinforcement specifications. Analytical methods using strut-and-tie and equilibrium analysis models for end zone reinforcement design are discussed. Further, strains and stresses in the end zone reinforcement of various girders designed based on the current specifications were determined experimentally at prestress transfer. The results showed that the stress level in the end zone reinforcement was less than the stress recommended by the specifications. The locations of maximum moment predicted by the analytical model developed by Gergely and Sozen were found consistent with the crack locations observed. As a result of the analytical and experimental investigations, new end zone reinforcement details were developed. The new details installed in inverted tees and NU I-girders have been tested experimentally. The results showed the new details would reduce the amount of current reinforcement by 40 percent and it is effective in controlling crack propagation in the end zone, and eliminating the end zone congestion. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{experiments}} on the pullout of single polymer chains have revealed a complex {{behavior of the}} force fluctuations. This <b>paper</b> analyzes the <b>pullout</b> process theoretically and numerically and shows that these fluctuations {{can be made to}} shed light on disentanglement dynamics. To facilitate the analysis, I first derive the probability density function of the threshold force needed to disentangle one entanglement point. This function is found to be dominated by large fluctuations, which bears directly on the observed statistics. The average and variance of the force are calculated, and a numerical investigation of the dynamics is carried out to check the results. Finally, applications to deformations in several macroscopic systems are discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcements like bars, strips, {{textiles}} and grids {{are used for}} the reinforcement of soil walls {{in the modern era}} of civil engineering, but the use of cellular type of reinforcements is still under consideration and there is still a need of study the probable use of cellular reinforcement in reinforced soil retaining walls. Pullout test is commonly used to predict actual field pullout behaviour of reinforcements. In this <b>paper,</b> laboratory <b>pullout</b> tests are carried out with different height of cellular reinforcements along with planar sheet reinforcement, under two different normal pressures of 75 kPa and 100 kPa. Dimension optimization analysis for cellular reinforcement is done and longitudinal spacing to height ratio of 3. 3 is found as optimum. Finite element method is used to compare the experimental pullout behaviour and found in good accord with the laboratory test results. Experimental results are also compared to the theoretical analysis. It is found that the interference in between transverse member is increasing with increase in height of cellular reinforcement, yet the ultimate pullout resistance is found more with higher reinforcement heights, for spacing to height ratio greater than 3. 3.

40|$|As the {{offshore}} wind power tends to locate farther from the coast for efficient generation of electricity, the interest of foundation systems of which construction sequence is economical and convenient under deep water circumstance is increasing. Mooring anchor system has been utilized {{as one of the}} most popular ways for anchoring of vessels or floating structures, and various types of anchor and mooring system have been investigated for large structures under diverse loading condition. In this <b>paper,</b> the <b>pullout</b> behavior of the modified embedded suction anchor (ESA) is studied using numerical analysis. The behavior of the embedded suction anchor is simulated using finite element method, and Adaptive Meshing (AM) technique approach incorporated in Abaqus/Explicit is applied to simulate the large deformation of soil caused by continuous pullout of anchor. The three dimensional modeling is performed to duplicate the round body shape with flanges of the embedded suction anchor. The anchor is assumed as rigid body and clay is considered as a linear elastic-perfectly plastic soil model with a Tresca yield criterion. The pullout capacities after different initial rotations show similar results with the maximum horizontal pullout capacity and the load inclination of 30 ?? or 40 ?? at the bottom point of the ESA has an advantage in that reduced pullout load can rotate the ESA...|$|R

The equation for estimating the pullout resistance of this reinforcement in coarse-grained soils has been previously developed but not for fine-grained soil. Claystone soil, abundant in Mae Moh mine, is a fine-grained material when crushed and compacted.

40|$|In this <b>paper,</b> the {{ultimate}} <b>pullout</b> {{capacity of a}} shallow laid vertical plate strip anchor in cohesion-less soil is analyzed with the consideration of active and passive states of limit equilibrium in the soil. Kötter’s equation is used to compute the active and passive thrusts, which are subsequently used in the analysis in which, all the equation of equilibrium are properly interpreted. The unique failure surfaces under active and passive states of limit equilibrium are identified {{on the basis of}} force equilibrium conditions. One distinguishing feature of the proposed method is its ability to compute the point of application of active/passive thrust using moment equilibrium. Another distinguishing feature is the prediction of distribution of soil reactions on the failure surface. Comparison {{of the results of the}} proposed method with the available experimental results vis-a-vis other theoretical methods shows that, up-to embedment ratio of 3. 0, the proposed method is capable of making reasonably good predictions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The use of FRP {{bars and}} strips as near-surface mounted (NSM) {{reinforcement}} {{has become an}} emerging technique for the strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) members. The bond between NSM FRP reinforcements and concrete is a crucial factor affecting the efficiency of this technique. Many factors involving the interaction between FRP reinforcement, adhesive and concrete can affect the bond behaviour and failure load of the NSM strengthening system. In this <b>paper,</b> the modified <b>pullout</b> test (adapted to NSM reinforcement) is used to study the effect of groove surface (pre-formed and saw cut), groove geometry (dimensions and shapes), FRP bar type (material and surface treatment), bond length; and also of the incorporation, in the groove-concrete system, of different construction details that modify the NSM-concrete interaction (transverse interlocking with or without shear connectors, covering plate with shear connectors and confinement of surrounding concrete).

40|$|The {{effect of}} molding water {{contents}} (on dry and wet sides of optimum water content) on the pullout resistance {{mechanism of the}} bearing reinforcement embedded in a marginal lateritic soil is investigated in this <b>paper.</b> The total <b>pullout</b> resistance is contributed from the pullout friction and bearing resistances. The pullout friction resistance is approximated from the soil shear strength and interaction factor, α. The peak and residual interaction factors (α p and α r) are independent of molding water contents tested and are approximately 0. 63 and 0. 46, respectively. The bearing pullout resistance of a single isolated transverse member is dependent upon both shear strength and failure mode and can be approximated from the modified punching shear solution with various angles of transformation, β. The β values of the compacted soil at 0. 67 ≤w/wOWC≤ 1. 0 are essentially constant and equal to π/ 2 (where w OWC is the optimum water content). For 1. 0 OWC. The failure mechanism of the bearing reinforcement is classified into three zones (block, interference and individual), depending upon spacing and dimension of transverse member, S/B ratio. The transverse member interference zone is independent of water content when 0. 67 ≤w/wOWC≤ 1. 0 and decreases as w/w OWC increases when 1. 0 <w/wOWC≤ 1. 33. Based on a critical analysis of the test results, the pullout resistance equations in term of normal stress, shear strength parameters, S/B and molding water content are proposed. The proposed equations are useful for the internal stability analysis of bearing reinforcement earth walls during construction {{and at the end}} of construction...|$|R
40|$|Bearing reinforcement, {{which is}} {{composed}} of a longitudinal member (steel deformed bar) and transverse (bearing) members (a set of equal angle steel), has been established as an effective earth reinforcement material. The equation for estimating the pullout resistance of this reinforcement in coarse-grained soils has been previously developed. The usage of locally available soils as a backfill is particularly cost effective for construction sites {{where there is a}} lack of available quality materials. The pullout resistance mechanism of the bearing reinforcement embedded in cohesive-frictional soils with various fine contents is presented in this <b>paper.</b> The total <b>pullout</b> resistance is the sum of the pullout friction and bearing resistances. The pullout friction resistance is approximated from soil shear strength and interaction factor a, which is linearly related to fine content. The bearing pullout resistance of a single isolated transverse member can be approximated from the modified punching shear mechanism where the failure plane angle, b is primarily dependent upon fine content. The relationship between b and fine content is expressed by a polynomial function. The b value of p= 2 is suggested for fine contents less than 45 %. The transverse member interference is classified into three zones, depending upon spacing and dimension of transverse member, S/B ratio. The larger softened region caused by transverse member interference develops with smaller fine content. Based on a critical analysis of the test results, the pullout resistance equations for bearing reinforcement with different normal stresses, dimensions and spacing of transverse members embedded in different cohesiveefrictional soils compacted at optimum point (optimum water content and maximum dry unit weight) are developed in term of total strength parameters. The application of the proposed equations are finally illustrated and verified. The developed equations is useful for the internal stability analysis of bearing reinforcement earth walls during construction and at the end of construction...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{stress-strain}} {{state and}} the effectiveness of shear resistance of a glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bar soil nail in a pullout test was studied in laboratory using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing measurement. Both experimental study and numerical simulation were carried out and results are compared in this <b>paper.</b> In the <b>pullout</b> test, cement slurry was grouted into one predrilled borehole with a GFRP bar in a completely decomposed granite (CDG) soil mass, forming a cement-grouted GFRP bar soil nail. This GFRP bar soil nail was pulled out from the CDG soil mass in laboratory to investigate the performance of the GFRP bar soil nail during the pullout test process. Three loading cycles were applied to pull the GFRP bar soil nail out. Compared with traditional electricity-based strain gauges,FBGsensing technique is a relative novel technology to geotechnical structures health monitoring and has a number of advantages including high accuracy, multiplexing, electromagnetic interference resistance, and good repeatability. In the current study, one fiber line had a series of FBG strain sensors with a sequence of initial wavelengths. This fiber line with five FBG strain sensors was adhered on the pregrooved GFRP bar before grouting and was used to measure the strain distribution along thisGFRPbar with cement grout during a pullout test. The mechanical behavior of theGFRPbar soil nail is evaluated by using the measured strain results in the paper. It is found that the pullout results of theGFRPbar soil nail are in good agreement with numerical calculation results. Test results also show that theFBGsensors are reliable for measuring the strain variation at all measured points under different loading stages. Furthermore, a simplified pullout resistance model originally proposed for GFRP pipe soil nails was employed to examine the laboratory pullout results of a GFRP bar soil nail. It is found that the simplified pullout resistance model is also applicable for the GFRP bar soil nail. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
