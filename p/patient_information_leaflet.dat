Evaluation of whole brain florbetaben PET images using the clinically applicable visual assessment method demonstrated that florbetaben provides good diagnostic efficacy in detecting/excluding cerebral neuritic β-amyloid plaques. Sensitivity and specificity {{of the whole}} brain assessment was 98 and 89%, respectively, against the histopathological standard of truth. Good agreement between blinded readers (kappa 0.90) was reported. Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect β-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see [...] ). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer. All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection-site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection-site irritation (1.2%).

40|$|There is much {{discussion}} {{about how the}} structure in a <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflet</b> should be. This research is conducted to compare the revised text structure, as proposed by Pander Maat and Lentz (2011), with a current text structure of a <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflet</b> (PIL). The structure in which the information is represented in a PIL is of great importance. Readers often experience difficulties with the readability and usability of PILs. This study can contribute in improving the text structure in a <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflet</b> {{so that it is}} easier for patients to locate correct information in a PIL. We focussed mainly on the grouping of topics, the presentation of the information and the phrasing of the headings. The outcome of this study has demonstrated {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} both the revised and current PIL. First we looked at the influence of the text structure (current and revised) on the findability of the information in a PIL. Secondly we examined the participant’s perception on the current and revised PIL. We expected that the revised text structure could help to improve the findability and appreciation of the leaflet but also the compatibility between the PILs structure and the readers’ medication schema. The findability scores have been measured on the number of correct locations on scenario questions. The perception was measured by how participants appreciated and evaluated these text structures. The objective was to find out whether the revised text structure has a positive effect on the findability and perception of the PIL. The outcome of this study demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of both the revised and current PIL. The effect of a PIL with the revised text structure as opposed to a current text structure on the user’s ability to find the information is as follows: whereas the main structure was better in the revised text structure, the quality of the subheadings are better in the current text structure. The expectation that a PIL with a revised text structure results in better findability of information in a <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflet</b> than a PIL with a current text structure is partly confirmed because the manipulation of the main headings is successful. At the other hand the quality of subheadings is less profitable. The perception and appreciation of the organisation of the information, wording and overall design was slightly higher for the revised PIL. The expectation that a PIL with the revised text structure is perceived in a more positive way than a PIL with a current text structure receives some support. Further research is essential to explore the positive aspects of both current and revised PIL to optimize the text structure in a <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflet.</b> These results can be a guideline for future research intended to improve the readability of patient information leaflets...|$|E

The decision to include leaflets from these two societies was based on accessibility. Future studies may include leaflets from additional societies and practices hence presenting a wide-ranging assessment of the quality and readability of orthodontic <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflets.</b> The reliability of readability tools has been previously reported [10]. A disadvantage of readability tools is that the majority are usually based on sentence length, syllable count, or vocabulary indexes. A potential bias could be introduced into the findings as a short word could score well using a measure of readability but is not a word that is widely used or understood [1]. To account for this, an evaluation of both readability and comprehension is recommended [1]. In addition, the qualitative score from a lay assessor may also be considered in the assessment of the quality of <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflets.</b> The translation of complex dental/medical terminology into lay terms may not be fully achievable without changing the meaning of the words.

Design of study A structured review of <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflets.</b> Setting All community pharmacies and general practices in one Primary Care Trust were invited to supply leaflets. Methods Readability was assessed using the SMOG scoring system. Presentation and content were reviewed using the Ensuring Quality <b>Information</b> for <b>Patients</b> (EQIP) guidelines. Three consultant dermatologists assessed each leaflet for accuracy. Results Thirty-one different <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> were returned. Thirteen (42 %) {{were published in the}} previous 2 years, but 10 (32 %) were over 5 years old. Nine (29 %) leaflets were produced by the NHS or Health Education Authority, and 8 (27 %) were linked to a commercial organization. One leaflet had readability in the primary education range (SMOG score = 6), and none with the recommended range for health education material (SMOG score ≤ 5). Two leaflets (6 %) were in the highest quartile of EQIP score for presentation and content.

40|$|Objective: The ABOP-project aims {{to improve}} the {{readability}} of Dutch <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> (PILs) by tackling three of the main issues that make a PIL difficult to read: {{a large amount of}} scientific terms, redundancy and ambiguously formulated instructions and warnings (1). Methods: An automatic optimizer of <b>patient</b> <b>information</b> <b>leaflets</b> was developed as a MS-Word plug-in, based on a learning system (2) for the detection of scientific terms (terminology module), and a rulebased system for the detection of text structure (redundancy module) and syntactic complexity (instructions module). The impact of the automatically suggested adaptations for a range of PILs was measured using readability tests (face to face interviews and computer-based questionnaires), health literacy tests, and the CIRF (3) instrument. Tests were performed for each module, and for the tool as a whole. Results: ABOP successfully detects scientific terms with a precision of more than 80 %, as well as discrepancies in text structure, and ambiguously formulated instructions and warnings. Readability tests revealed that, controlling for a priori health literacy differences, the PILs adjusted for terminology by the ABOP tool scored significantly higher than the original PILs (p= 0. 001). The same was true for perceived readability, as measured using the CIRF (p= 0. 025). Readability tests for adaptations concerning text structure and instructions / warnings, {{as well as for the}} combination of the three modules, are underway.
