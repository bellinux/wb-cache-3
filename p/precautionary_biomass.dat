40|$|We {{examined}} {{the biological and}} economic impact of changing from management based on single-species limit reference points to one based on alternative targets, using the multispecies multifleet North Sea flatfish fishery. The robustness of reference points was tested against identified changes in plaice and sole biology. Current ICES single-species limit and <b>precautionary</b> <b>biomass</b> and fishing mortality reference points were seldom consistent with each other. Although they were generally robust to biological uncertainty, fishing at Fpa for sole could lead to stock collapse under one biological scenario. Adoption of alternative targets would reduce reliance on current reference points as stocks moved to a more sustainable state. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY), maximum economic yield (MEY), and maximum employment conditions implied different effort levels in the two fleets modelled, and different profits. Ftarget could be achieved with equal effort reductions in both fleets. Changes in stock biology affected the fishing effort required to maximize employment within the fishery, whereas MSY, Fmax, and MEY targets were robust to this uncertainty. Resulting profits and yields did vary widely, however. The selection of target reference points therefore requires stakeholders to define fishery objectives explicitly, against which targets can be evaluated for the resulting trade-offs between risk to stocks, yield, employment, and other social objective...|$|E
40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are the 7 main {{target species}} of the mixed {{demersal}} fisheries of the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Among these, cod and plaice stocks are at low levels (historically), there is risk of poor recruitment and the current levels imply ongoing and significant losses in long-term yields. The 7 main resources are exploited {{by a variety of}} competing fleets deploying often quite unselective gears. The poorly defined fishing strategies result in high discards or unallocated landings far in excess of the single species TACs and thus jeopardizing multi-annual recovery and management plans. In this paper we propose a fleet specific effort management system. The fleet specific effects we estimate are based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species caught. They are then weighted by the ratio of the actual SSB size and the <b>precautionary</b> <b>biomass</b> reference (Bpa) which is also the ‘ecological quality objective’. As an axiom, fishing activities are thus considered more beneficial with decreasing numbers of species represented in the catch. The developed relative effort factors were applied in medium term simulations of the annual management decision processes on future catch possibilities, in accordance with the existing or proposed multi-annual management plans (including the cod recovery). Uncertainties in the international catch data compiled and the stock assessments significantly undermine the results and their application for management purposes. Towed nets, including seines equipped with 70 - 99 mm or ≥ 100 mm mesh size, beam trawlers ≥ 80 mm and gill nets are identified as the main gears affecting the depleted cod and plaice stocks. In contrast, trawls of 16 - 31 mm, longlines and other gear types appear to less significantly affect the stocks we considered. The proposed fleet management would require stringent effort reductions for the cod and plaice sensitive fleets over a time period of about 5 years, i. e. towed nets of ≥ 100 mm mesh size, beam trawlers ≥ 80 mm, trawls of 70 - 99 mm and gill nets. This will reduce the exploitation rates of all stocks significantly and, after their recoveries, catches will continuously exceed recent levels by far and management interventions would be minor. The more selective longlines and other fleet types will profit from increased effort and catch allowances over the entire scenario periods. The recovery and management plans on cod are dominating the management decisions resulting in significant under-exploitation of each haddock, saithe and plaice stocks due to poor fishing strategies with high by-catches. Even a low degree of non-compliance with the effort and adapted catch allowances as simulated through parameter bias indicates significant delays in realizing the predefined management goals. JRC.

Sci., 36 : 1 – 17. doi: 10. 2960 /J. v 36. m 544 Cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland {{supported}} substantial {{commercial fisheries}} for extensive periods in the past. Both stocks declined {{and have been}} under fisheries moratoria since 1994, but continue to be harvested as by-catch in other directed fisheries on the Grand Bank. For each stock, a <b>precautionary</b> spawning stock <b>biomass</b> limit reference point (Blim) has been established by the Scientific Council of the North-west Atlantic Fisheries Organization. In this study, stochastic simulations were {{used to evaluate the}} probability distributions of the time horizons required to rebuild each of the two stocks to above Blim. A range of by-catch mortality levels, recruitment models, and body growth and maturation rates were applied in the simulations. Uncertainty in the estimates of the numbers at age in the last assessed year and uncertainty in future recruitment were also incorporated within the simulations. If by-catches are not substantially reduced, the modelling results indicate there is virtually zero probability of attaining Blim by 2020 for either the cod or American plaice stocks on the Grand Bank...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{resource}} management faces trade-offs {{in the provision}} of various ecosystem goods and services to humanity. For fisheries management to develop into an ecosystem-based approach, the goal is not only to maximize economic profits, but to consider equally important conservation and social equity goals. We introduce such a triple-bottom line approach to the management of multi-species fisheries using the Baltic Sea as a case study. We apply a coupled ecological-economic optimization model to address the actual fisheries management challenge of trading-off the recovery of collapsed cod stocks versus the health of ecologically important forage fish populations. Management strategies based on profit maximization would rebuild the cod stock to high levels but may cause the risk of stock collapse for forage species with low market value, such as Baltic sprat (Fig. 1 A). Economically efficient conservation efforts to protect sprat would be borne almost exclusively by the forage fishery as sprat fishing effort and profits would strongly be reduced. Unless compensation is paid, this would challenge equity between fishing sectors (Fig. 1 B). Optimizing equity while respecting sprat <b>biomass</b> <b>precautionary</b> levels would reduce potential profits of the overall Baltic fishery, but may offer an acceptable balance between overall profits, species conservation and social equity (Fig. 1 C). Our case study shows a practical example of how an ecosystem-based fisheries management will be able to offer society options to solve common conflicts between different resource uses. Adding equity considerations to the traditional trade-off between economy and ecology will greatl...|$|R
