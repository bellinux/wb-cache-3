40|$|AbstractWe {{isolated}} mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Va (GnT-Va) knockout {{mice and}} studied the effects of loss of expression of GnT-Va on asparagine-linked glycans (N-glycan) synthesis and the gene expression of groups of glycosyltransferases and galectins. Loss of GnT-Va expression caused aberrant expression of several N-glycan structures, including N-linked β(1, 6) branching, poly-N-lactosamine, bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR), <b>altered</b> <b>gene</b> expression of several groups of glycosyltransferases and galectins was observed in GnT-Va null MEFs, supporting the observed changes in N-glycan structures. These results suggest that genetic disruption of GnT-Va ultimately resulted in <b>altered</b> MEFs <b>gene</b> expression and decreased tumor progression associated with loss of GnT-Va observed may result in part {{from a combination of}} effects from these <b>altered</b> <b>gene</b> expressions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) {{in law enforcement}} and border control applications has prompted some individuals with criminal background to evade identification by <b>purposely</b> <b>altering</b> their fingerprints. Available fingerprint quality assessment software cannot detect most of the altered fingerprints since the implicit image quality does not always degrade due to alteration. In this paper, we classify the alterations observed in an operational database into three categories and propose an algorithm to detect altered fingerprints. Experiments were conducted on both real-world altered fingerprints and synthetically generated altered fingerprints. At a false alarm rate of 7 %, the proposed algorithm detected 92 % of the altered fingerprints, while a well-known fingerprint quality software, NFIQ, only detected 20 % of the altered fingerprints.
