The machine was designed to produce lighting panels using Light-emitting diodes.

For example, a user needs to replace RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485 wire and run their data over Ethernet without making any changes to the server or the ultimate serial device, a user wants to replace a parallel leased line modem network with their parallel Ethernet network, or someone has a <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>machine</b> that puts ICs on boards, {{and they want to}} move the server into a back room where the equipment will be safe from damage. This {{application is}} ideal where a device exists with an application written to gather information from that device (common with sensors). This application allows them to eliminate the wiring. It can also be used with industrial devices (Allen-Bradley, Siemens, Modbus) so that those devices can be run transparently across the network.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, at {{the beginning}} of 2000 s, Single Head architectural technology was adapted for use in the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> <b>machine.</b> Single Head is the general acceptance of particular product architecture and is characteristic of technical evolution in a Pick and Place machines. Single Head architectural technology actually dominated the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> <b>machine</b> market. A dominant design often emerges in response to the opportunity to obtain economies of scale or to take advantage of externalities (Arthur, 1988). The K as a front runner of OSAT, adapted it in spite of having plenty of its own technologies because customers such as Samsung has strongly required it. Figure 1 presents the operation principle of Single Head Pick and Place Module. By utilizing the single head, Pick and Place machines pick the die from on wafer and placing them in the holes. Single Head technology is principle operation method, thus architecture technology. The K having accumulated knowledge about the operation principle of the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> <b>machine</b> began the innovation, because single Head component had a time lag during the process from picking the die to placing it the hole. Also the time required to move the die hindered quality control. Real time product inspection is much more important for OSATs.|$|E

30|$|In 1940 s, {{a printed}} circuit board (PCB) was created. It reduced the {{increasing}} complexity of attempting to wire circuits manually. However, as PCBs became more prevalent and advanced, it also became difficult to quickly and accurately produce circuit boards in large quantities. To solve these difficulties, the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> method, with its ability to place a large quantity of components on board extremely quickly arrived. <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> <b>machines</b> all function by picking up a component in one <b>place</b> <b>and</b> putting it in another, instead of using fingers or tweezers like a human operator would use.

30|$|Changing from Rotation Method to Vibration Feeding flip in the <b>Pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>Place</b> <b>machines</b> is {{not only}} an {{incremental}} innovation but also a modular innovation, using architectural knowledge in an internal firm in terms of overcome the discontinued technology. Since architectural knowledge is stable once a dominant design has been accepted, it can easily be embedded in these forms and thus becomes implicit (Henderson and Clark, 1990; O’Reilly and Tushman, 2008; Plessis, 2007; Yoon and Jeong, 2017). Firms that are actively engaged in incremental innovation, which occurs within the context of stable architectural knowledge are thus likely to manage much of their architectural knowledge. By considering the classification of innovation from Henderson and Clark (1990; Nonake and Tekeuchi, 1995; Senge, 1990; Lin, 2007; Yoon and Jeong, 2017). The K’s innovation can be classified as modular innovation. By internalizing architectural knowledge, engineers use strategies to find problem-solving within components. Problem solving strategies also reflect architectural knowledge about the component linkages that are crucial to the solution of routine problem (Henderson and Clark, 1990).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{constructive}} heuristic to optimise the component pick and place operations of a hybrid <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>machine,</b> which is {{a new type of}} surface mount device placement machine. Since a nozzle change operation is very expensive (it significantly adds to the overall assembly time), the heuristic gives highest priority to minimising the number of nozzle changes. The ordered nozzle selection heuristic begins by choosing the best nozzle pair that is most effective for picking and placing components onto the printed circuit board (PCB). Next, we schedule all pairs of PCB points, that are expecting components from the chosen nozzle pair. Then, the nozzle pairs are re-ranked based on the availability of component feeders and the PCB points that need to be scheduled. Again, the best nozzle pair is chosen and the previous steps are repeated. When none of the selected nozzle pairs can pick and place two components in a sub tour, we schedule the one component sub tour. Finally, when all the available PCB points, have been scheduled, we then reoptimise the schedule by minimising the nozzles changes. Computational results are presented. ...|$|E

The resistance of adhesive joints is measured using a four point method, the nonlinearity {{of the current}} vs. voltage charactristic using a modulation technique.

This article suggests a mathematical model, recently developed, for computation of scattered energy of vibrations sensed by the stylus during an object slippage in robot grippers. The model includes in it dynamic parameters like trial grasping force, object falling velocity, and geometry of object surface irregularities. It is envisaged that using the said mathematical model, {{with the help of}} robust decision making capabilities of artificial neural network (NN), a robot memory could be able to estimate appropriate/optimal grasping force for an object considering its physiomechanical properties.

The making of liquid alloy circuits is, today, a somewhat tedious handicraft that is time-consuming and not suited for mass production. In this diploma thesis a new method to produce liquid alloy circuitry is presented; print and roll. The circuits consists of Galinstan paths embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Conductive paths are printed in a two step sequence on semi-cured PDMS and then covered with uncured PDMS and exposed to a final curing step. Print and roll produces circuits that are of equal quality as the circuits made with the old method, with a speed and ease superior to the old method. Furthermore advantages and disadvantages with printing on partly cured PDMS substrates are discussed. Partly cured PDMS substrates is important for the print and roll process since it enables the use of uncured PDMS to cover the printed circuit. Using uncured PDMS as a cover-material makes it possible to print the circuits on flat substrates and to use a <b>pick</b> <b>and</b> <b>place</b> <b>machine</b> to place components on the circuit-paths.

The combined parameters of sintering temperature 250 °C, sintering pressure 10 MPa and sintering time 5 s were selected as the benchmark process to attach 2 mm × 2 mm × 0. 5 mm dummy Si devices. Then the effects of either the sintering temperature (240 to 300 °C), time (1 to 9 s) or pressure (6 to 25 MPa) on the porosity and shear strength of the sintered joints were investigated with 3 groups and a total of 13 experimental trials. The average porosities of 24. 6 to 46. 2 % and shear strengths of 26. 1 to 47. 7 MPa are comparable with and/or even better than those reported for sintered joints using wet nanosilver pastes. Their dependences on the sintering temperature, time and pressure are further fitted to equations similar to those describing the kinetics of sintering processes of powder compacts.

The alignment and reliable mounting of optical subcomponents such as semiconductor laser and photo diodes, micro lenses and micro prisms require far higher mounting and alignment accuracies than for micro-electronic parts. When connecting from silicon photonics chip level to single mode optical fibers, even higher precisions are called for (typically < 100 nm). Alignment and assembly commonly are performed on specialized lab equipment which needs manual operation, consuming {{a lot of}} time, with less possibilities for automation. To introduce {{a higher degree of}} automatized production, like it has become standard in large volume electronics, one can choose either active or passive alignment processes - or possibly a combination of both.

40|$|Micronic Mydata AB utvecklar och tillverkar maskiner för att automatisk montera elektroniska komponenter på kretskort, s. k. ”Pick and place” (PnP) maskiner. Komponenterna blir lokaliserade och inspekterade optiskt innan de monteras på kretskorten, för att säkerhetsställa att de monteras korrekt och inte är skadade. En komponent kan t. ex. plockas på sidan, vertikalt eller missas helt. Det nuvarande systemet räknar ut uppmätta parametrar så som: längd, bredd och kontrast. Projektet syftar till att undersöka olika maskininlärningsmetoder för att klassificera felaktiga plock som kan uppstå i maskinen. Vidare skall metoderna minska antalet defekta komponenter som monteras samt minska antalet komponenter som felaktigt avvisas. Till förfogande finns en databas innehållande manuellt klassificerade komponenter och tillhörande uppmätta parametrar och bilder. Detta kan användas som träningsdata för de maskininlärningsmetoder som undersöks och testas. Projektet skall även undersöka hur dessa maskininlärningsmetoder lämpar sig allmänt i mekatroniska produkter, med hänsyn till problem så som realtidsbegräsningar. Fyra olika maskininlärningsmetoder har blivit utvärderade och testade. Metoderna har blivit utvärderade för ett {{test set}} där den nuvarande metoden presterar mycket bra.

De nuvarande parametrarna kan användas tillsammans med en SVM eller ett ANN och uppnå resultat som reducerar defekta och monterade komponenter med upp till 64 %. Detta innebär att dessa fel kan reduceras utan att uppgradera de nuvarande bildbehandlingsalgoritmerna. Genom att använda SIFT descriptor tillsammans med ett ANN eller en SVM kan de vanligare felen som uppstår klassificeras med en noggrannhet upp till ca 97 %.

Some of the errors which may occur are; the component is picked sideways, vertically or not picked at all. The current vision system computes parameter such as: length, width and contrast. The project strives to investigate and test machine learning approaches which enable automatic error classification. Additionally the approaches should reduce the number of defect components which are mounted, as well as reducing the number of components which are falsely rejected. At disposal is a large database containing the calculated parameters and images of manually classified components. This can be used as training data for the machine learning approaches. The project also strives to investigate how machine learning approaches can be implemented in mechatronic systems, and how limitations such as real-time constraints could affect the feasibility. Four machine learning approaches have been evaluated and verified against a test set where the current implementation performs very well. The currently calculated parameters have been used as inputs, as well as a new approach which extracts (so called SIFT descriptor) parameters from the raw images. The current parameters can be used with an ANN or a SVM and achieve results which reduce the number of poorly mounted components by up to 64 %. Hence, these defects can be decreased without updating the current vision algorithms. By using SIFT descriptors and an ANN or a SVM the more common classes can be classified with accuracies up to approximately 97 %. This greatly exceeds results achieved when using the currently computed parameters...|$|R
