40|$|Research {{affirms the}} {{assertion}} that mining-induced displacement and resettlement (MIDR) impoverishes livelihoods. Particular of such impoverishments include; landlessness, joblessness, and social disarticulation. This thus threatens the sustainable and human-centered development the world seeks to attain. However, policy documents and researchers such as the World Bank’s Involuntary Resettlement Sourcebook (2004) and Sonnenberg and Münster (2001) propose the preparation of resettlement programmes as an intervention for the mitigation of the adverse effects of resettlement. Despite the introduction of resettlement <b>programmes,</b> <b>relocation</b> and resettlement continues to impoverish the livelihoods of affected population. This paper assesses {{the extent to which}} resettlement programmes have affected livelihoods of people in the Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipality. The paper first identifies some models and theories that underpin the preparation of resettlement programmes. It then proceeds to assess the effect of resettlement programme on livelihoods of affected households. Thirdly, it identifies the effect on societal ties. Fourtly, the paper identifies the challenges of an effective resettlement programme implementation. Lastly, the study makes plausible recommendations and way forward for an effective resettlement programme implementation.

40|$|Resettlement <b>programmes</b> and (forced) <b>relocation</b> {{have over}} the last years become an {{important}} element within Vietnam’s urban upgrading initiatives. These <b>programmes</b> include <b>relocation</b> made necessary by new infrastructure projects as well as the removal of slum-like dwellings with sub-standard living and housing conditions, often along rivers or canals. Resettlement projects can, hence, be understood as simultaneously being manifestations and drivers of urban “modernisation ” and socio-economic transformation on a wider scale. However, the short- and long-term effects, comprising of opportunities as well as constraints, for the affected population are not well understood scientifically and underemphasized in the political arena. Against this background, relocation dynamics and resulting response mechanisms of affected households are explored using, in particular, the example of Can Tho City in the Mekong Delta. Based on empirical fieldwork in 2009 and 2010, the paper argues that the degree of direct financial implications as well as indirect livelihood changes determine whether a household is able to gain a long-term livelihood upgrade from the resettlement or whether it fails and experiences a downward movement in livelihood conditions and vulnerability. The latter can result, for example, in the need {{to move out of the}} designated resettlement cluster and back into other areas with substandard living circumstances. The main factors regulating these development pathways were, in detail, foun...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in helping people in developing countries cope with climate change by reframing population relocation as an adaptation strategy. However, there is also ongoing uncertainly surrounding what {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of resettling poor and vulnerable communities might be.

It draws on a review of planned displacement and resettlement in eight countries, and six months’ experience researching a <b>relocation</b> <b>programme</b> in central Mozambique, to make three arguments: first, there is need to uncover long-standing governmental perceptions of rural populations and the ways in which these affect state-led responses to climate shocks and stresses; second, it is necessary to develop more sophisticated understanding of human choice, volition and self-determination during resettlement as adaptation; and third, greater attention should be paid to how development narratives are generated, transmitted and internalised during climate-induced relocations. Taking into account socioeconomic, political and historical realities in these ways will help to avoid situations in which present-day interventions to assist populations experiencing or threatened by climate displacement simply repeat or reinforce past injustices...|$|R

40|$|The authors use the government-commissioned Lyons review {{proposals}} for {{the relocation of}} approximately 20 000 public sector jobs from London and the South East of England as a springboard for a historical analysis of civil service dispersal in Britain. Though civil service dispersal has helped ameliorate regional disparities, {{this has been a}} secondary objective of <b>relocation</b> <b>programmes.</b> The authors highlight the interconnections between public sector relocation and civil service (re) organisation. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, relocation formed part of a national programme to accommodate the geographical consequences of the hierarchical and spatially centralised public sector by relocating routine functions from the capital. Today, relocation is part of a coordinated programme of public sector reform which seeks to slim down the central headquarters of the civil service—so that only strategic aspects of policy and management are concentrated in London. In the Lyons review regional development is taken more seriously than in previous programmes of relocation; however, the links between the Lyons review and Gershon’s review of public sector efficiency suggests that, in the short term at least, the primary emphasis remains on reducing costs and achieving efficiency savings. ...|$|R

The villages are located in lower-lying areas where land use {{is affected by the}} relocation of people from more isolated highland villages. This relocation is a consequence of district plans to eliminate/reduce shifting cultivation and opium production. The districts have introduced programmes to consolidate or merge villages to provide better infrastructure and government services.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in South Africa {{appears to have}} increased over the past 25 years. This {{is due to a}} change in land use from cattle ranching to wildlife ranching. The largest part of the cheetah population occurs outside conservation areas on privately owned ranch land. The Kruger National Park and the Kgalagadi Transfron-teir Park are the two most important conservation areas for cheetahs due to their large size and pristine habitat. The main threats to cheetahs are focused outside conservation areas and are the illegal trade, unregulated captive breeding and persecution. International trade in cheetahs is regulated by CITES and there is no quota for hunting of cheetahs. However, hunting trophies originating from the wild and captivity have been exported with CITES permits. Several programmes are in place aiming at conserving cheetah. Research is done both inside National Parks and on ranch lands.

However the plan to discontinue statistical activity in London proved controversial amid claims that the shift of functions from London and the closure of the London office would have serious implications for the future of certain sets of statistics. These include health statistics, National Accounts, Retail and Consumer Prices and Labour Market Statistics. These risks were stated to derive from the fact that few of the experienced staff working in these highly technical areas were expected to relocate to Newport, resulting in a substantial loss of expertise and a consequent threat to the continued quality of the statistics. In a submission to the Parliamentary Treasury Sub Committee, the Bank of England expressed concern over the relocation of the ONS to Newport, saying, that [...] "the <b>relocation</b> <b>programme</b> poses serious risks to the maintenance of the quality of macroeconomic data.

First studies of central diffraction and, in particular, diffractive dijet production in special runs in 2012 together with CMS have provided the proof of concept, but demonstrate that even at moderate luminosities a key issue to be overcome in physics with leading protons is the pileup of several events per bunch crossing.

40|$|The Alien Transfer Exit Programme (ATEP) is a US {{deportation}} strategy {{created in}} 2008 whereby migrants are returned to border regions of Mexico distant from their initial place of apprehension. The {{goal of this}} strategy is to geographically separate migrants from their coyotes [paid crossing guide], who are often waiting for them in Mexico, {{in an attempt to}} discourage people from attempting additional border crossings. The official government stance concerning this programme is that it is both effective at deterring migration and that it protects migrants from abusive coyotes who often “force” them to cross the harsh Sonoran desert. The effectiveness of this new policy or its impact on the experiences of migrants has yet to be examined. Using a combination of ethnography and archaeology, I describe ATEP and its impacts on the social process of border crossing with an emphasis on the experiences of migrants who have been deported from California to the Mexican border town of Nogales. I argue that recent formalized deportation strategies such as ATEP build on previous lateral <b>relocation</b> <b>programmes</b> that have long been ineffective at slowing migration. In addition, ATEP contributes to sustaining previous migration control policies of exclusion (based on age, gender, and health) that now produce new dangers for both those included and excluded from this programme. ATEP should be viewed as an enforcement strategy aimed at systematically placing migrants in harm's way by relocating them geographically and by undermining the resources (i. e., human and social capital) that people have come to rely on for successful (and safer) border crossings.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the measures adopted {{under the auspices}} of the European Union (EU) to respond to the phenomenon of unauthorized migrations, in the form of both the establishment of naval operations and the decisions adopted following relevant meetings of the European Council and of the Council of the European Union. The analysis shows that, while in an earlier phase of the process towards the Europeanization of migration policies the naval operations in the Mediterranean sea found their roots in a unilateral operation characterized by a fundamentally humanitarian purposes (the Italian Mare Nostrum operation), they have later evolved in a EU mission (Triton) mostly aimed at controlling the EU’s boundaries at sea, with the recently lunched EuNavfor Med operation representing a stiffening of this defensive approach. The article argues that the focus has shifted towards the protection of the European borders, with a progressively reduced space for the protection of refugees pursuant to humanitarian obligations. Some critical considerations are also proposed with regard to the effectiveness and efficiency of the measures adopted by the Members of the EU to date, which, in the author's view, the European countries approved with difficulty and discordantly, in clear contrast with the principle of solidarity, which is at the foundation of the Treaty of Lisbon. The essay concludes by arguing that this piecemeal and incomplete response to a phenomenon as complex as migration, focussed as it is on curing its symptoms instead of its root causes, cannot represent a valid remedy. The author further suggests that, rather than opting for the use of force at sea or in the territory of the States in distress from where the migration originates, Europe should urgently set itself to lead the process towards peace, liberty and human dignity, including by means of a robust <b>relocation</b> <b>programme</b> as well as immediate support in the countries of emigration...|$|R

The multiplier formulation explicitly takes into account an important feature of Government office dispersal; that is, that {{a large proportion of the}} employees move with the job. The importance of the first round in the multiplier process is stressed, and quantitative estimates of the effects of varying the nature of the initial injection are given. Following the recommendations of the Hardman Report (1973) the Labour Government initiated a programme to disperse 31 000 Government posts to locations outwith London. Two of the larger moves proposed in this <b>programme</b> were the <b>relocation</b> of the Property Services Agency (PSA) to Cleveland and the relocation of part of the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to the County of South Glamorgan. In this paper an augmented regional multiplier model is developed in order to estimate the local impact of these two moves. In section 1 the multiplier model is outlined, in section 2 the estimated impacts of the two moves are presented, and in section 3, we use the model set out in section 1 and the data introduced in section 2 to illustrate and evaluate three key points made by Sinclair and Sutcliffe (1978). These are that because of the particular pattern of withdrawals which occurs in the first round " [...] . the multiplier effect depends on both the way in which regional income is measured, and on the type of injection " (page 179) and " [...] . since the first round of income generation is of greater magnitude than that of any other round, it is particularly important that first round effects should be estimated correctly " (page 177). The more important conclusions of the study are summarised in section 4. 1 Th...|$|R
40|$|Extensive church {{building}} <b>programmes</b> and the <b>relocation</b> of existing churches were important features of Protestant congregational life in industrializing cities across Britain and North America. In Montreal, building booms in the 1860 s, 70 s, and 80 s led many congregations {{to abandon their}} old churches in {{the centre of the}} city and rebuild on a grander scale 'uptown', closer to the residential neighbourhoods to which their wealthier members were moving. In the early twentieth century, when a new phase of growth engulfed the city, many of the same congregations again faced the dilemma of whether or not to move. Whereas the earlier period was characterized by a strong evangelical consensus, the subsequent period was associated with wider-ranging theological and social debates: the context of decision-making had changed. For each period, I explore the impact of building decisions on 'domestic' ministries to church members and on the 'public' ministries that congregations carried out in the environs of their churches and in working-class neighbourhoods. In doing so, I draw on a variety of methodological approaches and on local sources that have not previously been synthesized. A database containing temporal and spatial information for every Protestant church built in Montreal between 1760 and 1914 was also constructed for this project. Case studies of six 'uptown' congregations, and of a downtown neighbourhood that was a popular mission field, are carried out. Investigation of documentary sources such as church minute books and correspondence is complemented by cartographic and sociological analyses of church membership using city directories, tax rolls, censuses, and the recently completed Montreal l'Avenir du Passe historical geo-database. A systematic sampling of local newspapers and denominational records brings to life the many congregational controversies and dilemmas that spilled over into the public sphere during a time of dramatic urban, social, and theological change. A range of external factors, both material and spiritual, affected the choices that were made. I show how investment in religious edifices during the original phase of church moves, as well as the heightened social exclusivity that these moves generated, made it more challenging for the next generation to adapt their religious institutions {{to the needs of the}} twentieth-century city. Congregations simultaneously had to deal with a number of ongoing tensions: the logic of institutional maintenance versus the logic of mission, competition versus cooperation amongst Protestant institutions, and the dynamic between capitalist materialism and Christianity. Unless these tensions were skilfully negotiated by church leaders, they threatened to destroy either the viability or the integrity of religious institutions...|$|R
