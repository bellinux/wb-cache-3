50|$|Predators of the {{northern}} hogsucker typically {{vary depending on the}} environment. During its early years in shallow, fast-moving streams it can fall prey to <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species.</b> Later in life it is typically one of the larger species in the waterways.

50|$|This <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species</b> {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 50 cm SL. These fishes have a {{laterally}} compressed body, with an elongated head and a prominent jaw. The fins are large and rounded. The basic coloration varies from pale pink to deep red to gold. Males are a bit larger than females, with a more accentuated red coloration. Females are usually rounder. The special feature of this species is in the jaws that are extensible to more than 1/4 {{of the length of}} the entire body, which allows to prey fishes of considerable size but also to suck small fishes directly into the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Human {{induced changes}} that might reduce the {{abundance}} of the common logperch include the excess stocking of <b>piscivorous</b> fish <b>species,</b> the damming of rivers, introduction of chemicals into watersheds, and erosion caused from human activities.

30|$|About six <b>piscivorous</b> fish <b>species</b> {{were found}} in our results (Figure  3, ‘PS’). Cheilio inermis (TL 4 to 10  cm) and small Sphyraena {{barracuda}} (TL 4 to 8  cm) fed on fish larvae or decapods. Other species were characterized by larger body sizes (> 15  cm) such as Tylosurus crocodilus, Caranx melampygus, Carangoides spp., and large S. barracuda. They fed mostly on mugilid or atherinid fish. Another piscivore, Negaprion acutidens, fed widely on mugilids, scarids, lethrinids, and lutjanids. The piscivorous fish constituted 3.40 %[*]±[*] 0.85 % of the total fish abundance in the Dongsha Island’s seagrass beds.|$|R

50|$|Cone snails use a radula tooth as a harpoon-like {{structure}} for predation. Each of these harpoons is a modified tooth, primarily made of chitin and formed inside {{the mouth of}} the snail, in a structure known as the toxoglossan radula. (The radula in most gastropods has rows of many small teeth, and is used for grasping at food and scraping it into the mouth.) Each specialized cone snail tooth is stored in the radula sac (an everted pocket in the posterior wall of the buccal cavity), except the tooth that is currently ready to be used. The radular-tooth structures differ slightly according to the feeding mode of vermivorous, molluscivorous and <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
40|$|Diets {{of adults}} of six {{important}} piscivorous fish species, black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, northern pike Esox lucius, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui, walleye Stizostedion vitreum, and yellow perch Perca flavescens were quantified in Spirit Lake, Iowa, USA from May to October in 1995 – 1997. Forty-one prey taxa {{were found in}} the diets of these species, including 19 species of fish. The most important prey taxa overall were yellow perch, amphipods and dipterans. Diets of northern pike and walleye were dominated by yellow perch. Largemouth bass diets included large percentages of both yellow perch and black bullhead Ameiurus melas. Smallmouth bass diets included large percentages of both yellow perch and crayfish. Black crappie and yellow perch diets were dominated by invertebrates, primarily amphipods and dipterans. There were pronounced differences in diets among species, among size classes within species and over time. Most of the dominant prey taxa we documented in the diets of <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species</b> were in accordance with previous studies, but a few deviated significantly from expectations. Many of the temporal diet changes were asynchronous among <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species</b> and size classes, suggesting different responses to common prey resources over time...|$|E
50|$|The predators of S. marina include larger piscivorous fish {{such as the}} Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus). There {{are also}} less common predators that include S. marina in their diet such as the common {{bottlenose}} dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Since they are surface swimmers, S. marina are also preyed upon by some birds. The competitors of S. marina include similar sized <b>piscivorous</b> fish <b>species</b> such as bonefish. Although the maximum salinity of Strongylura marina is 36.9 ppt, {{they are able to}} adapt {{to a wide range of}} salinities, regularly venturing into fresh water.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the natural}} {{whitewater}} habitats of these fish, which makes natural observation difficult, most observations {{of the behavior of}} this fish is largely known from study of fish in aquaria. Natural history and reproduction of this fish are not well known. When inactive, these fish often swim in a vertical posture, probably to help blend into stems of reeds and other aquatic plants; when active, they swim in a normal, horizontal manner. They may use this camouflage either to hide from predators or as part of ambush predation. These fish feed on fish and crustaceans, and as adults are largely <b>piscivorous.</b> Sorubim <b>species</b> have been observed in captivity to excavate a small pit as a nest and even to guard freshly hatched young (unfortunately, none of these young survived).|$|R

40|$|Various {{factors may}} impact the {{processes}} of diversification of a clade. In the marine realm, {{it has been shown}} that coral reef environments have promoted diversification in various fish groups. With the exception of requiem sharks, all the groups showing a higher level of diversity in reefs than in non-reef habitats have diets based predominantly on plankton, algae or benthic invert- ebrates. Here we explore the pattern of diversification of carangoid fishes, a clade that includes numerous <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species</b> (e. g. trevallies, jacks and dolphinfishes), using time-calibrated phylogenies as well as ecological and morphological data from both extant and fossil species. The study of caran- goid morphospace suggests that reef environments played a role in their early radiation during the Eocene. However, contrary to the hypothesis of a reef-association-promoting effect, we show that habitat shifts to non-reef environments have increased the rates of morphological diversification (i. e. size and body shape) in extant carangoids. Piscivory did not have a major impact on the tempo of diversification of this group. Through the ecological radiation of carangoid fishes, we demonstrate that non-reef environments may sustain and promote processes of diversification of different marine fish groups, at least those including a large proportion of <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Studying species flocks (e. g. Darwin¿s finches, Caribbean anoline lizards, East African cichlid fishes) {{has proven}} to be highly {{successful}} in understanding the forces driving speciation. The only known, intact species flock of cyprinid fishes, the 15 Labeobarbus species in Lake Tana (Ethiopia), includes eight <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species.</b> Piscivory is a rare specialisation among the highly successful (> 2000 species) but mostly benthivorous Cyprinidae. The extent and mechanisms of diversification of this remarkable Labeobarbus species flock, particularly among the unexpected <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species,</b> are still largely unknown. In the present study we demonstrate that all 15 Labeobarbus species are segregated to a great extent along spatial, trophic and/or temporal dimensions. The spatial distribution, diet (prey species but not prey size), time of active feeding and predation techniques differed significantly among the eight piscivores. Lake Tana¿s cyprinids displayed their retained potential for ecological diversification and speciation, including the uncommon specialisation of piscivory. The latter is probably a result of the absence of common African specialist piscivores in Lake Tana. We suggest that the evolution of Lake Tana¿s Labeobarbus species flock at this stage is predominantly structured by ecological selection models. The labeobarbs most likely underwent sequential stages of radiation and speciation: habitat divergence followed by trophic divergence...|$|E
40|$|Ventral target {{strength}} (TS) of smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) {{was measured}} using a bottom deployed Simrad EK 60 200 kHz echosounder in the shallow lake Ijsselmeer (The Netherlands). Ventral TS values recorded (TS = 20 log 10 (L) – 74. 39) were lower but comparable to previous studies looking at the dorsal TS in other areas. Biological samples were collected simultaneously close {{to the bottom and}} close to the surface. The combination of acoustic measurements and catch information revealed a diurnal migration of smelt. Smelt was observed to be more dispersed during the night than during daytime, but showing no clear avoidance pattern for any environmental variable recorded by CTD measurements. Smelt was found in the upper water column during times of highest light intensity. Such behaviour is likely to occur due to a combination of turbid water conditions and predator avoidance, mainly of <b>piscivorous</b> fish <b>species</b> such as pike–perch (Stizostedion luciperca) and perch (Perca fluviatilis...|$|R

Unusually for such a small shark, it also feeds on at least 10 species of cartilaginous fishes, including lantern sharks, catsharks (particularly the cloudy catshark, Scyliorhinus torazame, and its eggs), the electric ray Narke japonica, and skates (including their eggs). It also cannibalizes smaller members of its own species.

50|$|Efforts {{have been}} made in Idaho and Washington to assist in {{controlling}} stunted, overpopulated lakes by introducing known <b>piscivorous</b> fish <b>species</b> such as the brown trout, lake trout, and tiger muskellunge. Studies conducted in Idaho primarily focused on the tiger muskellunge and have been successful in low complexity habitats. The presence of these fish has drastically reduced brook trout populations, increasing average length and weight of remaining fish. Similarly, biologists in Washington have adopted the implementation of tiger muskellunge and are still studying the impacts of these fish. Historically, efforts in Washington {{have been made}} that seek similar results. Both brown trout and lake trout were introduced into various lakes within the Washington Cascades and monitoring took place over a 20-year span. While minimal improvements were noted with brown trout introductions, the largest success came from lake trout introductions. While the tiger muskellunge were stocked at a length of nearly 11 inches, the brown and lake trout were stocked as fingerlings and results did not become evident until up to 12 years later.

We also conducted a literature survey that together with our experiments showed that piscivorous top consumers selected cannibal prey over interspecific prey in 9 out of 10 cases. Our literature survey also showed that specialist prey species are competitively superior compared to juvenile <b>piscivorous</b> <b>species</b> within the zooplankton niche. We discuss our results in relation to omnivory in fish communities and we suggest that the observed general preference for cannibal prey over interspecific prey in piscivores and the competitive advantage of prey species over juvenile piscivores may be major mechanisms for coexistence in fish communities...|$|E

40|$|Many marine {{ecosystems}} {{have undergone}} ‘regime shifts’, i. e. abrupt reorgan- izations across trophic levels. Establishing whether these constitute shifts between alternative stable states is of key {{importance for the}} prospects of eco- system recovery and for management. We show how mechanisms underlying alternative stable states caused by predator-prey interactions can be revealed in field data, using analyses guided by theory on size-structured community dynamics. This is done by combining data on individual performance (such as growth and fecundity) with information on population size and prey avail- ability. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their prey in the Baltic Sea as an example to discuss and distinguish two types of mechanisms, ‘cultivation- depensation’ and ‘overcompensation’, that can cause alternative stable states preventing the recovery of overexploited piscivorous fish populations. Impor- tantly, the type of mechanism can be inferred already from changes in the predators’ body growth in different life stages. Our approach can thus be readily applied to monitored stocks of <b>piscivorous</b> fish <b>species,</b> for which this information often can be assembled. Using this tool can help resolve the causes of catastrophic collapses in marine predatory-prey systems and guide fisheries managers on how to successfully restore collapsed piscivorous fish stocks...|$|R
