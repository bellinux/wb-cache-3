5000|$|The Concord Prison Experiment was {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of psilocybin combined with psychotherapy on rehabilitation of released prisoners, after being guided through the psychedelic experience, or [...] "trips," [...] by Leary and his associates. Thirty-six prisoners {{were reported to have}} repented and sworn to give up future criminal activity. The average recidivism rate was 60 percent for American prisoners in general, whereas the recidivism rate for those involved in Leary's project dropped to 20 percent. The experimenters concluded that long-term reduction in overall criminal recidivism rates could be effected with a combination of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy (inside the prison) along with a comprehensive <b>post-release</b> <b>follow-up</b> support program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time in a prison setting a {{randomised}} trial rigorously compared intensive residential therapeutic community treatment to outpatient counselling. Confounding expectations, the US prison for problem drug users which hosted the study gained nothing in terms of preventing recidivism by allocating even high-risk prisoners to the more intensive treatment. In a rare randomised trial, the featured analysis attempted not just to establish the effectiveness of a US prison therapeutic community relative to outpatient treatment, but also what types of inmates may differentially benefit from these modalities. Key points from summary and commentary •	In a US prison for problem drug users nearly all new arrivals joined a study which for {{the first time}} in a prison setting rigorously compared intensive residential therapeutic community treatment to outpatient counselling. •	Over a three-year <b>post-release</b> <b>follow-up</b> period no extra reduction in reimprisonment was found from the intensive option. •	The same finding emerged among prisoners at the highest risk of re-offending, confounding expectations that the more intensive treatment would be particularly suitable for these offender...|$|R
50|$|The {{results of}} this {{experiment}} have been largely contested by a follow-up study, citing several problems including differences in {{the length of time}} after release that the study group versus the control group were compared, and other methodology factors including the difference between subjects re-incarcerated for parole violations versus imprisoned for new crimes. This study concluded that only a statistically slight improvement could be shown (as opposed to the radical improvement originally reported). In his interview within the study, Leary expressed that the major lesson of the Concord Prison experiment was that the key to a long-term reduction in overall recidivism rates might be the combination of the pre-release administration of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy with a comprehensive <b>post-release</b> <b>follow-up</b> program modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous groups to offer support to the released prisoners. The study concluded that whether a new program of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy and post-release programs would significantly reduce recidivism rates is an empirical question that deserves to be addressed {{within the context of a}} new experiment.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Urban {{non-indigenous}} populations report {{life events}} (marriages, employment) as influences for self-initiated cannabis cessation. However, this hasn't been investigated in remote indigenous populations with different social paradigms. Methods: We investigate cannabis use, harms, and poly-substance misuse in 101 consenting male incarcerated indigenous Australians. Interviews applied {{quantitative and qualitative}} questions assessing demographic characteristics, criminal history, drug use, the Marijuana Problems Inventory (MPI), and cannabis-cessation influences. Comparisons used Chi Square, Analysis of Variance, and Nvivo software. Results: Cannabis use groups (current users, ex-users, and never users) were demographically similar except that current users reported more juvenile legal problems, younger school departure, and lower school achievement (p < 0. 05). Mean cannabis consumption was 12. 3 cones/day. Incarceration and family responsibilities were the strongest cessation influences. Employment responsibilities and negative self-image were rarely cited as influences. Discussion: High cannabis use, with its associated problems, is concerning. These identified influences indicate incarceration {{should be used for}} substance reduction programs, plus <b>post-release</b> <b>follow-up.</b> Community-based programs focusing on positive influences, such as family responsibilities and social cohesion, may be successful within indigenous populations with strong kinship responsibilities, rather than programs that focus solely on substance harms...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the Solution-Focused Brief Group Counseling Program (SFBC) for low {{self-concept}} vocational high school students on the immediate and follow-up counseling effects. Sixteen 11 th grade students, whose self-total scores were below 10 percent of experimental calculation on the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale II Chinese Revision. The students participated in this study were randomly assigned by gender to either group. The treatment included six times consults and one <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity,</b> the subjects were interviewed during 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th consults and <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity.</b> The scores of the students on ‘self-concept subscale’, ’supplement subscale’, and self-total score were analyzed among before and after the experimental treatment, and after <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity.</b> The results showed the immediate and follow-up counseling effects. The students had already profoundly influenced by their self-concept. During adolescence the individual is searching for self-identity or looking for a suitable role to fulfill in society (Erikson, 1956 ）. To enter the subjective development phase, approximately ten years from the puberty, Franken (1994) described self-concept as a strong tendency to find motivation that will activate and generate behavior towards an intended target that is ideal or worthwhile. Researchers often found a revealing correlation between explainable and predictable behavior （ Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976 ）. The students with a positive self-concept have stronge...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{significant}} {{advances have}} been made in implementation science, comparatively less {{attention has been paid to}} broader scale-up and spread of effective health programs at the regional, national, or international level. To address this gap in research, practice and policy attention, representatives from key stakeholder groups launched an initiative to identify gaps and stimulate additional interest and activity in scale-up and spread of effective health programs. We describe the background and motivation for this initiative and the content, process, and outcomes of two main phases comprising the core of the initiative: a state-of-the-art conference to develop recommendations for advancing scale-up and spread and a <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity</b> to operationalize and prioritize the recommendations. The conference was held in Washington, D. C. during July 2010 and attended by 100 representatives from research, practice, policy, public health, healthcare, and international health communities; the <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity</b> was conducted remotely the following year. Discussion Conference attendees identified and prioritized five recommendations (and corresponding sub-recommendations) for advancing scale-up and spread in health: increase awareness, facilitate information exchange, develop new methods, apply new approaches for evaluation, and expand capacity. In the <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity,</b> ‘develop new methods’ was rated as most important recommendation; expanding capacity was rated as least important, although differences were relatively minor. Summary Based on the results of these efforts, we discuss priority activities that are needed to advance research, practice and policy to accelerate the scale-up and spread of effective health programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Prevention {{of acute}} drug-related {{mortality}} in prison populations during the immediate post-release periodPrevention of acute drug-related mortality in prison populations during The rate of acute drug-related mortality, or overdose deaths, among prisoners {{in the immediate}} post-release period is unacceptably high. Such incidents result from many factors, including decreased tolerance {{after a period of}} relative abstinence during imprisonment and the concurrent use of multiple drugs which, with every additional illicit drug consumed in combination with opioids, nearly doubles the risk of death from opioids. Other important factors are the lack of pre-release counselling, <b>post-release</b> <b>follow-up</b> and failure to identify those at risk. Substance dependence is a chronic disorder with high relapse rates and often requires long-term continuous treatment. There is good evidence from trials and cohort studies that opioid substitution treatment reduces the risk of overdose among opioid users. This report identifies the main areas that need to be improved in order to decrease the risk of death. Linking prison health and public health systems closely is essential to mitigating this risk. Recommendations for preventive responses are considered across all levels of the justice system. The report includes a literature review that identifies a substantial body of research from various countries; this research supports the finding that the initial post-release period presents ex-prisoners with a significantly heightened risk of acute drug-related mortality...|$|R
