40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>Applications</b> {{have become}} an omnipresent part of our daily lives. They are easy to use, but hard to develop. WYSIWYG editors, form builders, mashup editors, and markup {{authoring}} tools ease the <b>development</b> of <b>Web</b> <b>Applications.</b> However, more advanced <b>Web</b> <b>Applications</b> require servers-side programming, which is beyond the skills of end-user developers. In this paper, we discuss how declarative languages can simplify <b>Web</b> <b>Application</b> <b>development</b> and empower end-users as Web developers. We first identify nine end-user <b>Web</b> <b>Application</b> <b>development</b> levels ranging from simple visual customization to advanced three-tier programming. Then, we propose expanding the presentation tier to support all aspects of <b>Web</b> <b>Application</b> <b>development.</b> We introduce a unified XForms-based framework—called XFormsDB—that supports both client-side and server-side <b>Web</b> <b>Application</b> <b>development.</b> Furthermore, we make a language extension proposal—called XFormsRTC—for adding true real-time communication capabilities to XForms. We also present XFormsDB Integrated Development Environment (XIDE), which assists end-users in authoring highly interactive data-driven <b>Web</b> <b>Applications.</b> XIDE supports all <b>Web</b> <b>Application</b> <b>development</b> levels and, especially, promotes the transition from markup authoring and snippet programming to single and unified language programming.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>development</b> of <b>Web</b> <b>applications</b> is an {{important}} focus of the modern information enabled organization – whether the <b>Web</b> <b>application</b> <b>development</b> is in-house, outsourced, or purchased as ‘commercial-off-the-shelf’ (COTS) software. Traditionally <b>Web</b> <b>application</b> <b>development</b> has been delivered via the dominant waterfall system. The waterfall system relies upon well-defined governance structures, linear phases, gating, and extensive reporting and sign-off documentation. An increasing number of development stakeholders criticise the waterfall system for <b>web</b> <b>application</b> <b>development.</b> The criticisms include a disproportionate focus on governance and process at the direct expense of flexibility and, most importantly, reduced productivity. One consequence of these criticisms is the increasing adoption of <b>Web</b> <b>application</b> <b>development</b> via agile-system methods. This agile-system approach centres upon smaller design teams, fewer development phases, and shorter development time tables...|$|R
