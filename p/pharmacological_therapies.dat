Harris and Rice's Handbook of Psychopathy says that there is currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; as of yet, no <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapies</b> are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional, interpersonal and moral deficits of psychopathy, and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become more adept at the manipulation and deception of others and {{be more likely to}} commit crime. Some studies suggest that punishment and behavior modification techniques are ineffective at modifying the behavior of psychopathic individuals as they are insensitive to punishment or threat. These failures have led to a widely pessimistic view on its treatment prospects, a view that is exacerbated by the little research being done into this disorder compared to the efforts committed to other mental illnesses, which makes it more difficult to gain the understanding of this condition that is necessary to develop effective therapies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a shift manifestations {{pattern of}} ischemic myocardium. Revascularization either with Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) or <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy</b> is an {{optional}} treatment for ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (STEACS) patients. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare the functional capacity using six-minute walking test on STEACS patients who underwent Primary PCI or <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy.</b> Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from September to October 2012 to 35 STEACS patients who were treated after two years. The samples were obtained from the list of patients at Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients diagnosed as STEACS, cooperative and not experiencing cognitive disturbance. The exclusion criteria were STEACS patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarct in the last month, stable exertional angina, and pregnant women. The patients underwent 6 minutes walking test,VO 2 max was measured using theCalahin and Cooper formula, then Metabolic Equation Task (METs) was calculated. Data were analyzed by unpaired T-test. Results: There were 19 Primary PCI and 16 <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy</b> patients. The average of age between the two groups was distributed evenly. Most of the STEACS patients were male, had a college/academic degree and were retired. Patients treated with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy</b> had higher average of VO 2 max and METs than patients with Primary PCI.

40|$|Objective. PainVision {{device was}} a {{developed}} application {{for the evaluation}} of pain intensity. The objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) combined with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy</b> in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). We also discussed the correlation of the measurements. Method. Forty patients with PHN were randomized for treatment with PRF combined with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy</b> (PRF group, n= 20) or <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy</b> (control group, n= 20) at postoperative 48 hours. The efficacy measure was pain degree (PD) that was assessed by PainVision and visual analog scale (VAS), short form Mcgill pain questionnaire (SF-Mcgill), and numeric rate scale sleep interference score (NRSSIS). Correlations between PD, VAS, SF-Mcgill, and NRSSIS were determined. Results. The PD for persistent pain (PP) and breakthrough pain (BTP) at postoperative 48 hours assessed by PainVision were significantly lower in PRF group than in control group (PD-PP, P< 0. 01; PD-BTP, P< 0. 01). PD and VAS were highly correlated for both persistent pain (r= 0. 453, ρ= 0. 008) and breakthrough pain (r= 0. 64, ρ= 0. 001). Conclusion. PRF was well tolerated and superior to isolated <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapy</b> in the treatment of PHN.

50|$|The {{first step}} in {{management}} of uterine atony is uterine massage. The next step is <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapies,</b> {{the first of which}} is oxytocin, used because it initiates rhythmic contractions of the uterus, compressing the spiral arteries which should reduce bleeding. The next step in the pharmacological management is the use of methylergometrine, which is an ergot derivative, much like that use in the abortive treatment of migraines. Its side effect of hypertension means its use should not be used in those with hypertension or pre-eclampsia. In those with hypertension, the use of prostaglandin F2α is indicated (but beware of its use in patients with asthma).Another option Carbetocin and Carboprost where Oxytocin and ergometrin is inappropriate.|$|E
50|$|The mind-body or brain-gut {{interactions}} {{has been}} proposed for IBS, and is gaining increasing research attention. Hypnosis can improve mental well-being, and cognitive behavioural therapy can provide psychological coping strategies for dealing with distressing symptoms, as well as help suppress thoughts and behaviours that increase the symptoms of IBS, although the evidence base for effectiveness of psychotherapy and hypnosis is weak and such therapies are in general not recommended. However, in treatment-resistant cases where <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapies</b> {{over a period of}} at least 12 months have failed to give relief, NICE clinical guidelines recommend that consideration should be given to psychological treatment strategies such as cognitive behavioural therapy CBT, hypnotherapy and/or psychological therapy.|$|E

Narcan nasal spray is intended for distribution to the general public, allowing the friends or family of an overdose victim to counteract the drug's effects almost immediately, without waiting for emergency response personnel to arrive. Many lives are lost due to drug users' hesitance to contact emergency services, a trend which Narcan nasal spray may help combat.|$|E

50|$|Like other opiates, {{hydromorphone}} {{can be used}} recreationally. Its reinforcing {{effects are}} mediated via its strong affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, inducing euphoria, sedation, reduced anxiety, respiratory depression, and other prototypical morphinian effects. Such effects make it particularly susceptible to abuse, although many patients using it for analgesia are {{able to use it}} for extended periods of time without developing drug-seeking behavior. In abusers, there can be a strong psychological dependence, thus creating an addiction with repeated use. Physical dependence causes withdrawal, while psychological dependence can create strong compulsions to use the drug, which can persist for days or weeks after the physical dependence is broken, and has been known to induce anxiety, insomnia, depression, and a range of other persistent mental illnesses. For this reason, psychotherapy is often included in detox programs, sometimes augmented with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>therapies.</b> Hydromorphone is more expensive on the illicit market than heroin, despite producing similar effects, thus causing the abuse rates of hydromorphone to be lower than heroin and similar opioids in many areas.|$|E
