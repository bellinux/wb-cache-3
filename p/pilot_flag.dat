25|$|From 1858 whilst in transit, cutters were {{required}} by law to display white side lights, but often on the outbound leg these were turned off so as to give a traditional westerly advantage over the competition. Once on station— a situation that could last for a few weeks— the boats {{were required}} to display a <b>pilot</b> <b>flag,</b> which in 1849 became the white over red flag still in use today. At night, paraffin (kerosene in U.S. English) flares were required to be fired, with each port having its own sequence; Bristol's was two shorts and a long.|$|E
50|$|Legislation was {{introduced}} to the Texas Legislature in 2007 and 2009 to adopt the 1839 <b>pilot</b> <b>flag</b> of the Republic of Texas as the official flag of the Governor of Texas, but neither bill made it out of committee. Amendments to the Texas Flag Code, signed into law in 1993, authorize the Governor to adopt a flag {{of his or her own}} choosing, but this executive authority has not been exercised.|$|E

50|$|On 29 March 1920 {{the symbols}} were finally approved. The {{author of the}} {{sketches}} was the Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The coat of arms was a red-green bicolour Varangian shield, topped with traditional headdress loggers. The shield {{was a picture of}} a bear in black with a vesuri in their paws. By the bear's feet was a black chain, and above it were white sparks northern lights. The national flag was a black Scandinavian cross with a red border, situated on a green cloth. The colors of the flag symbolize the following: green - a symbol of the country's forest and nature, red - blood shed for the homeland, and the joy and fire, as in the ancient Karelians used slash-and-burn agriculture, black - the native land and sadness. On the state flag it had a red canton with white northern lights. The war flag was made in the same style, but had three plaits and a complementary Bear with a vesuri in the clutches (there is evidence that {{in the center of the}} black cross on it was a red square). There was also a <b>pilot</b> <b>flag</b> (luotsilippu), postal flag (postilippu), a customs flag (tullilippu), and a war pennant, in a similar manner to Finnish Household pennants.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, {{the owner}} of an Oversize Load often must hire a <b>Pilot</b> Car (<b>flag</b> or escort car) before the Load can be moved on a public roadway [...] An Oversize Load may exceed one or all normal vehicle {{dimensions}} of weight, height, length, width and/or extend beyond the commonly-recognized perimeter of the Load vehicle. All Pilot Cars in an individual state must be uniformly identified with required durable, fade-resistant yellow OVERSIZE LOAD sign (on rooftop or the car’s position bumper) and amber flashing or rotating lights that are visible 360° and at least 100 ft away. Those Pilot Cars may legally operate ahead of, behind or in any position relative to the Load that ensures the safe movement of the Load vehicle and all assisting Pilot, Police and Utility vehicles that are necessary for the move.|$|R
50|$|Stratton {{was one of}} {{the three}} stars of the 2004 IMAX film Fighter Pilot: Operation Red Flag. The film {{documents}} Stratton's experience as a F-15 Eagle <b>pilot</b> at Red <b>Flag,</b> a United States Air Force combat training exercise held at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. The film follows Stratton for two weeks at the Red Flag exercise. According to the film's voice-over, many of the training scenarios at Red Flag are more complex and dangerous than actual combat. The film was premiered on 2 December 2004 at the National Air and Space Museum.|$|R
5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien <b>pilot</b> and <b>flags</b> down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|R
