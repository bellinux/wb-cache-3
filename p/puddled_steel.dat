2500|$|Apart {{from some}} {{production}} of <b>puddled</b> <b>steel,</b> English steel {{continued to be}} made by the cementation process, sometimes followed by remelting to produce crucible steel. [...] These were batch-based processes whose raw material was bar iron, particularly Swedish oregrounds iron.|$|E
50|$|Fortunately in the 1840s, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Eugène Charrière, production of the factories near Rives, which had been devoted only to cast iron, changed to <b>puddled</b> <b>steel</b> with which the forges could get the wholesale railway market for steel tyres, first welded, then the seamless tyres developed by engineer A. Pinat. In 1867 steel production was 2,000 tonnes. At that time forges had a staff of 446 workers of which 80 were metal rollers. The customers were then 400 companies almost all French (Thiers, Saint-Etienne etc.) which increased to 1,300 customers in 1906 with a workforce of over 700 workers and a large increase in exports: Austria-Hungary, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. Allevard also partnered with some great groups just before the First World War (Firminy, Aulnoye, Batignolles, Commentary).|$|E
50|$|Before the Bessemer process, Western Europe and the United States {{relied on}} the {{puddling}} process to reduce the carbon content of white cast iron (refined pig iron), converting it to wrought iron. It was possible to make low-quality <b>puddled</b> <b>steel,</b> but the process was difficult to control and quality varied. High-quality steel {{was made by the}} reverse process of adding carbon to carbon-free wrought iron, usually imported from Sweden. The manufacturing process, called the cementation process, consisted of heating bars of wrought iron together with charcoal for periods of up to a week in a long stone box. This produced blister steel. The blister steel was put in a crucible with wrought iron and melted, producing crucible steel. Up to 3 tons of expensive coke was burnt for each ton of steel produced. Such steel when rolled into bars was sold at £50 to £60 (approximately £3,390 to £4,070 in 2008) a long ton. The most difficult and work-intensive part of the process, however, was the production of wrought iron done in finery forges in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|In 1832 he {{inherited}} his father's possessions in Bytom,Upper Silesia and began {{his involvement in}} agriculture, livestock, and heavy industry.

In 1846 {{he inherited}} Henckel von Donnersmarck family possessions in Carinthia; in particular Wolfsberg and Bad Sankt Leonhard in Lavanttal. Here he reorganized the steel industry and moved it from Frantschach-Sankt Gertraud in the Wolfsberg district to Zeltweg in Styria, where he had a <b>puddling</b> and <b>steel</b> rolling mill soon built.|$|R

40|$|Many {{bridges and}} {{railroad}} viaducts, {{which have been}} operated at the western and southern regions of Poland, were erected at the end ofthe 18 th or beginning of the 19 th century. In recent years they undergo overhauls and renovations requiring familiarity with the construction materials they have been made of. It is necessary for estimation of their load capacity (possible reinforcements) and determining their suitability for further utilisation. Among the materials in the old bridges the <b>puddled</b> <b>steels</b> and cast irons predominate. Aim {{of the work is}} identification and documentation of microstructure and selected properties of the cast irons used for production of parts for the bridge in Łażany, the Old Mieszczański Bridge in Wrocław, the hanging bridge in Ozimek, as well as the columnar piers of the railroad viaduct in Wrocław. Using the methods of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, as well as the results of hardness measurements and chemical analysis, {{it has been shown that}} the objects have been built of grey cast iron with flake graphite having the ferritic-pearlitic or pearlitic matrix. The diversification of their chemical analysis resulting from the type, size and geometry of the cast parts was indicated. The tested materials fulfil requirements of the contemporary standards related to grey cast irons of the EN-GJL- 100 and EN-GJL- 150 grades...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{subject of}} the authors’ {{research}} were the fragments of steel structures (of the <b>puddled</b> <b>steel)</b> coming {{from the turn of}} the 19 th and 20 th centuries. The material gained for the research comes from monumental (and still operated) Wroclaw bridges and the hall of the Main Wroclaw Railway Station. The works were focused on the phenomenon of microstructural degradation of those steels and its potential influence on their strength properties. Analysis of the achieved results indicated that those long operated steels are a subject for microstructure degradation processes consisting mainly in: precipitation of carbides and nitrides inside ferrite grains, precipitation of carbides at ferrite grain boundaries and degeneration of pearlite areas. The microstructure degradation processes negatively influence fatigue properties. The results of low cycle fatigue test for the <b>puddled</b> <b>steel</b> (from the Main Railway Station) in the after-operation state indicate for worse plastic properties of that steel in comparison to the normalised state. The results of fatigue crack growth test indicate for worsening of fatigue crack propagation resistance of the material depending on the degree of degradation processes intensity in the puddled steels. A new kinetic equation has been proposed for description of the fatigue of crack growth rate due to the Dimensional Analysis approach. From the utility point of view, the achieved results acquire fundamental importance because of the fact of continuous operation of a high number of the bridges aged more than 50 years (about 68 % for Europe). It is worth noticing that almost 28 % of them are objects aged over 100 years...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} authors’ {{investigations}} was {{determination of}} the fatigue crack growth in fragments of steel structures (of the <b>puddled</b> <b>steel)</b> and its cyclic behavior. Tested steel elements coming {{from the turn of}} the 19 th and 20 th were gained from still operating ancient steel construction (a main hall of Railway Station, bridges etc.). This work is a part of investigations devoted to the phenomenon of microstructural degradation and its potential influence on their strength properties. The analysis of the obtained results indicated that those long operating steels subject to microstructure degradation processes consisting mainly in precipitation of carbides and nitrides inside ferrite grains, precipitation of carbides at ferrite grain boundaries and degeneration of pearlite areas [1, 2]. It is worth noticing that resistance of the <b>puddled</b> <b>steel</b> to fatigue crack propagation in the normalized state was higher. The authors proposed the new kinetic equation of fatigue crack growth rate in such a steel. Thus the relationship between the kinetics of degradation processes and the fatigue crack growth rate also have been shown. It is also confirmed by the materials research of the viaduct from 1885, which has not shown any significant changes in microstructure. The non-classical kinetic fatigue fracture diagrams (KFFD) based on deformation () or energy (W) approach was also considered. In conjunction with the results of low- and high-cycle fatigue and gradual loss of ductility as a consequence (due to the microstructural degradation processes) - {{it seems to be a}} promising construction of the new kinetics fatigue fracture diagrams with the energy approach...|$|E

5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of <b>puddle</b> welding on <b>steel</b> construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, pig iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid pig iron to create <b>steel.</b> <b>Puddling</b> was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. Mangalloy, an alloy of steel and manganese exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, {{was one of the first}} alloy steels, and was created by Robert Hadfield in 1882.|$|R
40|$|Background: Measurements of {{exposure}} to vibrations from hand-held tools are often con-ducted on a single occasion. However, repeated measurements may be crucial for estimating the actual dose with good precision. In addition, knowledge of determinants {{of exposure}} {{could be used to}} improve working conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess hand–arm vibra-tion (HAV) exposure during different grinding operations, in order to obtain estimates of the variance components and to evaluate the effect of work postures. Methods: Ten experienced operators used two compressed air-driven angle grinders of the same make in a simulated work task at a workplace. One part of the study consisted of using a grinder while assuming two different working postures: at a standard work bench (low) and on a wall with arms elevated and the work area adjusted to each operator’s height (high). The workers repeated the task three times.

Both grinding tasks were conducted on weld <b>puddles</b> of mild <b>steel</b> on a piece of mild steel. Measurements were taken according to ISO-standard 5349 [the equivalent hand–arm-weighted acceleration (m s− 2) averaged over 1 min]. Mixed- and random-effects models were used to investigate the influence of the fixed variables and to estimate variance components. Results: The equivalent hand–arm-weighted acceleration assessed when the task was performed on the bench and at the wall was 3. 2 and 3. 3 m s− 2, respectively. In the mixed-effects model, work posture was not a significant variable. The variables ‘operator’ and ‘grinder’ together explained only 12 % of the exposure variability and ‘grinding wheel’ explained 47 %; the residual variability of 41 % remained unexplained. When the effect of grinding wheel wear was investigated in the random-effects model, 37 % of the variability was associated with the wheel while minimal variability was associated with the operator or the grinder and 37 % was unexplained. The interaction effect of grinder and operator explained 18 % of the variability. In the wheel wear test, the equivalent hand–arm-weighted accelerations for Grinder 1 during the first and second grinding minutes were 3. 4 and 2. 9 m s− 2, respectively, and for Grinder 2, they were 3. 1 and 2. 9 m s− 2, respectively. For Grinder 1, the equivalent hand–arm-weighted acceleration during the first grinding minute was significantly higher (P = 0. 04) than during the second minute. Conclusions: Work posture during grinding operations does not appear to affect the level of HAV. Grinding wheels explained much of the variability in this study, but almost 40 % of the variance remained unexplained. The considerable variability in the equivalent hand–arm-weighted acceleration has an impact on the risk assessment at both the group and the individual level...|$|R
