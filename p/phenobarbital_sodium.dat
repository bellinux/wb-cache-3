We aimed to find the effect of <b>Phenobarbital</b> and <b>Sodium</b> Valproate monotherapy on serum lipid profile and liver function tests in epileptic children. Materials & MethodsThis cohort study was conducted in Amirkola Children Hospital. One hundred and ten children with epilepsy were included in this study. Children with hepatic or renal disease, those receiving medications which could alter liver function tests or serum lipid profile were excluded from the study. Patients were allocated into two groups. The first group, including 63 patients, received Phenobarbital and the second group, including 47 patients, received Sodium Valproate, both in divided doses. A venous blood sample was collected after overnight fasting to evaluate serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and liver function tests. Data was analyzed with SPSS version 17. ResultsIn children receiving Phenobarbital, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, ALP, SGOT and SGPT increased significantly after treatment, but TG level showed no significant changes.

At {{the end of}} the period of soaking the mean resting potential of the muscle fibers was only 29 my. The decrease in the resting potential of the HETP-treated muscles was accompanied by a loss of potassium and a gain in sodium by the muscles. The effect of anticholinesterases on sodium extrusion was studied by incubating the muscles in a Ringer's containing haft of the normal amount of sodium. The muscles respond by extruding sodium against a concentration gradient into the external medium. Sodium extrusion was blocked by prior exposure of the muscle to HETP, and reversibly blocked by exposure to physostigmine. The inhibition of sodium extrusion by physostigmine was correlated with the inhibition of the intracellular cholinesterase. Sodium extrusion was also blocked by high concentrations of 2 -methyl-l, 4 napthaquinone 8 -sulfonic acid and by a-ketoglutarate, which are known to inhibit choline acetylase in ~tro.

Materials and Methods: The experiments were carried out on 24 male rabbits. They were divided into 4 groups (6 each); rabbits in group 1 were treated with INH following a standard protocol to induce hepatotoxicity. Rabbits in group 2 received starch. Group 3 received NS 1 g/kg/day before INH treatment. Group 4 rabbits were treated with NS only. <b>Phenobarbital</b> <b>sodium</b> (IP) was given to induce metabolism of INH.

40|$|Not long ago, while {{studying}} the “immediate ” antidiuretic action of pituitary extract (posterior-lobe), difficulty was en-countered {{because of the}} marked depressor effects often produced by the extract when sodium <b>phenobarbital</b> (<b>sodium</b> luminal) {{was used as the}} anesthetic (1). When comparison was made between the actions of pituitary extract during ether, chioretone and sodium phenobarbital anesthesia it was found that, {{in the case of the}} last, the circulatory depression was greatest (2). From other studies of our own (3) as well as those of others (see (3) for references and, more recently (4)), it was fairly obvi-ous that the depressor effect in these cases was due to a cardiac action-presumably to coronary constriction. We therefore took the first opportunity to examine the influence of sodium phenobarbital upon the action of pituitary extract in the heart-lung preparation of Starling. Gruber and Roberts (5) several years ago showed that sodium phenobarbital increases the coronary flow in excised hearts of cats and rabbits. We have confirmed this in the heart-lung preparation, using a Mdrawitz cannula to measure the coronary flow. A priori, therefore, one would be led to surmise that the cardiac action of pituitary extract would be less marked in the presence of luminal than in its absence, but the results below will make it clear that this is not the case.

The differences among the groups for renal and non-renal clearance were not statistically significant. The mean apparent volume of distribution of teicoplanin at steady state was significantly lower in the Pb-pre-treated rats as compared to controls (P < 0043).

Seizures persisted despite treatment with <b>phenobarbital</b> <b>sodium</b> (PB), phenytoin (PHT) and valproate sodium (VPA). At the age of 9, complex partial seizures (CPS) developed in this boy.

Case 2, also a boy, was born with complicating intraventricular hemorrhage in the neonatal period. An epileptiform EEG abnormality was noticed at age 2, when VPA administration was started. Despite this, an episode of CPS occurred at the age of 4, which prompted us to switch the treatment from VPA to CBZ. His later course was uneventful until the age of 8, when hematological problems became evident, and a diagnosis of ALL was made. Case 3, a boy, was initially treated with CBZ because of autism and EEG abnormality at 12 years of age. In addition to CBZ, haloperidol and promethazine hydrochloride were given at the age of 13 years. ALL developed at the age of 14 years 2 months.

A chromatographically homogeneous fraction has been obtained from the crude extract by dialysis and gel filtration on Sephadex G- 50. Attempts were made to purify the active fraction further by ion exchange column chromatography, but the specific activity of the active fraction was not increased. The active substance {{was found to be}} water soluble, heat and acid labile and stable to alkali. It showed a positive color reaction with ninhydrin on paper (circular) chromatography, using n-butanol: acetic acid:water (4 : 1 : 5) system. Steroids, steroidal glycosides, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates were found to be absent in the active fraction, when tested with specific reagents. The active fraction has a characteristic u. v. maximum at 277. 5 nm. Determination of protein by Lowry's method and estimation of nitrogen by Kjeldahl's method indicated the active fraction was rich in protein. An acid and alkaline hydrolysis of the active fraction was carried out and hydrolysates were analyzed both by two dimensional chromatography and Technicon auto aminoacid analyzer. The following amino acids were identified by comparing with standard aminoacids: cysteine, aspartic acid (asparagine), threonine, serine, glutamic acid (glutamine), proline, glycine, alanine, valine, cystine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, histidine and arginine. From these results it was concluded that the active fraction was a polypeptide containing seventeen different aminoacids. Based on behavior on Sephadex G- 50, the approximate molecular weight of the active fraction was estimated to be in the range of 2, 500 - 3, 000. Signs of {{central nervous system}} stimulatory activity produced by the active fraction in male mice included fighting episodes, increased motor activity and clonic convulsions. The ED 50 of the active fraction based on fighting episodes was 6. 4 mg/kg. The fighting episodes occurred at a frequency of 2 - 3 times/minute. After the administration of the active fraction intraperitoneally, the fighting episodes started within 4 - 6 minutes, peaked at 15 minutes and waned within about 30 minutes. The LD 50 dose of the active fraction was 12. 2 mg/kg. Toxic symptoms such as ataxia, catalepsy and tonic convulsions were observed before death. <b>Phenobarbital</b> <b>sodium,</b> chlorpromazine and methocarbamol completely blocked the fighting response of the active fraction even at the ED 100 dose level but did not change the LD 50. The antagonism of the active fraction induced stimulant activity (as measured by fighting episodes) by these drugs suggests that this activity was probably mediated centrally. Reserpine and tetrabenazine pretreatment markedly increased the stimulant effect of the active fraction by decreasing the ED 50 of the active fraction by 50 %. Such treatment increased toxicity twofold. a-methyl p-tyrosine methylester Hel (α-MPT) pretreatment did not alter the ED 50, while the LD 50 was significantly decreased. When α-MPT treatment was incorporated in reserpine or tetrabenazine treated animals, the stimulatory activity of the active fraction was completely blocked even at the ED 100 (9. 3 mg/kg) dose level. The active fraction produced a significant decrease in brain norepinephrine content at the ED 50 and the ED 100 doses during the stimulation period. Both the active fraction and reserpine produced a hyperthermic response in mice. DL-dopa treatment restored the active fraction induced stimulant action (fighting episodes) which was abolished after combined treatment with a-MPT and reserpine and reserpine and disulfiram. DL-dopa also increased the LD 50 of the active fraction. The active fraction at the ED 50 dose significantly decreased brain dopamine content. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine did not alter the ED 50 and the LD 50 of the active fraction. No change in brain serotonin content was observed after administration of the active fraction at the ED 50 dose. The active fraction at the ED 50 dose significantly inhibited the re-uptake mechanism of norepinephrine during the stimulation period. It also elevated normetanephrine levels at the ED 50 dose. Propranolol but not phentolamine treatment completely blocked the stimulatory action of the active fraction, with no change in the LD 50. Atropine treatment decreased the toxicity, with no change in the ED 50. On the other hand physostigmine blocked the stimulatory action and increased toxicity by twofold. In conclusion, the results suggest that the active fraction causes stimulant action by releasing active norepinephrine from functional pools and inhibiting its re-uptake, thus making more norepinephrine available at adrenergic receptors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOrgan {{specificities}} of cytochrome P- 450 s 21 (steroid 21 -hydroxylase) were investigated. The {{substrate specificity}} {{of the liver}} cytochrome P- 450 s 21 {{was found to be}} different from that of adrenocortical cytochrome P- 450 s 21. The steroid 21 -hydroxylase activity of liver microsomes decreased with treatment by <b>sodium</b> <b>phenobarbital</b> or β-naphthoflavone and was inhibited by anti-cytochrome b 5 immunoglobulin, although that of adrenocortical microsomes was not. The liver cytochrome P- 450 s 21 was immunochemically similar to adrenocortial cytochrome P- 450 s 21. The bovine liver and adrenocortical cytochromes P- 450 s 21 showed immunoprecipitin lines against antibody to bovine adrenocortical cytochrome P- 450 s 21. The molecular masses of the bovine liver and adrenocortical cytochromes P- 450 s 21 were 60 ± 1 and 50 ± 1 kDa, respectively. The content of cytochrome P- 450 s 21 and its percentage for the total microsomal cytochrome P- 450 were immunochemically determined using the antibody to the bovine adrenocortical cytochrome P- 450 s 21...|$|R
40|$|During the {{purification}} of pig kidney aldehyde reductase by {{an established}} procedure [Flynn, Cromlish & Davidson (1982) Methods Enzymol. 89, 501 - 506] a second enzyme with aldehyde reductase activity may be purified. When {{the procedure was}} performed {{in the presence of}} 5 mM-EDTA, only traces of the second reductase, pig kidney aldehyde reductase (minor form), were present. By the criterion of sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, pig kidney aldehyde reductase (minor form) had Mr 35 000, in comparison with Mr 40 200 found for pig kidney aldehyde reductase. Amino acid analysis of both enzymes and tryptic-peptide-map comparisons indicated differences in primary structure. The N-terminus of pig kidney aldehyde reductase (minor form) had the sequence Lys-Val-Leu, in contrast with the blocked (acetylated) N-terminus of pig kidney aldehyde reductase. The C-terminal sequence of both enzymes was the same. Both reductases were immunologically identical by double immunodiffusion and rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Pig kidney aldehyde reductase (minor form) had 50 % of the specific activity of pig kidney aldehyde reductase when tested with a variety of aldehyde substrates. Michaelis constants of both enzymes for these substrates and for NADPH were similar, but values for kcat. and kcat. /Km indicated that catalytically pig kidney aldehyde reductase was the more efficient enzyme. Typical aldehyde reductase inhibitors, such as <b>phenobarbital</b> and <b>sodium</b> valproate, had the same effect on both enzymes. It was concluded that pig kidney aldehyde reductase (minor form) is an enzymically active cleavage product of pig kidney aldehyde reductase which is formed when the latter is purified {{in the absence of the}} metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the influence of phenobarbital on the metabolism of m-, p-xylene, female Wistar rats were pretreated with intraperitoneal injection of <b>sodium</b> <b>phenobarbital</b> (75 mg per kg body weight) for 3 days (PB group). On the 4 th day, 4. 667 mmole per kg of m-xylene or p-xylene was injected intraperitoneally and urine samples were collected at 4 hour intervals thereafter. The urinary content of m-methylhippuric acid and p-methylhippuric acid was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Urinary excretion of m-methylhippuric acid or p-methylhippuric acid in the PB group {{was significantly higher than}} in the control group (pretreated with 2 ml per kg of normal saline instead of phenobarbital) at the 0 - 4 hour and 4 - 8 hour intervals (p< 0. 01). This suggests that oxidation of methyl groups of m- and p-xylenes can be performed by the microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme in liver. There {{was no significant difference between}} the PB and control groups in the amount of m-methylhippuric acid and p-methylhippuric acid excreted during the first 48 hours after administration...|$|R
40|$|The mean {{half-life}} of antipyrine in {{the plasma}} of {{four sets of}} identical and four sets of fraternal twins after a single oral dose of 16 mg/kg of antipyrine was 12. 7 ±SD 3. 3 hr. After 2 wk on <b>sodium</b> <b>phenobarbital</b> (2 mg/kg daily) the half-life of antipyrine in the plasma of these twins was reduced to 8. 0 ±SD 1. 5 hr. Shortening of the plasma antipyrine half-life occurred {{in all but one}} of these 16 normal, adult volunteers, but there was considerable variation in the extent of reduction which ranged from 0 to 69 %. Phenobarbital administration decreased individual variations in antipyrine metabolism as indicated by the smaller standard deviation of the plasma antipyrine half-lives after phenobarbital than observed initially and by the narrowed range of variation in plasma antipyrine half-lives from 2. 8 -fold initially to 1. 8 -fold after phenobarbital. These results suggest that some inducing agents may be used to minimize individual variations in drug metabolism where such variations create therapeutic problems by exposing patients who slowly metabolize certain drugs to toxicity and other patients who rapidly metabolize some drugs to undertreatment...|$|R
