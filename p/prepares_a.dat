As {{for the effort}} involved in the materials development, {{in addition to the}} ALS findings already mentioned (ALS, 1998), Rumble (2001, p. 79) reviews a study by Sparkes (1984, p. 219) who states that an academic needs between 2 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> conference, 1 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> small group session, 3 to 10  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> video recording, 50 to 100  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> text, around 100  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> live TV session, 200  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>a</b> tutorial and about 300  h to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> interactive software, not counting the time of the technical staff supporting the process. Many faculty would agree that these figures are not far from current ones, being the expertise of the academic and the possibility of repurposing available resources what makes the difference. Rumble points out that one way of keeping production costs within an acceptable range is by using an author-editor model with advisors supporting the author, rather than having permanent staff in charge of producing materials. He also states (p. 80) that because the quality of materials is critical, to achieve cost-efficiency, it is better to seek savings in recurrent costs such as course promotion.|$|R

The defender may use proportionate accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E

The guest cook (usually a celebrity) <b>prepares</b> <b>a</b> dish of their own choosing and places it in competition against a similar dish submitted by Ramsay. The dishes are judged by diners who are unaware of who cooked which dish and, if the guest wins (as they have on numerous occasions), their dish is served at Ramsay's restaurant.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in BB84 is quantum transmission. Alice creates a random bit (0 or 1) and then {{randomly}} selects one of her two bases (rectilinear or diagonal in this case) to transmit it in. She then <b>prepares</b> <b>a</b> photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, {{as shown in the}} adjacent table. So for example a 0 is encoded in the rectilinear basis (+) as a vertical polarization state, and a 1 is encoded in the diagonal basis (x) as a 135° state. Alice then transmits a single photon in the state specified to Bob, using the quantum channel. This process is then repeated from the random bit stage, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.|$|E
