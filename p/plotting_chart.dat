50|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1940s, the term Cape Verde {{hurricane}} referred to August and early September storms that formed {{to the east of}} the surface <b>plotting</b> <b>charts</b> in use at the time. Cape Verde hurricanes typically develop from tropical waves which form in the African savanna during the wet season, then move into the African steppes. The disturbances move off the western coast of Africa and become tropical storms or tropical cyclones soon after moving off the coast, within 10 to 15 degrees longitude, or 10760 km to 16140 km, of the Cape Verde Islands; this comprises the tropical latitudes east of the 40th meridian west. In the years since the phrase's coining, increasing detection has allowed meteorologists to determine that Cape Verde hurricanes have formed as early as 0600 UTC on July 3 (Hurricane Bertha of 2008) or as late as 1800 UTC on September 26 (Hurricane Noel of 1995).|$|R

30|$|Based {{on these}} requirements, we {{created the first}} version of the IESMR, which was {{composed}} of one checklist used to evaluate a measure and its data. This version was used to evaluate measurement repositories of two organizations in order to verify if the identified requirements were correct. For this, we asked if a measure that fulfilled the requirements of IESMR could really be used in SPC and if a measure that did not fulfill the requirements was really unsuitable for SPC. To answer these questions, we <b>plotted</b> in control <b>charts</b> the data collected for the measures evaluated. As a result, we observed that the measures considered suitable for SPC according to IESMR could be correctly <b>plotted</b> in control <b>charts</b> and they provided useful information about the processes performance. By contrast, the measures considered unsuitable by IESMR could not be <b>plotted</b> in control <b>charts</b> or, when they could, they did not describe the process performance.|$|R

The analysis is based on proper indicators that are the evolution of total income and expenses with the household as aggregate factor, the coverage of expenses through the incomes. Also, the total indicators were explained. The main categories of households taken into consideration were employees, unemployed, farming households and retirees. The statistical analysis covers the interval 2010 - 2014. In order substantiate the results of the research, an econometric model is presented, based on the datasets for gross available incomes and private consumption. The authors first analyse the statistical characteristics of the two variables, then observe the potential correlation through a dot <b>plot</b> <b>chart.</b> After ascertaining the opportunity to estimate a regression model, the parameters of the corresponding equation are deducted {{with the help of a}} dedicated software system.
