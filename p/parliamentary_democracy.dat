5|$|In the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> of India, the {{ultimate}} responsibility for running the administration {{rests with the}} elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and {{it is for the}} civil servants to carry out this policy.|$|E
5000|$|Fusion {{of powers}} is {{a feature of}} some <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies,</b> {{especially}} those following the Westminster system, where the executive and legislative branches of government are intermingled. It is often contrasted with the more strict separation of powers found in most Semi-presidential and presidential democracies. Fusion of powers exists in many, if not a majority, of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies,</b> and does so by design.|$|R
40|$|The {{role played}} by {{legislative}} committees in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies</b> is a rather underestimated topic. After all, legislative standing committees exist in almost all <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies.</b> Still, they {{can have an impact}} on our understanding of how a democracy works. Luigi Curini explains what exactly it encompasses, and argues that the similarity of committee members’ preferences represents {{the most important factor in}} deciding the effectiveness of committee work...|$|R

5|$|The Republic of Ireland is a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> {{based on}} the British model, with a written {{constitution}} and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the President on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the Dáil. Members of the government are chosen from both the Dáil and the upper house of parliament, the Seanad. Its capital is Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The {{divide between}} the Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) has caused the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> to become ethnically polarized. Though {{an equal number of}} seats in the Chamber of Representatives are {{prescribed}} to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} other broad-minded Finns, the new {{partnership}} constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered stable and broad <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy.</b> The compromise was based both on {{the defeat of the}} Reds in the 1918 war and {{the fact that most of}} the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After the foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Red and White lost their backup, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity, and the legacy of Fennomania, stood out among the Finns.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> {{in which}} the most {{powerful}} executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of direct democracy. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. Normally, the prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E
5|$|Canada is {{a federal}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> and a {{constitutional}} monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It {{is one of the}} world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has {{had a significant impact on}} its economy and culture.|$|E
40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{indicates that}} the representation of women in legislatures is positively associated {{with the passage of}} female-friendly social policy. However, there is little corresponding research concerning the effect of women in cabinet on female-friendly social policy. Yet, almost all advanced industrial <b>democracies</b> are <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies,</b> where policies typically originate within the cabinet and governments typically enjoy substantial control over the legislative process. Thus, to the extent that women promote female-friendly policy, women in cabinet positions should be ideally placed to do so, and indeed, possibly be more influential than women in legislatures. We find significant support for this argument in analyses of state guaranteed leave entitlement, in eighteen <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies</b> from 1980 - 2003.

40|$|Is global {{competition}} for mobile capital harmful (less public goods) or beneficial (less government waste) ? This paper combines both aspects within a generalized {{version of the}} comparative public finance model (Persson, Roland and Tabellini, 2000) by introducing multiple countries and endogenous tax bases. We consider the role of political institutions and compare <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies</b> (Europe) and presidential-congressional systems (USA) to show that increasing tax competition is likely to improve voter welfare, even if public good supply decreases because rents to politicians also fall. The conditions for voter welfare to improve are less stringent under the presidential-congressional system than under <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies.</b> Increasing tax competition lowers voter welfare if the only benefit to politicians is to divert resources from the government budget and the future is valued highly. ...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we address}} recent claims that {{executive}} legislative relations in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies</b> are undergoing important changes owing {{to either a}} 'presidentialization' or a 'Europeanization' of domestic political systems. Therefore, we test empirically whether <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies</b> are indeed experiencing changes in executive-legislative relations and whether these developments can, in part, be explained {{by an increase in}} European integration. Using data on ministerial selection in Swedish cabinets during the years 1952 - 2006, we find that {{there appears to be a}} slight tendency towards 'presidentialization', which is indicated by a decrease in ministers with a parliamentary background being appointed, and that there exists some support for the notion that Sweden's political and economic integration into the European Union is part of the explanation for this change...|$|R
5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy,</b> although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E
5|$|The post-independence period {{witnessed}} {{rapid growth}} as Dhaka attracted migrant workers from across rural Bangladesh. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujib {{was assassinated in}} an internal coup d'état. There were further chaos and uprisings in November 1975. An actual military coup was undertaken on 24thMarch 1982 by the sitting Army chief of staff. In the 1980s, Bangladesh pioneered {{the formation of the}} South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and hosted its first summit in Dhaka. A mass uprising in 1990 led to the removal of then Indian backed government and the return of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy.</b> In the 1990s and 2000s, Dhaka experienced improved economic growth and the emergence of affluent business districts and satellite towns.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 9November, about 150 councillors {{gathered}} for a two-day meeting in Stuttgart. A majority of the councillors entrusted {{the leaders of the}} SPD and USPD political parties, who had been invited to the meeting, with the establishment of a provisional government in Württemberg. The Spartacist Albert Schreiner, then chairman of a soldier council, initially assumed the key position of Minister of War in this quickly established first government, which for the time being shared power with the councils. However, he resigned already a few days later, after disputes about the future course of the government. While the Spartacists considered as their ideal aim the kinds of results achieved by the previous year's October Revolution in Russia, the position of the other USPD politicians was unclear and the SPD leaders supported a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> and early elections in Württemberg.|$|E

50|$|The French Fifth Republic, {{provides}} an example of the fusion of powers from a country which does not follow the Westminster system.

5|$|Belgium gained its {{independence}} from the United Netherlands in 1830 and was established as a popular and constitutional monarchy under a bicameral <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy.</b> A liberal Constitution was written in 1831 which codified the responsibilities and restrictions imposed on the monarch. Although the King, as head of state, was prevented from acting without the approval of a government minister, he was allowed full control of military matters {{in his capacity as}} Commander-in-Chief. Which responsibility would take precedence if they became incompatible was left ambiguous and this uncertainty would {{lie at the heart of}} the Royal Question. The first king, Leopold I, accepted the terms of the Constitution but attempted to use its ambiguities to subtly increase his own powers. This was continued by his successors, although with little real success.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the early}} regency, both the Pierlot and {{subsequent}} Achille Van Acker governments attempted to avoid confronting {{the issue of}} Leopold's return despite calls from Communists, some Socialists and trade unionists for the King's abdication in April and May 1945. Soon after the King's liberation, Van Acker and a government delegation headed to Strobl, Austria to negotiate with Leopold. At {{a series of meetings}} between 9 and 11 May 1945, Van Acker insisted that the King publicly announce his support for the Allied cause and his commitment to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy.</b> No agreement was reached. In the meantime, Leopold took up residence in Pregny (near Geneva) in Switzerland under the pretext that heart palpitations made further negotiations or thoughts of return to political life impossible.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{opposition}} to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy,</b> Zbor participated in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. It offered 8,100 candidates throughout Yugoslavia. On 5 May the Yugoslav government first announced {{the results of the}} elections, which showed that 72.6 percent of the eligible electorate had cast a total of 2,778,172 ballots. The party of Bogoljub Jevtić had received 1,738,390 (62.6%) votes and 320 seats in parliament and the Opposition Bloc led by Vladko Maček had received 983,248 (35.4%) votes and 48 seats. Zbor finished last in the polls, with 23,814 (0.8%) votes, and had acquired no seats in parliament. Of all the votes it had received, 13,635 came from the Danube Banovina, in which Ljotić's home district of Smederevo was located. The election results initially published by authorities caused an upheaval amongst the public, forcing the government to publish the results of a recount on 22 May. The recount showed that 100,000 additional ballots that had not been recorded on 5 May had been cast and that Jevtić's party had received 1,746,982 (60.6%) votes and 303 seats, the Opposition Bloc had received 1,076,345 (37.4%) and 67 seats, and that Zbor had received 24,008 (0.8%) votes and again no seats.|$|E
50|$|The {{strategies}} were continued until the Revolutions of 1989. People in the Eastern European satellite states revolted against their dictatorships, and became <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies.</b> Russian people ended their communist system in 1991. Without support from Moscow, many subsidized communist {{movements in the}} Asia, Africa, and Latin America virtually collapsed.|$|R
40|$|Ministerial {{portfolios}} are {{the most}} obvious payoffs for parties entering a governing coalition in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies.</b> This renders the bargaining over portfolios an important phase of the government formation process. The question of ‘who gets what, and why?’ in terms of ministerial remits has not yet received much attention by coalition or party scholars. This article focuses on this qualitative aspect of portfolio allocation and uses a new comparative dataset to evaluate a number of hypotheses that {{can be drawn from}} the literature. The main hypothesis is that parties which, in their election manifestos, emphasise themes corresponding to the policy remit of specific cabinet portfolios are more likely to obtain control over these portfolios. The results show that policy saliency is indeed an important predictor of portfolio allocation in postwar Western European <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{making a}} rapid recovery, the Belgian Workers' Party was still penalized by the Belgian electoral system, which based {{suffrage}} on wealth, stopping {{most of the}} party's support base among industrial workers from voting. In August 1885, the party began its Antwerp Programme, which called for universal suffrage while confirming the party's intention to pursue its goals through <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> rather than revolution. The culmination of this policy was the 1893 Belgian General Strike, involving some 250,000 workers. Fearing a revolution, the government adopted universal male suffrage in 1894, but only with plural voting, which allowed up to two additional votes for wealthy or educated citizens. Nevertheless, {{the percentage of the}} population eligible to vote rose from 3.9 to 37.3 percent, and in the 1894 elections the socialists won 28 of 152 seats. The Belgian Workers' Party called two further unsuccessful general strikes in 1902 and 1913 in an attempt to end the plural voting system.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy</b> was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>democracy.</b> The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E
