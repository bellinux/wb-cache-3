In the performed calculations four fixed energies of neutrons with the corresponding wavelengths of 1, 1. 8, 3 and 4 $A^ 0 $ are taken into account.

Two chemical looping gasification processes, the syngas chemical looping (SCL) process and the coal direct chemical looping (CDCL) process, are developed for hydrogen and electricity co-production from carbonaceous fuels. Both processes involve the reduction of a metal oxide with a fuel followed by regeneration of the reduced metal oxide with steam and air in a cyclic manner. The syngas chemical looping <b>process</b> <b>converts</b> gaseous fuels such as syngas and methane while the coal direct chemical looping <b>process</b> <b>converts</b> solid fuels such as coal and biomass.

30|$|In this study, tri 4 and tri 11 {{deletion}} mutants {{were generated}} {{to evaluate the}} roles of tri 4 and tri 11 in trichodermin biosynthesis. Tatri 4 catalyzes the addition of oxygen at C- 2, C- 12, and C- 11, and this <b>process</b> <b>converts</b> trichodiene to isotrichodiol in T. arundinaceum. Deletion mutant strain Δtri 4 did not produce trichodermin in strain 0248, and this phenomenon was previously observed for T. arundinaceum Δtri 4 mutants (Cardoza et al. 2011; Malmierca et al. 2012). This result suggested that tri 4 is essential for trichodermin biosynthesis in T. brevicompactum. Tatri 11 controls the hydroxylation at C- 4, and this <b>process</b> <b>converts</b> 12, 13 -epoxytrichothec- 9 -ene (EPT) to trichodermol in T. arundinaceum.
