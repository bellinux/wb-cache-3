40|$|Neoplasm formation, a non-meristematic {{tissue growth}} on young field pea (Pisum sativum L.) pods is {{triggered}} {{in the absence}} of UV light and/or in response to oviposition by <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bruchus pisorum L.). This trait is expressed in some genotypes (Np genotypes) of P. sativum and has the capacity to obstruct <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> larval entry into developing seeds. In the present study, 26 % of the tested accessions depicted the trait when grown under greenhouse conditions. However, UV light inhibits full expression of this trait and subsequently it is inconspicuous at the field level. In order to investigate UV light impact on the expression of neoplasm, particular Np genotypes were subjected to UV lamp light exposure in the greenhouse and sunlight at the field level. Under these different growing conditions, the highest mean percentage of neoplastic pods was in the control chamber in the greenhouse (36 %) whereas in single and double UV lamp chambers, the percentage dropped to 10 % and 15 %, respectively. Furthermore, when the same Np genotypes were grown in the field, the percentage of neoplastic pods dropped significantly (7 %). In order to enhance neoplastic expression at the field level, intercropping of Np genotypes with sorghum was investigated. As result, the percentage of neoplastic pods was threefold in intercropped Np genotypes as compared to those without intercropping. Therefore, intercropping neoplastic genotypes with other crops such as sorghum and maize can facilitate neoplasm formation, which in turn can minimize the success rate of <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae entry into developing seeds. Greenhouse artificial infestation experiments showed that <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> damage in neoplastic genotypes is lower in comparison to wild type genotypes. Therefore, promoting neoplastic formation under field conditions via intercropping can serve as part of an integrated <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> management strategy especially for small scale farming systems...|$|E

40|$|The <b>pea</b> leaf <b>weevil</b> {{is one of}} the few {{insect pests}} of field peas in {{southern}} Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan. Adults cause distinctive notching on seedlings which generally does not affect yield. Larval feeding on nitrogen-fixing root nodules may reduce yield if soil is nitrogen deficient. Only field peas and faba beans are at risk of damage. Other crops in the bean family may be fed on by adults but do not suffer significant damage from larvae. The economic threshold during the second to fifth node stages in field peas is 30 % of seedlings with damage to the terminal (clam) leaf. Seed treated with thiamethoxam has produced more consistent yield responses than application of foliar insecticides but additional farm-level trials are required. Trap cropping the <b>pea</b> leaf <b>weevil</b> can be done by planting a border in the fall with winter peas or adjacent, earlier planting of a spring cultivar. Close monitoring of the trap crop is needed to control the weevils in the trap crop area before they move to the rest of the field.

Synthetic products Nurelle D and Flordimex 420 (alone and in combination) were used as a standard. The products were applied once (at budding stage) or twice (at budding and flowering stages). The results showed that forage pea productivity was influenced positively by the application of all organic products. The plants treated with the organic combinations formed an average yield of 3190. 2 kg/ha, which was only 4. 7 % lower than that for the synthetic combination of Flordimex+Nurelle D. The highest yield was produced under application of two mixtures: Biofa+Pyrethrum and Polyversum+Pyrethrum at budding and flowering stages (22. 0 and 21. 8 % above untreated control, respectively). These combinations were also distinguished for their most pronounced protective effect against the attack of the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> and decrease in its numbers of 37. 0 and 38. 5 %, respectively. Pyrethrum was distinguished for a lower degree of damaged seeds and a toxic effect against the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> in comparison with NeemAzal.

Pod thickness and micromorphological traits of the pods were also examined. In the no-choice tests significantly more eggs were laid on the susceptible genotype Adet than on the other genotypes. Very few eggs were laid on P. fulvum and L. sativus. In the dual-choice experiments Adet was preferred by the females for oviposition. Furthermore, combinations of Adet with either 235899 - 1 or non-host plants significantly reduced the total number of eggs laid by the weevil in the dual-choice tests.

Repeated field and greenhouse trials revealed that locally released, high yielding varieties are highly susceptible to <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> infestation. The lack of strict quarantine systems in Ethiopia to prevent the spread of infested seeds is worsening the pest distribution within the country. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop locally adapted <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> resistance varieties.

To test whether arthropod community structure differed between the collections from plots having peas with normal or reduced wax, we performed a randomization test. The collection from peas with reduced wax had higher species evenness and thus higher community diversity despite having lower species richness. Our results demonstrate the potential of a single plant trait, epicuticular wax, to affect a community of arthropods. Two pests of peas had opposite responses to peas with reduced wax.

These crops are damaged by a large number of insect pests, of which pod borers, Helicoverpa armigera and H. punctigera; spotted pod borer, Maruca vitrata; spiny pod borer, Etiella zinckenella; pod fly, Melanagromyza obtusa; leaf miner, Liriomyza cicerina; stem fly, Ophiomyia phaseoli; <b>pea</b> and bean <b>weevil,</b> Sitona spp.; aphids, Aphis craccivora, Aphis fabae, and Acyrthosiphon pisum; white fly, Bemisia tabaci; defoliators, Spodoptera litura, S. exigua, and Amsacta spp.; leafhoppers, Empoasca spp., thrips, Megaleurothrips dorsalis, and Caliothrips indicus; blister beetles, Mylabris spp.; and the bruchids, Collasobruchus chinensis and Bruchus pisorum cause extensive losses worldwide. Because of development of resistance to insecticides in several insect species, there is a need to integrate different control tactics. Sources of resistance to insects in grain legumes have been identified, but these have not been used effectively in crop improvement. There is a need to place greater emphasis on utilization of wild relatives of crops with different resistance mecharusms, genetic engineering of plants for insect resistance, and identificatiorl of molecular markers associated with resistance to insect pests. Cultural manipulation of the crop and its environment, population monitoring and pest forecasting, manipulation of the crop environment to encourage the activity of natural enemies, use of natural plant products and bio-pesticides alone or in combination with synthetic pesticides, deployment of insectresistant varieties derived through conventional breeding, wide hybridization, or genetic engineering, and rational use of selective chemicals can be exploited for pest management in food legumes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} both the biological activity of an entomotoxin, the pea albumin 1 b (PA 1 b), and {{the presence or absence}} of its binding site within an array of insect species. The data obtained showed that insect sensitivity was not related to its taxonomic position. Moreover, PA 1 b was not toxic to several tested microorganisms. However, the binding site was found to be conserved among very different insects, displaying similar thermodynamic constants regardless of the in vivo species sensitivity. The binding site alone was, therefore, not sufficient for toxicity. One exception was the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil,</b> Bruchus pisorum, which was the only tested species without any detectable binding activity. These findings indicate that the binding site probably has an important endogenous function in insects and that adaptation to pea seeds resulted in the elimination of the toxin binding activity in two independent insect lineages. Other mechanisms are likely to interact with the toxin effects, although they are still largely unknown, but there is no evidence of any specific degradation of PA 1 b in the midgut of insects insensitive to the toxin, such as Drosophila melanogaster or Mamestra brassicae...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bruchus pisorum L.) (Coleóptera: Bruchidae) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{damaging}} pests of pea (Pisum sativum L.) We investigated the role of pea volatiles on the electrophysiological and behavioral response of B. pisorum using electroantennography (EAG) and olfactometry bioassays. Plant volatiles emitted at different phenological stages were collected in situ by headspace on Porapak Q traps and analyzed through gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Most abundant volatiles identified in all phenological stages were terpenes and green leaf volatiles. All tested volatile extracts elicited significant EAG responses in both male and female B. pisorum, with females exhibiting a greater response (1. 35 mV) than males (1. 02 mV) to pea-pod volatiles. Volatiles from each phenological stage stimulated an attractant behavioral response of both males and females B. pisorum in olfactometer bioassay. A larger attraction of B. pisorum females was observed to volatiles from pods over other phenological stages (P < 0. 001). These results suggest the relative importance of volatiles cues from plant mediating host location by B. pisorum. This work showed that plant volatiles elicited electrophysiological and behavioral responses and that B. pisorum female can discern between phenological stages of P. sativum based on those chemical cues...|$|E
40|$|Two α-amylase inhibitors, called αAI- 1 and αAI- 2, {{that share}} 78 % amino acid {{sequence}} identity and have a differential specificity toward mammalian and insect α-amylases are present in different accessions of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Using greenhouse-grown transgenic peas (Pisum sativum), we have shown previously that expression of αAI- 1 in pea seeds can provide complete protection against the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil</b> (Bruchus pisorum). Here, we report that αAI- 1 also protects peas from the weevil under field conditions. The {{high degree of protection}} is explained by our finding that αAI- 1 inhibits pea bruchid α-amylase by 80 % over a broad pH range (pH 4. 5 – 6. 5). αAI- 2, on the other hand, is a much less effective inhibitor of pea bruchid α-amylase, inhibiting the enzyme by only 40 %, and only in the pH 4. 0 – 4. 5 range. Nevertheless, this inhibitor was still partially effective in protecting field-grown transgenic peas against pea weevils. The primary effect of αAI- 2 appeared to be a delay in the maturation of the larvae. This contrasts with the effect of αAI- 1, which results in larval mortality at the first or second instar. These results are discussed in relationship to the use of amylase inhibitors with different specificities to bring about protection of crops from their insect pests or to decrease insect pest populations below the economic injury level...|$|E
40|$|Grain legumes such as chickpea, pigeonpea, cowpea, field pea, lentil, faba bean, black gram, green gram, grasspea, and Phaseolus beans play an {{important}} role in food and nutritional security, and sustainable crop production. Several insect pests damage these crops, of which pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera; spotted pod borer, Maruca vitrata; spiny pod borer, Etiella zinckenella; pod fly, Melanagromyza obtusa; stem fly, Ophiomyia phaseoli; <b>pea</b> and bean <b>weevil,</b> Sitona spp.; aphids, Aphis craccivora and Aphis fabae; white fly, Bemisia tabaci; defoliators, Spodoptera litura, S. exigua, and Amsacta spp.; leafhoppers, Empoasca spp., thrips, Megaleurothrips dorsalis, and Caliothrips indicus; blister beetles, Mylabris spp.; and the bruchids, Callasobruchus chinensis and Bruchus pisorum cause extensive losses. The incidence and extent of losses due to these pests varies across seasons, locations, and cropping systems. This scenario will change considerably due to impending global warming and climate change. The geographical distribution of some of the pests will extend to northern Europe and America, while the outbreks of some other pests will become more frequent. Several sources of resistance to insects have been identified in grain legumes, and improved cultivars also been developed in some crops. However, there are limitations to large-scale adoption of insect-resistant cultivars because of limited efforts in seed production and seed distribution. Cultural manipulation of the crop and its environment involving intercropping, population monitoring, manipulation of cropping systems to encourage the activity of natural enemies, use of natural plant products and bio-pesticides alone or in combination with synthetic pesticides, deployment of insect-resistant varieties derived through conventional breeding or genetic engineering, and need based application of synthetic pesticides can be used for pest management in grain legumes for sustainable crop production. The relative efficacy of some of these pest management tactics, particularly biopesticides and natural plant product might reduce considerably in warm climates. In addition, there will be greater genotype × environment interaction for expression of resistance to insect pests, and this warrants a greater effort for identification of diverse sources of resistance to insects, and develop integrated pest management packages that will be effective under variable climatic condition...|$|R
6000|$|The north {{wind had}} already begun to cool the pond, though it took many weeks of steady blowing to {{accomplish}} it, it is so deep. When I began to have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney carried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between the boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and rafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity overhead, where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I may say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had got a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it did me good to see the soot form {{on the back of the}} chimney which I had built, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than usual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in it; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever satisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in a house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family (patremfamilias) must have in his rustic villa [...] "cellam oleariam, vinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et virtuti, et gloriae erit," [...] that is, [...] "an oil and wine cellar, many casks, so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his advantage, and virtue, and glory." [...] I had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes, about two quarts of <b>peas</b> with the <b>weevil</b> in them, and on my shelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a peck each.|$|R
40|$|Trials were {{conducted}} in 2011 and 2012 at the Institute of Forage Crops, Pleven, Bulgaria, in order to study the imaginal and possible ovicidal effect of some insecticides against Bruchus pisorum under field conditions. Treatments with insecticides were started after {{the appearance of the}} first pea weevils eggs on pods located on the bottom two nodes. It was found that treatment with acetamiprid; thiacloprid; thiacloprid+deltamethrin; 50 g cypermethrin+ 480 g chlorpyrifosethyl, 50 g cypermethrin+ 500 g chlorpyrifosethyl and zeta-cypermethrin resulted in the cessation of additional oviposition on the lower nodes by Bruchus pisorum, due to the toxic effect of the insecticides on the <b>pea</b> <b>weevil.</b> It was found that spraying with acetamiprid and zeta-cypermethrin was the most effective. These insecticides significantly reduced the proportion of infected pods in comparison with the proportion of pods with eggs before the treatment by 30. 2 and 27. 4 % and by 15. 8 and 24. 0 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The use of acetamiprid and zeta-cypermethrin was also associated with the lowest percentage of infected seeds (21. 7 and 23. 6 %, respectively), with the lowest percentage of infected seed in infected pods (40. 5 and 42. 5 %, respectively) and the highest weight of 1000 infected seeds (161. 94 and 182. 04 g, respectively). It was concluded that the management of pea weevils in the crop with acetamiprid and zetacypermethrin can lead to satisfactory results when spray timing is chosen when the first eggs are visible. peer-reviewe...|$|E
