40|$|Is it {{possible}} to have a unique, recognizable style in soccer nowadays? We address this question by proposing a method to quantify the motif characteristics of soccer teams based on their pass networks. We introduce the the concept of "flow motifs" to characterize the statistically significant <b>pass</b> <b>sequence</b> patterns. It extends the idea of the network motifs, highly significant subgraphs that usually consists of three or four nodes. The analysis of the motifs in the pass networks allows us to compare and differentiate the styles of different teams. Although most teams tend to apply homogenous style, surprisingly, a unique strategy of soccer exists. Specifically, FC Barcelona's famous tiki-taka does not consist of uncountable random passes but rather has a precise, finely constructed structure.

This study investigated experimental strain distributions across a thick aluminum U-grooved weld and identified two weld process considerations for improving the multipass weld strength. The extreme thermal expansion and contraction gradient of the fusion heat input across the tab thickness between the grooves produce severe peaking, which induces bending moment under uniaxial loading. The filler strain hardening decreased with increasing filler <b>pass</b> <b>sequence.</b> These combined effects reduce the weld strength, and a depeaking index model was developed to select filler pass thicknesses, pass numbers, and sequences to improve the welding process results over the current normal weld schedule...|$|E

Therefore, {{the objective of}} the study was to analyse the effect of <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> (longer <b>passing</b> <b>sequence</b> and shorter <b>passing</b> <b>sequence)</b> towards field goals and penalty comers in men’s field hockey. <b>Passing</b> <b>sequence</b> referred to how many touches or passing made towards obtaining field goals or penalty comers won by the attacking team. Longer <b>passing</b> <b>sequence</b> was <b>passing</b> made more than five times, meanwhile shorter <b>passing</b> <b>sequence</b> was <b>passing</b> made less than four times. Analysis of 24 footages/ video taken from World Hockey League Semi Finals at Johor Bahru, 2013, including 8 countries (Germany, Argentina, England, Korea, Malaysia, Japan, Pakistan, and South Africa) competing to qualify for World Cup 2014. The analytical process focused on two different <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> in attacking on field goals and penalty comers in men’s field hockey. Two reliability tests, (intra and inter observer test) were conducted on researcher before going through the data collection process. All the footage/video were analysed by using computerized analysis software (SPORTCODE ELITE). A Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Test was deemed the appropriate statistical method to determine the effect of this study. Results showed that there were significant different between shorter passing and longer <b>passing</b> <b>sequence</b> towards field goals when, (z = - 4. 05, p <. 05), and the median for shorter <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> is greater than that of the longer <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> towards field goals. Meanwhile, for penalty corners, showed that shorter <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> were more effective and beneficial in men’s field hockey when the data indicate (z = - 4. 29, p <. 05), and the median for shorter <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> is greater than that of the longer <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> towards penalty comers. Moreover other findings from this study also support that shorter <b>passing</b> <b>sequence</b> is more effective during attacking in men’s field hockey when shown that D penetration more often occurred compare to longer <b>passing</b> <b>sequence</b> (z = - 4. 28, p <. 05).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the effect of match status (winning, losing or drawing) on the length of <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> of toplevel soccer teams. A total of 20 matches of the knockout phase of the 2008 - 2009 UEFA Champions League were analysed. The sample consisted of 222 <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> leading to shooting opportunities performed by the four semi-finalists teams (FC Barcelona, Manchester United FC, Chelsea FC and Arsenal FC). These <b>passing</b> <b>sequences</b> were selected to reflect how each team tended to break the balance with the opposing teams to reach the goal (symmetry-breaking process).

By analyzing the characteristics of thermal plasticity of 40 Cr steel, the Hensel-Spittel flow stress model of 40 Cr steel was established in this study. For the possible continuous rolling schedule of Φ 80 mm 40 Cr steel from 200 mm× 200 mm billet, the advanced technology of viscoplastic FEM by LARSTRAN/SHAPE was used to create 3 -D thermo-mechanical coupled simulation models for 8 -pass hot continuous rolling processes. From the rolling process simulation the stress, strain, temperature distribution and rolling force variation were obtained. The simulation results included the comparison of plastic deformation of round pass with curved side wall and round pass with straight-side wall as well as the cause of rolling defect (e. g. crack).

40|$|Aplysia californica is {{a marine}} opisthobranch mollusc {{used as a}} model {{organism}} in neurobiology for cellular analyses of learning and behavior because it possesses a comparatively small number of neurons of large size. The mollusca comprise the second largest animal phylum, yet detailed genetic and genomic information is only recently beginning to accrue. Thus developmental and comparative evolutionary biology as well as biomedical research would benefit from additional information on DNA sequences of Aplysia. Therefore, we have constructed a series of unidirectional cDNA libraries from different life stages of Aplysia. These include whole organisms from the egg, veliger, metamorphic, and juvenile stages as well as adult neural tissue for reference. Individual clones were randomly picked, and high-throughput, single <b>pass</b> <b>sequence</b> analysis was performed to generate 7971 sequences. Of these, there were 5507 quality-filtered ESTs that clustered into 1988 unigenes, which are annotated and deposited into GenBank. A significant number (497) of ESTs did not match existing Aplysia ESTs and are thus potentially novel sequences for Aplysia.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationships between transition speed, the various aspects that define a transition (e. g. passing characteristics, position on the field, etc.) and positive/non-positive outcomes during high level Football matches. Analysis was based on recording every transition during 27 Football matches played by a successful team during the 2009 / 2010 Hyundai A-League season (n= 1105). Transition outcomes were assigned as either positive (Shot, Penalty, and Free kick), or non-positive (Tackled, Passed Out, Passed Back to GK, Offside, and Pass Intercepted). Significant differences were found between transition speed and transition starting field position (p <. 001), <b>pass</b> <b>sequence</b> length (p <. 001), and number of players involved (p <. 001).

This study investigated experimental strain distributions across a thick aluminum U-grooved weld and identified two weld process considerations for improving the multipass weld strength. One is the source of peaking in which the extreme thermal expansion and contraction gradient of the fusion heat input across the groove tab thickness produces severe angular distortion that induces bending under uniaxial loading.

River buffalo has 50 chromosomes and is mainly reared in India, Southwest Asia and the Mediterranean region, including Italy, where the mozzarella di bufala campana cheese is produced from river buffalo milk contributing to the excellent reputation of the made in Italy brand worldwide. Swamp buffalo has 48 chromosomes and is mainly reared in Southeast Asia and China. The river buffalo genome has been recently sequenced and de-novo assembled, through the coordinated effort of an international Consortium led by a core group of Italian scientists. An associated HapMap project has sequenced 47 river buffaloes from 4 breeds at low coverage. As a result, more than 22 M SNPs were discovered, permitting the development of the Axiom Buffalo Genotyping 90 K (Affymetrix) marker panel. In this study, the SNP panel has been used to assess the main genetic parameters and genetic diversity of different water buffalo breeds sampled in Italy and elsewhere. Genotyping accuracy and main population genetic indexes have been compared between the 90 K SNPs from the SNPchip and the 22 M SNPs discovered by sequencing.

Of 483 studies initially identified, 77 were fully reviewed and their outcome measures extracted and analyzed. Results showed that research mainly focused on (1) performance at set pieces, i. e. corner kicks, free kicks, penalty kicks; (2) collective system behaviours, captured by established variables such as team centroid (geometrical centre of a set of players) and team dispersion (quantification of how far players are apart), as well as tendencies for team communication (establishing networks based on <b>passing</b> <b>sequences),</b> sequential patterns (predicting future <b>passing</b> <b>sequences),</b> and group outcomes (relationships between match-related statistics and final match scores); and (3) activity profile of players, i. e. playing roles, effects of fatigue, substitutions during matches, and the effects of environmental constraints on performance, such as heat and altitude.

Simultaneously, the technology suffers from a significantly higher error rate, ameliorated by the ability to sample multiple reads from the same location.

We combine the Weighted Sequence Graph (WSG) representation of all optimal and near optimal alignments between the two reads sampled from a piece of DNA with k-mer filtering methods and spaced seeds to quickly generate candidate locations for the reads on the reference genome. We also propose a fast implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm using vectorized instructions that significantly speeds up the matching process. Our method combines these approaches {{in order to build}} an algorithm that is both fast and accurate, since it is able to take complete advantage of both of the reads sampled during two <b>pass</b> <b>sequencing.</b> ...|$|R
