5|$|Like most rare-earth elements, <b>praseodymium</b> most readily {{forms the}} +3 {{oxidation}} state, {{which is the}} only stable state in aqueous solution, although the +4 oxidation state is known in some solid compounds and, uniquely among the lanthanides, the +5 oxidation state is attainable in matrix-isolation conditions. Aqueous <b>praseodymium</b> ions are yellowish-green, and similarly <b>praseodymium</b> results in various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its ability to filter yellow light from light sources.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> {{compounds}} give {{glasses and}} enamels a yellow color.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pr and atomic number 59. It {{is the third}} member of the lanthanide series and is traditionally considered {{to be one of}} the rare-earth metals. <b>Praseodymium</b> is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal, valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in native form, and pure <b>praseodymium</b> metal slowly develops a green oxide coating.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> is used {{to color}} {{ceramics}} yellow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium,</b> {{like all}} of the {{lanthanides}} (except lanthanum, ytterbium, and lutetium, which have no unpaired 4f electrons), is paramagnetic at room temperature. Unlike some other rare-earth metals, which show antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures, <b>praseodymium</b> is paramagnetic at all temperatures above 1K.|$|E
5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to praseodymium(III) oxide (Pr2O3) with {{hydrogen}} gas. The dark-coloured praseodymium(IV) oxide, PrO2, is the most oxidised product of the combustion of <b>praseodymium</b> and is only obtained by reaction of <b>praseodymium</b> metal with pure oxygen at 400°C and 282bar. The reactivity of <b>praseodymium</b> conforms to periodic trends, as {{it is one of}} the first and thus one of the largest lanthanides. At 1000°C, many <b>praseodymium</b> oxides with composition PrO2−x exist as disordered, nonstoichiometric phases with 0 < x < 0.25, but at 400–700 °C the oxide defects are instead ordered, creating phases of the general formula PrnO2n−2 with n = 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and ∞. These phases PrOy are sometimes labelled α and β′ (nonstoichiometric), β (y = 1.833), δ (1.818), ε (1.8), ζ (1.778), ι (1.714), θ, and σ.|$|E
5|$|Doping <b>praseodymium</b> in {{fluoride}} glass {{allows it}} {{to be used as}} a single-mode fiber optical amplifier.|$|E
5|$|In {{combination}} with neodymium, another rare-earth element, <b>praseodymium</b> {{is used to}} create high-power magnets notable for their strength and durability.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> is a {{component}} of didymium glass, {{which is used to}} make certain types of welder's and glass blower's goggles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> is {{the third}} member of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides cerium to its left and neodymium to its right, and above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{comparable to that of}} silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f36s2; theoretically, all five outer electrons can act as valence electrons, but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally, <b>praseodymium</b> only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. <b>Praseodymium</b> is the first of the lanthanides to have an electron configuration conforming to the Aufbau principle, which predicts the 4f orbitals to have a lower energy level than the 5d orbitals; this does not hold for lanthanum and cerium, because the sudden contraction of the 4f orbitals does not happen until after lanthanum, and is not strong enough at cerium to avoid occupying the 5d subshell. Nevertheless, solid <b>praseodymium</b> takes on the 4f25d16s2 configuration, with one electron in the 5d subshell like all the other trivalent lanthanides (all but europium and ytterbium, which are divalent in the metallic state).|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> oxide {{in solid}} {{solution}} with ceria or ceria-zirconia {{has been used}} as an oxidation catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Silicate {{crystals}} doped with <b>praseodymium</b> ions {{have been}} used to slow a light pulse down to a few hundred meters per second.|$|E
5|$|Like most lanthanides, <b>praseodymium</b> {{usually only}} uses three {{electrons}} as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. <b>Praseodymium</b> nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth valence electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, <b>praseodymium</b> has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> {{is present}} in the rare-earth mixture whose {{fluoride}} forms the core of carbon arc lights, which are used in the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projector lights.|$|E
5|$|The early {{lanthanides}} act {{as essential}} cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, <b>praseodymium,</b> and neodymium alone are about equally effective. <b>Praseodymium</b> is otherwise {{not known to}} have a biological role in any other organisms, but is not very toxic either. Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals {{has been known to}} impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical similarity of the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, <b>praseodymium,</b> or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E
5|$|Magnets {{are made}} of heavy metals such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, niobium, bismuth, <b>praseodymium,</b> neodymium, gadolinium, and dysprosium. Neodymium magnets are the strongest type of {{permanent}} magnet commercially available. They are key components of, for example, car door locks, starter motors, fuel pumps, and power windows.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> {{has only}} one stable and {{naturally}} occurring isotope, 141Pr. It is thus a mononuclidic element, and its standard atomic weight can be determined with high precision. This isotope has 82 neutrons, a magic number that confers additional stability. This isotope is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Reaction with excess {{fluorine}} {{produces the}} stable white tetrafluoride CeF4; the other tetrahalides are not known. Of the dihalides, only the bronze diiodide CeI2 is known; like the diiodides of lanthanum, <b>praseodymium,</b> and gadolinium, {{this is a}} cerium(III) electride compound. True cerium(II) compounds are restricted to a few unusual organocerium complexes.|$|E
5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride {{is removed from the}} reaction mixture with liquid hydrogen fluoride. Additionally, <b>praseodymium</b> forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and gadolinium, it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.|$|E
5|$|All other <b>praseodymium</b> {{isotopes}} have half-lives under a day (and most under a minute), {{with the}} single exception of 143Pr with a half-life of 13.6days. Both 143Pr and 141Pr occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 141Pr is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of cerium, while that of heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Praseodymium</b> alloyed with nickel (PrNi5) {{has such}} a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed {{scientists}} to approach within one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero. In general, most alloys of the cerium-group rare earths (lanthanum through samarium) with 3d transition metals give extremely stable magnets that are often used in small equipment, such as motors, printers, watches, headphones, loudspeakers, and magnetic storage.|$|E
5|$|All other cerium {{isotopes}} are synthetic and radioactive. The {{most stable}} {{of them are}} 144Ce with a half-life of 284.9days, 139Ce with a half-life of 137.6days, 143Ce with a half-life of 33.04days, and 141Ce with a half-life of 32.5days. All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, {{and most of them}} have half-lives under ten minutes. The isotopes between 140Ce and 144Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium. The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 140Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum, while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of <b>praseodymium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is the most common of the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and <b>praseodymium.</b> It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
5|$|The colours of glass, ceramic glazes, paints, pigments, and {{plastics}} {{are commonly}} {{produced by the}} inclusion of heavy metals (or their compounds) such as chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, zirconium, molybdenum, silver, tin, <b>praseodymium,</b> neodymium, erbium, tungsten, iridium, gold, lead, or uranium. Tattoo inks may contain heavy metals, such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, and copper. The high reflectivity of some heavy metals {{is important in the}} construction of mirrors, including precision astronomical instruments. Headlight reflectors rely on the excellent reflectivity of a thin film of rhodium.|$|E
5|$|This may {{be reduced}} to cerium(III) oxide with {{hydrogen}} gas. Cerium metal is highly pyrophoric, meaning that when it is ground or scratched, the resulting shavings catch fire. This reactivity conforms to periodic trends, since cerium {{is one of the}} first and hence one of the largest lanthanides. Cerium(IV) oxide has the fluorite structure, similarly to the dioxides of <b>praseodymium</b> and terbium. Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known, along with the trivalent Ce2Z3 (Z = S, Se, Te). The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce3+Z2−e−. While CeZ2 are known, they are polychalcogenides with cerium(III): cerium(IV) chalcogenides remain unknown.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} very toxic either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, <b>praseodymium,</b> and neodymium alone are about equally effective.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and <b>praseodymium</b> to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{americium}} {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, <b>praseodymium</b> and neodymium.|$|E
25|$|The only tetrahalides known are the tetrafluorides of cerium, <b>praseodymium,</b> terbium, {{neodymium}} and dysprosium, {{the last}} two known only under matrix isolation conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{ease with which}} the 4th electron can be removed in cerium and (to a lesser extent <b>praseodymium)</b> indicates why Ce(IV) and Pr(IV) compounds can be formed, for example CeO2 is formed rather than Ce2O3 when cerium reacts with oxygen.|$|E
25|$|In {{experiments}} {{where other}} elements are substituted on the Cu and Ba sites, evidence {{has shown that}} conduction occurs in the Cu(2)O planes while the Cu(1)O(1) chains act as charge reservoirs, which provide carriers to the CuO planes. However, this model fails to address superconductivity in the homologue Pr123 (<b>praseodymium</b> instead of yttrium).Cu3O7−y|last1=Oka|first1=K|bibcode = 1998PhyC..300..200O }} This (conduction in the copper planes) confines conductivity to the a-b planes and a large anisotropy in transport properties is observed. Along the c axis, normal conductivity is 10 times smaller than in the a-b plane. For other cuprates in the same general class, the anisotropy is even greater and inter-plane transport is highly restricted.|$|E
25|$|Most roAp {{stars have}} been {{discovered}} using small telescopes to observe the small changes in amplitude caused by the pulsation of the star, however {{it is also possible}} to observe such pulsations by measuring the variations in radial velocity of sensitive lines, such as Neodymium or <b>Praseodymium.</b> Some lines are not seen to pulsate, such as Iron. It is thought that the pulsations are of highest amplitude high in the atmospheres of these stars, where the density is lower. As a result, the spectral lines that are formed by elements that are radiatively levitated high in the atmosphere are likely to be most sensitive to measuring the pulsation, whereas the lines of elements such as Iron, which gravitationally settle, are not expected to exhibit radial velocity variations.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the time}} that ion-exchange methods and elution were available, the {{separation}} of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallisation. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium-group earths (scandium, lanthanum, cerium, <b>praseodymium,</b> neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium-group earths (yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are difficultly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group (dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups.|$|E
500|$|As the {{lanthanides}} are so similar, <b>praseodymium</b> {{can substitute}} for most other lanthanides without significant loss of function, and indeed many {{applications such as}} mischmetal and ferrocerium alloys involve variable mixes of several lanthanides, including small quantities of <b>praseodymium.</b> The following more modern applications involve <b>praseodymium</b> specifically, or at least <b>praseodymium</b> in a small subset of the lanthanides: ...|$|E
