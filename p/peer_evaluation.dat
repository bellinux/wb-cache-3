The government owns or supports most journals {{with only a}} small number being privately owned. The [...] "publish or perish" [...] system has been argued to contribute to many low quality {{journals and}} articles that are infrequently cited and also to plagiarism and fraud. The Chinese government has put into place stricter regulations, punished or terminated some journals, and aims increase quality control and <b>peer</b> <b>evaluation</b> of journals as well as to create five to ten large publishing groups. As part of the reforms, in 2012 the China Association for Science and Technology, which oversees 1,050 journals, in a declaration listed various forms of misconduct, plagiarism, and fraud and as well, [...] the penalties for perpetrating them such as written warnings, blacklisting, contacting the researcher's home institution or funding agencies, or public disclosure. It has also been seen as important by increasing pressure on other journals and by informing editors who may not know that some actions such as favoring researchers based on personal relations are unacceptable. China also plans to give substantial financial incentives to top journals based on factors such as their Chinese and international impact factor.

40|$|Abstract. Team-based work {{practices}} are ubiquitous, and most organizations collect infor-mation about an individual’s performance from his team-mates through privately reported <b>peer</b> <b>evaluations.</b> We analyze the optimal use of <b>peer</b> <b>evaluations</b> {{in the provision}} of in-centives. We derive the optimal contract in a setting in which the firm pays a discretionary bonus based on a publicly observed team output but may further sharpen incentives by using <b>peer</b> <b>evaluations.</b> The optimal contract illustrates why, when and how should <b>peer</b> <b>evaluations</b> be used. We show that <b>peer</b> <b>evaluations</b> can help sustain relational contracts. <b>Peer</b> <b>evaluations</b> are used when the firm is impatient and the associated surplus destruction is small. Moreover, peer reports affect a worker’s pay only when the public output is the lowest possible and he receives the worst possible peer report. Interestingly, a worker’s re-port does not affect his own pay. Effort incentives cannot be decoupled from truth-telling incentives, and in order to induce both effort and truthful peer reports, it may be optimal to ignore signals that are informative of the worker’s effort. Our results are consistent with compensation policy in many professional services industries such as the financial sector. 1...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Curriculum and InstructionThis study {{reports the}} results of {{research}} done in three ninth grade English classrooms during a four week unit on Romeo and Juliet. The research focuses on the independent variables of ability grouping and evaluation modality {{as they have been}} found to be crucial to improving comprehension in English classrooms. The three classrooms were randomly assigned either the control condition or one of two experimental conditions. Each classroom received instruction using the Reciprocal Teaching Strategy. All 56 students were identified as either high or low level learners based on his or her most recent standardized reading test scores. The control classroom‟s student participants were placed in reading groups with students of similar ability and were evaluated daily by the instructor. The participants in the two experimental cohorts were placed in reading groups with a variety of learner levels. Additionally, one experimental classroom employed <b>peer</b> <b>evaluations.</b> The study found that high level learners had significantly higher gains on the classroom objective test when receiving <b>peer</b> <b>evaluations</b> combined with mixed ability groupings.
