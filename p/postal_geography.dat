The tutorial gives guidance and links to learning materials provided by the Collection of Historical and Contemporary Census Data and Materials (CHCC) for which an Athens password is required. An introduction to the different geographies used in the United Kingdom such as Administrative Geography and <b>Postal</b> <b>Geography</b> is given along {{with a look at}} the use of Universal Data Maps. There is also an introduction to US Census geography. The PowerPoint presentation is provided by the US Census Bureau giving an overview of Census 2000 geographic concepts and products. The activity sheet relates to learning materials provide in CHCC Units 12 and 13 and the US Census Bureau presentation. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>postal</b> <b>geography</b> as areal units has {{developed}} significantly since its first introduction in the 1971 Census of Scotland. The 1987 Chorley report advocated {{the use of}} postal codes as the standard areal unit for publication of geographic data across the board. The change to a postal base in the census of England and Wales finally took place in 2001. Aggregation of population data is essential, both to protect the identity of individuals and make the data manageable. The question however remains, whether the independent aggregation of two similar datasets covering the same geographical area makes the data two separate information sources, or whether they can be successfully be linked together and used as one. Through the comparison of two aggregated areal datasets of British population based statistics, this paper examines the reliability of commercially produced, undocumented data, {{with the use of}} a look-up table linking postal sectors to enumeration districts of the 1991 Census of British population. The investigation finds that the ability to link the Experian dataset is to the census is questionable. The two datasets contain many obvious and significant differences when linked, it can be concluded that look-up tables are a poor and inaccurate way of linking differently aggregated spatial datasets...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{work done}} to {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} the publication of data for multiple geographies poses a risk to the confidentiality of individuals. One of the major outputs of the last UK Census and earlier Censuses was a set of standard tables providing numerous cross-tabulations of all recorded variables. These are known as the Small Area Statistics (SAS), and were initially supplied for a fixed set of areas, namely Enumeration Districts (EDs) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and Output Areas (OAs) in Scotland. There were a total of 155, 180 of these small areas in the UK in 1991, with an average population of about 366 people (Denham, 1993). Despite the fact that this output geography is detailed and offers considerable scope for analysis of conditions at a local level, there are three main drawbacks. Firstly, although the output geography is detailed, it may be the `wrong' geography for any particular user. Secondly given the fact that the output units have a relatively small (average) population size, there are concerns about the possibility that the privacy of individuals might be compromised by published data. Thirdly, users increasingly want data for output areas that make most sense to themselves and not necessarily to the data providers. The requirement for multiple geographies is significantly increased by the way in which geographies change over time. The two main geographies of interest in the UK are administrative and postal geographies. In some areas of the country (in particular Scotland) the match between these two geographies is quite close, but in other areas they are very dissimilar. <b>Postal</b> <b>geography</b> changes almost continuously over time by small amounts (Raper et al. 1992), whereas in contrast the administrative geography chang [...] ...|$|E

50|$|In 1973, a {{group of}} {{dedicated}} residents, politicians and community workers started identifying ways to address community problems. They concentrated their efforts on improving their neighbourhood’s negative image and creating {{a sense of community}} pride. Since then the neighbourhood has developed over 30 grassroots associations, including social and health service organizations, based on principles of mutual aid. Jane-Finch residents managed to create the infra-structure that their community needed to become healthy and sustainable. They succeeded in bringing together various sectors to address a wide range of economic, social and recreational needs. The United Way’s “Poverty by <b>Postal</b> Code-The <b>Geography</b> of Neighbourhood Poverty: 1981-2001” (2004) report explained that by 2001, there were more high-poverty neighbourhoods in the former City of North York than in any of the other former cities. More than one in five families in North York live in poverty, and in the Jane-Finch region.|$|R

In this study, we combine the perspective of regional economics on the interrelationships among technology, organization, and territory with the triple-helix model, and offer the mutual information in three dimensions {{as an indicator of}} the configuration. When this probabilistic entropy is negative, the configuration reduces the uncertainty that prevails at the systems level. Data about more than a million Dutch companies are used for testing the indicator. The data contain <b>postal</b> codes (<b>geography),</b> sector codes (proxy for technology), and firm sizes in terms of number of employees (proxy for organization). The configurations are mapped at three levels: national (NUTS- 1), provincial (NUTS- 2), and regional (NUTS- 3). The levels are cross-tabled with {{the knowledge}}-intensive sectors and services. The results suggest that medium-tech sectors contribute to {{the knowledge base}} of an economy more than high-tech ones. Knowledgeintensive services have an uncoupling effect, but less so at the high-tech end of these services...|$|R
