The spatial diversity available in the naturally decoupled phases of the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> can be exploited for using <b>power</b> <b>line</b> as <b>communication</b> medium for narrowband application just as incase of fading channel of a wireless communication. In this paper, a study is performed to test the transmission of digital data using simulated <b>power</b> <b>line.</b> Time and frequency dependent transfer function of the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> is varied instantaneously during data transmission, which is a characteristic of the <b>power</b> <b>line.</b> Impulsive disturbance on the <b>power</b> <b>line</b> is modeled using Middleton class-A noise. BCH code is used as outer code to reduce the SNR requirement. Concatenation of BCH code with space time code is found to reduce the SNR requirement to have the carrier power within the regulatory limits...|$|R

2500|$|The rapidly {{changing}} currents also create electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) that radiate {{outward from the}} ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as <b>power</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>communication</b> <b>lines,</b> or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. This is the [...] "surge" [...] that, more often than not, results {{in the destruction of}} delicate electronics, electrical appliances, or electric motors. Devices known as surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS) attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through an alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached earthing ground, thereby protecting the equipment from damage.|$|R
