5|$|The Sea Harrier FA2 {{featured}} the Blue Vixen radar, which {{was described as}} one of the most advanced <b>pulse</b> <b>doppler</b> radar systems in the world; the Blue Fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was available at the time of procurement. The Blue Vixen formed the basis for development of the Eurofighter Typhoon's CAPTOR radar. The Sea Harrier FA2 also carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, the first UK aircraft to be provided with this capability. An upgraded model of the Pegasus engine, the Pegasus Mk 106, was used in the Sea Harrier FA2; in response to the threat of radar-based anti aircraft weapons electronic countermeasures were added. Other improvements included an increase to the air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{numerical}} weather prediction is to sample {{the state of the}} fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. Sites launch radiosondes, which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available. Compared with similar data from radiosondes, the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage, however at a lower accuracy and resolution. Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity, which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time. Additionally, if a <b>pulse</b> <b>Doppler</b> weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of death in the majority of well-developed countries. Importance of early diagnosis Early diagnosis of coronary artery disease is difficult due to blood vessels remodeling, late manifestations of reduced maximal and normal coronary blood flow, and negative correlation between stenosis and plaque burden. <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> tissue imaging <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> tissue imaging is used for assessment of myocardial velocity, whereas classical Doppler imaging is used for measurement of blood flow velocity. Systolic myocardial velocity profile During the systolic phase only a single myocardial motion is registered - S wave. Diastolic myocardial velocity profile There are early and late myocardial relaxation velocities. Impact of coronary artery disease on myocardial velocities Early to late myocardial relaxation velocity ratio is influenced by coronary artery disease. This paper provides practical guidelines for using pulsed doppler tissue imaging. Conclusion <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> tissue imaging is an excellent procedure for early diagnosis of coronary artery disease. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} with mitral stenosis, routine noninvasive techniques are insensitive {{for the detection}} of coexistent aortic insufficiency. The ability of pulsed Doppler echocardiography to detect {{the presence or absence of}} angiographically demonstrated aortic insufficiency was evaluated in 45 {{patients with}} rheumatic mitral stenosis. <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> echocardiography correctly identified the presence of aortic insufficiency in 97 % of the 35 patients with documented aortic regurgitation. More important, pulsed Doppler echocardiography disclosed aortic insufficiency in all 7 patients in whom it was not suspected on physical examination and in 28 of the 29 patients in whom it was not suspected by M-mode echocardiography. <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> echocardiography also demonstrated excellent specificity, correctly detecting the absence of aortic insufficiency in 9 of the 10 patients who had no angiographic evidence of aortic insufficiency. It is concluded that in patients with mitral stenosis, pulsed Doppler echocardiography is a useful noninvasive diagnostic test for evaluating the presence of aortic insufficiency, even when this lesion is not detectable by physical examination or M-mode echocardiography...|$|R
25|$|The Skyguard {{system is}} {{contained}} within a towed trailer, {{mounted on the}} roof of which is a <b>pulse</b> <b>doppler</b> search radar, a <b>pulse</b> <b>doppler</b> tracking radar and a co-axial television camera.

25|$|While the Lavi {{project had}} been {{terminated}} without any production aircraft being produced, the development represented an important opportunity to demonstrate and advance {{the capabilities of}} Israel's aerospace industry.

40|$|A {{common problem}} is a soft basal {{ejection}} murmur in an asymptomatic child with a normal electrocardiogram and chest x-ray films. If the diagnosis is aortic stenosis, {{there is a need}} for prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis and concern about development of calcific aortic stenosis. In 40 consecutive children referred for this differential diagnosis, aortic stenosis was diagnosed in 30, based on an ejection murmur at the second right interspace (not necessarily louder than at the second left), which transmitted well to the neck, accompanied by a normal second heart sound. <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> echocardiography confirmed turbulence at the aortic valve in 26. In the 10 children diagnosed clinically as having an innocent murmur, three had evidence on pulsed Doppler echocardiography for an abnormal aortic valve.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Falklands, the typical air group was three AEW Sea Kings, nine ASW Sea Kings and eight or nine Sea Harriers. Analysis of the Sea Harrier's performance during the war lead to the requirement for an upgrade, approval for which was granted in 1984. The Sea Harrier FA2 entered service in 1993 and deployed on Invincible to Bosnia in 1994.

The final new build Sea Harrier FA2 was delivered on 18 January 1999.

500|$|As {{early as}} 1946, missile {{conversion}} projects for Kentucky and the incomplete large cruiser [...] were discussed. In the early 1950s, the advances in guided missile technology {{led to a}} proposal to create a large warship armed with both guns and missiles. To this end, the incomplete Kentucky was chosen for conversion from an all gun ship into a [...] "guided missile battleship". This proposal would have been relatively conservative, and would have involved the installation {{of a pair of}} twin arm launchers for the RIM-2 Terrier surface-to-air missile (SAM) on the aft deckhouse, with a pair of antennas for the associated AN/APG-55 <b>pulse</b> <b>doppler</b> interception radar installed forward of these, and the AN/SPS-2B air search radar on a short mast. Since the battleship was already approximately 73% complete (construction had been halted at the main deck), installation of the missile system and associated electronics would have involved only adding the necessary equipment without any need to rebuild the ship to accommodate the system. Some guided missile concepts included one or two launchers for eight Regulus II or SSM-N-2 Triton nuclear cruise missiles. The guided missile battleship project was authorized in 1954, and Kentucky was renumbered from BB-66 to BBG-1, with the conversion due to be complete in 1956. However, the project was soon cancelled, with the conversion ideas transferred to a smaller platform that led to the [...] guided missile cruiser. [...] These partial conversions of two [...] heavy cruisers proved only partially successful in their new role, as the pace of change in cruise missile technology rendered their new weapons systems obsolete, while their remaining heavy guns proved in demand.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as high-thrust solid-fuel rockets {{became a}} reality in the mid-1950s, the USAF began {{to develop a new}} solid-fueled Bomarc variant, the IM-99B Bomarc B. It used a Thiokol XM51 booster, and also had {{improved}} Marquardt RJ43-MA-7 (and finally the RJ43-MA-11) ramjets. The first IM-99B was launched in May 1959, but problems with the new propulsion system delayed the first fully successful flight until July 1960, when a supersonic KD2U-1/MQM-15A Regulus II drone was intercepted. Because the new booster took up less space in the missile, more ramjet fuel could be carried, increasing the range to [...] The terminal homing system was also improved, using the world's first <b>pulse</b> <b>Doppler</b> search radar, the Westinghouse AN/DPN-53. All Bomarc Bs were equipped with the W-40 nuclear warhead. In June 1961, the first IM-99B squadron became operational, and Bomarc B quickly replaced most Bomarc A missiles. On 23 March 1961, a Bomarc B successfully intercepted a Regulus II cruise missile flying at 100,000ft, thus achieving the highest interception in the world up to that date.|$|E

However, in the published literature, emptying velocity measurement location is not uniform, and no standard currently exists. We assessed the hypothesis that emptying velocity when acquired near the LAA orifice differs from that at the LAA apex. Methods and results The study group comprised 44 patients (32 in sinus rhythm and 12 in atrial fibrillation) who were able to complete a non-emergent transoesophageal echocardiography. <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> recordings were obtained with the sample volume first positioned 1 cm from the LAA orifice, and then positioned within 1 cm of the LAA apex. At each location, we calculated the average of the peak end-diastolic LAA emptying velocity from five consecutive cardiac cycles. LAA orifice emptying velocity was higher than the apex emptying velocity in all patients. The median velocity at the orifice was 72 cm/s, which was 45 % higher than the median velocity at the apex (43 cm/s, P, 0. 001). Lower LAA emptying velocity at the orifice was associated with a larger discrepancy between orifice and apex velocities...|$|R

From the digitized images of the <b>Pulsed</b> <b>Doppler</b> spectra over time, the mean velocities have been computed with the software package developed by the authors. Moreover, to test the calibration procedure in effective conditions, we carried out performance test on five different ultrasound platforms, equipped with phased array and convex array probes with a nominal mean velocity of the blood mimicking fluid ranging from 1. 1 cm/s to 12. 7 cm/s. The pooled data showed an overestimation of the mean velocity, from over 200 % down to about 50 %, depending on nominal flow rate and ultrasound equipment.

The acceleration time of the flow velocity and ventricular systolic time intervals were measured on recordings obtained at {{the right and left}} ventricular outflow tract, and the patency of the ductus arteriosus was evaluated by the flow at the pulmonary end of the ductus. The flow velocity pattern of the right ventricular outflow tract changed from a triangular shape with a peak velocity in early systole in the younger age groups to a dome-like contour with a peak velocity in mid-systole; thus the ratio of mean acceleration time to right ventricular ejection time increased with age. The flow velocity pattern of the left ventricular outflow tract was triangular in all age groups, and the ratio of mean acceleration time to left ventricular ejection time showed no significant change with age. The right ventricular pre-ejection period shortened and the right ventricular ejection time lengthened with age; thus the ratio of mean right ventricular pre-ejection period to right ventricular ejection time decreased with age. The left ventricular systolic time intervals showed no significant change with age.
