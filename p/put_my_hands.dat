500|$|Parliament {{repealed}} the Townshend Acts in 1770. Washington {{regarded the}} passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774 as [...] "an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges". He told friend Bryan Fairfax, [...] "I think the Parliament of Great Britain has no more right to put their hands in my pocket without my consent than I have to <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> into yours for money." [...] He also said that Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny [...] "till custom and use shall make us as tame and abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway." ...|$|E
500|$|The parade scene took {{multiple}} days of filming; Broderick {{spent some}} time practicing the dance moves. [...] "I was very scared", Broderick said. [...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, I turned around and saw a river of people. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. I can understand how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{became aware}} of Tammy Wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths {{sometimes}} crossed after Wynette's first minor hit [...] "Apartment #9" [...] in 1966, which was written by Johnny Paycheck. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows at the time. The three became friends but eventually Jones {{took more than a}} passing fancy to Wynette, who was 11 years his junior and grew up listening to all of his records. According to his autobiography, Jones went to their house for supper and while she was fixing the meal Wynette and Chapel got into a heated exchange with Chapel calling his wife [...] "a son of a bitch." [...] Jones wrote: [...] "I felt rage fly all over me. I jumped from my chair, <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> under the dinner table, and flipped it over. Dishes, utensils, and glasses flew in all directions. [...] Don's and Tammy's eyes got about as big as the flying dinner plates." [...] Jones professed his love for Wynette on the spot and the couple were married in 1969.|$|E

60|$|At this I shipped my oars, {{and began}} to examine the boat. The bottom {{was covered with a}} movable floor of slats, and as I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> down I could feel the water welling up between the slats. The {{flooring}} was in sections, and lifting the one beneath me, I felt under it, and <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> into six or eight inches of water.|$|R

2500|$|Armstrong's first guitar was a Cherry Red Hohner acoustic, {{which his}} father bought for him. He {{received}} his first electric guitar, a Fernandes Stratocaster that he named [...] "Blue," [...] {{when he was}} ten year old. His mother got [...] "Blue" [...] from George Cole who taught Armstrong electric guitar for 10 years. Armstrong says in a 1995 MTV interview, [...] "Basically, it wasn't like guitar lessons because I never really learned how to read music. So he just {{taught me how to}} <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> on the thing." [...] Cole bought the guitar new from David Margen of the band Santana. Cole gave Armstrong a Bill Lawrence L500XL Humbucker pickup and told him to install the pickup in the bridge position. Armstrong switched the L500XL with a white Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker at Woodstock '94. After the Seymour Duncan was filled with mud and ruined in November 1994, Armstrong reinstalled the original Bill Lawrence pickup before recording Insomniac in 1995, and used {{it for a long time}} after that, although he has since switched to a black Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB. [...] "Armstrong fetishized his teacher's guitar, partly because the blue instrument had a sound quality and Van Halen-worthy fluidity he couldn't get from his little red Hohner. He prized it mostly, however, because of his relationship with Cole, another father figure after the death of Andy." [...] He toured with this guitar from the band's early days and still uses it to this day, Both middle and neck pickups are disconnected and the pickup selector locked in the bridge position. [...] "Blue" [...] also appears in a number of Green Day music videos such as [...] "Longview", [...] "Basket Case", [...] "Geek Stink Breath", [...] "Stuck with Me", [...] "Brain Stew/Jaded", [...] "Hitchin' a Ride", and most recently in [...] "Minority".|$|E
2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You and I would not have gone outside to get the newspaper on a day like that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was our regular punter and as we were ready to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. I just <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, you never got enough credit for that game.' It was so boring. I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E

60|$|The air hit me on {{the chest}} so that I gasped. I dropped the glass screw. I cried out, <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to my chest, and sat down. For a time I was in pain. Then I took deep breaths. At last I could rise and move about again.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the thought}} struck {{me to try}} a bit of deception. I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> in <b>my</b> pocket and drew out the empty envelope.|$|R

60|$|I <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> to {{the long}} red silk waist-cloth that was hanging out of the window, and we three pulled and pulled with all the {{strength}} at our command.

60|$|The emptiness! Ah, it {{was from}} that I shrank. I could have faced pain and anxiety and heartbreak undauntedly, but I could not face that terrible, yawning, barren emptiness.
