An example is the British World War II Fuze, Percussion, D.A., No. 233 ('direct action') The primary explosive transmits its detonation to an explosive booster within the fuze, then in turn to the main charge of the shell. As an artillery shell lands with a considerable impact, the [...] "soft" [...] nose may be made robust enough to be adequately safe for careful handling, without requiring any <b>protection</b> <b>cap</b> or safety mechanism. As a matter of normal practice though, fuzes and shells are transported separately and the fuze is only installed shortly prior to use. These simple contact fuzes are generally used for anti-tank shells, rather than high-explosive.|$|E

Initially serving in a {{training}} role, within the year, Puncher was re-tasked to both airstrike and convoy air <b>protection</b> (<b>CAP)</b> after her sister ship, Nabob, was decommissioned due to being torpedoed off Norway in August 1944. Punchers CAP service included protection of six different Arctic convoys on the Murmansk/Arkhangelsk route.

On 11 February, Punchers Wildcats formed part of the fighter escort for a minelaying airstrike along the western coast of Norway. The escort carrier's aircraft then provided fighter cover for a British minesweeping mission clearing German-laid mines along the Norwegian coast. On 24 March, Punchers aircraft took part in an airstrike {{in the area of}} Trondheim. A second strike was planned for 3 April but was cancelled due to bad weather. Following the surrender of Germany, Puncher was utilized as a troop transport, carrying Canadian soldiers back to Canada. Her hangar had bunks welded into them and was used in this role until the end of 1945.|$|E

40|$|Paper in French] This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the consequences for the French agricultural sector of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Health Check following the measures adopted in France in February 2009. The simulations, conducted with the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), show a shift of direct payments in favour of sheep and dairy farms, mainly those with a high proportion of grassland in their rotation. By contrast, crop farms and intensive cattle farms should lose. This new reform of the CAP will reduce the variability of single farm payment amounts among French farms; however, it will not modify in depth the current hierarchy of agricultural incomes which is also highly dependent on agricultural prices.

In conclusion, the mechanical cap-pull-off tests confirmed the results from self- and observer’s assessments, and importantdifferences between brands were observed. The pulloff forces correspond roughly to the force needed to hold a narrow-neck plastic flask containing 1 – 3 l of water by pinching the neck between a finger and thumb.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a Cloud {{empowered}} Cognitive Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (C 2 -ICIC) scheme for small cellular networks. The scheme leverages a recently proposed cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture for enabling intra-tier coordination and relaxes the need for inter-tier coordination by adopting the phantom cell architecture. Employing tools from stochastic geometry, we characterize the downlink success probability for a Mobile User (MU) scheduled under the proposed coordination scheme. It is shown that, compared to un-coordinated scheduling, significant performance gains can be realized in ultra dense small cell deployment scenarios under the proposed C 2 -ICIC scheme. This is attributed to the robust interference protection provisioned by the scheme. It is demonstrated that the gains are particularly large for the users experiencing a weak received signal strength. Indeed, for these users, the received signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can only be improved by reducing the experienced aggregate co-channel interference. The closed-form expression derived for the downlink success probability is employed to quantify the link level throughput under the proposed scheme. Finally, we briefly explore the design space of the C 2 -ICIC scheme in terms of interference <b>protection</b> <b>cap</b> which determines both the downlink throughput of the MU scheduled in the coordination mode and the transmission opportunity for the co-channel small cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} of an ancestral circular genome to multiple linear chromosomes was crucial for eukaryogenesis because it allowed rapid adaptive evolution through aneuploidy.

We also propose that both noncanonical structures based on guanine-guanine interactions and the end-protection proteins recruited by the emergent telomeric heterochromatin have been required for telomere maintenance through evolution. We further suggest that the origin of Drosophila telomeres may be reminiscent of how the first telomeres arose.

Est 1 's ability to convert single-stranded telomeric DNA into a G quadruplex was required for telomerase-mediated telomere protection function. Additionally, Est 1 maintained the integrity of telomeres by suppressing the recombination of subtelomeric Y′ elements.

40|$|The price {{provisions}} of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are designed to transfer income to European farmers and to maintain a secure supply of food for European consumers. The consequences of this policy for countries outside the European Community (EC) have become increasingly contentious now that the EC has passed the point of self sufficiency for many temperate zone food products {{and has become a}} major exporter, with the aid of export subsidies, to world markets. These consequences are of two kinds (a) <b>CAP</b> <b>protection</b> leads to lower prices on world markets for CAP products, though its effect on the prices of substitutes for CAP products (e g oilseeds) is less clear, (b) <b>CAP</b> <b>protection</b> increases the instability of world market prices. EC agricultural protection is usually seen as damaging to the interests of the less developed countries (Valdes and Zietz, 1980, Fitzpatnck, 1982), though more recently there is a growing realisation that many importing LDCs benefit from the availability of cheaper food supplies on the world market (Bale and Koester, 1984, Matthews, 1985).

50|$|The Eurasian otter {{declined}} {{across its}} {{range in the}} second half of the 20th century primarily due to pollution from pesticides such as organochlorine and polychlorinated biphenyls. Other threats included habitat loss and hunting, both legal and illegal. Eurasian otter populations are now recovering in many parts of Europe. In the United Kingdom, the number of sites with an otter presence increased by 55% between 1994 and 2002. In August, 2011, the Environment Agency announced that otters had returned to every county in England since vanishing from every county except the West Country and parts of Northern England. Recovery is partly due to a ban on the most harmful pesticides that has been in place across Europe since 1979, partly to improvements in water quality leading to increases in prey populations, and partly to direct legal protection under the European Union Habitats Directive and national legislation in several European countries.

40|$|How {{does the}} rising ‘regulatory welfare state’ address social policy {{concerns}} in pension markets? This study examines this question {{by comparing the}} regulatory responses to high charges paid by low-income workers in pension markets in the UK and Israel. In the UK, with the recognition that the market would not cater to low-income workers, the regulatory response {{was the creation of}} a publicly operated low-cost pension fund (NEST), a ‘public option’ within the market. This allowed low-income workers access to a low level of charges, previously reserved for high-income and organised workers. In Israel, regulation sought to empower consumers, while providing minimal social <b>protection</b> by <b>capping</b> pension charges at a relatively high level, thereby leaving most of the responsibility for reducing the charges with the individual saver. By comparing these two cases, the article develops an analytical framework {{for the study of the}} regulatory welfare state, making two contributions. First, it highlights different types of regulatory citizenship: minimal regulatory social protection as opposed to a more egalitarian approach. Second, it identifies an overlooked regulatory welfare state strategy: creating ‘public option’ arrangements, whereby a state-run (but not funded) service operates within the market...|$|R

50|$|Opposition to salary lenders was {{spearheaded by}} social elites, such as {{businessmen}} and charity organizations. Businessmen were encouraged not to fire employees who were indebted to loan sharks, as they unwittingly supported the industry by providing lenders with {{a means of}} blackmailing their customers ("pay up or we'll tell your boss and you'll be fired"). Charities provided legal support to troubled borrowers. This fight culminated in the drafting of the Uniform Small Loan Law, which brought into existence {{a new class of}} licensed lender. The law was enacted, first in several states in 1917, and was adopted by all but a handful of states {{by the middle of the}} 20th century.
