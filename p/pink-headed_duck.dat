50|$|In {{the huge}} Najafgarh jheel that existed here, {{a very rich}} wetland {{ecosystem}} flourished with rich local and migratory bird life; and in the surrounding lands {{there was plenty of}} local wildlife.

50|$|The male <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> is unmistakable when a {{good view}} is had. Both sexes are 41-43 cm and long-billed with long necks and peaked heads. The male has a pink bill, head and neck while the female has a pale pinkish head and neck with a paler bill. The black of the body extends as a narrow strip {{on the front of}} the neck. Wings have a leading white edge. In flight it would not {{contrast}} as much as the syntopic white-winged duck. Wing does not have the dark trailing edge of the red-crested pochard. Confusion with male red-crested pochards stems mainly from observations of swimming birds, as the latter species also has a conspicuous red head (although the color is actually very different from the <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck).</b> Spot-billed ducks, on the other hand, can look similar to female pink-headed ducks when in flight and seen from a distance, and if seen from behind, they could be mistaken for males too. The upper side of the wing is distinguishing, with dark green secondaries (speculum) and prominent white tertiaries in the spot-billed duck and a pinkish-beige speculum, much lighter than its surroundings, in the <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck.</b> If the upper part of the wings cannot be reliably seen, they are all but indistinguishable except to expert observers in good visibility conditions. Young birds had a nearly whitish head without a trace of pink and a mellow two note call wugh-ah has been attributed to the species.|$|E

50|$|This duck {{formerly}} {{occurred in}} eastern India, Bangladesh and northern Myanmar, {{but is now}} probably extinct. It was always rare, and the last confirmed sighting, by C. M. Inglis, was from Darbhanga in June 1935, with reports from India persisting until the early 1960s. These include reports from Monghyr and from near Simla. Sidney Dillon Ripley considered it likely extinct in 1950.In 1988, Rory Nugent, an American birder, and Shankar Barua of Delhi, reported spotting the elusive bird {{on the banks of}} the Brahmaputra. The pair started their quest for the bird at Saikhoa ghat on the north-eastern end of the river on the Indian side of the border. After 29 days of sailing, Nugent said that he saw the <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> amidst a flock of other waterbirds. However, Nugent and Barua's claimed sighting has not been widely accepted. Reports of pink-headed ducks after the 1960s have been received from the largely unexplored Mali Hka and Chindwin Myit drainages in Northern Myanmar. While the area is not very well surveyed by scientists, searches have been inconclusive and confusion with the red-crested pochard and the spot-billed duck has been a common source of supposed <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> sightings. A report on a survey in the Hu Kaung valley in November 2003 concluded that there is sufficient reason to believe that pink-headed ducks may still exist in Northern Myanmar's Kachin State, but a thorough survey of the Nat Kaung river between Kamaing and Shadusup in October 2005 failed to find this species; a number of interesting ducks were observed, but they turned out to be spot-billed ducks or white-winged ducks. Suggestions have been made that it may be nocturnal.|$|E
50|$|Three genera are {{included}} in the Aythyini. The marbled duck which makes up the monotypic genus Marmaronetta, however, seems very distinct and might have diverged prior to the split of dabbling and diving ducks as indicated by morphological and molecular characteristics. The probably extinct <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck,</b> previously treated separately in Rhodonessa, has been suggested to belong into Netta, but this approach has been questioned. DNA sequence analyses, which would probably resolve this question, have not been conducted to date for lack of suitable material. It might be an early divergence from the dabbling duck lineage. The molecular analysis also suggests that the white-winged duck should be placed into a monotypic genus Asarcornis which is fairly close to Aythya and might belong into this subfamily.|$|E
5000|$|Nugent {{was born}} in New York. After he {{graduated}} from Williams College in 1975, he went to sea aboard freighters and canvas-fliers. He sailed solo across the Atlantic Ocean four times. His fifth crossing ended prematurely when the catamaran he was sailing capsized; he was rescued five days later. In the mid-1980s, Nugent mounted solo expeditions {{in search of the}} <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> on the Brahmaputra River [...] and Mokele-mbembe in the Congo. He may have seen both, but his sightings remain unconfirmed. He wrote a non-fiction book about each expedition. Nugent changed gears in 1992 to become a foreign correspondent, first for Men's Journal and then as a staff member of Spin. He left journalism in 2002 and to work on his third book.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) was (or is) a large {{diving duck}} {{that was once}} found {{in parts of the}} Gangetic plains of India, Bangladesh and in the {{riverine}} swamps of Myanmar but feared extinct since the 1950s. Numerous searches have failed to provide any proof of continued existence. It has been suggested that it may exist in the inaccessible swamp regions of northern Myanmar and some sight reports from that region have led to its status being declared as [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] rather than extinct. The genus placement has been disputed and while some have suggested that it is close to the red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), others have placed it in a separate genus of its own. It is unique in the pink colouration of the head combined with a dark body. A prominent wing patch and the long slender neck are features shared with the common Indian spot-billed duck. The eggs have also been held as particularly peculiar in being nearly spherical.|$|E
50|$|Peter Gladstone (16 October 1928 - 25 July 2000) was a British naturalist and wildfowl expert. He was {{the great}} {{grandson}} of the Liberal prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, and brother of Sir William Gladstone, 7th Baronet. He grew up at Hawarden Castle in Wales, and attended Eton College, where his father, Charles Gladstone, was a housemaster. He served in the Palestine Police in 1946, {{towards the end of}} the British Mandate of Palestine. From 1949 to 1952 he studied biology at Christ Church, Oxford, and rowed for Oxford in the 1952 Boat Race. He went on to teach biology at Shrewsbury School until 1971, when he joined Sir Peter Scott's Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. Gladstone developed the trust's wildfowl reserve at Martin Mere in Lancashire. In the 1970s he took over the management of Fasque House, a family property in Aberdeenshire. In 1998 he journeyed to Tibet in an unsuccessful search for the <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck.</b> He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Gladstone died of a heart attack at the age of 71.|$|E
50|$|The {{reason for}} its {{disappearance}} was probably habitat destruction. It {{is not known}} why it was always considered rare, but the rarity {{is believed to be}} genuine (and not an artefact of insufficient fieldwork) as its erstwhile habitat was frequently scoured by hunters in Colonial times. The <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> was much sought after by hunters and later as an ornamental bird, mainly because of its unusual plumage. Like most diving ducks, it was not considered good eating, which should facilitate the survival of any remnant birds. The last specimen was shot in 1935 in Darbhanga, Bihar, India, by C. M. Inglis, who did not even know what he had killed, until his dog, a retriever, brought the bird to him. Some birds were also kept in the aviaries of Jean Théodore Delacour in Clères (France) and Alfred Ezra at Foxwarren Park (England) where the last known birds lived in captivity. The only known photographs of the species were taken here and include one of a pair taken around 1925 by David Seth-Smith.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> was {{described}} by John Latham in 1790 under the genus Anas. In describing the species, {{it is possible that}} he made of use of a painting in the collection of Lady Impey, wife of Sir Elijah Impey who was Chief Justice of court in Calcutta from 1774 to 1783. Mary Impey maintained a menagerie in Calcutta and commissioned Indian artists such as Bhawani Das from Patna to illustrate animals in the collection. The Impeys moved to England, and after the death of her husband, she sold these paintings at auction in 1810. Some of them were acquired by the 13th Earl of Derby.The genus Rhodonessa was originally created for this species alone. Jean Delacour and Ernst Mayr, in their 1945 revision of the family Anatidae considered it a somewhat abnormal member of the Anatini (or river-ducks) group because the hind toe is slightly lobed, display behaviour and the tendency to feed at the surface. The birds were observed in European aviaries and although they never bred, the males displayed often and this involved puffing the neck feathers, lowering the neck to rest on the back and then stretching up the neck while producing a wheezy whistle like a mallard. A study of its tracheal anatomy by Alfred Henry Garrod in 1875 suggested that it had a [...] "slight fusiform dilatation" [...] in the anterior syringeal region. The [...] "bulba ossea" [...] at {{the lower part of the}} male syrinx is peculiar in being swollen. The colour pattern has also been considered unique, lacking any of the metallic colours on the secondaries that are characteristic of the Anatini. The other unique feature being the somewhat large and nearly spherical shape of the eggs. All of these features supporting the retention of the species in a separate genus. Such mid-tracheal swellings were found only in Mergini and Aythyini and is extremely rare in the genus Anas. This tracheal bulla is rounded in Anas but angular with fenestrae in Netta and Aythya. Johnsgard considered Marmaronetta and Rhodonessa as intermediate in form. Based on the available morphological and behavioural evidence, especially the structure of the humerus and the structure of tracheal rings, Sidney Dillon Ripley suggested that it was undoubtedly in the Aythyini.|$|E

In addition to 15 species that are very similar in body proportions and diving adaptations, the apparently extinct <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> has anatomical characteristics that approach those of the pochards and it clearly should be included in this tribe. All of the typical pochards are adept at diving and possess large feet, with long outer toes and strongly lobed hind toes. Their legs are placed quite far apart and are situated farther back on the body than in other ducks, making the birds relatively awkward on land but improving their diving efficiency. They also have a heavier body size to wing-surface ratio, forcing them to run for some distance over the water when taking flight, in contrast to the 2 ̆ 2 springing 2 ̆ 2 takeoff of dabbling ducks. Although sexual dimorphism occurs to some extent in all species, male plumage patterns are generally not especially complex, and the wing speculum patterns are either lacking or limited to gray or white stripes. The females of pochards are usually rather uniformly brownish, and lack the very distinct patterning of female dabbling ducks. Nesting is usually done on land near water or, more commonly, in beds of emergent vegetation. The downy young tend to be weakly or obscurely patterned with shades of yellow and dark brown...|$|E
40|$|For {{most people}} {{interested}} in zoology the finding {{of a new and}} unknown species must rank among the most exciting of discoveries that they can hope to make.

40|$|The {{tribe of}} surface-feeding, or dabbling, ducks {{is the largest}} single tribe in the family. There are 40 species in the tribe as it is {{constituted}} here. Contrary to the arrangement of Delacour (1956), the ringed teal {{is included in the}} Cairinini; and the crested duck, included in the Tadornini by Delacour, is here considered a typical dabbling duck. In addition, the <b>pink-headed</b> <b>duck</b> has been removed from the Anatini and placed in the Aythyini with the pochards, and the freckled duck has been removed from the tribe and is considered a primitive species having anserine relationships. The marbled teal has been removed from the genus Anas and placed in a monotypic. genus which, I believe, provides an evolutionary link between the dabbling ducks and the pochards. The Anatini are world-wide in distribution and include the most numerous and widespread species of the family. Most species (and especially those of the shoveler group) forage on the water surface, gathering food from the surface by up-ending or 2 ̆ 2 tipping-up, 2 ̆ 2 or, more rarely, by diving. Most species open their wings when diving. A few species, such as the wigeon, graze, and nearly all species are predominantly vegetarians. Nearly all nest on the ground, but a few species nest in holes or crevices. The downy young are much like those of the perching ducks and are usually strongly marked with brown and white or with yellow. All species mature their first year, and pair bonds are generally renewed yearly. Most species exhibit sexual dimorphism in plumage, and metallic coloration is usually restricted to the head and speculum. The males of most sexually dimorphic species have a distinct eclipse plumage. Nearly all species have metallically colored wing specula. Males of all species studied to date except one have tracheal bullae which are ossified throughout; the marbled teal is the exception, and its bulla has numerous membranaceous fenestrae similar to those found in the pochard group...|$|E
