30|$|GCE {{consumers}} are well-defined consumer segments that exhibit similar demographic and socio-cultural characteristics; share similar needs, tastes, and lifestyles; converge across national borders (Douglas and Craig, 1997; Ramarapu et al., 1999); {{and are not}} limited in consumption activities by geographic location (Globerman et al., 2001). Fashion consumers {{use the power of}} technology to form distinctive consumer clusters which connect across local norms, values, and identities. While they may not always be characterized by the same tastes or values; cluster members participate in a shared conversation (Holt et al., 2004). For example, GCE consumers enjoy Pinterest, one of the largest social networking services in which users can create and manage theme-based image <b>Pinboards</b> such as fashion, home, arts and crafts, food, events, interests, and hobbies. They can share photos by “re-pinning” <b>Pinboards</b> with other users and following other users’ boards. Users also invite their friends to the Pinterest website which can be linked to a Facebook or Twitter profile so that Pinterest acts as a personalized media platform. Fashion retailers such as Gap, J. Crew, Ralph Lauren, Dillards and Nordstrom use Pinterest as an advertising platform to link their company to users with similar interests. Similarly, Polyvore is a social commerce website where users curate “sets” of products like fashion and home furnishing from a variety of online retailers and then share their creations with others. If consumers click on the products, they will get price and stock details and can directly access the site to make a purchase.|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{a number}} of social {{scientists}} have described significant changes in cultural practices and discourses around girls’ sexual development in the contemporary moment, there is almost complete silence {{on the question of}} widely reported changes in the physical and public health-related aspects of this seemingly ‘sped up’ development. This article addresses this deficit by critically exploring a range of technoscientific, biomedical, popular and environmentalist discourses describing such changes. Using science studies theorist John Law's device of the ‘pinboard’, I provide a map of the field of early puberty and elaborate areas of popular and expert concern, of controversy and debate, and of incoherence and confusion. Using the <b>pinboard's</b> facility for jarring juxtaposition and lateral connection, I raise critical questions about links between early puberty and other biomedical conditions and question the role of normative assumptions in the fiel...|$|R

The National Film Board of Canada did buy one of the <b>pinboards</b> built by them and, as guests of the NFB, on August 7, 1972, Alexeïeff and Parker demonstrated the pinscreen to a group of animators at the NFB. Due to Cecile Starr (friend of Alexeieff and Parker, and distributor of their work in the US) most insisting intervention talking to Norman McLaren that the opportunity should not be missed to preserve Alexeïeff's knowledge, this demonstration was filmed, and later released by the NFB as Pin Screen.

40|$|It’s a {{new world}} online, where {{consumers}} can publish their writing and gain a public presence, even a mass audience. This book links together blogging, writing reviews for Yelp, and creating <b>pinboards</b> for Pinterest, all of which provide ordinary people the opportunity to display their tastes to strangers. Edward McQuarrie shows how the operation of taste in consumption has been changed by the Internet and offers a fresh perspective on why websites like Yelp and Pinterest have become so successful. Drawing on Bourdieu and Campbell to support his thesis, Edward McQuarrie uncovers what is new online by:• presenting a sociological perspective on what consumers do online and contrasting it to more familiar economic, psychological and ethnographic views• reinterpreting Bourdieu’s idea of cultural capital to understand the success of fashion bloggers• showing how the meaning of taste {{and what it means}} to dress fashionably have changed with the Web• explaining why online reviews cannot be considered word-of-mouth and therefore cannot be understood using that idea• examining why Pinterest is so attractive to female consumers while relating Pinterest to Walter Benjamin’s ideas about how mechanical reproduction changes the meaning of art. This book will be valuable to students and scholars interested in consumer research, marketing, and sociology, specifically those who seek an alternative to purely psychological and economic explanations for what consumers do online.

40|$|Recent {{progresses}} {{and advances}} {{in the field of}} consumer electronics, driven by display technologies and also the sector of mobile, hand-held devices, enable new ways in presenting information to users, as well as new ways of user interaction, therefore providing a basis for user-centered applications and work environments. My thesis focuses on how arbitrary display environments can be utilized to improve both the user experience, regarding perception of information, and also to provide intuitive interaction possibilities. On the one hand advances in display technologies provide the basis for new ways of visualizing content and collaborative work, on the other hand forward-pressing developments in the consumer market, especially the market of smart phones, offer potential to enhance usability in terms of interaction and therefore can provide additional benefit for users. Tiled display setups, combining both large screen real estate and high resolution, provide new possibilities and chances to visualize large datasets and to facilitate col- laboration in front of a large screen area. Furthermore these display setups present several advantages over the traditional single-user-workspace environments: con- trary to single-user-workspaces, multiple users are able to explore a dataset displayed on a tiled display system, at the same time, thus allowing new forms of collabora- tive work. Based on that, face-to-face discussions are enabled, an additional value is added. Large displays also allow the utilization of the user’s spatial memory, al- lowing physical navigation without the need of switching between different windows to explore information. With Tiled++ I contributed a versatile approach to address the bezel problem. The bezel problem is one of the Top Ten research challenges in the research field of LCD- based tiled wall setups. By applying the Tiled++ approach a large high resolution Focus & Context screen is created, combining high resolution focus areas with low resolution context information, projected onto the bezel area. Additionally the field of user interaction poses an important challenge, especially regarding the utilization of large tiled displays, since traditional keyboard & mouse interaction devices reached their limits. My focus in this thesis is on Mobile HCI. Devices like mobile phones are utilized to interact with large displays, since they feature various interaction modalities and preserve user mobility. Large public displays, as a modernized form of traditional bulletin boards, also en- able new ways of handling information, displaying content, and user interaction. Utilized in hot spots, Digital Interactive Public <b>Pinboards</b> can provide an adequate answer to questions like how to approach pressing issues like disaster and crisis man- agement for both responders as well as citizens and also new ways of how to handle information flow (contribution & distribution & accession). My contribution to the research field of public display environments was the conception and implementa- tion of an easy-to-use and easy-to-set-up architecture to overcome shortcomings of current approaches and to cover the needs of aid personnel. Although being a niche, Virtual Reality (VR) environments can provide additional value for visualizing specific content. Disciplines like earth sciences & geology, me- chanical engineering, design, and architecture can benefit from VR environments. In order to consider the variety of users, I introduce a more intuitive and user friendly interaction metaphor, the ARC metaphor. Visualization challenges base on being able to cope with more and more complex datasets and {{to bridge the gap between}} comprehensibility and loss of information. Furthermore the visualization approach has to be reasonable, which is a crucial factor when working in interdisciplinary teams, where the standard of knowledge is diverse. Users have to be able to conceive the visualized content in a fast and reliable way. My contribution are visualization approaches in the field of supportive visualization. Finally, my work illuminates how the synthesis of visualization, interaction and dis- play technologies enhance the user experience. I promote a holistic view. The user is brought back into the focus of attention, provided with a tool-set to support him, without overextending the abilities of, for example, non-expert users, a crucial factor in the more and more interdisciplinary field of computer science...|$|R
