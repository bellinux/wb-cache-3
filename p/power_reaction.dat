We show that the microwave treatment gives comparable improve-ment in crystallinity of BFO nanocrystals with respect to tradi-tional hydrothermal processes while requiring significantly less time and energy.

In terms of reducing sugar yield, the four kinds of metal salt co-catalyst act in the order: ferrous sulfate > copper sulfate > sulfuric acid zinc sulfate > manganese sulfate.

Materials and Methods: The influence of MW <b>power,</b> <b>reaction</b> time, polyethylene glycol, zero-valent iron powder, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and water (H 2 O) were investigated on the dechlorination and destruction efficiency of PCBs in real-waste transformer oil under MW radiation. Results: The findings show that polyethylene glycol and NaOH have great influence on destruction of PCBs. However, iron (Fe) {{did not have any}} influence, and H 2 O decreased the destruction efficiency of PCBs. Moreover, experimental data showed that with optimum amount of variables [ie, polyethylene glycol (PEG) = 5. 4 g, NaOH = 1. 13 g, Fe = 0. 6 g, H 2 O = 0. 8 mL, and MW power of 800 W], more than 99. 9 % of PCBs were destructed at reaction time of 6 min.

As {{there are}} always certain defects on the final surface of {{large-scale}} lightweight mirrors, which are formed in traditional mechanical polishing process, such as microcracks, lattice disturbances, plastic deformation, and so on, an atmospheric pressure plasma polishing method is a good solution to this problem. As a key component, {{the design of the}} capacitance coupling atmospheric pressure radio-frequency plasma torch is introduced. The designed torch uses water cooled coaxial aluminium electrodes with special treatment to avoid arcing between them. In normal machining process, the mixture of reaction gas and plasma gas with optimum ratio is input into the plasma torch. Then, excited by radio-frequency <b>power,</b> <b>reaction</b> gas is ionized in the plasma so as to create high density and energy reactive radicals under atmospheric pressure. The radicals cause chemical reactions with the atoms on the part surface, which performs an effective atom-scale removal process. As the machining process is chemical in nature, this method avoids surface/subsurface defects mentioned above. Furthermore, initial experiment data analysis has proved that the atmospheric pressure plasma polishing method is effective and reliable, as well as demonstrates the validity of the designed plasma torch...|$|E

Etching process successfully used in anchor fabrication below 150 um deep in micro-inertial devices, is first used in deep-hole etching. The result is badly, the sidewall surface is coarse, and the sidewall perpendicularity is poor,the dimension difference between upper and down diameter is as large as 35 um. Because with the depth increasing, deep-hole etching brings new problem, such as fluorine(F) radical and ions distributing very differently between in down and upper area, also extracting reactant and temperature distribution.

The {{use of an}} isolated mother liquor obtained by separating the sol from a Na-Y aged sol-gel partially crystallized at 96 ∘C for 6 hours was determined to produce Na-Y coatings which adhered well to the metal substrates. A Na-Y coating was synthesized by crystallizing the isolated mother at 96 ∘C for 12 hours {{in the presence of}} a metal substrate. The thickness of these zeolite coatings could be varied between 1 μm to 0. 25 mm depending on the amount of isolated mother liquor used in the reaction. During crystallization, zeolite coatings were observed to grow on one side of the substrate due to gravitational effects. Both Na-Y and Na-A coatings can be synthesized.

This method represents a very rapid heating alternative to the conventional method that involves very long time of reactions (from 20 - 24 h in conventional heating to 5 - 8 min in microwave irradiation).

To assess reliability of the new testing device, subjects were tested on 3 separate occasions (T 1, T 2, and T 3). At least 72 hours but not more than 1 week separated each laboratory visit. During each testing session subjects per-formed a countermovement jump (CMJ), a 30 consecutive jumps anaerobic power test (30 JT), and reaction to both an auditory and visual stimulus. Results showed no differences between T 1, T 2, and T 3 in either CMJ height or 30 JT assess-ments. However, reaction to an audible or visual stimulus significantly improved during each testing session. Intraclass reliability of the CMJ and the 30 JT was greater than 0. 96 across the 3 trials. Pearson correlation coefficients of r. 0. 90 were seen for the CMJ and 30 JT, indicating a high test-retest reliability. The test-retest reliability for the reaction tests were lower (r ranging from 0. 72 to 0. 83). A Bland-Altman plot showed limited agreement between methods of vertical jump height assessment.
