5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosperity}} stimulated {{a building}} boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, {{with the building}} {{of some of the}} most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Barring Link's {{progress}} are creatures he must {{battle to}} locate the entrances to nine underground dungeons. Each dungeon is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, and guarded by monsters different from those found on the surface. Dungeons also contain useful items which Link can add to his arsenal, such as a boomerang for retrieving distant items and stunning enemies, and a recorder with magical properties. Link must successfully navigate through {{each of the first}} eight dungeons to obtain all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Once he has completed the artifact, he can enter the ninth dungeon to rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order of completing dungeons is somewhat left to the player, although they steadily increase in difficulty and some of them can only be reached or completed using items gained in a previous one. In addition, the entrances of the three highest-level dungeons are hidden. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game. For example, it is possible to reach the final boss of the game without ever receiving the first sword.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical <b>point,</b> <b>this</b> derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{was born}} in Missouri and trained for {{a career as a}} printworker. He moved to Montana because he wanted an {{adventure}} in the West, but ended up staying there for the remainder of his life. At first he worked as an itinerant printer, but after getting married he trained in medicine and became a physician. The idea was to have a more settled lifestyle, especially after his first daughter was born, but Marquis seemed to have a wanderlust, frequently changing location and often considering a change of career (he qualified as an attorney at one <b>point).</b> <b>This</b> became especially apparent after his military service in World War I and the failure of his marriage. These moves were always within Montana, and his final location was in Hardin on the Crow Reservation close to the Custer battle site. He founded a museum there that has now been incorporated into the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.|$|E
5|$|Molten salts will solidify on cooling {{to below}} their {{freezing}} <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> is sometimes {{used for the}} solid-state synthesis of complex ionic compounds from solid reactants, which are first melted together. In other cases, the solid reactants {{do not need to}} be melted, but instead can react through a solid-state reaction route. In this method the reactants are repeatedly finely ground into a paste, and then heated to a temperature where the ions in neighbouring reactants can diffuse together during the time the reactant mixture remains in the oven. Other synthetic routes use a solid precursor with the correct stoichiometric ratio of non-volatile ions, which is heated to drive off other species.|$|E

5|$|Viète {{began by}} solving the PPP case (three points) {{following}} {{the method of}} Euclid in his Elements. From this, he derived a lemma corresponding {{to the power of}} a point theorem, which he used to solve the LPP case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the LLL case (three lines) using the angle bisectors. He then derived a lemma for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle bisector that passes through a point, which he used to solve the LLP problem (two lines and a <b>point).</b> <b>This</b> accounts for the first four cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.|$|E
5|$|A National Army relief column {{including}} the detachments under Husher, Fleetwood and Devine assembled at Lurkers' Ridge {{during the morning}} of 12 February. Under the command of Captain Tony Clark, it flanked through the townships south of the Alamo, engaging ZIPRA guerrillas along the way, then turned north to relieve Dyck. The Elands led the way, with Devine himself standing upright in the turret {{of one of them}} with a machine gun. At one <b>point</b> <b>this</b> was shot out of his hands, prompting him to briefly stop the advance so he could jump down into the street to collect it. By the time the relief column reached the Alamo at 13:00, C Company had been pocketed for 16 hours. Four wounded 1RAR soldiers were evacuated, and Dyck left the building to point out targets for Devine's armoured cars. During the afternoon, A Company relieved D Company at Lurker's Ridge, and the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas withdrew into the townships and the surrounding country, sporadically exchanging fire. Devine was sent to Essexvale to engage the rest of ZIPRA's armoured battle group, which surrendered when he arrived; the T-34 tanks were later found by the Zimbabwe National Army to be nonfunctional. By the evening of 12 February, the rebellion was over.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles went on {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship against Samoa Joe at Turning <b>Point.</b> <b>This</b> defense was due to Styles accusing Joe of violating the unwritten X Division code. Styles then {{challenged}} Joe to a TNA X Division Championship match at Turning Point which Joe accepted on the November19 episode of Impact!. Joe defeated Styles at the show to become the new TNA X Division Champion. After the bout, Joe attempted to assault Styles {{in the same manner}} he did with Daniels until Daniels returned from injury to save Styles. This continued a rivalry between the three wrestlers as Joe {{went on to}} defend the title against Daniels at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January15, 2006, which Joe won to retain the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in a Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again, but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March12, 2006. Daniels won the bout, thus becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April13, 2006 episode of Impact! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship.|$|E

5|$|All these {{achievements}} were {{a prelude}} to the 1927 Wimbledon Championships where in successive rounds Cochet defeated two leading Americans Frank Hunter and Bill Tilden and finally Jean Borotra in remarkable five set matches, {{all of whom had}} a two-sets advantage against him. Tilden served for the match, leading 5–1 in the third set and had a match ball. In the final Borotra left six match points unconverted to open the route for Cochet's revival. With the latter one Cochet set a Wimbledon final comeback record that stands up to this day. He then again met Hunter and Tilden in the final of the doubles, this time he joining forces with Jacques Brugnon and lost the championship despite having a match <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> was the first of three consecutive encounters between the French and American teams as in early September the 1927 Davis Cup final took place in the United States where the US Davis Cup team led by Tilden and Hunter faced the challenging team of the Musketeers. France won 3–2 with Cochet victorious in the decider against Bill Johnston and reclaiming the Davis Cup for France the first time since 1920. A couple of days later the French troupe went to compete in the U.S. National Championships at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. Cochet and Eileen Bennett became the mixed doubles champions. When he returned home {{in the first week of}} October Cochet took revenge on Christian Boussus in their second meeting in the final of the Coupe Porée of Paris. The same week he was ranked third in the world for the second consecutive year although this time he finished ahead of compatriot Borotra. In November he won the Swiss Covered Courts Internationals in a short twenty-five-minute final against Donald Greig.|$|E
5|$|In 1769, Pulaski's {{unit was}} again besieged by numerically {{superior}} forces, {{this time in}} the old fortress of Okopy Świętej Trójcy, which has served as his base of operations since December the previous year. However, after a staunch defense, he was able to break the Russian siege. On April 7, he was made the regimentarz of the Kraków Voivodeship. In May and June he operated near Przemyśl, but failed to take the town. Criticized by some of his fellow Confederates, Pulaski departed to Lithuania with his allies and a force of about 600 men on June 3. There, Pulaski attempted to incite a larger revolt against Russia; despite no decisive military successes, he was able to assemble a 4,000-strong army and deliver it back to a Confederate staging <b>point.</b> <b>This</b> excursion received international notice and gained him a reputation as the most effective military leader in the Bar Confederation. Next, he moved with his unit towards Zamość and — after nearly losing his life to the inferior forces of the future Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov in the disastrous battle of Orekhowa — on the very next day, September 15, he was again defeated at the Battle of Włodawa with his forces almost completely dispelled. He {{spent the rest of the}} year rebuilding his unit in the region of Podkarpacie.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the doubts {{highlighted}} {{in relation to the}} construction of a synagogue, the Perushim, confidently in possession of the ambiguous firman, began clearing away the rubble from the Ruin courtyard in September 1836. As the foundations of he-Hasid's original synagogue were revealed, they discovered a few old documents dating from 1579, signed by Israel ben Moses Najara. After much debate, they decided not to rebuild the Ruin, but initially erect a small structure {{on the edge of the}} Ashkenasic compound. The Arab creditors, however, still refused to relinquish the claims they had on the Jews and continued to interfere with the works. Zoref, claiming that the Ashkenazim currently in Jerusalem were not related in any way to those who had borrowed the money at the turn of the 18th century, was forced to appear in court requesting a further ruling cancelling the debts. He mentioned that an injunction had already been passed that absolved the Ashkenazim from repaying the debt and maintained that the Turkish Statute of Limitations cancelled out the debts of Judah heHasid's followers. Although the court ruled in the Ashkenazim's favour, Zoref nevertheless had to appease the Arab instigators with annual bribes in order to allow building to continue. At some <b>point</b> <b>this</b> arrangement ceased and in 1851, he was struck on the head with a sword and died of his wounds three months later. By January 1837 however, the Perushim had dedicated the modest Menachem Zion Synagogue in the northwestern corner of the courtyard. In 1854, a second smaller synagogue was built within the compound. The actual plot upon which he-Hasid's synagogue had stood 130 years earlier, however, remained in ruins.|$|E
