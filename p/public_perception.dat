5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. <b>Public</b> <b>perception</b> of bears is often positive, as people {{identify}} with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E

40|$|Anti-social {{behaviour}} (ASB) {{has emerged}} as a major community safety concern over the past decade. Reducing the number of incidents of ASB and lessening the impact these have upon the publics’ quality of life have become key components of criminal justice policy. The British Crime Survey has provided evidence of the types of ASB being experienced and quantified the proportion of people perceiving high levels of ASB in their local area. This research suggests strong links between high levels of deprivation and perceiving high levels of ASB. Attempts have also been made to determine what factors drive these perceptions, in order to produce evidence-based ASB reduction policies. This thesis builds upon existing research into <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of ASB by exploring <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> in-depth, using a mixed methods strategy. A three phase, explanatory sequential design was employed. Phase one quantified <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> in selected hardpressed ACORN areas. These findings were utilised to inform the topics for further qualitative elaboration in phase two. The third phase qualitatively explored how practitioners address <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of ASB. Inferences were generated from all three phases of data collection, providing a holistic, coherent and contextualised discussion of potential policy implications of the findings. The findings presented within this thesis uncover new attitudinal based factors that are statistically and independently associated with <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of ASB. In addition, primary and secondary drivers of <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> were qualitatively identified in the hardpressed areas studied. New insight has also been provided into the methods practitioners use to address <b>public</b> <b>perceptions,</b> particularly into the difficulties associated with measuring perceptions and the reciprocal relationship that exists between practitioners and the public. The inferences generated suggest that <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of ASB are complex, with the factors influencing perceptions often interconnected. This thesis calls for greater strategic clarification regarding the role perceptions play in ASB policy, in order for accurate, locally applicable perception measurement to be achieved and a reduction in perceived high levels of ASB to be obtained.

In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters.

5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and engine breakdowns were recurring and appeared across the entire class. These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor <b>public</b> <b>perception.</b> This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|E

The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible.

However, due to negative <b>public</b> <b>perception</b> regarding the existing papers they decided to create a new one. In order to ensure credibility, the two agreed to convince a group of competing newspapers (the Golkar-backed Suara Karya, the Catholic-owned Kompas, the Protestant-owned Sinar Harapan, and the weekly Tempo) to back the nascent paper. It was hoped to become a quality English-language paper, similar to The Straits Times in Singapore, the Bangkok Post in Thailand, and the New Straits Times in Malaysia.|$|E

Identifying how to engage society in this shift is an ongoing debate. This includes strengthening the positive connections between society and the sea. This study uses a survey (n¼ 1047) to investigate UK <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of subtidal species and marine health to assess whether {{it is possible to}} build more positive connections between society and the sea. Respondents showed considerable interest in traditionally charismatic species (puffins, seals and seahorses) although many respondents thought these species did not live in UK seas. Gender and experience of marine environments influenced <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of species. <b>Public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of marine health showed issues such as litter to be considered as the greatest indicator of poor health. Ecological concepts of habitat integrity and biodiversity were also rated as important to marine health. Social values were found to influence <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of marine health. The results show that perceptions are far from uniform across the population, and such diversity of perceptions is likely impact upon methods to catalyse societal engagement with marine conservation. These findings reinforce previous research on <b>public</b> <b>perceptions</b> of UK seas, and identify opportunities for building positive connections between society and the sea. Research priorities to further the debate of engaging society with the sea are identified...|$|R
