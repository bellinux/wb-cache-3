5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} hummingbirds occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{the first}} comet where the noble gas argon was detected. Noble gases are {{chemically}} inert and highly volatile, and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, {{they can be used}} for <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40K, but has at some point been warmer than 20K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.|$|E

40|$|We report {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{of the effect}} of <b>the</b> photoisomerization of <b>probe</b> molecules on <b>the</b> nonequilibrium dynamics of a bulk amorphous matrix. Is it the matrix or <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> that drives <b>the</b> dynamics in SRG formation? In the first picture, <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> isomerization induces <b>the</b> motion of <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> inside <b>the</b> matrix. The motion of <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> then induces molecular motions inside the matrix. In the second picture, <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> isomerization induces a modification of the matrix diffusion mechanism. The diffusion of the matrix then induces the motion of <b>the</b> embedded <b>probe.</b> To answer this question, we compare the motion of <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> molecules and <b>the</b> motion of the matrix molecules in various thermodynamic conditions. We show that when the isomerization is switched on, the matrix molecules surrounding <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> move faster than <b>the</b> <b>probe.</b> Around <b>the</b> <b>probe,</b> <b>the</b> structural relaxation time of the matrix molecules is shorter than <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> relaxation time and the diffusion of the matrix molecules is larger than <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> diffusion. These results show that the matrix motions drive the dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} estimating current and voltage distributions by scanning with a <b>probe.</b> <b>The</b> method {{takes advantage of the}} phenomenon that the coupling between the current and <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> varies with <b>the</b> direction of <b>the</b> <b>probe.</b> <b>The</b> current and voltage are estimated by calculating <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> vector output for each of four directions. Both the current and voltage vector distributions can thus be estimated at the same time by using a single <b>probe.</b> <b>The</b> estimated distributions in a digital IC package and a microstrip line showed that this method produces reliable results. The simple structure of <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> should make it easy to reduce its size...|$|R
5|$|Interest in copernicium's {{chemistry}} was {{sparked by}} predictions {{that it would}} have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of period7 and group12, and indeed among all 118 known elements. Copernicium has the ground state electron configuration 5f146d107s2 and thus should belong to group12 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons, copernicium shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between millipedes and centipedes {{are a common}} question from the general public. Both groups of myriapods share similarities, such as long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, {{a single pair of}} antennae, and the presence of postanntennal organs, but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories, as the most recent common ancestor of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in the Silurian. The head alone exemplifies the differences; millipedes have short, elbowed antennae for <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> substrate, a pair of robust mandibles and a single pair of maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a pair of small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a pair of large poison claws.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chemical}} {{experiments on}} copernicium were conducted using the 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn reaction. Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half-life of 5minutes. Analysis {{of the data}} indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties. However, the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium-283 has cast some doubt on these experimental results. Given this uncertainty, between April–May 2006 at the JINR, a FLNR–PSI team conducted experiments <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl. In this experiment, two atoms of copernicium-283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties indicated that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury, due to formation of a weak metal-metal bond with gold, placing it firmly in group 12.|$|E
50|$|In single-molecule {{fluorescence}} {{resonance energy}} transfer, the molecule is labeled in (at least) two places. A laser beam {{is focused on}} the molecule exciting <b>the</b> first <b>probe.</b> When this probe relaxes and emits a photon, it has a chance of exciting <b>the</b> other <b>probe.</b> <b>The</b> efficiency of the absorption of the photon emitted from <b>the</b> first <b>probe</b> in <b>the</b> second <b>probe</b> depends on <b>the</b> distance between these <b>probes.</b> Since <b>the</b> distance changes with time, this experiment <b>probes</b> <b>the</b> internal dynamics of the molecule.|$|R

5|$|Foraging {{takes place}} {{mostly on the}} ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. Landfill sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> soil, and occasionally, digging. Flies around cow pats are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by {{dropping}} vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. Earthworms are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking ticks as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{casualties}} on Hill 205 rendered the company ineffective, {{and for several}} weeks it was only capable of being used to conduct routine patrols or as a security force for divisional headquarters elements. Puckett was evacuated to recover from his wounds. On 5 December, Captain John P. Vann assumed command of the company, and Captain Bob Sigholtz, a veteran of Merrill's Marauders, was also assigned to the unit. Yet with the company's casualties being replaced by regular soldiers who had no Ranger training it {{did not return to}} full combat capability after the Hill 205 battle. The replacements were subsequently given cursory training between missions, but U.S. military historians contend that the inexperienced replacements dramatically decreased the usefulness of the company as a special forces unit. The company participated in a few isolated missions in late 1950 and early 1951, including the recapture of Ganghwa Island from Chinese forces while attached to the Turkish Brigade. It advanced with the 25th Division during Operation Killer in late February {{as part of an effort}} to push Chinese forces north of the Han River. During that operation the company was employed as a scouting force, <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> strength of Chinese formations as they launched raids and attacks on the 25th Infantry Division. The frequent scouting missions were also intended to draw Chinese fire and determine the locations of their units.|$|E
5|$|Just {{days before}} his death, Walker had tried to bolster the defences of the central and eastern {{sections}} of the 38th parallel by stretching the South Korean forces from Chuncheon to the Korean east coast. Following his instructions, the ROK III Corps was placed around Chuncheon while the ROK I Corps was deployed on the east coast. Meanwhile, the ROK II Corps, with its strength reduced to a single infantry division {{in the aftermath of}} the Ch'ongch'on River battle, filled the gap between the ROK I and III Corps. However, with the absence of the US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were gaps between the understrength South Korean units. Because the South Korean forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950, most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training, and out of the four South Korean divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy. Taking advantage of the situation, the North Korean forces had been <b>probing</b> <b>the</b> South Korean lines since mid-December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts. On December 27, 1950, the KPA II Corps managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK 9th Infantry Division on the ROK I Corps' left flank at Hyon-ri. This development threatened to destabilize the entire UN eastern front.|$|E

50|$|Oligomer Restriction (abbreviated OR) is a {{procedure}} to detect an altered DNA sequence in a genome.
