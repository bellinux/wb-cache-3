Monoclonal antibody and monospecific antiserum to an immunodominant trichomonad surface glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 267, 000 (267 K glycoprotein) were used to evaluate fresh isolates (JHH and RU 375) and long-term grown isolates (NYH 286, IR 78, and JH 31 A) of T. vaginalis. Isolates NYH 286, JH 31 A, and JHH were made up of heterogeneous staining (positive [pos] phenotype) and nonstaining (negative [neg] phenotype) populations of trichomonads, whereas RU 375 and IR 78 were all neg phenotype parasites. Flow cytofluorometric patterns of agar clones derived from single organisms of heterogeneous isolates such as NYH 286 showed populations which were either homogeneous <b>pos</b> <b>or</b> <b>neg</b> and also showed clones which were heterogeneous in nature containing both phenotypes. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was also accomplished, and subpopulations of defined <b>pos</b> <b>or</b> <b>neg</b> phenotype were purified. Flow cytofluorometry evaluation of all isolates {{for an extended period}} revealed a phenotypic variation among all heterogeneous isolates and also for all clones and subpopulations derived from the heterogeneous isolates. On the other hand, IR 78 and RU 375 did not undergo phenotypic variation and have remained neg for greater than 4 years. Parasites which were nonreactive with either monoclonal antibody or monospecific antiserum to the 267 K glycoprotein in flow cytofluorometry did not possess the antigen on their surface. This was determined by radioimmunoprecipitation assays using extracts of iodinated trichomonads. Finally, neg phenotype parasites yielded enhanced rates of contact-dependent cytotoxicity of host cell monolayers as compared with the pos phenotype trichomonads...|$|E

40|$|Possible {{influences}} of donor (D) /recipient (R) HLA-DR antigen disparities on graft survival were studied in 310 renal cadaver transplantations performed at one center from January 1980 to July 1988. For each DR 1 to DR 7 specificity, four combinations were considered {{according to the}} presence (<b>pos)</b> <b>or</b> the absence (<b>neg)</b> of the antigen in the D and in the R. Logistic regression analysis was used to study graft survival during two postoperative periods: A (month 1 to 3) and B (month 4 to 24). The following combinations exerted a beneficial effect on survival: DR 5 and DR 7 Dpos/Rneg for period A, DR 4 Dpos/Rneg and DR 5 Dneg/Rpos for period B. In contrast, the following combinations appeared detrimental: DRw 6 and DR 7 Dneg/Rpos for period A, DR 1 and DR 2 Dpos/Rneg, DR 2 and DRw 6 Dneg/Rpos for period B. Graft survival at 2 years was similar (83 %) in HLA-DR-identical pairs and in recipients with beneficial and no detrimental HLA-DR disparities, contrasting with poorer outcome in patients with either mixed beneficial and detrimental HLA-DR disparities (67 %) or detrimental (and no beneficial) HLA-DR disparities (55 %). The use of relevant D/R HLA-DR disparities for predicting graft outcome could yield results similar to those currently reported with the best HLA-DR-matched pairs, thus providing an alternative for recipient selection in cadaver kidney transplantation.

For in depth investigation ofT-cells following Melan-A/MART- 1 peptide vaccination in melanoma patients,we conducted a detailed prospectivestudy at the single cell level. We first sorted individual human naiveand effector CD 8 T-cells from peripheralblood by flow cytometry, andtested a modified RT-PCR protocolincluding a global amplification ofexpressed mRNAs to obtain sufficientcDNAfromsingle cells. We successfullydetected the expression ofseveral specific genes of interest evendown to 106 -fold dilution (equivalentto 10 - 5 cell).

To elucidate the hallmarksof effective immunity the genesignatures were {{defined by a}} panel ofgenes related to effector functions(e. g.

Usingthis novel single cell analysis approach,we observed that T-cell differentiationis clonotype dependent,with a progressive restriction in TCRBV clonotype diversity from EMCD 28 pos to EMCD 28 neg subsets. However,the effector function gene imprintingis clonotype-independent,but dependent on differentiation,since it correlates with the subset oforigin (EMCD 28 <b>pos</b> <b>or</b> EMCD 28 <b>neg).</b> We also conducted a detailedcomparative analysis after vaccinationwith natural vs. analog Melan-Apeptide.

Combination of pyrosequencing, PCR-DGGE and qPCR analyses of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed that POS decreased microbial diversity and richness of caecal microbiota whereas it increased Bifidobacterium spp., Roseburia spp. and Bacteroides spp. (affecting specifically B. dorei) to a higher extent than INU. INU supplementation increased the portal SCFA propionate and butyrate, and decreased cancer cell invasion in the liver. POS treatment did not affect hepatic cancer cell invasion, but was more efficient than INU to decrease the metabolic alterations. Indeed, POS better than INU delayed anorexia linked to cancer progression. In addition, POS treatment increased acetate in the caecal content, changed the fatty acid profile inside adipose tissue and counteracted the induction of markers controlling β-oxidation, thereby hampering fat mass loss.

To appreciate the eventual advantage of such combinations, infected mice were treated for short durations (non-curative) of each individual treatment. Cure rates were determined by investigating blood parasites (microscopic examination) and parasite DNA (quantitative PCR) after submitting treated mice to immune suppression with cyclophosphamide. The results mainly suggest that shorter durations of treatment combining BZL and <b>POS</b> <b>or</b> NFX might cure mice acutely or chronically infected with the Tulahuen strain, whereas the combination of BZL with AMB does not have such an effect. Moreover, the association BZL+POS does not improve the curative effect of POS (all used for shorter durations) in infection with the Y strain. Shortening the duration of treatment whilst keeping a complete curative effect deserves interest in limiting adverse reactions due to dose-cumulative toxic effects of long treatment. Genotyping of the T. cruzi strain(s) infecting patients might also allow a better adaptation of individual therapeutic schedules, improving both the efficiency and safety of trypanocidal treatment.
