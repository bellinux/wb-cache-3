Microscopic count of cells showed that Acanthamoeba trophozoites and cysts adhered to all types of contact lenses. A significantly greater adherence of trophozoites than cysts was recorded.

40|$|Jean-Pierre Martinon : The {{representation}} of the forbidden and {{the literature of the}} unhealthy. This article discusses the links between the description of places in certain 18 th-century literary texts, and the opposition between the healthy and the unhealthy. This is to be seen both in the actions of the characters and in the descriptions of imaginary places impregnated with contradictory connotations, not only in connection with mental and <b>physical</b> <b>hygiene,</b> but also with sexuality. In particular, texts in the Nouvelle Hèloïse concerning «natural » gardens represent physical and moral health in sentimental and sexual relations with others. In the works of Sade, on the contrary, cellars, vaulted rooms, labyrinths, oozing water, shadows, indicate the unhealthy side of erotic relations. This analysis must be accompanied by methodological reflection on the literary text as {{representation of}} the dichotomy clean /unclean, healthy/sick, mind/body. Martinon Jean-Pierre.

40|$|We {{monitored}} the surface level cleanliness of a five-bedded surgical {{intensive care unit}} (SICU) over a ten-week period in order to evaluate proposed hygiene standards. Ten environmental sites within SICU were sampled twice weekly along with collection of clinical and patient activity data. The standards designate aerobic colony counts (ACCs) > 2. 5 cfu/cm 2 from hand-touch sites {{and the presence of}} Staphylococcus aureus as <b>hygiene</b> <b>failures.</b> Nearly a quarter of 200 samples failed the standards, mostly from hand-touch sites on curtains, beds and medical equipment. The total number of fails each week was associated with bed occupancy (p= 0. 04), trending towards association with SICU-acquired infections (p= 0. 11). Environmental S. aureus was associated with the proportion of beds occupied (p = 0. 02). Indistinguishable genotypes were found between patient and environmental staphylococci, with timescales supporting staphylococcal transmission in both directions. Hygiene standards based on microbial growth levels and the presence of S. aureus reflect patient activity and provide a means to risk manage infection. They also exposed a staphylococcal reservoir that could represent a more tangible risk to patients. Standards for surface level cleanliness deserve further evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Hospital-acquired {{infections are}} {{a serious problem}} and can {{be a threat to}} patient safety. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the {{thoughts}} and experiences of critical care nurses in regard to hospital-acquired infections and patient safety. This study uses a qualitative design based on focus group interviews. Inclusion criteria for the focus group panels were the following: nurses with advanced training in anesthesiology, intensive care or operating room nurses. The findings show that respect for hygiene protocols becomes reduced over time and this affects patient safety. A busy and stressful work environment can also be a problem when having to adhere to these protocols. They also pointed out the consequences of poor role models in that it was everyone’s responsibility to adhere to hygiene protocols. Finally, the more experienced nurses had often not up-dated their education. In conclusion, critical care nurses have experienced that hospital-acquired infections and a decrease in patient safety can be result of poor hand <b>hygiene,</b> <b>failure</b> to comply with established protocols, poor role models and a busy and stressful environment. Thoughts and experiences of critical care nurses should be considered in clinical practices in order to reduce hospital-acquired infections and preserve patient safety...|$|R

The results were analysed using hygiene standards, which specify 1) an {{aerobic colony count}} (ACC) > 2. 5 cfu/cm 2, and 2) presence of coagulase-positive staphylococci, as <b>hygiene</b> <b>failures.</b> Sites most often failing the standards were beds and hoist (64 %: 33 of 52 weeks), bedside lockers (62 %: 32 of 52) and overbed tables (44 %: 23 of 52). Methicillin-susceptible/resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA/MRSA) were more often recovered from lockers, overbed tables and beds. Recovery of MSSA/MRSA at any site {{was significantly associated with}} an ACC> 2. 5 cfu/cm 2 from that site (p= 0. 001; OR: 3. 35 (95 % CI 1. 79, 6. 28)).

To this end, 156 samples of sausages were taken in various shopping sites during one year from March 2014 to February 2015. The microbiological analysis was carried out using the specific medium for isolation and identification of C. perfringens. ANOVA test was used for Statistical analysis (p< 0. 05). The results of this study showed the presence of C. perfringens in 77. 56 % (121 of 156) samples, with 88. 88 % (32 of 36) in street vendors, 79. 16 % (19 of 24) in a weekly market, 70. 83 % (51 of 72) in butchery and 62. 5 % (15 of 24) in a supermarket. The average rate was 2. 42 Log CFU/g, with a minimum value of 0 CFU/g recorded in several outlets and a maximum value of 6. 05 Log CFU/g recorded in butchery.

40|$|In Search of Purity: Eugenics and Racial Uplift among New Negroes, 1915 – 1935 ” {{examines}} the reinterpretation of eugenic theories by Black scholars, who helped integrate the science into a social movement for racial uplift. Areas of analyses include: The Talented Tenth, links between ideas about social degeneracy and <b>physical</b> <b>hygiene,</b> eugenics courses and professors at Howard University, hereditarian, and colorism. Guiding principles of African American-led eugenic theory are examined alongside the fading {{imagery of the}} Old Negro that consisted of stereotypes scattered throughout plantation fiction, blackface minstrelsy, vaudeville, and Darwinism. Specifically, terms like germ plasm (negative characteristics transmitted through genes through continual selection, unchanged, {{from one generation to}} the next), and racial hygiene (a public health platform designed to eliminate, among other ailments, venereal disease and promote healthy reproduction within a race) are analyzed in their relation to popular discourses about Black cleanliness that included “moral fitness” and intellectual ineptness. Ideologies that intrinsically tied blackness to social degeneracy and criminality, as well as terms like full-blood and mulatto, are also examined. Links between standards of beauty, desirability, and marriage-worthiness in relation to those ideas are also critiqued.

Most of the information in {{this section of the}} submission has been obtained from reports to the Melbourne City Council Health Committee from 1913 to 1980. A study of these reports show that there were four distinct periods: 1.

The history of this period is reviewed under the heading "Keep the Well Baby Well".

From the mid thirties {{to the end of the}} 1940 's when the main concern was with mental hygiene and Melbourne City Council was the leading municipality in establishing kindergartens.

Methods: We conducted an online survey involving a fixed choice Likert-type scale with 19 items and an open question to solicit more detailed information with a national sample of student nurses in the United Kingdom.
