However, there has been paucity of data on the prognosis of LV lead. Consecutive 32 patients with LV lead for CRT (n= 22) or pacemaker (n= 10) were subjected. Serial changes in pacing threshold and impedance along with lead-related complications were evaluated. Over 2 yr follow-up, {{there was no significant}} change in relative threshold voltage to the initial value (100 %, 110 %, 89. 6 %, and 79. 6 % at baseline, 1, 6, and 24 months respectively, P= 0. 62) as well as lead impedance (816 ± 272, 650 ± 178, 647 ± 191, and 590 ± 185 ohm at baseline, 1, 6, and 24 months respectively, P= 0. 80). The threshold change was not affected by lead position, lead <b>polarity,</b> and <b>indication</b> of lead implantation. The cumulative rates of lead revision were 6. 3 % (n= 2) and 9. 4 % (n= 3) in 6 month and 2 yr follow-up, respectively. One case of phrenic nerve capture at left lateral decubitus position was detected 1 month after the implantation. However, there were no serious complications over 2 yr period.

40|$|Reviews of {{clinical}} practice for paediatric pacemaker implantation and follow-up {{are necessary to}} provide an evidence-base for future policy and practice in this field. Epicardial pacing data available through Green Lane Hospital, New Zealand's (NZ) primary referral centre for paediatric cardiac surgery and pacemaker implantation, was reviewed with the following aims: Assessment of pacemaker lead performance over time {{in relation to the}} type of epicardial lead implanted - steroid-eluting (SE) and non steroid-eluting (NSE). Determination of the survival rate of epicardial leads. Identifying factors predicting or associated with lead failure. A database of pacing and sensing thresholds and lead impedance data at implant, 2, 6 and 18 weeks and 6 monthly intervals thereafter, was compiled and the prevalence and timing of complications in relation to lead type, location and implant route determined. In total 192 leads (155 SE, 37 NSE) were implanted in 96 patients (52 male) aged 3 days to 71 years (y) (median 1. 7 y), 74 patients were < 17 years of age at implant. Congenital heart defects were present in 82 % of patients. Follow-up (f/u) was possible for 180 leads. Mean f/u duration for the 150 SE leads was 3. 1 y (2 weeks - 8. 8 y) and for the 30 NSE leads was 4. 5 y (2 weeks - 27 y). SE and NSE pacing thresholds were similar at implant. NSE pacing thresholds peaked at 6 weeks post implant and remained significantly higher than SE leads throughout f/u in surviving leads, although the difference was small at 2 and 4 y. SE and NSE leads had similar ventricular sensing thresholds and lead impedances throughout the study period. Survival at 5 years for all leads was 61 % (66 % for SE leads and 41 % for NSE leads). Primary causes of failure in the leads receiving f/u were exit block and lead fracture. The occurrence of exit block was significantly higher (p< 0. 0001) in NSE leads (57 %) compared to SE leads (5 %). Lead fracture occurred in 15 % of leads with the highest fracture rate at 2 - 3 y post implant. Patient age and weight at implant, gender, previous cardiac surgery, lead <b>polarity,</b> <b>indication</b> for pacing and implant route were not predictors of lead failure. NSE leads were 6 times more likely to fail compared to SE leads (p < 0. 0001). The main study findings were: SE leads maintain lower pacing thresholds and a reduced incidence of exit block compared to NSE leads. It is therefore recommended that SE leads be developed which can penetrate fibrosed, scarred or fatty epicardial surfaces. Where SE lead use is contraindicated, alternative surgical techniques for SE lead placement should be attempted rather than implanting NSE leads. Lead fracture is a significant complication of epicardial pacing in paediatric patients. Using stronger bipolar leads implanted by the subxiphoid route may reduce the risk of fracture. Medium term survival (5 y) of SE epicardial leads is acceptable and therefore the continued use of these leads is recommended, particularly in young patients, allowing their veins to be saved for transvenous leads later in their life...|$|R
40|$|Indications {{for extra}} {{corporeal}} membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after pediatric cardiac surgery have been increasing despite {{the absence of}} encouraging survival statistics. Modification of ECMO circuit {{led to the development of}} integrated ECMO cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit at the author&#x 2032;s institute, for children undergoing repair of transposition of great arteries among other congenital heart diseases (CHD).

The outcome was analyzed with reference to the timing of intervention, use of integrated ECMO-CPB <b>circuit,</b> <b>indication</b> for ECMO support, duration of ECMO run and the underlying CHD. The results reveal a significantly improved survival rate with the use of integrated ECMO-CPB circuit and early time of intervention rather than using ECMO as a last resort in the management.

40|$|In {{everywhere}} {{at level}} crossing between railroad and highway {{there are so}} many railway accidents happening due to the carelessness in manual operations or lack of workers. So, this paper describes the automatic railway gate control system using PIC microcontroller for saving precious human lives and preventing major disasters in railway track. Railway gate may be saved for the road users to prevent accidents in terms of train speed at level crossing. This system uses PIC 16 F 877 A microcontroller with the help of sensors. It can divide into two parts. The first part is concern on the hardware development where all electronic components have included. IR sensors, inductive sensors are the input components while buzzer, light indicator, DC motor and LCD display are the output components. These are controlled by the controller circuit. The microcontroller forms the main unit of the system. It receives input signal from the sensors and sends information to the gate motor driver for opening and closing the gate. Besides, the input signal will active LCD display and alarm and <b>indication</b> light <b>circuit</b> was provided as additional part of this system. The first inductive sensor and IR sensor are fixed at a certain distance from the gate and the second sensors are fixed at the same certain distance after the gate. The gate is closed, when the train crosses the first IR sensor and the gate is opened, when the train crosses the second IR sensor. This system deals about one of the efficient methods to avoid train accidents. The second part is based on software programming to operate the hardware structure. Program for railway gate control system is based on PIC microcontroller with PIC basic Pro language...|$|R
40|$|There are <b>indications</b> {{of motor}} <b>circuit</b> changes in {{patients}} with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Nevertheless, although several studies have analyzed motor behavior in CRPS, a relation with pain could not be detected. This might {{be explained by the}} use of cross-sectional designs in these studies, in which pain is considered as a trait- rather than a state-dependent variable. We therefore studied the time-dependent relation between pain and motor function in affected arms of 29 CRPS patients during their participation in a placebo-controlled ketamine study. Movement parameters (velocity, frequency, amplitude, and number of arrests) were assessed during a finger tapping task. Linear mixed model analysis of the effects of pain (numerical rating scale score), treatment (ketamine/placebo), and week (1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks after treatment) on the movement parameters revealed that pain intensity was significantly (inversely) related to motor function, irrespective of whether patients had received ketamine or placebo. Movement parameters changed 3 – 12 % per point numerical rating scale change. Because patients were unaware of possible effects of ketamine on motor function, these findings suggest that motor function changes were mediated by, or occurred simultaneously with, changes in pain intensity. By improving motor function, pain relief may offer a window of opportunity for rehabilitation programs in CRP...|$|R
