In 2012, Daunt stated that future expansion was being considered, based {{on the performance of}} the company. The accounts for the year to 2012 showed Waterstones, prior- and <b>post-acquisition</b> had made losses of £37.3 million2013 saw the start of an overhaul of the company's business strategy, with centralised decision making giving way to store-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques. Waterstones embarked on a major restructuring of staffing levels, with a company-wide consultation with 560 managerial staff to subsequently reduce roles within the company. This consultation led to Head Office staff departures and around 200 branch and regional managers leaving their posts. Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the University of Derby to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff, with the Folio Society to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops, and partnering with a new charity, BookTrust. By the end of 2013, Waterstones had cut its losses to £12.2 million, opened 12 further Café W and embarked on a capital investment in its store portfolio of £29.5 million.|$|E

2500|$|Just as importantly, {{horizontally}} transferred segments need {{to exhibit}} the donor's genomic signature. This {{might not be}} the case for ancient transfers where transferred sequences are subjected to the same mutational processes {{as the rest of the}} host genome, potentially causing their distinct signatures to [...] "ameliorate" [...] and become undetectable through parametric methods. For example, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a predatory δ-Proteobacterium, has homogeneous GC content, and it might be concluded that its genome is resistant to HGT. However, subsequent analysis using phylogenetic methods identified a number of ancient HGT events in the genome of B. bacteriovorus. Similarly, if the inserted segment was previously ameliorated to the host's genome, as is the case for prophage insertions, parametric methods might miss predicting these HGT events. Also, the donor's composition must significantly differ from the recipient's to be identified as abnormal, a condition that might be missed in the case of short- to medium-distance HGT, which are the most prevalent. Furthermore, it has been reported that recently acquired genes tend to be AT-richer than the recipient's average, which indicates that differences in GC-content signature may result from unknown <b>post-acquisition</b> mutational processes rather than from the donor's genome.|$|E

An analysis suggests that specific neuronal populations participate in the processing of familiarity for specific tastants.

This persistent cortical representation of taste familiarity requires slow <b>post-acquisition</b> processing to develop.
