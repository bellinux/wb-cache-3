25|$|Contact voltage energizes objects {{which are}} {{normally}} safe – fences, telephone booths, street signs, etc. Anywhere buried electric wiring exists, a failure {{can occur in}} that wiring and create conditions that allow electricity to flow into the immediate surroundings. Some systems have <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> such as circuit breakers or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI), designed to isolate such a fault.

25|$|Surge <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> are {{designed}} to reduce the random energy surges of voltage transients and electrical noise on the power supply line that can damage sensitive electronics such as TVs, computers, and smart appliances. They are available for 120V, 15/20A applications, in different form factors such as surge protective receptacles in single, duplex, four-in-one, and six receptacle configurations as well as surge-protective power strips. These devices provide point-of-use protection and are {{the last line of}} defense in a whole house surge protection network.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{maintain}} the California Polytechnic State University Electrical Distribution System by performing short circuit and <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> coordination studies for the Baker Science Building. When a short circuit arises in a system, there is no finite way in telling what <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> will be tripped, which can cause outages, arc flashes and electrical explosions. The best way in determining the outcomes of these occurrences are to perform precise simulated reports. To output these reports, design {{and analysis of the}} single line through a commercialized software, Power Tools for Windows (SKM) was used. To name a few, the analyses that the software can provide are load flow, short circuit, and <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> coordination studies.

The need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second. In some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules. A maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems.|$|E

25|$|The murders {{sent the}} town of Texarkana {{into a state of}} panic {{throughout}} the summer.

Most of the town hid in fear inside their houses or hotels, sometimes even leaving town. Some youths took matters in their own hands by trying to bait the Phantom so they could kill him. After three months of no more Phantom attacks, the Texas Rangers slowly and quietly left town to keep the Phantom from believing he was safe to strike again. The murders were reported nationally and internationally by several publications.|$|E

The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other <b>protective</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} safety {{performance of a}} passenger car in side collisions, using a side air-curtain <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> {{to minimize the risk}} of head-brain injuries. Traumatic brain injury in passenger vehicle side collisions is one of the common injury patterns with fatal consequences in traffic accidents. A dummy head has limited capability to evaluate vehicle safety performance with detailed injury related physical parameters. Continuous development of mathematical models has provided efficient tools for assessing the safety performance of a <b>protective</b> <b>device.</b> A validated head-brain FE model and air-curtain model was employed to simulate the impact responses of head-brain to B-pillar and further quantify the effect of the air-curtain on the protection of the human head in side collisions. A parametric study was conducted using the design of experiment approach. The kinematics of a head impacting the B-pillar and the air-curtain are presented. The calculated physical parameters from the head-brain FE model include the distribution of von Mises stress, shear stress, coup pressure, contrecoup pressure, and accelerations during vehicle side collision. Study outcomes suggested that using a side air-curtain <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> can reduce von Mises stress, shear stress, coup pressure, contrecoup pressure, and deceleration rate during vehicle side impact. The efficiency of the <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> for head-brain injuries is identified by reducing the HIC (Head Injury Criterion) to 80 % of original values...|$|R
