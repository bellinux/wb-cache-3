In the 2009 mtDNA interpopulation <b>PCA</b> <b>analysis</b> of subhaplogroups, insular populations from Krk, Ugljan, Korčula, Brač, Hvar were clustered together implying to have close maternal lineages, with Vis close to them, but Cres (prevalence U2, W, N1a) and Rab (U4, H6, J1c) had separate outlying positions from both the cluster and each other. In the 2014 mtDNA <b>PCA</b> <b>analysis,</b> the populations from eastern and southern Croatia clustered together with Bosnia and Herzegovina, while western and northern Croatia with Slovenia. As Slovenian population does not form Southeast Europe cluster it is considered a possible input from different migration waves of Slavs in the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy {{is the only}} detection technique which does not rely on separation of the analytes, and the sample can thus be recovered for further analyses. All kinds of small molecule metabolites can be measured simultaneously - in this sense, NMR is close to being a universal detector. The main advantages of NMR are high analytical reproducibility and simplicity of sample preparation. Practically, however, it is relatively insensitive compared to mass spectrometry-based techniques. Another study demonstrated {{that the lack of}} sensitivity of the current NMR based metabolomics protocol is not due to instrumental limitations but rather due to methodological limitations. In the same way that binning of spectra negates the better resolution of higher field magnets; the same appears to be true by employing <b>PCA</b> <b>analysis</b> to NMR spectra which effectively negates the higher sensitivity of higher field magnets.|$|E

5000|$|Whilst haploid markers such as mtDNA and Y-DNA {{can provide}} clues about past {{population}} history, they only represent a single genetic locus, compared {{to hundreds of}} thousands present in nuclear, autosomes. Although autosomal analyses often sample a small number of Bulgarians, by multiple autosomes multiple ancestral lines may be traced by an individual's 21 autosomes as opposed to one identical mtDNA or Y DNA sex chromosome, whose inheritance although clinal, demonstrates genetic drift often in statistics. Analyses of autosomal DNA markers gives the best approximation of overall 'relatedness' between populations, presenting a less skewed genetic picture compared to Y DNA haplogroups. This atDNA data shows that there are no sharp discontinuities or clusters within the European population. Rather there exists a genetic gradient, running mostly in a southeast to northwest direction. A study compared all Slavic nations and combined all lines of evidence, autosomal, maternal and paternal, including more than 6000 people for and at least 700 Bulgarians from previous studies, of which 13 were used for autosomal analysis (right image). The overall data situates the southeastern group (Bulgarians and Macedonians) in a cluster with Romanians, and they are at similar proximity to Gagauzes, Montenegrins and Serbs who are not part of another cluster but are described as 'in between' clusters. Macedonians and Romanians consistingly keep being among most related to Bulgarians by au, mt, and Y-DNA a conclusion backed also by a pan-European autosomal study investigating 500,568 SNP (loci) of 1,387 Europeans and including 1 or 2 Bulgarians, other more or less extensive data sets situate Bulgarians and Romanians as their nearest [...] Per HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies Bulgarians are also in a cluster with the same populations. The Balto-Slavic study itself calculated genetic distance by SNP data of the multiple autosomes and ranked most proximal to Bulgarians the Serbs, followed by Macedonians, Montenegrins, Romanians, Gagauzes, Macedonian Greeks apart from Thessaloniki, the rest of the South Slavs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Czechs, and then by Greeks from Thessaloniki, Central Greece and Peloponese. The East Slavs and Poles cluster together remaining less proximal to Bulgarians than Germans, among whom Slav admixture is also observed. Balts, however, according to the <b>PCA</b> <b>analysis</b> are less proximal to Bulgarians than Italians for example are. Bulgarians are also only modestly close to their eastern neighbours - the Anatolian Turks, suggesting the presence of certain geographic and cultural barriers between them. Despite various invasions of Altaic-speaking peoples in Europe, no significant impact from such Asian descent is recorded throughout southern and central Europe.|$|E
