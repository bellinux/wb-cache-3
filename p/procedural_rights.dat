As such, it {{has proven to be}} a controversial provision in the Charter.|$|E

The same <b>procedural</b> <b>rights</b> apply in these proceedings as in the earlier proceedings on the merits of the charge.|$|E
25|$|According {{to several}} human rights organizations, 30 percent of pretrial detainees were {{eventually}} acquitted. According to the Memory Commission's committee, there were approximately 6,500 complaints {{of human rights}} violations against juvenile detainees in provincial prisons and juvenile detention facilities, the majority of which were pending investigation. In July 2008 the Buenos Aires Provincial Supreme Court inaugurated an ad hoc juvenile justice system, which operated in eight out of 18 provincial districts. It provides minors age 16 to 18 the same <b>procedural</b> <b>rights</b> as adults and limits sentences to 180 days in prison. In August 2008 the minister of justice {{announced that he had}} instructed police forces to conform standard operating procedures for arresting minors to international standards; however, by year's end, there was no information on application of procedures.|$|E
25|$|Non-refoulement is {{the right}} not to be {{returned}} to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The right to non-refoulement is distinct from the right to asylum. In order to respect the right to asylum states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to non-refoulement by guaranteeing refugees three <b>procedural</b> <b>rights</b> (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution. This proposal attempts {{to strike a balance between}} the interest of national governments and the interests of refugees.|$|E

25|$|In Singapore, {{the right}} to legal {{representation}} is contingent {{on the nature of}} the inquiry.

5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) {{is another}} significant, {{specific}} criminal <b>procedural</b> <b>right</b> {{guaranteed by the}} due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, {{and there is a}} reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different ("materiality"). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|R
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{circumstances}} where the courts accept that procedural protections {{should be more}} limited or even placed in abeyance, {{and this is a}} function of context. This is especially so in matters of national security where the sensitivity of such matters demands that the courts do not look closely at government decisions to limit <b>procedural</b> <b>rights.</b> In wartime, the case of Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) is regarded to be of great constitutional significance. The House of Lords found that there could be no inquiry into whether there were reasonable grounds for the detention of the appellant as it was a subjective matter for the Home Security to determine, as prescribed by legislation. However, in Lord Atkin's acclaimed dissenting judgment, he refused to endorse this construction of the law. Lord Atkin's judgment is now taken as the correct decision, where every imprisonment is prima facie illegal until justified by the arresting authority. Nonetheless, national security is still an important issue that can and does limit procedural protection in certain cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{third phase}} (1996-1999) came {{about as a}} result of an {{amendment}} to the ITM Act 1976 which granted the institution all the powers of a university and on par with all the universities in the country, despite retaining its name. Among the significant change was a creation of Board of Directors and Senate. Many principal officers of ITM were re-designated such as the Branch Director was renamed Rector, the Head of Campus became the Provost, while Principal and Senior Lecturers were re-designated as Professors and Associate Professors, respectively; each School was redesignated as a Faculty; ITM was given the power to confer degrees up to Doctor of Philosophy level; ITM was given the unique power to establish courses and campuses abroad with permission from the Minister of Education; the Institute was conferred additional powers to enable it to conduct business, invest in shares, set up companies and engage in commercial research; disciplinary powers over staff were transferred from the Minister to the Board of Directors; to improve staff accountability, the Institute was bestowed the power to impose a surcharge; and the <b>procedural</b> <b>rights</b> of students in disciplinary proceedings were strengthened.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted {{generally}} that natural justice is a fundamental element {{of the rule of}} law. In administrative law, the two principles of natural justice, which constitute a framework for common law <b>procedural</b> <b>rights,</b> are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or [...] "no man a judge in his own cause") and the right to be heard (audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side"). In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd. & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd. (1978), the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of [...] "fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties." [...] Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999, MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice, which he described thus: [...] "atural justice requires essentially two basic principles. One is that {{you have the right to}} be heard and to explain your case, and, two, is the right to equal treatment. A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Professor Thio Li-ann that where a domestic tribunal places an individual's reputation or his livelihood in jeopardy, the stronger the case for allowing legal representation is, particularly since this would vindicate the ideal of equality before the law. She also referred to the Malaysian case of Doresamy v. Public Service Commission (1971), in which the right to legal representation {{was linked to the}} notion of constitutional equality. Thio opined that this link to constitutional equality implies that a fundamental right is at stake and that this recognition [...] "should lead to greater weightage being accorded to such <b>procedural</b> <b>rights</b> where balanced against competing demands of efficiency".|$|E
2500|$|Although the courts' {{protection}} of procedural legitimate expectations assured individuals that decision-making processes were guided by fairness {{and thus the}} [...] "greater propensity for fairer decisions", in some circumstances a procedural right alone was insufficient for producing a fair outcome as [...] "procedure and substance are intertwined, with <b>procedural</b> <b>rights</b> reinforcing substantive ones, and vice-versa [...] ". The Schmidt case illustrates that the courts' {{protection of}} a procedural right inevitably leads to a substantive outcome. The plaintiffs here challenged a decision to refuse renewal of their residence permits {{on the grounds that}} they had not been given a hearing before the decision was reached. This argument was rejected as the original permits had been issued for only a certain time, which had since expired. However, Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, said that had the plaintiffs' residence permits been revoked before they expired, they [...] "would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for the permitted time". The Court of Appeal in effect envisaged procedural protection of a substantive expectation of being allowed to stay in the UK.|$|E

Gonzales dissents from the consensus view, siding with Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who said [...] "though the Constitution prohibits Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus except during times of rebellion or invasion, this provision was probably meant to keep Congress from suspending the writ and preventing state courts from releasing individuals who were wrongfully imprisoned.

40|$|The article aims to {{investigate}} the roots and role of the principle of, and then right to, good administration in the European Union. Article 41 of the Charter of Nice {{for the first time}} includes a <b>procedural</b> <b>right,</b> like the right to have a good admnistration, in an international catalogue of human rights. Nevertheless, as stressed by European jurisprudence, it is more than a <b>procedural</b> <b>right,</b> because it belongs to the constitutional tradition of the Member States: {{it is based on the}} principles of the rule of law, democracy and legality. Furthermore, the contribution will explain the meanings of “good administration” and “maladministration”, the ground of the complaints received by the Ombudsman. The article defends the complementary and not opposite relationship between the two concepts. Moreover, whereas the European Ombudsman strived to give a positive definition of maladministration, the formation of the right to good administration has been developed by the European judges, especially in the cases involving competition regulation, according to the exclusive European process competence in the antitrust field. For this purpose, the contribution analyses the most significant European jurisprudence in competition law related to this principle, considering that the first steps to the definition of “good administration” in the European Union developed from competition proceedings. In conclusion, the reported antitrust case law shows that the right to good admnistration has already furthered the defence of the European citizen, in spite of the uncertain destiny of the role of the Charter of Nice, linked to the Treaty of Lisbon for its binding implementation...|$|R
