40|$|The tar, nicotine, {{and carbon}} {{monoxide}} yields of cigarettes {{manufactured in the}} United Kingdom between 1934 and 1979 were studied. Over this period the average tar yield decreased by 49 %, the nicotine yield by 31 %, the carbon monoxide yield by 11 %, all estimated on a sales-weighted basis. The average tar yield decreased progressively {{after the second world}} war, owing both to the introduction of filter cigarettes and to changes in the manufacture of <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> The average nicotine yield increased initially, decreased by 43 % from about 1950 to 1974, but increased again by 9 % between 1974 and 1979. The average carbon monoxide yield started to decrease after about 1961; while it decreased substantially in <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> the rapid increase in sales of filter cigarettes at this time, at the expense of <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> largely offset the reduction in carbon monoxide yield that would otherwise have occurred. As with nicotine, carbon monoxide yield showed a small rise in later years (4 % between 1976 and 1979). The trends in tar yield may well explain the reduction in lung cancer in the UK better than has been suspected hitherto. The trends in nicotine and carbon monoxide yields are probably not sufficiently different to distinguish which of them might be the more likely cause of cardiovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-five years ago, {{cigarette}} smokers in the United Kingdom smoked <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes</b> with {{an average}} tar yield of probably about 35 mg. Now smokers predominantly smoke filter cigarettes and average tar yields have been reduced by half. Epidemiological evidence comparing mortality in smokers of differing types of cigarettes is reviewed. Compared with smokers of higher tar <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> smokers of lower tar filters cigarettes have a reduced mortality for lung cancer, for cancer of the buccal cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, and bladder, for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and for cirrhosis of the liver. They also have a slightly significant. Problems of interpretation and limitations of the available evidence are discussed. No worthwhile evidence is yet available on smokers of "low tar' (0 - 10 mg) cigarettes and data are sparse on lifetime smokers of filter cigarettes. Continuing research {{is important to understand}} the situation fully, but the trends of lower mortality to be associated with lower tar and nicotine levels are promising...|$|R
40|$|In a case control {{study of}} over 12 000 inpatients aged 35 - 74, risk of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and, {{particularly}} in those aged 35 - 54, ischaemic heart disease was positively associated {{with the number of}} manufactured cigarettes smoked daily and was negatively associated with long term giving up. Risk of stroke was not clearly related to smoking. Among manufactured cigarette smokers, lung cancer risk tended to be lowest in those who had always smoked filter cigarettes. This pattern was, however, evident only in men who additionally smoked pipes, cigars or handrolled cigarettes and in women, not being seen in men who smoked only manufactured cigarettes. Risk of lung cancer was not clearly related to time of switch to filter cigarettes. A markedly lower risk of chronic bronchitis was seen in men, but not women, who smoked filter rather than <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Heart disease risk did not vary by type of cigarette smoked 10 years before admission, but, compared with those who had never smoked filter cigarettes, those who had ever smoked filter cigarettes had a higher risk in men and a lower risk in younger women. Compared with the general population, markedly more controls were ex-smokers, suggesting incipient disease, whether or not smoking related, may alter smoking habits, thus affecting the interpretability of the findings. Control smokers were also relatively much more likely to report smoking <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes</b> than expected. This comparison, not made in other studies relating risk to type of cigarette smoked, indicates that great care must be taken in verifying validity of reported smoking habits. While our findings are compatible with other evidence that risk of lung cancer and chronic bronchitis is probably reduced by switching from <b>plain</b> to filter <b>cigarettes,</b> they underline the difficulties in obtaining valid evidence from epidemiological studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} of smoking to total mortality {{and to the}} prevalence of cardiorespiratory symptoms has been studied in three prospective surveys in west central Scotland in which 18 786 people attended a multiphasic screening examination. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms, {{and to a lesser}} extent cardiovascular symptoms, increased with the number of cigarettes smoked, with inhalation, and with a younger age of starting to smoke. A lower prevalence of respiratory symptoms in both sexes was observed in smokers of filter cigarettes than in smokers of <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> and in those who smoked cigarettes with lower tar levels, irrespective of whether these were filtered or plain. In general, the relationships found between smoking and mortality were similar to those reported by other workers.

40|$|The {{relative}} intakes of tar, nicotine, {{and carbon}} monoxide were estimated in 2455 cigarette smokers, who freely smoked their usual brands of cigarette. The estimates were derived {{by using an}} objective index of inhaling based on the measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin divided by the carbon monoxide yield of the cigarettes smoked, after background and carry over carboxyhaemoglobin effects had been allowed for. Separate analyses were performed according to the yield and type (plain, filter, etc) of cigarette smoked. The analyses based on yield indicated that the extent of inhaling was adjusted sufficiently to achieve similar intakes of nicotine/carbon monoxide regardless of the nicotine/carbon monoxide yield. It was not, however, sufficiently increased to achieve a similar intake of tar as the tar yield of the cigarette decreased. The analyses based on type of cigarette indicated that the extent of inhaling was adjusted to achieve similar intakes of tar and nicotine regardless {{of the type of}} cigarette smoked, but that this led to a greater intake of carbon monoxide among filter cigarette smokers than that among smokers of <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes</b> [...] more so than would have been expected from their relative carbon monoxide yields. Two conclusions arise from these results. Firstly, any harmful effects of nicotine/carbon monoxide are unlikely to be materially reduced by smoking cigarettes with lower yields of nicotine/carbon monoxide, but the harmful effects of tar are likely to be reduced by smoking cigarettes with lower tar yields. These predictions appear to be borne out by epidemiological observations. Secondly, any harmful effects of carbon monoxide on the cardiovascular system will be greater in smokers of modern filter cigarettes than in smokers of modern <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> provided that these two groups of smokers are otherwise similar with respect to risk of cardiovascular disease...|$|R

While most case–control findings have not shown increased mortality from lung cancer with menthol smoking, and per-haps a slightly lowered risk with menthol, the possibility that menthol substantially decreases {{the most common cause of}} cancer mortality must be considered from a public health perspective. The National Health Interview Survey study may have even underestimated the protective effect from menthol.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSmoking is {{associated}} with an accelerated loss of lung function and inhalation accelerates the decline further. Exhaled CO reflects the exposure of smoke to the lungs. AimTo investigate whether self-reported inhalation and type of cigarette influenced the level of exhaled CO and whether CO could provide additional information to usual measures of smoking regarding prediction of present lung function and decline in lung function {{over an extended period}} of time. MethodCigarette smokers from the Copenhagen City Heart Study with valid measures of lung function and exhaled CO; in total 3738 subjects, 2096 women and 1642 men. ResultsSubjects not inhaling had slightly lower exhaled CO values than those inhaling, but substantially higher values than non-smokers (P< 0. 001). Smokers of <b>plain</b> <b>cigarettes</b> had slightly lower CO values than smokers of filter cigarettes (P< 0. 001). Increasing CO levels were correlated to a lower FEV 1 %pred and to an accelerated decline in lung function. However, in multiple linear regression analyses these correlations were not significant. ConclusionInhalation and type of cigarette affects exhaled CO levels. CO measures have no predictive value regarding neither present lung function nor decline in lung function with time in a population survey setting...|$|R
