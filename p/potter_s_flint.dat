50|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{promoters}} and theorists of Imagism along with T. E. Hulme and F. <b>S.</b> <b>Flint,</b> but his contrasting relation with Ezra Pound contributed to make him soon forgotten. His poetry was based on the value of the image to which language had to be adapted in conciseness and vividness through the use of simple and universally comprehensible symbols.|$|R
50|$|Pound's {{involvement}} with the Imagists {{marked the beginning of}} a revolution in the way poetry was written. English poets involved with this group included D. H.

Eliot, particularly after the publication of The Waste Land, became a major figure and influence on other English poets.|$|R

5000|$|In France, haiku was {{introduced}} by Paul-Louis Couchoud around 1906. Couchoud's articles were read by early Imagist theoretician F. <b>S.</b> <b>Flint,</b> who passed on Couchoud's ideas to {{other members of the}} proto-Imagist Poets' Club such as Ezra Pound. Amy Lowell made a trip to London to meet Pound and find out about haiku. She returned to the United States where she worked to interest others in this [...] "new" [...] form. Haiku subsequently had a considerable influence on Imagists in the 1910s, notably Pound's [...] "In a Station of the Metro" [...] of 1913, but, notwithstanding several efforts by Yone Noguchi to explain [...] "the hokku spirit", there was as yet little understanding of the form and its history.|$|R

25|$|The {{origins of}} Imagism and cubist poetry {{are to be}} found in two poems by T. E. Hulme that were {{published}} in 1909 by the Poets' Club in London. Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy who had established the Poets' Club to discuss his theories of poetry. The poet and critic F. <b>S.</b> <b>Flint,</b> who was a champion of free verse and modern French poetry, was highly critical of the club and its publications. From the ensuing debate, Hulme and Flint became close friends. They started meeting with other poets at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Soho to discuss reform of contemporary poetry through free verse and the tanka and haiku and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems.|$|R
25|$|The period 1909 to 1913 saw the {{emergence}} of Imagism, the first consciously avant garde movement in 20th century English-language poetry. Pound, who was Imagism's prime mover, served as foreign editor of Harriet Monroe's magazine Poetry. In October 1912, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Richard Aldington under the label Imagiste. Aldington's poems were printed in the November issue, and H.D.'s appeared in the January 1913 issue. The March 1913 issue of Poetry also contained Pound's A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste and F. <b>S.</b> <b>Flint's</b> essay Imagisme. This publication history meant that this London-based movement had its first readership in the United States. It also meant that Imagism was available {{as a model for}} American Modernist poets of the next generation.|$|R

50|$|Masters {{was born}} in New York and moved to Cleveland with his first wife, Naomi, in 1851. Masters became a trustee of Ohio City. He later helped William B.

Masters defeated his successor, Edward <b>S.</b> <b>Flint,</b> because of his Republican views during the Civil War. Masters resigned from office in May 1864 when he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He subsequently sold his part of Peck & Masters shipbuilding company. Masters' first wife, Naomi, died in 1863, after which he married M. Augusta Prull on October 27, 1863.
