5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eva {{lives in}} the provincial town of Junín, and longs {{for a better life}} in Buenos Aires. She persuades a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, with whom she is having an affair, {{to take her to the}} city. After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his <b>political</b> <b>momentum.</b> The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new government will serve the descamisados.|$|E

Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and <b>political</b> <b>momentum</b> grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting Prince Charles and Lady Diana on their visit to open Expo 86.

40|$|Abstract. Trachoma, {{the second}} {{leading cause of}} {{blindness}} worldwide, differentially affects the poorest communities, which may have the least access to resources. With {{the establishment of the}} Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by 2020 (GET 2020) goal, the World Health Organization has set an ambitious target for country programs. The currently recommended surgery for trichiasis/entropion, antibiotics for active disease, facial cleanliness, and environ-mental change to reduce transmission (SAFE) strategy targets all key elements believed to be necessary for a short- and long-term intervention program. This report reviews the need for a multi-faceted strategy, and the evidence supporting the elements of SAFE. Concerns about the implementation are discussed. Additional research is suggested that will enhance the implementation of the SAFE strategy. In the current climate of significant <b>political</b> and social <b>momentum</b> for trachoma control, the SAFE strategy is a safe bet to accomplish the elimination of blinding trachoma...|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{political}} connotations of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been gaining <b>momentum.</b> <b>Political</b> CSR includes social and philanthropic activities undertaken by firms {{that enable them to}} access political stakeholders while safeguarding their legitimacy and reputation at the same time.

However, governments in several emerging-market countries have been making CSR mandatory to address social and environmental issues at a local (or domestic) level. In this study, I analyse the Indian participants in the United Nations Global Compact in the pre and post CSR mandate period (passing of the Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013).

Once the ‘Quinquenio regime’ was overthrown, three <b>political</b> forces gain <b>momentum</b> within the Liberal Press: The Republican Press–that supported the presidential nomination of journalist Carlos E.

40|$|In the Millennium Development Goals discussion, the {{question}} of how we eliminate bad institutions that perpetuate global poverty often arises. Democracy and participatory institutions are proposed as meta-institutions that are meant to create better ones. Democracies, however, also stumble. We study two episodes of crisis of presidential legitimacy in the Philippines: one arising from perceived electoral failure and the other from involvement in an illegal numbers game called Jueteng. A crisis of legitimacy can arise because the "declared winner" may not be the "true winner" because of the compromise of mechanisms of recall and accountability, or because the "true winner" reveals himself or herself ex post to be the "incorrect choice," or both. The ensuing crisis of legitimacy, in turn, robs the executive of <b>political</b> mandate and <b>momentum</b> for reform. In the struggle to survive, executive autonomy is traded away as the power brokers of the status quo are enlisted for the defense. Thus, democracy's march to good institutions may be blocked or even reversed. (c) 2007 The Earth Institute at Columbia University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} (ACD) is a delayed-type hypersensitivity immune reaction mediated by T-lymphocytes {{as a result}} of repeated exposure of an allergen primarily on skin. ACD accounts for up to 95 % of occupational skin diseases (OSDs), with epoxy resins implicated {{as one of the most}} common causes of ACD. Efficient high-throughput in vitro screening for accurate identification of compounds and materials that may pose hazardous risks in the workplace is crucial. At present, the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is the ‘method of choice’ for predicting the sensitizing potency of contact allergens. As the 3 Rs principles of reduction, refinement and replacement in animal testing has gained <b>political</b> and economic <b>momentum,</b> several in vitro screening methods have been developed for identifying potential contact allergens.

40|$|Protests often {{indicate}} social {{states of}} emergency. Protesters no longer {{agree with the}} existing situation and the way their lives are regulated; therefore, they demand immediate change. The Gezi Protests, in which people from various social, political, and class backgrounds went {{to the streets to}} voice their dissent, certainly reflected a state of emergency in Turkey. Young people, often referred to as members of the countrys post- 1980 apolitical generation within public discourse, unexpectedly gathered on the streets and acted as the frontrunners of this mass movement. What is more, their way of protesting through creative performances and humor effectively increased their visibility. Drawing upon the concept of emergency, and guided by a cultural performative approach, this article focuses on young peoples experiences of protest. It is a study of the reasons and meanings behind young peoples participation in the protests, as well as of values such as trust, solidarity, and collectivity upon which their action was grounded. My findings are based on qualitative field research, i. e., in-depth interviews conducted with young participants of the Gezi protests in &# 304;stanbul. The investigation is driven by the questions of how young people describe the notion of the political in relation to trust, solidarity, and collectivity, and how these diverse ways of describing the political through practices foreshadow a new understanding of the <b>political,</b> which gained <b>momentum</b> from the state of emergency of the Gezi Protest...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{transfer}} {{has gained}} <b>political</b> and social <b>momentum</b> {{in the twenty-first}} century. The emphasis of this momentum has been on encouraging the transfer of scientific expertise between academia and industry, and on informing the public. The widespread use of the World Wide Web has provided a mechanism for sharing large volumes of information, which enables knowledge transfer between all sections of society. In geoscience, this trend in online knowledge transfer, combined with a move to digital data acquisition, processing, and interpretation technologies, has provided a unique opportunity for rapid progression of the science and its understanding by the public. To maximize these opportunities, the geoscience community needs to embrace technologies in Web and data management, as well as consider how best to combine and share data sources and data interpretations in a digital world. To achieve effective knowledge transfer, geoscientists first {{need to understand the}} benefits and limitations of digital data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. In this paper, we consider four aspects of the "digital revolution" on geological workflows and knowledge transfer—sources of uncertainty in digital data workflows, combining data sources, presentation of data and models in 3 D visualization environments, and the use of Web and data management systems for knowledge transfer. In considering these aspects, we have focused on the collection, processing, and management of field data and implications for data analysis and decision making. Understanding the benefits and limitations of digital data collection will place the community {{in a better position to}} represent data and geological models in a digital environment through online resources for effective knowledge transfer...|$|R
40|$|Social injustices, {{structural}} and personal crises {{as well as}} intensifying stress on some citizens seem increasing preoccupations in contemporary society and social policy. In this context, the concept of vulnerability has come to play {{a prominent role in}} academic, governmental and everyday accounts of the human condition. Policy makers and practitioners are now concerned with addressing vulnerability through an expansive range of interventions. As this special issue draws attention to, a vulnerability zeitgeist or ‘spirit of the time’ has been traced in contemporary welfare and disciplinary arrangements (Brown, 2014, 2015), which now informs a range of interventions and approaches to social problems, both in the UK and internationally. As prominent examples, ‘vulnerable’ people are legally entitled to ‘priority need’ in English social housing allocations (Carr and Hunter, 2008), vulnerable victims of crime are seen as requiring special responses in the UK criminal justice system (see Roulstone et al., 2011; Walkgate, 2011), ‘vulnerable adults’ have designated ‘protections’ under British law (Dunn et al., 2008; Clough, 2014) and vulnerable migrants and refugees are increasingly prioritised within international immigration processes (Peroni and Timmer, 2013). There is a long tradition in the field of social policy of critiquing the implications of particular concepts as mechanisms of governance, from poverty (Townsend, 1979; Lister, 2004) and social exclusion (Levitas, 1998; Young 1999) to risk (Beck, 1992; Kemshall, 2002) and resilience (Ecclestone and Lewis, 2014; Wright, 2016).

5000|$|The idea of Bjelke-Petersen {{becoming}} {{prime minister}} was first explicitly discussed by Gold Coast businessmen Brian Ray and Mike Gore, with Bjelke-Petersen, in autumn 1986—not long after his comprehensive state election victory. Gore would later claim that Bjelke-Petersen was reluctant to pursue a position in federal politics. However, according to Ray, Bjelke-Petersen expressed enthusiasm for the idea and had to convince Ray and Gore of its merit. The base of the [...] "Joh for Canberra" [...] campaign {{was made up of}} a group of Queensland businessmen nicknamed the [...] "white shoe brigade" [...] who had enjoyed substantial patronage from the Bjelke-Petersen government. Despite Bjelke-Petersen's insistence that his campaign was driven by popular enthusiasm, the base of support for the [...] "Joh for Canberra" [...] campaign was always quite narrow. In the 1984 federal election, the National Party had polled only 10.63% of the vote and won 21 seats, compared to 45 for the Liberal Party and 82 for Labor. In 1987, John Howard and Ian Sinclair were poised to lead the Liberal and National parties respectively into the 1987 election against Bob Hawke. Bjelke-Petersen believed that Howard and Sinclair had drifted too far from their conservative principles and stood no chance of defeating the Labor Party in the election. Bjelke-Petersen's confidence had been bolstered by several convincing wins at the state level. After his decisive victory in the 1986 state election, Bjelke-Petersen became the [...] "superstar of non-Labor politics in Australia", though his support was concentrated in rural areas and on the far right of the <b>political</b> spectrum. This <b>momentum</b> gave Bjelke-Petersen a feeling of invulnerability and the mistaken belief that the dynamics of Queensland politics could be replicated at a federal level.|$|R
