40|$|In the {{framework}} of the braneworld models, rotating black holes can be described by the Kerr metric with a tidal charge representing the influence of the non-local gravitational (tidal) effects of the bulk space Weyl tensor onto the black hole spacetime. We study the influence of the tidal charge onto <b>profiled</b> spectral <b>lines</b> generated by radiating tori orbiting in vicinity of a rotating black hole. We show that with lowering the negative tidal charge of the black hole, the <b>profiled</b> <b>line</b> becomes to be flatter and wider keeping their standard character with flux stronger at the blue edge of the <b>profiled</b> <b>line.</b> The extension of the line grows with radius falling and inclination angle growing. With growing inclination angle a small hump appears in the <b>profiled</b> <b>lines</b> due to the strong lensing effect of photons coming from regions behind the black hole. For positive tidal charge ($b> 0 $) and high inclination angles two small humps appear in the <b>profiled</b> <b>lines</b> close to the red and blue edge of the lines due to the strong lensing effect. We can conclude that for all values of $b$, the strongest effect on the <b>profiled</b> <b>lines</b> shape (extension) is caused by the changes of the inclination angle.

On the other hand, enormous efforts have been made by the industry to develop a modern S-Bahn train. This then succeeded so well with the series 270 (now 485), which were produced in the years 1987-92 for the German Reichsbahn in series (model already arisen in 1979/80).

40|$|Spectral {{molecular}} <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> {{observations of}} star-forming molecular clouds sometimes show distinct red asymmetric double-peaked molecular <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> with weaker blue peaks and stronger red peaks. For some star-forming molecular clouds, such molecular transitions with red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> and blue asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> (i. e. blue asymmetric double-peaked molecular <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> with weaker red peaks and stronger blue peaks) may coexist in spatially resolved spectral observations, while for others, such molecular transitions with red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> may completely dominate in spatially resolved spectral observations. Blue asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> are usually interpreted as signals of central core collapses, while red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> remain unexplained. In this paper, we advance a spherically symmetric self-similar hydrodynamic model framework for envelope expansions with core collapses (EECC) {{of a general}} polytropic molecular gas cloud under self-gravity. Based on such EECC hydrodynamic cloud models, we perform tracer molecular <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> calculations using the publicly available RATRAN code for star-forming clouds with spectroscopic signatures of red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles.</b> The presence of red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> from molecular cloud cores indicates that EECC processes are most likely an essential hydrodynamic process of star formation. With spatial distributions, we explore various <b>profiles</b> of molecular <b>lines</b> for several tracer molecules in different settings of EECC dynamic models with and without shocks.

40|$|Motivated by the {{requirements}} of the present archaeology, we have been developing an automated archivation system for archaeological classification and reconstruction of ceramics. Our system works with the profile of an archaeological fragment, which is the cross-section of the fragment {{in the direction of the}} rotational axis of symmetry. Ceramic fragments are recorded automatically by a 3 D-measurement system based on structured light. The input data for the estimation of the profile is a set of points produced by the acquisition system. The profile is used to reconstruct the original pot. Our approach consists of several steps, starting by calculating the proper orientation, which describes the exact positioning of the fragment on the original vessel. Next the <b>profile</b> <b>line</b> is computed and several measurements, like the diameter and height of the vessel. After evaluating the <b>profile</b> <b>line</b> a virtual pot is reconstructed.
