5|$|Since {{at least}} 1936, Route 17 (then Route 2) was planned for {{upgrading}} to a freeway, not only north of U.S. Route 46, but also {{south to the}} Newark area. The first <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> freeway {{along the length of}} the route was halted due to World War II, and the second <b>plan</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> freeway in the 1960s was cancelled due to the disruption it was projected to cause to businesses and residents along its path. In 1972, there were plans to extend Route 17 past Route 3 to Interstate 280 in Harrison. The plans for this five-mile (eight kilometer), $50 million extension were cancelled due to the defeat of a transportation bond that would have funded the proposed freeway.
