5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient <b>pressure.</b> <b>In</b> the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> <b>In</b> all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|Efficient {{decompression}} {{from high}} pressures should start by rapidly halving the absolute pressure, {{followed by a}} slower ascent {{to ensure that the}} partial <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> the tissues does not at any stage exceed about twice the ambient pressure.|$|E

5|$|When workers leave a {{pressurized}} caisson or a {{mine that}} has been pressurized to keep water out, they will experience {{a significant reduction in}} ambient pressure.

40|$|Oscillotonometry using Dinamap {{machine was}} {{investigated}} for {{the measurement of}} ankle and brachial blood <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> our vascular practice.

Systolic ankle and brachial <b>pressures</b> <b>in</b> 43 patients were compared using the Dinamap and Doppler techniques, and significant correlation was found. Ankle and brachial systolic, diastolic and mean pressures and ankle/brachial pressure indices for all three <b>pressures</b> were measured <b>in</b> a group of 12 normal subjects supine at rest, and after treadmill exercise, {{and a range of}} normal values defined. The main limitation of the Dinamap is its failure to measure pressures below 50 mmHg.

5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective <b>pressure,</b> <b>in</b> this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E

5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> people with hypertension.|$|E

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E

Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>in</b> Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock.
