Postharvest pre-treatments such as hot water dipping (HWD) have been proven successful to reduce storage rot. However, excessive heat during dipping easily induces heat stress and <b>physiological</b> <b>disorders,</b> which only show up after several weeks of cold storage. To develop further the HWD technology, a method for early detection of <b>physiological</b> <b>disorders</b> is desirable. As apples emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in response to stress and ripening, VOC profiling can be a useful tool for detecting the immediate heat stress and latent <b>physiological</b> <b>disorders.</b> In this study, a selected ion-monitoring program was developed for analyzing VOCs from apples (Malus domestica ‘Ingrid Marie’ and ‘Pinova’) dipped in water at 20 and 56 °C for 3 min. VOCs were sampled by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by GC-MS in total ion current mode. From these results, a selected ion-monitoring program was developed which enabled detection of trace VOCs collected by static headspace sampling. The results showed that all apples dipped in 56 °C for 3 min developed visual signs of <b>physiological</b> <b>disorders</b> in cold storage. At the same time, the VOC profile of these apples differed from that of the 20 °C treated apples.

50|$|Qualitative zymoblot is {{of great}} {{potential}} use in diagnosis of human, animal and plant diseases. If a pathogen demonstrates a specific enzyme that is not shared by its host, the technique can be a definitive diagnostic tool. The detection of an enzyme not known to be normally present {{in a sample of}} body fluid (e.g. blood serum, CSF, synovial fluid, milk, tears...etc.) using qualitative zymoblot is an indication of a <b>physiological</b> <b>disorder,</b> inflammatory reaction or pathogenic infection. In all these situations, quantitative zymoblot can be used to determine the severity of the problem. Similarly, replacing biological fluids with non-biological fluids taken from water bodies (or prepared from similar environmental sources) at different locations or depths at different times will allow zymoblot, through detecting enzyme activities, to reveal or monitor microbial load and consequently determine the level of contamination in these sources.|$|E

In a study of the silverleaf whitefly, a pest of other curcurbits family plants including zucchini squash, cucumber, and pumpkin was examined. In particular squash is infected with Squash silverleaf, which is a serious <b>physiological</b> <b>disorder</b> that involves silvering of the surface of leaves, reduction in chlorophyll concentrations and higher reflectance. To combat this disease, insect growth regulator (IGR), pyriproxyfen has been used. This hormone is a juvenile hormone analogue, which affects hormonal balance and chitin in premature insects, which causes deformation and death during molting and pupation stages. Therefore, making pyriproxyfen effective in reducing the whitefly populations. It reduces the fruit damages, and increases the size, weight, and quality of fruit. Effectively, IGR does not kill adult whiteflies, but instead sterilizes the eggs of those adults that are treated. It is also a potent inhibitor of embryogenesis, adult formation and metamorphosis. It kills larva and keeps adults from completing the last nymphal stage. The IGR has low toxicity to mammals, fish, birds and bumblebees.|$|E

His main characters are monsters, and stand out in glaring contrast to the regularity of the plays' structure and versification. The suffering lover Hermione, Roxane or Phèdre is aware of nothing except her suffering and the means whereby it can be relieved.

In a torment of jealousy, she tries to relieve the [...] "pangs of despised love" [...] by having (or, in Phèdre's case, allowing) him {{to be put to}} death, and thus associating him with her own suffering. The depth of tragedy is reached when Hermione realizes that Pyrrhus's love for Andromaque continues beyond the grave, or when Phèdre contrasts the young lovers' purity with her unnaturalness which should be hidden from the light of day.

5000|$|Selective {{auditory}} {{attention or}} selective hearing {{is a type}} of selective attention and involves the auditory system of the nervous system. Selective hearing is characterized as the action in which people focus their attention on a specific source of a sound or spoken words. The sounds and noise in the surrounding environment is heard by the auditory system but only certain parts of the auditory information are processed in the brain. Most often, auditory attention is directed at things people are most interested in hearing. In an article by Krans, Isbell, Giuliano, and Neville (2013), selective auditory attention is defined as the ability to acknowledge some stimuli while ignoring other stimuli that is occurring at the same time. An example of this is a student focusing on a teacher giving a lesson and ignoring the sounds of classmates in a rowdy classroom (p. 53). This is an example of bottlenecking which means that information cannot be processed simultaneously so only some sensory information gets through the [...] "bottleneck" [...] and is processed. A brain simply cannot process all sensory information that is occurring in an environment so only that which is most important is thoroughly processed. Selective hearing is not a <b>physiological</b> <b>disorder</b> but rather it is the capability of humans to block out sounds and noise. It is the notion of ignoring certain things in the surrounding environment. Over the years, there has been increased research in the selectivity of auditory attention, namely selective hearing.|$|E
50|$|PLRV infects {{members of}} the Solanaceae family. The most {{economically}} important host is the Potato, Solanum tuberosum spp. In potato, symptoms of primary infection, infection in the growing season, occurs in the youngest leaves. Leaf margins become necrotic, turning brown and purplish and curl inwards towards {{the center of the}} leaf. Secondary infection, which starts from infected potato culls, produces more severe symptoms. Leaf rolling is more apparent and the entire leaf can become chlorotic and sometimes also has a purple discoloration. Necrosis of the phloem tissue particularly in the haulm is observed after onset of symptoms. Plants infected with PLRV experience stunted growth and produce smaller tubers. Infected tubers retain normal shape but experience necrosis of the vascular tissue. Necrosis of the tuber may not be apparent at harvest and can develop in storage. This usually appears as small brown spots scattered throughout the tissue.Net necrosis of potato is the result of infection by potato leaf roll virus (PLRV). This symptom is caused by the selective death and damage to cells in the vascular tissues of the tuber. The fact that only specific cells within the tuber are affected by this problem while others remain normal causes the characteristic net symptom. Infection by the virus may directly cause the damage to and death of the vascular tissues or the presence of the virus may make these sensitive tissues more susceptible to damage from other stresses. There is a strong resemblance between PLRV net necrosis and another tuber defect known as stem end discoloration (SED). Unlike PLRV, SED is believed to be a <b>physiological</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{multiscale}} {{gas exchange}} model {{was developed to}} perform in silico experiments to evaluate the effect of external storage conditions, fruit size and maturity to the intra-cellular respiration and risks of occurrence of <b>physiological</b> <b>disorders.</b> Pear fruit was chosen as a model system. The approach consists of interconnected models that describe the transport phenomena at the macro and the microscale. First, macroscale model predictions of the most sensitive fruit regions (regions of the lowest and highest O 2 and CO 2 concentration of intact fruits) were performed. Next, the microscale model was applied to quantify intra-cellular metabolic gas concentration of the sensitive regions of the tissue. The in silico study revealed that O 2 concentration of optimal picked pear stored at typical controlled atmosphere condition (2. 5 kPa O 2, 0. 7 kPa CO 2 at - 1 °C) were higher than the Michaëlis-Menten constant for cytochrome c oxidase Km,c, the rate limiting enzyme of the respiration pathway. In contrast to small pears, large pears and extreme low O 2 storage conditions lead to O 2 concentrations well below the Km,c. This most probably leads to fermentation and <b>physiological</b> <b>disorders</b> which have been observed under such conditions.
