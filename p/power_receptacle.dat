2500|$|The {{small hole}} {{near the end}} of the power (non-ground) blades of some NEMA plugs is used for {{convenience}} in manufacturing; if present, it must be of specified diameter and position. Small specialized padlocks are available to fit these holes, allowing [...] "lockout" [...] of hazardous equipment, by physically preventing insertion of locked plugs into a <b>power</b> <b>receptacle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the player}} {{does not have}} control of when the {{dimensions}} are shifted, but later gains access to the Interdimensional Shift Device glove where they can switch to any dimension so long as a battery for that dimension is placed in a <b>power</b> <b>receptacle</b> for that room. In some puzzles, the players must find and locate these batteries; in other cases, the player may have to choose which batteries to insert into place to solve a puzzle.|$|E
5000|$|In most European countries, the {{standard}} mains <b>power</b> <b>receptacle</b> will physically accept banana and even US-style [...] "double banana" [...] plugs ({{the standard}} US pin spacing of 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) is {{close enough to}} the mains plug spacing of about 19 mm, and the pin diameter is also compatible), leading to a risk of electrical shock. For safety reasons, {{it can be difficult to}} purchase US-style laboratory [...] "double banana" [...] plugs in these countries.|$|E
50|$|<b>Power</b> points (<b>receptacles,</b> plugs, wallsockets) {{need to be}} {{installed}} throughout the house in locations where power will be required. In many areas the installation must be done in compliance with standards and by a licensed or qualified electrician. Power points are typically located where {{there will be an}} appliance installed such as, telephone, computers, television, home theater, security system, CCTV system.|$|R
40|$|The Mobile Integrated Temporary Utility System (MITUS) {{integrates}} portable {{electrical power}} along with communications and emergency alarm and lighting capabilities to provide safe, centralized power to work areas {{that need to}} be de-energized for decommissioning work. MITUS consists of a portable unit substation; up to twenty portable kiosks that house the <b>power</b> <b>receptacles,</b> communications, and emergency alarm and lighting systems; and a central communications unit. This system makes sequential decommissioning efforts efficient and cost-effective by allowing the integrated system to remain intact while being moved to subsequent work sites. Use of the MITUS also eliminates the need to conduct zero-energy tests and implement associated lock-out/tag-out procedures at partially de-energized facilities. Since the MITUS is a designed system, it can be customized to accommodate unique facility conditions simply by varying kiosks and transformer configurations. The MITUS is an attractive alternate to the use of portable generators with stand-alone communications and emergency system. It is more cost-effective than upgrading or reconfiguring existing power distribution systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} layer defines: a) passive interconnect (e. g., cables and connectors); and b) {{transmitter and receiver}} device electrical characteristics. Within this standard, references to connector gender use the terms plug and receptacle as equivalent to the terms free and fixed, respectively, {{that may be used}} in the references that define the connectors. Fixed and free terminolgy has no relationship to the application of the connector. 5. 2 Passive interconnect 5. 2. 1 SATA cables and connectors Figure 49 shows a schematic representation of the cables and connectors defined by SATA (see ATA/ATAPI- 7 V 3).

5000|$|Bender {{is powered}} by alcohol-based fuels, which he can convert into an {{electrical}} power source sufficient to operate not only himself, but also small household appliances plugged into his <b>power</b> <b>receptacle.</b> Low alcohol intake levels decrease his production of electricity: when he stops drinking and begins to [...] "sober", his behavior grows increasingly ebrious and dysfunctional, and he grows a red beard of rust. He is also, apparently, able to sustain himself by consuming mineral oil, though he considers this to be only 'functional'.|$|E
5000|$|Lighting and <b>power</b> <b>receptacle</b> {{circuits}} in North American {{systems are}} typically radial from a distribution panel containing circuit breakers to protect each branch circuit. The smallest branch circuit rating is 15 amperes, used for general purpose receptacles and lighting. Often, 20 ampere circuits {{are used for}} general purpose receptacles and lighting. In residential construction, branch circuits for higher ratings are usually dedicated to one appliance, for example, fixed cooking appliances, electric clothes dryers, and air conditioners. Lighting and general purpose receptacles are at 120 volts AC, with larger devices fed by three wire single-phase circuits at 240 volts.|$|E
5000|$|Bender was {{designed}} specifically for the relatively simple task of bending straight metal girders into various angles. Despite this apparent simplicity, he possesses numerous features superfluous to his original purpose, which become more apparent after an electric jolt to his antenna from an overhead light socket in the pilot episode. The scope of Bender's functionality is impressive; he often acts {{as if he were}} a multifunctional gadget rather than a special bending machine. Similar to a contemporary computer, he hosts a number of input/output devices: his head has a data socket and remotely operated volume control. His body has a socket for a microphone jack, a dual-socket <b>power</b> <b>receptacle,</b> a reset button, a kill switch, and a self-destruct button. Having the hardware-based self-destruct control on his body, rather than in his software, prevents Bender from committing suicide in [...] "A Head in the Polls" [...] when he pawns everything but his head, grows desperate without it and desires to kill himself.|$|E
50|$|Carrel desks {{are most}} often found in {{university}} or college libraries. Most carrel desks are rectangular in shape. Above the main desktop area {{there is often a}} shelf for books. Sometimes the seat is integrated with the carrel desk. Unlike the cubicle desk, carrel desks usually have no file drawers or other facilities. Since the late 1990s, some carrel desk designs provide AC <b>power</b> and Ethernet <b>receptacles</b> for students using laptop computers.|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} connectors were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A receptacles on host devices that supply <b>power</b> and type-B <b>receptacles</b> on target devices that draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible.|$|R
50|$|Equipment {{intended}} to be <b>powered</b> by the <b>receptacle</b> needs to account for intermittent contact, and voltages outside the nominal 12 V DC, such as maximum voltage 9-16 V continuously, or maximum voltage of 20 V lasting 1 hour, 24 V lasting 1 minute, and 40 V lasting 400 ms. An example of protection component ratings tolerance is +50 to −60 V DC. Robust equipment must tolerate temperatures varying between , plus possible high humidity and condensation of water.|$|R
40|$|Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{standards}} {{are a major}} step towards the realization of a worldwide information grid. Just as power system standards allow the connection of either a microwave oven or a television set into a <b>power</b> <b>receptacle,</b> so ISDN will allow information appliances, such as facsimile machines, computer terminals, and telephones to plug into a standard socket. It {{will be possible to}} move office equipment either down the hall or around the world and immediately “plug in ” to the information grid. ISDN will allow the travelling worker to communicate (using portable computers and facsimile machines) with customers or manufacturing sites worldwide. And this will be accomplished without modems, which slow data transmission rates. One of the larger technical problems in achieving such...|$|E

5000|$|A {{good quality}} power {{conditioner}} is designed with internal filter banks {{to isolate the}} individual <b>power</b> outlets or <b>receptacles</b> on the <b>power</b> conditioner. This eliminates interference or [...] "cross-talk" [...] between components. For example, if the application will be a home theater system, the noise suppression rating listed in the technical specifications of the power conditioner will be very important. This rating is expressed in decibels (db). The higher the db rating, the better the noise suppression.|$|R
2500|$|NEMA {{connectors}} are <b>power</b> plugs and <b>receptacles</b> {{used for}} AC mains electricity in North America {{and other countries}} that use the standards set by the US National Electrical Manufacturers Association. [...] NEMA wiring devices are made in current ratings from 15 to 60 amperes (A), with voltage ratings from 125 to 600 volts (V). Different combinations of contact blade widths, shapes, orientation, and dimensions create non-interchangeable connectors that are unique for each combination of voltage, electric current carrying capacity, and grounding system.|$|R
50|$|The {{authority}} {{can give}} a householder notice that waste must be disposed of in a specified receptacle, and in a specified manner (s.46). It is a crime to fail, without reasonable excuse, to observe such requirements. On summary conviction in a Magistrates' Court, an offender can be fined up to level 3 on the standard scale (s.46(6)). Authorities also have <b>powers</b> over <b>receptacles</b> for commercial and industrial waste (s.47). There is a system of fixed penalty notices for offences under these sections (ss.47ZA-47ZB). Where controlled waste is deposited on land within their responsibilities,authorities may give notice to the occupier to remove it (ss.59-59A). It is a crime to disturb or sort over, unless with consent, waste deposited for collection by the waste collection authority. On summary conviction in a Magistrates' Court, an offender can be fined up to level 5 on the standard scale (s.60).|$|R
