More research on pressure ulcers has been conducted in healthy persons or residents of nursing homes than in critically ill patients. Thus, the optimal elevation for the head of the bed to balance the risks for aspiration and pressure ulcers in critically ill patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation and tube feedings is unknown.

The institutionalisation of IKS in South Africa has the potential to influence the balance of power between techno-centric and socio-centric approaches to local ICT research and development.

40|$|International audienceQC-MDPC-McEliece is {{a recent}} variant of the McEliece {{encryption}} scheme which enjoys relatively small key sizes {{as well as a}} security reduction to hard problems of coding theory. Furthermore, it remains secure against a quantum adversary and is very well suited to low cost implementations on embedded devices. Decoding MDPC codes is achieved with the (iterative) bit flipping algorithm, as for LDPC codes. Variable time decoders might leak some information on the code structure (that is on the sparse parity check equations) and must be avoided. A constant time decoder is easy to emulate, but its running time depends on the worst case rather than on the average case. So far implementations were focused on minimizing the average cost. We show that the tuning of the algorithm is not the same to reduce the maximal number of iterations as for reducing the average cost.

40|$|Based on {{a series}} of field surveys {{conducted}} among a cross-section of eight French MNCs located in three Central and Eastern European countries (Hungary, Slovakia, Romania) and present in three sectors of activity (energy, car industry, food-processing), the present paper offers some evidence for understanding the impact of trans-nationalization of production on the re-composition of Industrial Relations rules and practices. By exploring the new layout of Human Resources policies in MNCs, it stresses the growing incursion of those policies in the very field of industrial relations, and consequently the affirmation of a new paradigm of social dialogue we propose to call “managerial social dialogue”. By focusing on the strategies of Labor Unions at national and EU levels, it also <b>provides</b> <b>some</b> <b>indications</b> of obstacles to the consolidation of the European Social Model whose institutional process remains largely incomplete.

40|$|The Chinese {{practice}} of soft power and public diplomacy has prompted {{a great deal}} of discussion, evaluation, controversy and criticism from both practitioners and scholars. This study attempts to assess the compatibility of China's soft power strategy in the Australian discourse in the climate change context through the examination of Australian framing China's environmental images. Inductive framing analysis is conducted to reveal news frames of China's environmental image in the two Australian broadsheets in three cases. The analysis shows that there are four generic frames, which compose the conceptual framework of the evaluation of environmental image. Moreover, there are eight types of environmental images of China portrayed by the Australian broadsheets. The empirical findings demonstrate the proposition that China's soft power strategy is not compatible with the Australian media discourse in the context of climate change. The analysis of the valence of these eight environmental images also <b>provides</b> <b>some</b> <b>indications</b> to the exercise of China's soft power and public diplomacy in the Australian context, perhaps extendable to the larger Western context. 20 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Examining the origins, conduct, {{conclusions}} of, {{and reactions}} to, previous budget reviews <b>provides</b> <b>some</b> <b>indications</b> {{about how the}} current National Commission of Audit might unfold. Introduction On 22 October 2013 the Abbott Government announced {{the appointment of a}} National Commission of Audit. In announcing the review, Treasurer Joe Hockey and Finance Minister Cormann said ‘[i]t is …essential that the Commonwealth government live within its means and begin to pay down debt’. The review, headed {{by the president of the}} Business Council of Australia, Tony Shepherd AO, has broad terms of reference that are intended to allow it to ‘assess the role and scope of Government, as well as ensuring taxpayers’ money is spent wisely and in an efficient manner. 2 ̆ 7 The other members of the Commission are the current head of the New South Wales Independent Regulatory and Pricing Tribunal, Dr Peter Boxall AO, former public servants Tony Cole AO and Robert Fisher AM, and former politician Amanda Vanstone. The appointment of the current Commission of Audit has not passed without criticism. For example, the Shadow Finance Minister, Tony Burke has described the review as a ‘Commission of Cuts,’ and declared that it was ‘an extraordinary outsourcing of the responsibilities of Government across to big business’. The current National Commission of Audit is but one in a long series of budget reviews that have been conducted by Commonwealth, state and territory governments in Australia. Many previous reviews have largely been forgotten by the general public and sometimes even by the governments that have commissioned them. Others provided broad recommendations that have assisted in providing coherence and purpose to what have usually been new administrations. Examining the origins, conduct and conclusions of, and reactions to previous reviews <b>provides</b> <b>some</b> <b>indications</b> about how the current National Commission of Audit might unfold. While every review is inevitably a product of its time and the political and economic circumstances in which it was commissioned, there are recurring themes that emerge from many of these exercises. Arguably, the general nature of the findings and recommendations of budget reviews can be broadly predicted, but how—and even if—governments respond to them cannot.   Examining past reviews may also show whether the current review has provided genuinely new approaches to managing and prioritising Commonwealth expenditure and service delivery, or has rehashed well-worn policy prescriptions posed repeatedly by prior reviews...|$|E
30|$|First, {{we focus}} {{on the extent to which}} {{doctoral}} students in German-speaking countries are familiar with a set of accounting journals and how they assess the quality of the journals. We show that familiarity with US mainstream journals, European Accounting Review (EAR) and German academic journals is high, while familiarity with Accounting, Organizations and Society (AOS) and, in particular, Critical Perspectives on Accounting (CPA) is far more limited. With regard to the second research question our study reveals that doctoral students in the German-speaking setting use various different methods and that many doctoral students approach their topics with the aid of multiple methods. At the same time, our analysis <b>provides</b> <b>some</b> <b>indications</b> that the structured approach to doctoral education, which goes hand in hand with an emphasis on internationalisation, seems to be primarily related to the adoption of quantitative empirical methods. While empirical qualitative doctoral researchers also tend to be internationally oriented, their absolute number remains relatively small.
