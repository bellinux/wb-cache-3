5|$|While Bissell showed early {{promise as}} a dancer, he also {{showed signs of}} being a troubled young man and began taking drugs {{at the age of}} 14. He was {{expelled}} from his first school for dealing drugs on the premises. He was noticed by the American ballet dancer Edward Villella, who encouraged his parents to send him to a performing arts boarding school. In 1972 he joined the National Academy of Dance in Champaign, Illinois from which he was dismissed for behavior problems. Bissell then spent a year at the North Carolina School of the Arts which he left when he was informed that he should <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his academic studies. He hitch-hiked all the way to New York to pursue a lifelong career in dance as that's where the company's top schools are. He then won a scholarship to study at the School of American Ballet, where he was encouraged by Lincoln Kirstein, its founder, and Stanley Williams, one of his teachers. He was invented to join Balanchine's New York City Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre. He decided to join ABT and {{became a member of the}} corps. Though he quickly rose through the ranks.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Sinai {{has been}} the site of several terror attacks against tourists, the {{majority}} of whom are Egyptian.

He wanted Germany preserved as a major power as a block to Russian influence, possibly gaining Austria to compensate for the loss of her colonies, Alsace-Lorraine and her North Sea and Baltic ports (including the Kiel Canal).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the French success in the Heineken Cup and Champions Cup, the clubs in the lower European competitions have achieved similar results. The first four finals of the European Challenge Cup (1997–2000) were all-French affairs. Since then, however, only four French clubs (Clermont in 2007, Biarritz in 2012, Montpellier in 2016, and Stade Français in 2017) have won this competition, and French clubs in general have had less success; the revised Top 16/Top 14 format has required them to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> league games {{in order to avoid}} relegation. The now defunct European Shield, a repechage tournament for clubs knocked out {{in the first round of}} the Challenge Cup that was played for three seasons in 2003–05, was won by a French team each time.|$|E
25|$|The Bazaar and caravanserai were {{constructed}} {{as an integral}} part of the complex, initially to provide the construction workers with accommodation and facilities for their wellbeing, and later as a place for trade, the revenue of which supplemented the expenses of the complex. The area became a small town in its own right during and after the building of the Taj. Originally known as 'Mumtazabad', today it is called Taj Ganji or 'Taj Market'. Its plan took the characteristic form of a square divided by two cross axial streets with gates to the four cardinal points. Bazaars lined each street and the resultant squares to each corner housed the caravanserais in open courtyards accessed from internal gates from where the streets intersected (Chauk). Contemporary sources <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the north eastern and western parts of the Taj Ganji (Taj Market) and it is likely that only this half received imperial funding. Thus, the quality of the architecture was finer than the southern half.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} year Parnell {{remained}} a reserved observer of parliamentary proceedings. He first came to attention {{in the public eye}} when in 1876 he claimed in the Commons that he did not believe that any murder had been committed by Fenians in Manchester. This drew the interest of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), a physical force Irish organisation that had staged a rebellion in 1867. Parnell made it his business to cultivate Fenian sentiments both in Britain and Ireland and became associated with the more radical wing of the Home Rule League, which included Joseph Biggar (MP for Cavan from 1874), John O'Connor Power (MP for County Mayo from 1874) (both, although constitutionalists, had links with the IRB), Edmund Dwyer-Gray (MP for Tipperary from 1877), and Frank Hugh O'Donnell (MP for Dungarvan from 1877). He engaged with them and played a leading role in a policy of obstructionism (i.e., the use of technical procedures to disrupt the House of Commons' ability to function) to force the House to <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Irish issues, which had previously been ignored. Obstruction involved giving lengthy speeches which were largely irrelevant to the topic at hand. This behaviour was opposed by the less aggressive chairman (leader) of the Home Rule League, Isaac Butt.|$|E

30|$|Increased mind {{wandering}} and <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> one’s own thoughts, emotions, {{and experiences}} have been related with {{low levels of}} self-esteem (Mrazek, et al. 2013). Nevertheless, <b>paying</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> oneself is not necessarily considered a negative activity for self-esteem. So mindfulness is considered a construct that contrasts with mind wandering (Mrazek, Smallwood, and Schooler, 2012 b). The mindfulness construct has been defined in many forms, and all its definitions coincide in that {{it is a matter of}} <b>paying</b> intentionally <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the present time and not taking a judgemental attitude about experience (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Germer, 2005; Kabat-Zinn, 1990; Segal, Williams and Teasdale, 2002). This non-judgemental attitude makes mindfulness appear positively related with self-esteem (Kong, Wang, and Zhao, 2014; Rasmussen and Pidgeon, 2011). In turn, self-esteem is considered a predictor of satisfaction with life (Diener and Diener, 1995; Mäkikangas and Kinnunen, 2003). Hence, the aforementioned factors may be considered modulators in the relation between mind wandering and satisfaction with life.|$|R
25|$|There were roughly three {{positions}} {{on the future of}} the Dutch economy. The CDA claimed that the reforms were finished and that the following cabinet would not have to take any serious measures. The VVD wanted to continue reforming to increase the performance of the Dutch economy. They wanted to continue to cut taxes and reduce bureaucracy. The opposition parties PvdA, SP, GL, joined by the ChristianUnion wanted to revert some of the measures and <b>pay</b> <b>more</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the public sector, especially to the health care-sector and the poor. The PvdA and the GreenLeft however also announced that they wanted to reform part of the economy and welfare system. For instance several months before the elections, Wouter Bos, the leader of Labour Party, announced that he wanted to tax the elderly pension in such a way that rich elderly would pay more taxes on their pensions than poor elderly. The Dutch pension system consists of government supplied (AOW) and mandatory self-saved pensions. It is the latter portion Bos wanted to tax progressively. The proposal led to considerable controversy, both outside and within Bos' own party. Former minister and de Volkskrant columnist Marcel van Dam wrote a critical column on 22 June concerning Bos' proposal. The second man of the Christian Democratic Appeal Maxime Verhagen used soundbites from the proposal continually to emphasise that the PvdA was an unreliable partner for the elderly. Bos later moderated his plans: only new cases would pay taxes over their pension.|$|E
