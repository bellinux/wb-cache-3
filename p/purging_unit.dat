(Prior to this, various American regiments {{had been using}} a variety of different manuals, making it difficult to manoeuvre any large American force). Scott also <b>purged</b> his <b>units</b> of any remaining inefficient officers who had gained their appointments through political influence rather than experience or merit, and he insisted on proper camp discipline including sanitary arrangements.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{automated}} dynamic chamber system which is optimised for continuous unattended flux measurements of multiple non-reactive and reactive trace gases on grassland ecosystems. Main design features {{of our system}} are (a) highly transparent chamber walls consisting of chemically inert material, (b) individual <b>purging</b> flow <b>units</b> for each chamber, and (c) a movable lid for automated opening and closing of the chamber. The purging flow rate was chosen high {{enough to keep the}} mean residence time of the chamber air below one minute. This guarantees a proven efficient mixing of the chamber volume and a fast equilibration after lid closing. The dynamic chamber system is able to measure emission as well as deposition fluxes of trace gases. For the latter case, the modification of the turbulent transport by the chamber (compared to undisturbed ambient conditions) is quantitatively described by a bulk resistance concept. Beside {{a detailed description of the}} design and functioning of the system, results of field applications at two grassland sites are presented. In the first experiment, fluxes of five trace gases (CO 2 , H 2 O, NO, NO 2 , O 3 ) were measured simultaneously on small grassland plots. It showed that the dynamic chamber system is able to detect the characteristic diurnal cycles with a sufficient temporal resolution. The results also demonstrated the importance of considering the chemical source/sink in the chamber due to gas phase reactions for the reactive compounds of the NO-NO 2 -O 3 triad. In a second field experiment, chamber flux measurements of CO 2 and methanol were compared to simultaneous independent eddy covariance flux measurements on the field scale. The fluxes obtained with the two methods showed a very good agreement indicating a minimal disturbance of the chambers on the physiological activity of the enclosed vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} this research was to develop a low cost, reliable system that would lead to early detection of lung cancer. Tests involved the quantitation of gaseous metabolic emissions from immortalized lung cancer cell lines in order to correlate the chemical markers to be of cancerous origin. The specific aims of the project were the study of gas emissions in selected cancer cell lines and identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in them. Disadvantages of earlier studies were that the measurements were not real time or state specific so that molecular identification was often inconclusive. Furthermore the methods of study used in the past were not quantitative, which limited their practicality for medical applications. We felt the need to prove or disprove these earlier results using a new technique. The method we proposed is different and unique when compared to previous methods because cell lines have not been studied extensively for cancer markers. We have studied cancer cell lines which are adherent, immortalized cultures originating from primary tumors obtained from patients with no prior treatment for lung cancer. We have used an alternative method for the spectrometric analysis and quantitation of the selected chemical markers. The pre-concentration method involved a <b>Purge</b> and Trap <b>unit</b> with a thermal desorber where the vapor concentration was enhanced. The concentrated head space gases were analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph ?? Mass Spectrometer setup. This setup eliminated the bulky apparatus used in earlier studies. It is simpler in design and more comprehensive so that external factors such as patient??s diet, habitat and lifestyle do not contribute to our study of recognition of cancer markers. Based on the results obtained in the above experiments, a more comprehensive, inexpensive study of lung cancer related markers could be made. The first section, after giving an introduction to lung cancer, goes on to explain the background work done by other researchers on cancer. The third section gives a detailed explanation of the experimental setup. This is followed by all the tests conducted with corresponding results. The final section deals with the conclusions drawn from all experiments...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences & IndustryElizabeth A. BoyleQuality {{attributes}} of vacuum packaged, skinless smoked sausage {{made with a}} combination of pork, turkey, and beef, cooked to 64, 68, or 72 °C internal endpoint temperature following USDA FSIS Appendix A, and displayed at 4 °C for up to 120 days under light emitting diode (LED) and fluorescent (FLS) lighting were evaluated. External color, pH, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), proximate analysis, reheat yield, and sensory attributes were measured on day 0, 90, and 120 of display. Purge amount and color were measured on day 10, 90, and 120. Product was displayed in LED or FLS retail display cases set to the same operational and temperature profiles. Lighting type had no effect (P> 0. 05) on any of the measured attributes. Instrumental external color was less (P< 0. 05) red by 0. 63 units in product thermally processed to 64 °C than product processed to 68 °C. Product cooked to 72 °C was less (P< 0. 05) yellow externally compared to those processed to 64 and 68 °C. Purge color lightness increased (P< 0. 05) in product thermally processed to 72 compared to 64 °C. Purge was more red by 0. 36 units (P< 0. 05) on day 120 compared to day 10. Yellowness of purge color increased at 72 °C compared to 64 °C by 0. 66 <b>units.</b> <b>Purge</b> was more yellow (P< 0. 05) on d 120 compared to d 10 and 90. TBARS values decreased (P< 0. 05) from 0. 70 mg of malonaldehyde/ 100 g on day 0 to 0. 35 and 0. 23 on d 90 and 120, respectively. Sensory panel scores showed that flavor intensity decreased (P< 0. 05) as day of storage increased, and saltiness decreased from d 0 to d 90. Purge content increased (P< 0. 05) from 1. 45 % to 1. 90 % in products cooked to 64 and 68 °C, respectively. The amount of purge increased (P< 0. 05) from 1. 58 % to 1. 92 % on day 10 and 90, respectively. While there were slight changes found in quality characteristics of smoked sausages during storage, many of these were minimal. Processors could reduce their internal endpoint temperature following USDA FSIS Appendix A guidelines with minimal effect on product quality. Vacuum packaged pre-cooked smoked sausages could be displayed under LED or FLS lighting with no effect on product quality...|$|R
