In this paper we apply this method to a proof due to Shioji and Takahashi on the convergence of Halpern iterations in spaces X with a uniformly Gâteaux differentiable norm. We design a logical metatheorem guaranteeing the extractability of highly uniform rates of metastability under the stronger condition of the uniform smoothness of X. Combined with our method of eliminating Banach limits this yields a full quantitative analysis of the proof by Shioji and Takahashi. We also give a sufficient condition for the computability of the rate of convergence of Halpern iterations...|$|R

40|$|Proof Mining {{consists}} in extracting from <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> non-constructive <b>proofs</b> constructive information. For that purpose many techniques mostly based on negative translation, realizability, functional interpretation, A-translation and combinations thereof have been developed. After introducing various {{different approaches to}} Proof Mining we present an application of `monotone functional interpretation' to a modification of a classical proof from 1921 of uniqueness of L 1 -approximation of continuous functions by polynomials of degree # n. From that proof we extracted the first effective uniform rate of strong uniqueness (also called `uniform modulus of uniqueness') for L 1 -approximation, which existence had been studied for 80 years but always in a non-constructive manner. For that reason, previous results only stated the dependencies of the modulus but explicit constants had never been obtained. We also show how this modulus of uniqueness {{can be used to}} compute the actual best L 1 -approximation of the given continuous functions on a compact interval. Finally, we analyze the complexity of the resulting algorithm using the tools of Computable Analysis (cf. [Ko 91] and [Wei 00]). The first part of this work (the extraction of the uniform modulus of uniqueness) has been concluded, the last two parts are under development. This report also includes indications of future areas of work. ...|$|R

These metatheorems {{for the first time}} cover general classes of structures like arbitrary metric, hyperbolic, CAT(0) and normed linear spaces and guarantee the independence of the bounds from parameters ranging over metrically bounded (not necessarily compact!) spaces. Recently (in [P. Gerhardy, U. Kohlenbach, General logical metatheorems for functional analysis, 2005, p. 42 (submitted for publication) ]), the authors obtained generalizations of these metatheorems which allow one to prove similar uniformities even for unbounded spaces as long as certain local boundedness conditions are satisfied. The use of classical logic imposes some severe restrictions on the formulas and proofs for which the extraction can be carried out. In this paper we consider similar metatheorems for semi-intuitionistic proofs, i. e. proofs in an intuitionistic setting enriched with certain non-constructive principles. Contrary to the classical case, there are practically no restrictions on the logical complexity of theorems for which bounds can be extracted. Again, our metatheorems guarantee very general uniformities, even in cases where the existence of uniform bounds is not obtainable by (ineffective) straightforward functional analytic means. Already in the purely intuitionistic case, where the existence of effective bounds is implicit, the metatheorems allow one to derive uniformities that may not be obvious at all from a given constructive proof. Finally, we illustrate our main metatheorem by an example from metric fixed point theory...|$|R

40|$|Challenging {{traditional}} antitrust jurisprudence, Professor Alan J. Meese {{argues that}} the present structure of Rule of Reason analysis, applied pursuant to Standard Oil v. United States, has become outdated. The Rule of Reason as currently applied by the courts rests upon neoclassical price theory, an economic paradigm that assumes that legitimate competition consists of unbridled technological rivalry, unconstrained by nonstandard contracts. Recently, however, the Supreme Court has begun to apply a competing paradigm- Transaction Cost Economics-when determining whether a contract is unreasonable 2 ̆ 2 per se 2 ̆ 2 or instead deserving of Rule of Reason scrutiny. Professor Meese argues that Transaction Cost Economics more accurately reflects market realities {{with the result that}} courts should also apply the teachings of this new paradigm when conducting Rule of Reason analysis. Accordingly, Professor Meese concludes that courts should abandon the current three-part Rule of Reason inquiry in those cases where nonstandard contracts avoid per se treatment because they plausibly produce nontechnological efficiencies by overcoming a market failure. In such cases, proof that a contract results in prices or other terms of trade different from those that preexist a restraint should not suffice to establish a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. Further, <b>proof</b> that contractual integration combats a market failure should, in any event, rebut a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case, eliminating the need for courts to balance 2 ̆ 2 anticompetitive harms 2 ̆ 2 against procompetitive benefits. Finally, because the less restrictive alternative element of Rule of Reason analysis rests upon an assumption that any benefits of a nonstandard contract coexist with procompetitive effects, courts should abandon this element when analyzing restraints that purportedly combat market failure...|$|R
