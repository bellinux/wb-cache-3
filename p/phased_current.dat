40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the control of the turn-on angle used to excite the switched reluctance motor (SRM). The control algorithm determines the turn-on angle that supports the most efficient operation of the motor drive system, and can be divided in two fractions. One fraction of the control algorithm monitors the position of the first peak of the <b>phase</b> <b>current</b> (θp) and seeks to align this position with the angle where the inductance begins to increase (θm). The second fraction of the controller algorithm monitors the peak <b>phase</b> <b>current</b> and advances the turn-on angle if the commanded reference current cannot be produced by the controller. The first fraction of the controller tends to be active below nominal speed of the SRM, where <b>phase</b> <b>currents</b> can be built easily by the inverter and θp is relatively independent of θm. The second fraction of the controller is active above nominal speed, where the peak of the <b>phase</b> <b>currents</b> tends to naturally occur at θm regardless of the current amplitude.
