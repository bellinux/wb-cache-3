Local princes feared him, but the masses liked him... An independent and clever first hierarch and ruler was unacceptable neither for Tibet, nor for the Chinese".|$|R
50|$|When the {{government}} announces quotas to increase women's political representation, Annasaheb, an MLA {{for the past}} 30 years, compels his intelligent daughter Vasudha to take over from him and continue so that nothing changes {{for him and his}} family.

60|$|In {{a minute}} the gate was thrown back, and an aged man came out, {{followed}} by several women. The {{age of the}} king was nearly eighty-five, and he was from first to last a mere <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of others. <b>In</b> no case would he have been executed by the government, since {{the old man was}} clearly beyond any active participation in what had taken place.|$|R

50|$|His {{tenure of}} Diwan ended with demise of Dharma Raja Karthika Thirunal in 1798.

Raja Kesavadas was proclaimed as a traitor and kept under house arrest which helped Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri to usurp the post of Diwan. Later his family assets were confiscated and was poisoned to death on 21 April 1799.|$|R
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} all retired to bed. They had had little sleep the night before, {{and the day}} had been full of events.

50|$|John Erskine {{was born}} in 1558, though the precise date is unknown.Together with King James VI of Scotland he was educated by George Buchanan. After {{attaining}} his majority he was nominally the guardian of the young king, who was about seven years his junior, and who lived with him at Stirling; {{but he was in}} reality something of a <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of the regent, James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton; and he lost power and position when Morton was imprisoned.|$|R

25|$|In the 15th {{century the}} whole area changed {{dramatically}} in all possible aspects: linguistic, cultural, political, etc. During that period the Kingdom of Georgia turned into an isolated, fractured Christian enclave, {{a relic of the}} faded East Roman epoch surrounded by a Muslim, predominantly Turco-Iranian world. During the three subsequent centuries, the Georgian rulers maintained their perilous autonomy as subjects under the Turkish Ottoman and Iranian Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar domination, although sometimes serving as little more than <b>puppets</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of their powerful suzerains.|$|R
50|$|King Henry pardoned young Simnel (probably {{because he}} {{recognised}} that Simnel had merely been a <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of adults) {{and put him}} {{to work in the}} royal kitchen as a spit-turner. When he grew older, he became a falconer. Almost no information about his later life is known. He died some time between 1525 and 1535. He seems to have married, as he is probably the father of Richard Simnel, a canon of St Osyth's Priory in Essex during the reign of Henry VIII.|$|R

50|$|Subsequently, whan the Hoyasala Vira Narasimha's {{successor}} Someshvara, {{desirous of}} making the Chalukya Chola ruler a <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> his <b>hands,</b> joined hands with the Pandyas and attacked Rajendra III, Choda TiKka {{came to the rescue}} of the Chola emperor. He defeated both the Hoyasala and the Pandyan forces and got thereby the Thondai Nadu (Tondaimandalam) region for himself. He even assumed the title Cholasthapanacharya. During the reign of Tikka's son and successor Manumasiddhi II (1248-1263), the power of the Nellore Cholas was at its low ebb.|$|R
50|$|Jogeswar Singha {{along with}} his family arrived Jogighopa under British escort. Shortly after his arrival, he fell ill and died, in 1825 CE. Being a <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of the Burmese, Jogeswar Singha was unable to {{exercise}} any authority, during his reign. People use to refer him as “Maane pota Raja”, means king installed by Burmese. His reign was marked by the atrocities committed by Burmese on Assamese, and the people recalled those days with terror as “Maanor Din”, literally the days of Burmese(Assamese refer Burmese as Myan or Maan).|$|R
50|$|Poland was {{likewise}} in {{the midst}} of great political turmoil at the time of Hofbauer's arrival in 1787. King Stanislaus II was virtually a <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of Catherine II of Russia. Fifteen years earlier, the first partition of the country had taken place—with Austria, Russia, and Prussia dividing the spoils. A similar partition was to occur again in 1793 and for a third time in 1795. Napoleon and his great army of conquest marching through Europe added to the political tension. During Hofbauer's 21 years in Warsaw, there was hardly a peaceful moment.|$|R
60|$|Eustace {{had never}} seen Augusta but twice in his life; but then passion does not {{necessarily}} depend upon constant previous intercourse with its object. Love at first sight is common enough, and in this instance Eustace was not altogether dependent upon the spoken words of his adored, or on his recollection of her very palpable beauty. For he had her books. To those who know something of the writer--sufficient, let us say, to enable him to put an approximate value {{on his or her}} sentiments, so as to form a more or less accurate guess as to when, he is speaking from his own mind, when he is speaking from the mind of the <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> and when he is merely putting a case--a person's books are full of information, and bring that person into a closer and more intimate contact with the reader than any amount of personal intercourse. For whatever is best and whatever is worst in an individual will be reflected in his pages, seeing that, unless he is the poorest of hack authors, he must of necessity set down therein the images that pass across the mirrors of his heart.|$|R

This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave.

50|$|The {{aged and}} childless brother of Gustav III, Charles XIII was made king in 1809, {{but he was}} a mere <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of the Estates and the {{question}} of his successor had to be solved. The election, by the Riksdag of the Estates, of the French Marshal and Prince of Ponte Corvo Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte in 1810, provided not only a successor, but also a vital regent and a new dynasty. The rights of Bernadotte's successors to accede to the Swedish throne were codified in an amendment to the constitution {{in the form of the}} Act of Succession (1810).|$|R

60|$|The jealousy of the Venetian patricians on {{the subject}} of their Doge is matter of history. He was, by situation, a <b>puppet</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hands</b> of the nobles, who only tolerated his existence, because the theory of their {{government}} required a seeming agent in the imposing ceremonies that formed part of their specious system, and in their intercourse with other states. He dwelt in his palace like the queen-bee in the hive, pampered and honored to the eye, but in truth devoted to the objects of those who alone possess the power to injure, and perhaps we might add, like the insect named, known for consuming more than a usual portion of the fruits of the common industry.|$|R
