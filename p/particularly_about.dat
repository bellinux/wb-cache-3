5|$|As the British {{government}} has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according {{to the laws of}} the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the Duke himself appoint a council. Sébastien de Charolais arrives and presents his claim to the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body which includes the local policeman, Spiller, and the manager of the bank branch, Mr. Wix; the neighbourhood shop keeper, Arthur Pemberton, is appointed as Burgundy's Prime Minister. The council begin discussions with the government, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> the Burgundian treasure.|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E
5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E

5|$|He {{authored}} {{books and}} law journal articles, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> public law in Malaysia and Singapore; {{some of the}} latter were collected into two works, Essays in Malaysian Law (1991) and Essays in Singapore Law (1992). In 1995, in recognition of his reputation and standing in the legal profession, he was appointed adjunct {{professor of law at}} the Centre of South East Asian Law at Charles Darwin University in Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia. Until 2006, Hickling continued travelling to the Far East and Australia, delivering lectures, reviewing examination papers and visiting friends, colleagues and students. Despite his many accolades, he lived simply and impressed staff and students with his disarming humility. In addition to his legal writings, Hickling wrote novels and short stories, mostly drawing on his experiences of life in different British colonies. Hickling was appointed a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) in 1968 and a Queen's Counsel (Gibraltar) in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{treaties}} were signed, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, acting {{in his capacity}} as US Indian agent, visited La Pointe. He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E
5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E

25|$|The first {{libraries}} in Ljubljana {{were located}} in monasteries. The first public library was the Carniolan Estates' Library, established in1569 by Primož Trubar. In the 17thcentury, the Jesuit Library collected numerous works, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> mathematics. In1707, the Seminary Library was established; {{it is the first}} and oldest public scientific library in Slovenia. Around1774, after the dissolution of Jesuits, the Lyceum Library was formed from the remains of the Jesuit Library as well as several monastery libraries.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the written}} standard, the Austrian Warmblood {{is built on}} a mare base of old Austrian cavalry horses such as the Nonius, Furioso-North Star, Shagya and Gidran. Foreign warmblood sport horse bloodlines have been and will {{continue}} to be used to produce a horse more suitable for modern-day dressage and show jumping. Refinement comes from Thoroughbred, Shagya Arabian and Trakehner blood. The combination of the plain Nonius type and the Arabian-influenced Shagya and Gidran suggest a broad range of distinctive types, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> the head.|$|E

25|$|Contemporaries {{described}} Olaus as {{energetic and}} pushy, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> matters {{in which he}} believed strongly. He also wrote a Swedish hymnal, liturgical manual and many homiletic and polemic tracts. In fact, some consider the brothers and their ally Laurentius Andreae (who had physically crowned Gustav Vasa king in 1523) responsible for most early Swedish printed literature. Olaus also wrote a Chronicle of Sweden, which despite some historical inaccuracies, contains many interesting facts and anecdotes and remains an important historical document. Olaus also had {{an important part in}} translating the whole Bible into the vernacular; the Gustav Vasa Bible was completed circa 1541.|$|E
25|$|A {{merchant}} sailor of Carthage, Himilco, {{explored in}} the Atlantic {{to the north}} of the straits, along the coast of the Lusitanians and perhaps as far as Oestrymnis (modern Brittany), circa 500 B.C. Carthage would soon supplant the Iberian city of Tartessus in carrying the tin trade from Oestrymnis. Another, Hanno the Navigator explored the Atlantic to the south, along the African coast well past the River Gambia. The traders of Carthage were known to be secretive about business and <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> trade routes; it was their practice to keep the straits to the Atlantic closed to the Greeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{heights in}} rear of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe, are {{somewhat}} lower than those on the opposite or Fleurus side of the valley; and, from {{the nature of the}} ground, troops, particularly artillery, were more exposed on the former than on the latter, where the undulations afford better cover. The descent from either side into the villages of Wagnelée, Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and Saint-Amand, was gentle: between the latter point and Mont-Potriaux the sides of the valley descend more rapidly: and below that village they become steep, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> Tongrinne, Boignée, and Balâtre: while the ground above commanded alternately from side to side. Above Mont-Potriaux, the bed of the valley was soft, and occasionally swampy: below that Mont-Potriaux the ground was still softer. The buildings in the villages were generally of stone, with thatched roofs, and comprised several farm houses with courtyards, presenting great capabilities for defence. Saint-Amand and Boignée were the most salient points of the position, the central portion of which retired considerably, particularly near Mont-Potriaux.|$|E

25|$|Soon after, Samu {{left the}} WWF {{to recover from}} {{injuries}} {{and was replaced by}} Sione (formerly The Barbarian). They were called The New Headshrinkers. The storyline reason for Samu’s departure was that he was not coping well with manager Lou Albano’s attempts to civilize him, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> wearing boots. The New Headshrinkers made only two PPV appearances, at the 1994 Survivor Series, where they were eliminated from their ten-man tag match, but helped their team win and at the 1995 Royal Rumble; Sione lasted about seven minutes early on and Fatu over five nearer the end. They entered a tournament to crown new WWF tag team champions in late 1994/early 1995, and lost to Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka in the semifinals. For most of 1995, they worked with Jacob & Eli Blu, usually putting them over. Their final match was a loss to Men on a Mission at a June 22 house show in London, England, after which Sione left for WCW.|$|E
500|$|Other {{aspects of}} Shadow of Mordor were praised. Sullivan enjoyed its Lord of the Rings lore, {{and found the}} number of {{collectibles}} in the game [...] "staggering". Miller also admired Monolith's extensive use of lore in the game, and praised its soundtrack and voice-acting; Stapleton agreed, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> the voice acting.|$|E
500|$|Despite initial intentions, as {{the film}} developed, Yoda said anti-war messages, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> how war makes women suffer, kept {{surfacing}} and soon became the most prominent theme. While writing the script, Mizoguchi told Yoda [...] "Whether war originates in the ruler's personal motives, or in some public concern, how violence, disguised as war, oppresses and torments the populace both physically and spiritually... I want to emphasise this as the main theme of the film". During the shooting Yoda was constantly rewriting and revising scenes due to Mizoguchi's perfectionism.|$|E

500|$|Lombard's final film, To Be or Not to Be (1942), {{directed}} by Ernst Lubitsch and co-starring Jack Benny, a satire about Nazism and World War II, was in post-production {{at the time}} of her death. The film's producers decided to cut part of the film in which Lombard's character asks, [...] "What can happen on a plane?" [...] out of respect for the circumstances surrounding her death. When the film was released, it received mixed reviews, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> its controversial content, but Lombard's performance was hailed as the perfect send-off to one of 1930s Hollywood's most important stars.|$|E
500|$|Hodgson's release {{has sparked}} {{debate about the}} use of the death penalty, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> its fallibility. Neil Durkin of Amnesty International commented in a piece for The Daily Telegraph: [...] "e had the deeply sad case of Sean Hodgson, the man from Hampshire who ended up being behind bars for 27years, not least because the {{prosecution}} service suppressed exculpatory DNA evidence that could have set him free a decade earlier. He was totally innocent, should never have been imprisoned {{in the first place and}} on release joins the ranks of those– eventually– rescued from their judicial fate". Durkin characterized the Hodgson case as [...] "a warning not to trust a justice system never to be wrong".|$|E
500|$|Village {{government}} in Ratanakiri has {{both traditional and}} administrative components. Traditional forms of government, namely village elders and other indigenous institutions, are dominant. Members of each village designate one or more community elders to manage village affairs, mediate conflicts, and ensure that villagers follow customary laws, <b>particularly</b> <b>about</b> land and resource use. Elders do not play an autocratic role, and are instead primarily respected advisors and consensus builders. Village elders are generally male, but women {{also play a role}} in the management of the community and its resources. [...] A village may also have a village chief, i.e., a local government person who is appointed by a higher governmental official. The village chief serves as a liaison between the village and outside government officials, but lacks traditional authority. The role of the village chief in village governance may be poorly defined; in one Kreung village, residents told a researcher that they were [...] "very unclear exactly what the work of the village chief entailed." ...|$|E
