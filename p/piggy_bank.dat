25|$|Much of the Arabic {{influence}} upon Spanish {{came through}} the various Arabized Romance dialects that were spoken in areas under Moorish rule, known today by scholars as Mozarabic. This resulted in Spanish often having both Arabic and Latin derived words with the same meaning.

25|$|Taxes {{and fines}} were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised {{since the late}} 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century Wonoboyo hoard {{discovered}} in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in Sidoarjo in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era. The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume {{it was due to}} the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a currency system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited. These kepeng Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes—the imported Chinese copper coins—enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped celengan (<b>piggy</b> <b>bank).</b>|$|E

In 1999, Hasbro renamed the Rich Uncle Pennybags mascot [...] "Mr. Monopoly", and released Star Wars: Episode I, Pokémon and Millennium editions of Monopoly.
