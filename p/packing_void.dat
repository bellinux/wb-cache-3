Contact-angle (θ) measurements revealed that the apparent θ decreased from partially hydrophobic (θ ∼ 62 °) to more hydrophilic (θ ∼ 47 °) when the corn starch was first added, leading to foams with a reduced stability. As the concentration of corn starch reached above ∼ 8 vol. %, θ returned back to greater than 60 °, rendering then a stable foam. On the other hand, θ was found to decrease from 57 ° to 50 ° when the agar concentration increased above a mere 0. 16 vol. %. This {{gave rise to a}} pronounced drainage and coalescence of the foam, and a further increase of the agar concentration only led to a quick disappearance of the a/w bubbles.

40|$|The flow in a {{radial flow}} {{fixed bed reactor}} (RFBR) was {{simulated}} using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). There are four types of RFBR based on the axial direction of the flow in the distributing channel and the center pipe and the reactor radial flow direction. These types are known as CP-z, CP-π, CF-z and CF-π configurations. Flow in all four configurations was simulated. The model results showed good agreement with published experimental data. Results also showed {{that one of the}} π-flow configurations has always the most uniform axial flow compared to the z-flow configurations under the same conditions. Results also showed that if the ratio of the cross sectional area of the center pipe to that of the annular channel is less than one, the CF-π configuration gives the best uniform flow. For an area ratio larger than one, the CP-π configuration gives the best uniform flow. Key words: Radial flow reactors, computational fluid dynamics, fixed bed, flow distribution.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to the study of mass transport processes (flow, diffusion, and hydrodynamic dispersion) in computer-generated random sphere packings. Periodic and confined packings of hard impermeable spheres were generated using Jodrey–Tory and Monte Carlo procedure-based algorithms, mass transport in the <b>packing</b> <b>void</b> space was simulated using the lattice Boltzmann and random walk particle tracking methods. Simulation codes written in C programming language using MPI library allowed an efficient use of the high-performance computing systems (supercomputers). The first part of this thesis investigates the influence of the cross-sectional geometry of the confined random sphere packings on the hydrodynamic dispersion. Packings with different values of porosity (interstitial void space fraction) generated in containers of circular, quadratic, rectangular, trapezoidal, and irregular (reconstructed) geometries were studied, and resulting pre-asymptotic and close-to-asymptotic hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients were analyzed. It was demonstrated i) a significant impact of the cross-sectional geometry and porosity on the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients, and ii) reduction of the symmetry of the cross section results in longer times to reach close-to-asymptotic values and larger absolute values of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients. In case of reconstructed geometry, good agreement with experimental data was found. In the second part of this thesis i) length scales of heterogeneity persistent in unconfined and confined sphere packings were analyzed and correlated with a time behavior of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients; close-to-asymptotic values of the dispersion coefficients (expressed in terms of plate height) were successfully fitted to the generalized Giddings equation; ii) influence of the packing microstructural disorder on the effective diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients was investigated and clear qualitative corellation with geometrical descriptors (which are based on Delaunay and Voronoi spatial tessellations) was demonstrated...|$|E

However the, available research information on this aspect in the tropics, and especially in Asia, is rather scanty.

Pore space was quantified using a morphological approach and 2 D image analysis. Soil aggregate stability was primarily specific for each-land use type and afterwards affected by earthworm activity within each ecosystem. Earthworm casts were always more stable than control surrounding soil aggregates. Casts were characterized by higher pH. C, polysaccharides, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K+ contents. Conversely, the particle size fraction and the content of oxides (Al-cbd and Fe-cbd) were not significantly affected by earthworm activity.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the effect of {{periodic}} liquid feeding on trickle bed fluid mechanical and mass transfer characteristics and on the effect of packing particle shape by comparing data obtained with cylindrical extrudates and with spherical particles. Cylindrical-extrudate particles are employed to study air-water downflow (steady trickling flow) in a packed bed of 14 cm i. d. The effect of particle shape, neglected in the literature so far, is shown to be very significant. A packed bed of extrudates displays significantly greater global dynamic liquid holdup hd and pressure drop, as well as a trickling-to-pulsing transition boundary at higher gas flow rates, compared to beds of spheres of comparable size. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup, hd, in the axial flow direction, a trend reported {{for the first time as}} there are no similar data available in the literature; on the contrary beds of spherical particles are characterized by practically constant hd in the axial direction. Although an explanation for this hd axial variation is not obvious, one might attribute it to the anisotropy and non-uniformity of interstitial voids of packed cylindrical particles. Comparisons are reported with literature methods for predicting the measured parameters; discrepancies between data and predictions may be partly due to the inadequacy of a single “equivalent” diameter to represent both shape and size of non-spherical particles; predictive methods performing best are also identified. Periodic liquid feeding is investigated – at sufficiently high frequencies to be classified as “fast” mode of induced pulsing – in the range of mean gas and liquid flow rates corresponding to the steady “trickling flow” regime. Detailed information is obtained, on the axial propagation and attenuation of pulses, from instantaneous, cross-sectionally averaged holdup measurements. Key fluid-mechanical parameters studied include, aside from dynamic holdup and pressure drop, pulse celerity and intensity, as a function of fluid feed rates (G, L) and liquid cyclic frequency. Data from previous work for 6 mm glass spheres and 3 mm spheroid particles, are employed for comparison; it is shown that, for the particles examined, particle-size has a pronounced effect, but not as significant as that of particle shape. For particles of comparable volume, the cylindrical shape is associated with much greater global dynamic holdup and pressure drop, and with increased pulse attenuation. Moreover, packed extrudates exhibit a significant increase of holdup in the axial direction, as in the case of steady trickling flow. For spherical particles, both time-average holdup and pulse celerity are practically constant along the bed for fixed liquid and gas flow rates. Pressure drop, global holdup and pulse celerity are not affected by cyclic liquid feeding frequency, for both spherical and cylindrical extrudate particles. For the mass transfer study, experiments aimed at determining local and global liquid/solid mass transfer rates, mainly for the so-called fast mode of periodic liquid feeding. Uniform 6 mm spheres and cylindrical extrudates, of 1. 5 mm diameter and a narrow distribution of lengths, are employed in the tests. For completeness, results are also reported for single-phase (liquid) and trickling flow through the same packed beds. A well-known electrochemical technique is employed to measure instantaneous local mass transfer coefficients by means of quite a few probes distributed throughout the bed. The hydrodynamic characteristics under the above conditions, are helpful in interpreting the new mass transfer data. There is a wide spread of measured local mass transfer rates, in all cases tested, apparently due to packing and flow non-uniformities. This spread is much smaller in the case of packed uniform spheres. In general, the benefits of cyclic liquid feeding are more evident in the packed bed of spheres than in that of cylindrical extrudates; for instance, with increasing mean liquid rate, induced pulsing tends to reduce the spread of local mass transfer coefficients, which suggests that more uniform fluids distribution is promoted. Other trends of local mass transfer rates are identified and discussed in relation to measured variation of liquid holdup, under the same conditions. For packed spheres, the measured global mass transfer rates are in fair agreement with literature correlations obtained for the trickling flow regime, unlike the case of packed extrudates where significant discrepancies are observed. In conclusion, imposed pulsing flow appears to promote a uniform distribution of fluids in the packing characteristics. Moreover, for comparable particle size and mean <b>packing</b> <b>void</b> fraction ε, the uniform spherical shape displays clear advantages over the cylindrical extrudates, both with respect to fluid mechanical parameters and to mass transfer rates. ...|$|E

40|$|Single domain {{proteins}} {{are thought}} to be tightly packed. The introduction of voids by mutations is often regarded as destabilizing. In this study we show that packing density for single domain proteins decreases with chain length. We find that the radius of gyration provides poor description of protein packing but the alpha contact number we introduce here characterize proteins well. We further demonstrate that protein-like scaling relationship between packing density and chain length is observed in off-lattice self-avoiding walks. A key problem in studying compact chain polymer is the attrition problem: It is difficult to generate independent samples of compact long self-avoiding walks. We develop an algorithm based on the framework of sequential Monte Carlo and succeed in generating populations of compact long chain off-lattice polymers up to length $N= 2, 000 $. Results based on analysis of these chain polymers suggest that maintaining high packing density is only characteristic of short chain proteins. We found that the scaling behavior of packing density with chain length of proteins is a generic feature of random polymers satisfying loose constraint in compactness.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{postulated}} for many years that it is excess water rather than whole water that lubricates the cementitious materials and governs flowability of paste (excess water is water in excess of that needed to fill up voids), {{there has been no}} detailed investigations to study the actual effects of excess water. This was {{due to the lack of}} a suitable method for measuring the <b>packing</b> density and <b>voids</b> content of cementitious materials, To resolve the problem, the authors have recently developed a new wet packing method that was applied herein to measure the <b>packing</b> densities and <b>voids</b> contents of cementitious materials containing different amounts of cement, pulverised fuel ash and condensed silica fume. The flowability properties of the paste formed of the cementitious materials with different water contents were also measured and correlated to the excess water contents, each determined as water content minus voids content. The results revealed that whereas an improvement in packing density would increase excess water content, flowability is governed mainly by excess water to solid volume and excess water to solid surface area ratios. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Slumping of hardsetting seedbeds upon wetting {{is likely}} to {{determine}} the shrinking and development of strength on drying. Different processes have been invoked, including aggregate disruption, material relocation, and compaction. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the role played by compaction compared with aggregate disruption in seedbed slumping and shrinking, mechanical analysis was combined with previous morphogenetical description. The global structural behavior of repacked seedbeds of a hardsetting sandy loam soil was studied after wetting and again after subsequent drying. Bulk density was measured in 5 -mm-depth increments using gamma attenuation, and water content was determined at 10 -mm-depth increments. Various wetting conditions were used to simulate a range of climatic and management conditions, including flood irrigation, furrow irrigation of a formed seedbed, drip irrigation, and rainfall. Aggregate coalescence under overburden pressure played the main role in slumping, even though microcracking enhanced coalescence. Most of the slumping occurred at calculated effective stress > 1. 1 kPa. Intense aggregate breakdown at the top of seedbeds under fast wetting led to slight slumping because the resulting clogging of the initial interaggregate <b>packing</b> <b>voids</b> was balanced, in part, by the increase in microporosity resulting from aggregate disruption. However, aggregate coalescence induced by overburden pressure developing at the seedbed bottom often resulted in a strong decrease in total porosity. The effect of rainfall kinetic energy on crust bulk density was strong compared with the effect of fast wetting (bulk density increase of about 0. 07 Mg m(- 3) and 0. 03 Mg m(- 3), respectively) and could be ascribed to compaction rather than to aggregate breakdown. Shrinking on drying was related to the continuity of the microstructure resulting from wetting rather than to the intensity of slumping. Aggregate breakdown led to more shrinking than did aggregate coalescence...|$|R
40|$|Cement powder {{particles}} of micronic size tend to form agglomerates {{due to the}} influence of interparticle forces (Van der Waals forces). The formation of agglomerates results in an increased air-void in the solid structure (aerated powder) requiring an increase in water demand to sustain the feasibility of the structure. Consequently, if the compound formed is not stabilized, it would have low mechanical strength that may result in cracking of hardened cement. In this study, the results of cement powder consolidation and its flow properties show that its behaviour is controlled by internal forces (Van der Waals) and external forces (elastic and plastic). These forces have a direct influence on the powder structure, leading to a variable <b>packing</b> behaviour (<b>void</b> reduction). Consolidated cement powder shows a decrease in the void structure leading to a more efficient material. This study intends to determine the impact of interaction forces between cement particles during consolidation...|$|R
