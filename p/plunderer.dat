25|$|In 1572, Drake {{traveled}} to Nombre de Dios, Panama {{in search of}} the Spanish treasure being carried from Peru across the Isthmus of Panama. Drake was a notorious <b>plunderer</b> and was active in the slave trade. While waiting for the treasure to arrive, he made contact with the Cimarrons(whose population was around 3,000), whom he described as “certaine valiant Negros fled from their cruel masters the Spaniards”. The first Cimarron he encountered was named Pedro Mandiga (or Mandinga), who helped guide Drake and his men across the Chagres River to Spanish outposts. Because the Cimarrons knew the land well and despised the Spanish, they were eager to assist Drake in his pursuit of Spanish gold.|$|E

25|$|In 1873 prince Trubetskoy (1813–1889) {{challenged}} Koene's {{story and}} published a different {{explanation of the}} events. According to Trubetskoy, all five test samples were sent to Warsaw {{and ended up in}} the hands of an anonymous Polish <b>plunderer</b> who later emigrated to France. After his death Trubetskoy became his widow's agent; two or three coins were allegedly sold to an American collector and perished in a shipwreck, two remained in Trubetskoy's possession. Russian collectors contested Trubetskoy's account and suspected that the so-called Trubetskoy rubles were fake. After World War II Valentin Yanin partially redeemed Trubetskoy: according to Yanin, the legendary shipment of samples to Warsaw was a coverup of Cancrin's invention, rather than Trubetskoy's own hoax.|$|E
25|$|From 1951 {{he was the}} Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency. In that year, he {{convened a}} meeting in New York City of 23 major {{national}} and international Jewish organizations to address the task of negotiating {{an agreement with the}} West German government for the reparations to Jews for losses caused by Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (also known as the Claims Conference) was the organization that emerged from this meeting. On September 10, 1952, after six months of negotiations, a reparations agreement between the Claims Conference and Konrad Adenauer's government of West Germany was reached. Noting the historic import of the agreement, David Ben-Gurion said in a 1952 Dr. Goldmann, “For {{the first time in the}} history of the Jewish people, oppressed and plundered for hundreds of years...the oppressor and <b>plunderer</b> has had to hand back some of the spoil and pay collective compensation for part of the material losses.” In 1954 a similar treaty was signed between Austria and Israel.|$|E
500|$|In May 1945, the Allied forces {{questioned}} {{banker and}} art dealer Alois Miedl regarding the newly discovered Vermeer. Based on Miedl's confession, {{the painting was}} traced back to van Meegeren. On 29 May 1945, {{he was arrested and}} charged with fraud and aiding and abetting the enemy. He was remanded to Weteringschans prison as an alleged Nazi collaborator and <b>plunderer</b> of Dutch cultural property, threatened by the authorities with the death penalty. He labored over his predicament, but eventually confessed to forging paintings attributed to Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch. He exclaimed, [...] "The painting in Göring’s hands is not, as you assume, a Vermeer of Delft, but a Van Meegeren! I painted the picture!" [...] It took some time to verify this and he was detained for several months in the Headquarters of the Military Command at Herengracht 468 in Amsterdam. He painted his last forgery between July and December 1945 in the presence of reporters and court-appointed witnesses: Jesus among the Doctors, also called Young Christ in the Temple in the style of Vermeer. After the trial painting was finished, he was transferred to the fortress prison Blauwkapel. Van Meegeren was released from prison in January or February 1946.|$|E

2500|$|The genus name Eoraptor {{is derived}} from the Greek word eos (ηως) meaning [...] "dawn", a {{reference}} to its primitive nature and the Latin word raptor meaning [...] "plunderer", a reference to its presumed carnivorous nature and its grasping hand.
