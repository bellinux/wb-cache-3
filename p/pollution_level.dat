No major areas of dense human population exist anywhere near the region and industrial effects are minimized due to a scarcity of factories and other potential contributors of pollutants. However, the sterile and cold lakes found throughout the park are easily contaminated by airborne pollutants that fall whenever it rains or snows, and some evidence of these pollutants {{has been found in}} park waters. Wildfires could also impact the quality of water. However, the <b>pollution</b> <b>level</b> is currently viewed as negligible, and the park lakes and waterways have a water quality rating of A-1, the highest rating given by the state of Montana.|$|E
5|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Delhi was {{the most}} {{polluted}} {{city in the world}} in 2014. In 2016 WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database. According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people in Delhi every year. During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) in Delhi increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states. Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms. Rising air <b>pollution</b> <b>level</b> has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women. The dense smog in Delhi during winter season results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year. According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature in Delhi during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.|$|E

Controlling for scale, composition, technique as well as aggregate time effects, robust evidence is found that parliamentary green/left-libertarian party strength is associated with lower <b>pollution</b> <b>levels.</b> The rise of ecologically oriented parties has thus had a real impact on air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels.</b> Traditional left-wing party strength is possibly also associated with lower <b>pollution</b> <b>levels,</b> but the evidence is less consistent and robust. Combined left-wing party strength in government is possibly associated with higher <b>pollution</b> <b>levels,</b> but this result is also far from robust and is practically small.

40|$|Artificial {{neural network}} (ANN) is a {{commonly}} used approach to estimate or forecast air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels,</b> {{which are usually}} assessed by the concentrations of air contaminants such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and suspended particulate matters (PMs) in {{the atmosphere of the}} concerned areas. Even through ANN can accurately estimate air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels</b> they are numerical enigmas and unable to provide explicit knowledge of air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels</b> by air <b>pollution</b> factors (e. g. traffic and meteorological factors). This paper proposed a neural network based knowledge discovery system aimed at overcoming this limitation in ANN. The system consists of two units: a) an ANN unit, which is used to estimate the air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels</b> based on relevant air pollution factors; b) a knowledge discovery unit, which is used to extract explicit knowledge from the ANN unit. To demonstrate the practicability of this neural network based knowledge discovery system, numerical data on mass concentrations of PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0, meteorological and traffic data measured near a busy traffic road in Hangzhou city were applied to investigate the air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels</b> and the potential air pollution factors that may impact on the concentrations of these PMs. Results suggest that the proposed neural network based knowledge discovery system can accurately estimate air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels</b> and identify significant factors that have impact on air <b>pollution</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Tier 4 engines produce {{substantially}} lower emissions {{than most}} other diesel vehicles in Toronto. The Environmental Impact Assessment for the UP Express of 2009 was carried out assuming that trains would be Tier 3 standard rather than Tier 4, and showed that at peak frequency the air quality effect of the additional trains would not raise any <b>pollution</b> <b>level</b> above the provincial criterion levels. The 2010 Metrolinx electrification study, which did assume the use of Tier 4 emissions technologies for diesel propulsion options, found that the Georgetown/UP Express diesel service would contribute {{on the order of}} 0.2% to local air pollution, and that electrification would result in only a small improvement to local air quality. In an additional review of human health assessment in 2011, GO Transit examined the current plan for Tier 4 emission controls on both the UP Express trains and conversion of existing GO locomotives to Tier 4 and found that the human health risks of the diesel UP Express service are negligible, but that current background air quality (from other pollution sources in Toronto) is an issue.|$|E
