25|$|During the {{elaborate}} mating dance, the male of some <b>pseudoscorpion</b> species pulls a female over a spermatophore previously laid upon a surface. In other species, the male also pushes the sperm into the female genitals using the forelegs. The female carries the fertilised {{eggs in a}} brood pouch attached to her abdomen, and the young ride on the mother {{for a short time}} after they hatch. Up to two dozen young are hatched in a single brood; there may be more than one brood per year. The young go through three molts {{over the course of several}} years before reaching adulthood. Adult pseudoscorpions live 2 to 3 years. They are active in the warm months of the year, overwintering in silken cocoons when the weather grows cold.|$|E
25|$|More than 60 years later, Bateman’s Principle has {{received}} considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success {{may result from}} random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive success can be greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies {{are subject to change}} depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances. An example of a species that flouts Bateman's principle is the <b>pseudoscorpion,</b> Cordylochernes scorpioides. Female pseudoscorpions that mated with more than one male had higher reproductive success.|$|E
500|$|The amber {{specimen}} [...] "AMNH NJ-90", which {{preserved the}} two holotypes, also preserved {{a number of}} other inclusions that give indications as to what the ecology of Archaeomarasmius may have been. [...] Of the approximately forty insect inclusions present, flies in the families Ceratopogonidae and Chironomidae, together with caddisflies of the order Trichoptera, suggest that the mushroom was growing near fresh water. Beetles from the family Elateridae, a termite and a <b>pseudoscorpion,</b> in addition to the mushroom, are indicators of rotting wood, probably from a tree in the Cupressaceae family. [...] Modern Marasmiaceae members are saprobic—obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter—and specimens included with Archaeomarasmius indicate a similar habit for the mushroom.|$|E

2500|$|Australia has a {{wide variety}} of arachnids, {{including}} 78 spider families with 79 species of spider familiar enough to have common names. There are numerous highly venomous species, including the notorious Sydney funnel-web and allied mygalomorphs, whose bites can be deadly. The [...] Redback Spider was thought to be deadly but Redback bites are no longer thought to be life threatening, as the lack of deaths since 1956 was thought to be due to the development of an anti-venom which has since been shown to be no better than placebo [...] There are thousands of species of mites and ticks from the subclass Acari. Australia also has at least 150 species of <b>pseudoscorpion</b> with an estimated 550 more waiting to be described, and at least 17 scorpion genera with 120 species.|$|E
2500|$|In 1882, the German {{zoologist}} Ferdinand Karsch {{described a}} number of fossil arachnids from the Coal Measures of Neurode in Silesia (now Poland), including one he named Anthracomartus voelkelianus in honour of Herr Völkel, the foreman of the mine where it was discovered. This species was raised to a new, extinct, arachnid order which Karsch called Anthracomarti. The name is derived from [...] (...) , the Greek word for coal. A number of other fossils which would eventually be placed in Trigonotarbida were discovered around this time. Hans Bruno Geinitz described Kreischeria wiedei from the Coal Measures of Zwickau in Germany, although he interpreted it as a fossil <b>pseudoscorpion.</b> Johann Kušta described Anthracomartus krejcii from Rakovník in the Czech Republic, and published further descriptions in {{a number of}} subsequent papers. In 1884, Samuel Hubbard Scudder described Anthracomartus trilobitus from Fayetteville, Arkansas – the first trigonotarbid from North America.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} other karst {{invertebrates}} {{that are also}} endangered in Travis County and neighboring Williamson County. They include Texella reddelli (Bee Creek cave harvestman), Texella reyesi (Bone Cave harvestman), Tartarocreagris texana (Tooth Cave <b>pseudoscorpion),</b> Neoleptoneta myopica (Tooth Cave spider), Rhadine persephone (Tooth Cave ground beetle), Batrisodes texanus (Coffin Cave mold beetle). All of these karst invertebrates are considered troglobites, which are characterized by living their entire lives underground, have small or absent eyes, elongated appendages, and other adaptations to their subterranean environment. A widely accepted theory {{for the evolution of}} [...] troglobites is that during a series of climatic changes in the Pleistocene epoch, certain creatures wandered into the caves for a more stable environment and over time evolved into the invertebrates they are today. Troglobites prefer to inhabit the dark zone of the cave where the humidity and temperature are relatively constant. High temperatures nearly 100% humidity is required for most troglobites. There are some 7,700 species of troglobites, but this is probably {{only a small portion of}} the population because most of them have not been discovered. Even though they spend their entire life under ground in total darkness they depend very much on the world above. Rootlets from the trees above crawl down into the caves providing bug food. The bugs that feed on these rootlets are the troglobites prey. Moisture and heat from above and the natural springs within the caves provide the humidity that is needed to support their life. Because all of these invertebrates share similar habitats, they face many of the same threats as the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle that has led to their endangerment.|$|E
