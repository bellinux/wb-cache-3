The substation layer protection decision unit can acquire the <b>protective</b> <b>results</b> of the layer protection in the substation through the GOOSE network and that in the neighbor substation by the pilot channel. The protection scheme needs two signal transmission to realize the identification of fault element, which can respectively achieve the near backup protection and remote backup protection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether child temperament, parent personality, and the {{interaction}} between the two would predict anxiety/depressive problems, and also whether the presence of positive factors would be related to child anxiety/depressive problems. It was also hypothesized that child mood would be predictive of symptoms of anxiety and depression, even after accounting for heritability. Participants were 106 5 -year-old twin pairs and their parents, who completed questionnaires and a parent-child interaction. As hypothesized, child negative mood and parent personality were significant predictors of anxiety/depressive problems. However, their interaction was not significant. For children in the negative mood group, as their level of family conflict decreased, their score on anxiety/depression also decreased, providing evidence that low family conflict is <b>protective.</b> <b>Results</b> also revealed that anxiety/depression is heritable and that child mood was significant in predicting symptoms of anxiety and depression even after first accounting for heritability...|$|E

40|$|Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of {{more than}} half of the human {{population}} worldwide. Soon after its discovery, the causative relationships between H. pylori infection and chronic atrophic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma were evidenced. Then, a significantly increased risk of developing gastric cancer was found to be associated with H. pylori infection. The efficacy of the treatment for H. pylori, based on a proton pump inhibitor plus antibiotics, has dropped below 80 %, mainly due to antibiotic resistance. Vaccination would overcome antibiotic resistance and would lead to the eradication of this pathogen; however, in spite of almost twenty-five years of investigation on H. pylori vaccine candidates and good <b>protective</b> <b>results</b> obtained in animal models, no vaccine is currently licensed. This review focuses on the studies on the efficacy of those H. pylori vaccine candidates that underwent clinical trials.

40|$|Oxidative stress play a {{major role}} in the genesis and the {{evolution}} of vascular pathologies. Recent data suggest that redox mechanisms are involved in the signaling network of vascular cells and the physiology of the vascular wall. Experimental cell models allow to analyse the biological effect of pro-oxidants, and the regulation exerted by antioxidants and cytoprotective agents. 				Fatty acids play a complex role in atherosclerosis, since they exhibit both anti and proatherogenic properties, as function of their concentration and insaturation level. Beside their role in cell metabolism and mitochondrial b-oxidation, fatty acids activate various signaling pathways, and could modulate intracellular oxidative stress via an uncoupling effect on mitochondria. We report here that fatty acids protect against mitochondrial oxidative stress by activating cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. This effect is independent of the chain length and unsaturation level. EGF receptor is activated by fatty acids and involved in their protective effect against mitochondrial oxidative stress and GPX activation, and similar <b>protective</b> <b>results</b> are observed with EGF. Oleic acid and EGF protect DNA against the formation of 8 oxodG lesions occurring subsequently to oxidative stress. Taken together, this new ‘antioxidant’ and cytoprotective property of fatty acids and EGF could participate to the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque, and the more general anti-atherogenic properties of oleic acid...|$|E

However, {{little is known about the}} effects of different combinations of sibling placement and relative caregiver status on placement change. Nor does the field fully understand how family dynamics may differ in these households. Utilizing data from the Supporting Siblings in Foster Care study, this paper examines family dynamics across four typologies of living composition, and tests the effects of living composition membership on the odds of experiencing a placement change over an 18 -month period of time. Findings suggest that across living composition typologies, children who were placed separately from their siblings in non-relative care were more likely to be older, have more extensive placement histories, and experience more placement changes both prior to and during the study than were children in other living composition groups. Family living composition was found to influence the occurrence of placement change. Specifically, children co-placed in kinship care were least likely to experience movement; however, sibling co-placement in non-relative care was also <b>protective.</b> <b>Results</b> reveal the need to conduct additional research into the experiences of children in different family living arrangements, and tailor case management services and supports to children in substitute care accordingly.

40|$|Background. Influenza is a {{major health}} problem among elderly people in industrialized countries. Nursing homes may be a {{particularly}} good setting for outbreaks of influenza. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to evaluate some aspects of the nutritional status of institutionalized elderly subjects in relation to their response to influenza vaccina-tion. Certain aspects of the cellular immune response were also investigated. Methods. Twenty-three patients participated in this cross-sectional study. All patients were vaccinated on day 0 with FluviralR, 1994 - 95 preparation: NShangdongl 09 / 93, A/Texas/ 36 / 91, B/Panama/ 45 / 90. At the same time the prevacci-nation antibody titer, the nutritional status by the Mini Nutritional Assessment, biochemical parameters, and lympho-cyte proliferation were assessed. On day 28, the postvaccination antibody titer was determined. The determination of pre- and postvaccination antibody titers against the various influenza antigens was carried out by the hemagglutination inhibition test. An increase of 4 x for any of the virus antigens was considered as a seroconversion. A titer higher than 40 at the prevaccination period was considered as <b>protective.</b> <b>Results.</b> Eleven elderly subjects were responsive and 12 were not. We have shown that the nutritional parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, total protein, iron and vitamin E levels, as well as the DHEA level and the cellular immune response were significantly lower in the nonresponsive group as compared to the responsive group.

40|$|AIMS: Doxorubicin {{is widely}} used against cancer; however, it can produce heart failure (HF). Among other hallmarks, {{oxidative}} stress is {{a major contributor to}} HF pathophysiology. The late INa inhibitor ranolazine has proven effective in treating experimental HF. Since elevated [Na+]i is present in failing myocytes, and has been recently linked with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, our aim was to assess whether ranolazine prevents doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and whether blunted oxidative stress is a mechanism accounting for such protection. METHODS AND RESULT: In C 57 BL 6 mice, doxorubicin treatment for 7 ???days produced LV dilation and decreased echo-measured fractional shortening (FS). Ranolazine (305 ???mg/kg/day) prevented LV dilation and dysfunction when co-administered with doxorubicin. Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity was accompanied instead by elevations in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), BNP, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP 2) mRNAs, which were not elevated on co-treatment with ranolazine. Alterations in extracellular matrix remodelling were confirmed by an increase in interstitial collagen, which did not rise in ranolazine-co-treated hearts. Levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and pro-caspase- 3 measured by western blotting were lowered with doxorubicin, with increased cleavage of caspase- 3, indicating activation of the proapoptotic machinery. Again, ranolazine prevented this activation. Furthermore, in HL- 1 cardiomyocytes transfected with HyPer to monitor H 2 O 2 emission, besides reducing the extent of cell death, ranolazine prevented the occurrence of oxidative stress caused by doxorubicin. Interestingly, similar <b>protective</b> <b>results</b> were obtained with the Na+ /Ca 2 + exchanger (NCX) inhibitor KB-R 7943. CONCLUSIONS: Ranolazine protects against experimental doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Such protection is accompanied by a reduction in oxidative stress, suggesting that INa modulates cardiac redox balance, resulting in functional and morphological derangements...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the long-term immunogenicity and effectiveness of HBV vaccination among healthcare students with different working seniorities. Material and Methods A cross-sectional observational study of undergraduate and postgraduate students attending the Medical School of the University of Palermo was conducted from January 2014 – July 2016. HBV serum markers were performed with commercial chemiluminescence assays. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test (Mantel–Haenszel), whereas means were compared by using the Student’s t test. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated by a multivariable logistic regression, using a model constructed to examine predictors of anti-HBs titer above 10 mIU/mL, assumed as <b>protective.</b> <b>Results</b> Of the 2, 114 subjects evaluated – all vaccinated at infancy or at the age of 12 years and were HBsAg/anti-HBc negative – 806 (38. 1 %) had an anti-HBs titre < 10 IU/L. The latter were younger, more likely to be attending a healthcare profession school (i. e., nursing and midwifery), than a medical postgraduate level school, and more likely to have been vaccinated in infancy (p < 0. 001, 95 % CI 2. 63 – 5. 26, adjusted OR 3. 70). Conclusions The results of the study suggest that assessment of HBV serum markers in workers potentially exposed to hospital infections is useful for identifying small numbers of unvaccinated subjects, or vaccinated subjects with low antibody titre, all of whom should be referred to a booster series of vaccinations...|$|E

Materials and Methods. Forty-eight Wistar rats (apigenin and control groups), 14 to 16 weeks old and weighing 220 to 350 [*]g, were used. They were all subjected to hepatic ischemia by occlusion of the hepatic artery and portal vein for 45 minutes and reperfusion was followed for 60, 120, and 240 minutes. Apigenin was administrated intraperitoneally. Liver tissues were used for the detection of apoptosis by TUNEL assay and caspase 3 antibodies. Expression analysis of Fas/FasL genes was evaluated by real time PCR. Results. The expression analysis of Fas and FasL genes was increasing during reperfusion (significantly in the group of 240 minutes of reperfusion).

40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is {{characterized}} by intravascular hemolysis and inflammation coupled to a 400 -fold greater incidence of invasive pneumococcal infection resulting in fulminant, lethal pneumococcal sepsis. Mechanistically, invasive infection is facilitated by a proinflammatory state that enhances receptor-mediated endocytosis of pneumococci into epithelial and endothelial cells. As statins reduce chronic inflammation, {{in addition to their}} serum cholesterol-lowering effects, we hypothesized that statin therapy might improve the outcome of pneumococcal infection in SCD. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in an experimental SCD mouse model and found that statin therapy prolonged survival following pneumococcal challenge. The <b>protective</b> effect <b>resulted</b> in part from decreased platelet-activating factor receptor expression on endothelia and epithelia, which led to reduced bacterial invasion. An additional <b>protective</b> effect <b>resulted</b> from inhibition of host cell lysis by pneumococcal cholesterol-dependent cytotoxins (CDCs), including pneumolysin. We conclude therefore that statins may be of prophylactic benefit against invasive pneumococcal disease in patients with SCD and, more broadly, in settings of bacterial pathogenesis driven by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the CDC class of toxins produced by Gram-positive invasive bacteria...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{notion that}} {{electrophiles}} serve as messengers in cell signaling is now widely accepted. Nonetheless, major issues restrain acceptance of redox homeostasis and redox signaling as components of {{maintenance of a}} normal physiological steady state. The first is that redox signaling requires sudden switching on of oxidant production and bypassing of antioxidant mechanisms rather than a continuous process that, like other signaling mechanisms, can be smoothly turned up or down. The second is the misperception that reactions in redox signaling involve “reactive oxygen species” rather than reaction of specific electrophiles with specific protein thiolates. The third is that hormesis provides protection against oxidants by increasing cellular defense or repair mechanisms rather than by specifically addressing the offset of redox homeostasis. Instead, we propose that both oxidant and antioxidant signaling are main features of redox homeostasis. As the redox shift is rapidly reversed by feedback reactions, homeostasis is maintained by continuous signaling for production and elimination of electrophiles and nucleophiles. Redox homeostasis, which is the maintenance of nucleophilic tone, accounts for a healthy physiological steady state. Electrophiles and nucleophiles are not intrinsically harmful or protective, and redox homeostasis is an essential feature of both the response to challenges and subsequent feedback. While the balance between oxidants and nucleophiles is preserved in redox homeostasis, oxidative stress provokes {{the establishment of a}} new radically altered redox steady state. The popular belief that scavenging free radicals by antioxidants has a beneficial effect is wishful thinking. We propose, instead, that continuous feedback preserves nucleophilic tone and that this is supported by redox active nutritional phytochemicals. These nonessential compounds, by activating Nrf 2, mimic the effect of endogenously produced electrophiles (parahormesis). In summary, while hormesis, although globally <b>protective,</b> <b>results</b> in setting up of a new phenotype, parahormesis contributes to health by favoring maintenance of homeostasis...|$|E

40|$|Background. Rabies is a fatal {{infection}} and immunisation {{is important to}} consider in those travellers going to rabies endemic areas. In those at high risk, a course of three immunisations may be given by the intramuscular (IM) or intradermal (ID) route, both of which are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Little is known in the New Zealand context regarding the effectiveness of pre-exposure ID rabies immunisation. Methods. The data was collected prospectively on all travellers requiring the immunisation from July 2001 to September 2003 in Auckland. The standard WHO rabies immunisation protocol was used with three ID injections of 0. 1 ml, given on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28 with a booster after 12 months. The vaccine used was the Pasteur Merieux human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or the Rabipur Purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) vaccine. Both vaccines are approved by the WHO and the CDC, and are interchangeable. Serology was performed approximately 2 weeks after completion of the primary immunisation course or after a booster, wherever possible. Antibody levels were measured using EIA, and levels of O 0. 5 IU/ml were considered <b>protective.</b> <b>Results.</b> Of the 263 travellers assessed in this study, 125 were males and 138 were females. The mean age of the cohort was 34. 8 years (SDZ 11. 7).

In addition to the sample group, a further 12 travellers had rabies serology performed but were excluded from the study because they had IM vaccines as part of their primary course. Whilst rabies serology ranged from 0. 2 to 27. 9 IU/ml in the study cohort, the mean antibody level for the group was 4. 7 IU/ml (SDZ 4. 1 IU/ml). The mean antibody level for males was 4. 3 IU/ml (SDZ 3. 3), and for females, 5. 2 IU/ml (SDZ 4. 6). Of the 263 travellers, all had some level of detectable antibodies.

However, cross-reactive antibodies can complicate flavivirus diagnostics and promote more severe disease, as noted after serial dengue virus (DENV) infections. The endemic circulation of DENV in South America and elsewhere raises concerns that preexisting flavivirus immunity may modulate ZIKV disease and transmission potential. Here, {{we report on the}} ability of human monoclonal antibodies and immune sera derived from dengue patients to neutralize contemporary epidemic ZIKV strains. We demonstrate that a class of human monoclonal antibodies isolated from DENV patients neutralizes ZIKV in cell culture and is protective in a lethal murine model. We also tested a large panel of convalescent-phase immune sera from humans exposed to primary and repeat DENV infection. Although ZIKV is most closely related to DENV compared to other human-pathogenic flaviviruses, most DENV immune sera (73 %) failed to neutralize ZIKV, while others had low (50 % effective concentration [EC 50], 1 : 100 serum dilution; 9 %) levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies. Our results establish that ZIKV and DENV share epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing, protective human antibodies. The availability of potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies provides an immunotherapeutic approach to control life-threatening ZIKV infection and also points to the possibility of repurposing DENV vaccines to induce cross-protective immunity to ZIKV...|$|R
