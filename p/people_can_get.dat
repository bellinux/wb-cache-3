Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If I listen to a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion in his voice. I think equally <b>people</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> off on this record by just hitting on the mood of the song, or connecting to the mood of the song." ...|$|E
