40|$|Most {{thermophilic}} moulds {{are known}} to be lipase producers and the potential for esterification by reversal of lipase hydrolysis has long been recognized. We evaluated the mycelial aspects of T. lanuginosus growing in Petri dishes in YpSs (yeast extract + starch + agar) medium control and four other media based on YpSs containing different carbon source. These raw materials evaluated as carbon sources suppliers for microorganism were pentaerythritol, oleic acid and <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>dioleate</b> are commonly used in several classic industrial esters synthesis. Thermomyces lanuginosus growed in all studied media and kept its reproduction capacity, showing that this fungus is a promising alternative for future studies of live microorganism's biocatalysts...|$|E
