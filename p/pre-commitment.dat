40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this dissertation is {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of consumer food acquisitions by considering policies to promote dietary fiber intake, modeling consumer food acquisitions as a complex system, and by determining the effects of pre-determined demand and regularity conditions on policy analysis. To achieve these objectives, three related empirical investigations of consumer food acquisitions are conducted. The first paper conducts a panel regression on nine per-capita fiber intake categories taken from purchases of a variety of food to uncover socioeconomic, demographic and government food policy related factors on the per capita intake of dietary fiber in the United States. Although consumer response to 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans in terms of increased intake of dietary fiber showed mixed results, a proposed 20 % subsidy on prices of fruits and vegetables showed some promising results concerning increasing fiber intake in the U. S. diet. The second uses individual and household attributes, characteristics of the local food environment, the individual?s dietary pattern, prices, health outcomes, and policy variables jointly to estimate a complex graphical causality structure. The resulting directed acyclic graph shows a number of complicated relationship among these variables. Concerning the paths between poverty, race and food insecurity, we find a number of paths. Thus, policymakers that want to reduce the problems associated with food insecurity need a full picture of the complex interactions among all these variables. In addition, we find variables associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation and food insecurity to be not strictly endogenous. Obesity was found to be strictly endogenous. The objective of the third paper is to examine the affect that ignoring pre-determined demand and theoretical regularity conditions will have on consumer food demand. To accomplish this we used the Almost Ideal Demand System because of its wide use in applied policy research. A major result from this study is that elasticities calculated under the presence of <b>pre-commitments</b> are more elastic relative to those calculated without. The result from a proposed subsidy further reinforces the importance of accounting for <b>pre-commitments.</b> In terms of satisfying regularity conditions, the AIDS with <b>pre-commitments</b> performs slightly better. One further important result from this study is not only the need to account for <b>pre-commitments,</b> but also the need to account for the timing of a consumer?s <b>pre-commitments,</b> since pre-committed quantities could vary over time...|$|R

40|$|Principal topic: Effectuation theory {{suggests}} that entrepreneurs develop their new ventures in an iterative way by selecting possibilities through flexibility and interactions with the market; a focus on affordability of loss rather than maximal return on the capital invested, {{and the development of}} <b>pre-commitments</b> and alliances from stakeholders (Sarasvathy, 2001, 2008; Sarasvathy et al., 2005, 2006). In contrast, causation may be described as a rationalistic reasoning method to create a company. After a comprehensive market analysis to discover opportunities, the entrepreneur will select the alternative with the higher expected return and implement it {{through the use of a}} business plan. However, little is known about the consequences of following either of these two processes. One aspect that remains unclear is the relationship between newness and effectuation. On one hand it can be argued that the combination of a means-centered, interactive (through <b>pre-commitments</b> and alliances with stakeholders from the early phases of the venture creation) and open-minded process (through flexibility of exploiting contingencies) should encourage and facilitate the development of innovative solutions. On the other hand, having a close relationship with their “future first customers” and focussing too much on the resources and knowledge already within the firm may be a constraint that is not conducive to innovation, or at least not to a radical innovation. While it has been suggested that effectuation strategy is more likely to be used by innovative entrepreneurs (Sarasvathy, 2001), this hypothesis has not been demonstrated yet (Sarasvathy, 2001). Method: In our attempt to capture newness in its different aspects we have considered the following four domains where newness may happen: new product/service; new method for promotion and sales; new production methods/sourcing; market creation. We identified how effectuation may be differently associated with these four domains of newness. To test our four sets of hypotheses a dataset of 1329 firms (702 nascent and 627 young firms) randomly selected in Australia was examined through ANOVA Tukey HSD Test. Results and Implications: Results indicate the existence of a curvilinear relationship between effectuation and newness where low and high levels of newness are associated with low level of effectuation while medium level of newness is associated with high level of effectuation.
