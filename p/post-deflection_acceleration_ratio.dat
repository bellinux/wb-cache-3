The responsive <b>acceleration</b> <b>ratio</b> for this input acceleration, defined as the ratio of the measured maximum responsive acceleration to the measured maximum input acceleration, however, is greater than 1.0 for a frequency of 2  Hz as shown in Fig.  9. In shaking table tests, it takes a number of cycles to reach steady accelerations as shown in Figs.  5 and 7. Under a frequency of 2  Hz, the joints failed at average actual input accelerations of 305 and 321 gal before they reached the assumed steady values of 330 and 495 gal, respectively. A responsive <b>acceleration</b> <b>ratio</b> greater than 1.0 for the steady input acceleration of 495 gal is the result of this failure behavior. The measured maximum responsive acceleration for this input acceleration was 485 gal on average, which did not exceed the assumed upper limit value of 495 gal. Under frequencies from 3 to 7  Hz, the input acceleration reached the steady value before the joints failed. For an input acceleration of 495 gal, as a result, the responsive <b>acceleration</b> <b>ratios</b> dropped to less than 1.0, and they decreased gradually as the frequency increased from 3 to 7  Hz. For this input acceleration, the joints initially responded sensitively below the steady acceleration state, and then the resultant cyclic stiffness degradation dulled their response and lasted them for a number of cycles under the steady acceleration for these frequencies. This responsive behavior resulted in responsive <b>acceleration</b> <b>ratios</b> of not exceeding 1.0.|$|R

Special {{attention is paid to}} the development of <b>post-deflection</b> <b>acceleration</b> types especially band-type PDA tubes and an improvement on that type known as the helix-type PDA tube. One of the most severe complications of the band or helix-type PDA tube has been scan compression. Analysis of this problem has led directly into the noncompressing method developed here. A model of this noncompressing method, i. e. the voltage and gradient between two spheres, is applied to a practical system. Some of the constraints of the practical system including the problem of two virtual sources for the beam, the design of the field-forming element and the limitations on the application of the required boundary conditions, have complicated the design somewhat. These constraints have not prevented the achievement of a close approximation to the voltage and gradient required from the analysis. Evaluation of this new noncompressing CRT (now called a mesh-type tube) shows it to be superior to the older types of PDA tubes in every respect except for minimum spot size. In addition to the mesh tube's low sensibility and high writing speed, the mesh tube is compact and adapts nicely to the small package size required for modern day equipment...|$|R

In contrast, interruptible algorithms may be interrupted throughout their execution, at which point they must report their current solution. Simulating interruptible algorithms by means of schedules of executions of contract algorithms in parallel processors is a wellstudied problem with significant applications in AI. In the classical case, the interruptions are hard deadlines in which a solution must be reported immediately at the time the interruption occurs. In this paper we study the more general setting of scheduling contract algorithms at the presence of soft deadlines. This is motivated by the observation of practitioners that soft deadlines are as common an occurrence as hard deadlines, if not more common.

Using their measurements, the spacecraft trajectory and the vertical structure of density, pressure, and {{temperature in the}} atmosphere through which it descends can be calculated. We review the general procedures for trajectory and atmospheric structure reconstruction and outline them here in detail. We discuss which physical properties are important in atmospheric entry, instead of working exclusively with the dimensionless numbers of fluid dynamics. Integration of the equations of motion governing the spacecraft trajectory is carried out in a novel and general formulation. This does not require an axisymmetric gravitational field or {{many of the other}} assumptions that are present in the literature. We discuss four techniques—head-on, drag-only, <b>acceleration</b> <b>ratios,</b> and gyroscopes—for constraining spacecraft attitude, which is the critical issue in the trajectory reconstruction. The head-on technique uses an approximate magnitude and direction for the aerodynamic acceleration, whereas the drag-only technique uses the correct magnitude and an approximate direction. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>ratios</b> technique uses the correct magnitude and an indirect way of finding the correct direction and the gyroscopes technique uses the correct magnitude and a direct way of finding the correct direction.

Our atmospheric structure reconstruction, which uses only a simple aerodynamic database, is consistent with the PDS archive to about 4 %. Surprisingly accurate profiles of atmospheric temperatures can be derived with no information about the spacecraft aerodynamics.

40|$|International audienceGravity walls {{retaining}} {{dry soil}} are modeled {{as a system}} of two bodies: (a) the gravity wall that slides along the wall-foundation soil boundary and (b) the critical soil wedge in the soil behind the wall. The strength {{of the system is}} defined by both the frictional and the cohesional components of resistance. The angle of the prism of the critical soil wedge behind the wall is obtained using the limit equilibrium method. The model accounts for changes in the geometry of the backfill soil behind the wall by considering the displacements {{at the end of each}} time step under limit equilibrium. The model shows that the standard (single) block model is over-conservative for the extreme case of critical-to-applied-seismic <b>acceleration</b> <b>ratios</b> less than about 0. 30, but works well for cases where this ratio ranges between 0. 5 and 0. 8. The model is applied to predict the seismic displacement of gravity walls (a) tested in the shaking-table and (b) studied numerically by elaborate elasto-plastic analyses...|$|R
