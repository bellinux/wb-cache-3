40|$|We {{introduce}} novel {{models for}} disordered solids {{at very low}} temperatures {{with the goal of}} representing the <b>physics</b> <b>of</b> <b>disorder</b> causing local random fluctuations in the masses and inter-constituent forces. The basic model that provides the clean limit upon which the other models are built is a variant of the harmonic crystal. Neglecting the difference between longitudinal and transverse vibrational modes, known as phonons, we use a large number, n, of phonon bands. All models are constructed within a harmonic approximation for small oscillations about a stable ground state. That means that runaway dynamics are excluded, but interactions between phonons are neglected. Disorder is added by way of 14 suitable ensembles of local (hence sparse) random matrices. Each of these ensembles comes with a non-negative variance interpreted as the disorder strength. In principle, any of these disorder types can be combined, hence we obtain a model kit of disordered phonons. To assess the building blocks in our kit, we study the average density of states in the large-n limit, known as the coherent potential approximation (CPA). It is determined self-consistently by means of illustrative diagrammatic as well as rigorous supersymmetric techniques. The validity of this mean-field type approximation in three dimensions is verified by comparison with exact numerical diagonalisation. Two of our elementary models, one with pair potential (or "spring constant") and one with mass disorder, are particularly interesting. The model with strong spring constant and weak mass fluctuations is microscopically well motivated and leads to a phase transition (at finite disorder strength). A critical point terminates the weak-disorder (or Debye) phase, above which a strong-disorder phase is discovered. This novel phase features a finite density of states at zero energy. The two-parameter space of models combining both of these disorder types is called interfering mass and spring constant disorder (IMSC) model. Unlike the widely used two-level tunnelling system (TTLS) model, we do not make any a priori assumption about a finite density of scatterers at low energies. Hence we show that disorder alone is, in principle, sufficient to explain the experimental finding of the heat capacity of vitreous systems varying linearly with temperature below about 1 K, first observed in 1971. The new strong-disorder phase is stable under the addition of most of the other disorder types. Assuming that the IMSC model is renormalisable and that critical points of the renormalisation group (RG) flow are correctly identified from the CPA, we predict a tentative RG flow diagram. Under these assumptions, the novel phase is also stable under the RG flow...|$|E
