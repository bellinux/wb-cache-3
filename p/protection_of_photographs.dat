25|$|The <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{photographs}}</b> in {{this manner}} has been criticised on two grounds. Firstly, {{it is argued that}} photographs should not be protected as artistic works, but should instead be protected {{in a manner similar to}} that of sound recordings and films. In other words, copyright should not protect the subject matter of a photograph as a matter of course as a consequence of a photograph being taken. It is argued that <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>photographs</b> as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation. As such, it is more similar to a film, or sound recording than a painting or sculpture. Some photographers share this view. For example, Michael Reichmann described photography as an art of disclosure, as opposed to an art of inclusion. Secondly, it is argued that the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>photographs</b> as artistic works leads to bizarre results. Subject matter is protected irrespective of the artistic merit of a photograph. The subject matter of a photograph is protected even when it is not deserving of protection. For copyright to subsist in photographs as artistic works, the photographs must be original, since the English test for originality is based on skill, labour and judgment. That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low. Essentially, by this, Arnold is arguing that whilst the subject matter of some photographs may deserve protection, it is inappropriate for the law to presume that the subject matter of all photographs is deserving of protection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Now days {{more people}} are use photos to record their special activities; and they will share these photos and {{information}} to others via internet. But, these photos may be used without permission after they are uploaded to Internet. To coming out from this problem, invisible watermarks into images will be done. Also, an additional for watermarking process embedding watermarks should be apply before an image is up-loaded on internet. But sometimes the numbers of photos are large then the watermarking process will be lengthy to user. Thus we propose a Digital watermarking for copyright on Android platform. By using this system, pre-specified copyright information is automatically embedded into pictures with digital watermark technology before uploading on internet. In addition, original images (i. e., images without watermarks) can be achieved as its original form [...] Therefore, this system is very suitable for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>photographs</b> which are used by Android phones to prevent piratical behaviors...|$|R

5000|$|Before the directive, {{different}} Member States {{had applied}} widely different criteria of originality and creativity to the copyright <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>photographs.</b> These were harmonized by article 6, {{which states that}} the only permissible criterion for full protection (70 years pma) is that the photograph is [...] "original {{in the sense that}} is the author's own intellectual creation".

Stanford Daily 436 U.S. 547 (1978) is a United States Supreme Court {{case from}} 1978 in which The Stanford Daily, a student {{newspaper}} at Stanford University, was searched by police after they suspected {{the paper to}} be in possession <b>of</b> <b>photographs</b> <b>of</b> a demonstration that {{took place at the}} campus' medical center in April 1971. The paper filed a suit claiming that under the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution, the warrants were unconstitutional and that the searches should have fallen under the context of subpoenas.

40|$|In {{using new}} media {{as a means}} for {{providing}} access to cultural heritage collections, it is inevitable that museums, as content providers and facilitators, face the copyright challenge. This is especially so, since copyright, is not apparent in the Internet environment. Copyright can act as a barrier, limiting electronic access to museum content due to conditions placed on the use of certain museum intellectual property. Copyright can, however, act as an enhancement, so that museum intellectual property, If properly cleared, can pave the way to electronic access for the largest possible audience. Wo legal issues are paramount for museums to take advantageof copyright to enhance access to museum collections 1. Copyright on Databases: Museums accumulate knowledge and information in databases. Such databases may also include images. By providlng the public access to these databases, museums increase public access to their collections. What is the copyright status on these databases and their underlying data? Does It enhance or preclude access? A general comparative presentation will be made looking at the development of the law in North America and in Europe; particularly the EC Database Directive as It compares to NAFfA provisions, using museum examples to place theory into practice. The presentation will also include issues affecting natural sciences museums. 2. me Status of Copyright on Images and Photographs: As part of the above issue, the decision in Bridpeman v Corel has alerted us to a weakness in copyright protection for museum intellectual property. The decision will be summarised and discussed in terms of its impact on museum databases that include images i. e. what impact it may have on the copyright <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>photograph</b> and digitized image and what impact may it have on the copyrightability of the database housing the images...|$|R
40|$|<b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> {{the colour}} <b>photographs</b> and prints seems as an {{inevitable}} {{step in the}} preservation of the cultural heritage, because up to 80 % of the institutions dealing with cultural heritage have inkjet prints in their collections. Thus {{it is important to know}} how they behave when exposed to the environmental conditions. The most harming are light and airborne pollutants. Appling barrier layer, which should protect these prints from ozone and UV light harm, seems like an elegant solution. As the test target was selected i- 1 RGB 1. 5 target and this target was printed on microporous Ilford Smooth Gloss inkjet paper with dye-based ink set and one pigment ink set. The accelerated ageing test was performed in xenon test chamber Q-Sun with daylight filter on inkjet prints protected by Hahnemühle and Tetenal varnishes. The varnishes were also applied on clear PP films for determination of their spectral change during the light exposure. The reflectance spectra of samples were measured by spectrophotometer i- 1. The changes in the gamut volumes were plotted as a function of exposure dose. From this function, fading rate coefficient was determined for each sample. Gamut volumes, fading rate coefficients and gamut visualizations were calculated and made by using VolGa utility...|$|R

5000|$|Each new {{technology}} for creative work {{has led to}} debate over what protection should be accorded to such works, {{as has been the}} case most recently for software copyright and database rights. Similar debates occurred over the copyright <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>photographs.</b> The Berne Convention allows a shorter period of protection than for other works (twenty-five years from creation rather than fifty years post mortem auctoris, Art. 7.4), and many countries apply a different period of copyright protection to photographs than to other works. An alternative approach, adopted notably by Germany and Italy, has been to offer full copyright protection to photographs that are clearly [...] "artistic works" [...] and protect all photographs, whatever their creative value, by a shorter sui generis related right. This focuses the debate on those photographs that still have value {{at the end of the}} sui generis protection (no-one would bother to try to protect photographs without value), which are the photographs most likely original. However it also means that photographs are subject to a higher test of originality than other works of art, with copyright being reserved only for those the courts felt to be particularly meritous, in contravention of the spirit (if not the letter) of the Berne Convention. The sui generis protections are found at § 72, UrhG for Germany (50 years) and Arts. 87 - 92, Legge 22 aprile 1941 n. 633 for Italy (20 years). The different treatment of photographs and other artistic works was eliminated by European Union Directive 93/98/EEC (Art. 6), which states that the only applicable criterion for copyright protection is that the photograph be [...] "original in the sense that they are the author's own intellectual creation", a lower criterion than used until then, but equivalent to the criterion used for other copyright works. The sui generis protection may be retained for photographs that do not meet this criterion (e.g., photographs taken automatically such as for a passport).|$|E

Kanu’s original photographs remained in obscurity until they were acquired by a German collector, Peter Ruhe, in the 1980s who traced similar material and began to market them.
