The features of the geographic location and topography of the Pyrenees imply that the climate of the region is highly complex. The results point toward an intensification of extremes, with a generalized tendency toward increasing drought periods, an increasing trend in daily intensity, and an increasing contribution of intense events to total precipitation; however, the results are subject to substantial spatial and seasonal variability, mainly related to the Atlantic-Mediterranean gradient and the longitudinal disposition of the main axis of the range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reports the}} {{procedure}} used {{in creating a}} homogeneous database of daily precipitation in northeast Spain. The source database comprised 3106 daily precipitation observatories, with data ranging from 1901 to 2002. Firstly, a reconstruction of the series was performed. Data from adjacent observatories were combined to provide long temporal coverage. Data gaps were filled using values from nearest neighbor observatories. A distance threshold was set to avoid the introduction of spurious information in the series. Secondly, the reconstructed series were subjected to a quality control process. Empirical percentiles corresponding to each precipitation observation were compared to the percentiles corresponding to the closest neighbor observatory, and a threshold difference was set to identify questionable extremes. After careful inspection of each case, 0. 1 % of the data was rejected and replaced with information from the nearest neighbor. Thirdly, the homogeneity of the series was checked using the standard normal homogeneity test. This allowed detection of inconsistencies present in the original database or introduced by the reconstruction process. Four parameters were assessed at a monthly level: amount of <b>precipitation,</b> <b>number</b> of rainy days, daily maxima, and number of days above the 99 th percentile.

Prior to statistical analysis, homogeneity tests were performed to determine {{the usefulness of the}} data (recorded in six pluviometric stations). If the data were homogeneous, the Mann–Kendall test was performed to detect monotonic trends for variables such as total <b>precipitation,</b> <b>number</b> of days with precipitation greater than 1, 20 or 40 mm, number of consecutive dry days and number of consecutive wet days. Moreover, the linear tendency was calculated and accepted (or rejected) by performing a Student's t-test of the calculated residual values. The results showed, on average, a clear change in precipitation patterns for the last 20 years. Annual rainfall had decreased, with values ranging from 0 to 15 %, dry periods had increased in length, and the number of rainy days had decreased (especially when high daily precipitation was considered).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Century-long {{precipitation}} {{records from}} {{stations in the}} contiguous USA indicate an increased frequency of rainy days {{over the past century}} and some evolution in the probability distributions of precipitation amount. Temporal trends in eight metrics of the precipitation climate are of similar magnitude and sign regardless of whether they are derived from bootstrapping of regression residuals or using the Kendall’s tau statistic, though the bootstrap technique generally resolved a larger number of ‘significant ’ trends. There is substantial variability in terms of the magnitude, significance and sign of the linear trends with specific metrics, and they are sensitive to recording bias of light precipitation events {{in the early part of}} the 20 th century. The majority of stations that exhibit significant linear trends show evidence of increases in the intensity of events above the 95 th percentile. The resolved trends tend to have a larger magnitude at the end of the century. Spatial variability as manifest in the spatial autocorrelation in the interannual variability and trends in extreme metrics is manifest at a range of scales, but in general the correlation between stations is significant only for separation of distances of a few tens of kilometres. The largest trends towards increased annual total <b>precipitation,</b> <b>number</b> of rainy days and intense precipitation (e. g. fraction of precipitation derived from events in excess of the 90 th percentile value) ar...|$|E

The impact that these environmental factors had on numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci caught on sticky traps during April and May was determined using stepwise regression analysis of 43 and 38 site-years of aerial trapping data from 21 and 18 different field locations, respectively. The independent variables used in the regression models included degree-days, total <b>precipitation,</b> and the <b>number</b> of days in which precipitation occurred during January through May. Each variable was significant in explaining variation for both thrips species and, in all models, degree-days was the single best explanatory variable. Precipitation had a comparatively greater effect on T. tabaci than F. fusca. The numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci captured in flight were positively related to degree-days and the number of days with precipitation but negatively related to total precipitation. Combined in a single model, degree-days, total <b>precipitation,</b> and the <b>number</b> of days with precipitation explained 70 and 55 % of the total variation in the number of F. fusca captured from 1 April through 10 May and from 1 April through 31 May, respectively.

From meteorological parameters we examined <b>precipitation,</b> <b>number</b> of tropical days, and their periods from June to August. We revealed distinct differences in air temperature and precipitation between the years, which affected the onset of individual phenological phases.

40|$|Background The recent {{spread of}} West Nile Virus in {{temperate}} countries has raised concern. Predicting {{the likelihood of}} transmission is crucial to ascertain the threat to Public and Veterinary Health. However, accurate models of West Nile Virus (WNV) expansion in Europe may be hampered by limited understanding of the population dynamics of their primary mosquito vectors and their response to environmental changes. Methods We used data collected in north-eastern Italy (2009 – 2011) to analyze the determinants of the population growth rate of the primary WNV vector Culex pipiens. A series of alternative growth models were fitted to longitudinal data on mosquito abundance to evaluate the strength of evidence for regulation by intrinsic density-dependent and/or extrinsic environmental factors. Model-averaging algorithms were then used to estimate {{the relative importance of}} intrinsic and extrinsic variables in describing the variations of per-capita growth rates. Results Results indicate a much greater contribution of density-dependence in regulating vector population growth rates than of any environmental factor on its own. Analysis of an average model of Cx. pipiens growth revealed that the most significant predictors of their population dynamics was the length of daylight, estimated population size and temperature conditions in the 15 day period prior to sampling. Other extrinsic variables (including measures of <b>precipitation,</b> <b>number</b> of rainy days, and humidity) had only a minor influence on Cx. pipiens growth rates. Conclusions These results indicate the need to incorporate density dependence in combination with key environmental factors for robust prediction of Cx. pipiens population expansion and WNV transmission risk. We hypothesize that detailed analysis of the determinants of mosquito vector growth rate as conducted here can help identify when and where an increase in vector population size and associated WNV transmission risk should be expected. </p...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1952 In the mid 1930 's the Diesel engine, which {{formerly}} {{was used}} {{only as a}} large, low-speed machine, was developed into a smaller high-speed engine for use in trucks, busses, and tractors. Along with these changes in mechanical design came many problems, of which a major one was lubrication. Because ordinary mineral lubricating oils quickly deteriorate, certain chemical compounds were mixed with the oils to improve their performance. Introduction of the chemical additives to the Diesel engine lubricants met with considerable success and the practice was soon followed in spark-ignition engine lubrication. The additives used now include such chemical compounds as anti-oxidants, anti-corrosive agents, extreme pressure agents, viscosity index improvers, and pour point depressants. In addition to the compounds developed by petroleum and chemical companies, other commercial addition agents, which are sold in auto supply stores and service stations, have appeared with many and varied claims. Today {{there are many of}} these "patent medicine" mixtures on the market. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the stability of a representative group of these commercial addition agents in an internal combustion engine. A small single cylinder, water-cooled Lauson was used as the test engine. It was mounted on a test stand with a direct current generator and a control panel. The procedure followed in the tests was adapted from the Coordinating Research Council Handbook. It consisted of a standardized break-in period with a reference oil, and a test time of 36 -hours with an additive-reference oil mixture. The reference oil, of high rating, was procured from the Coordinating Research Council for the control in these tests. The oil or additive mixture, after the 36 -hour test period, was analyzed by the following ASTM tests: Gravity, viscosity at 100 F and 210 F, flash and fire points, water and sediment, neutralization number, <b>precipitation</b> <b>number,</b> and copper strip corrosion. Photomicrographs were taken to observe the extent of corrosion on copper-lead bearing sections, cut from a bearing whose composition was 65 per cent copper and 35 per cent lead. These specimens had been present in the sump during the test run. Two different oil temperatures were utilized to obtain extremes in operating conditions. One oil temperature was 212 F and the second at 110 F, with 25 ml of water added to the crankcase. The first value simulated long, hot weather, driving conditions and the second town driving with many starts and stops and low oil temperature. The results of the tests are summarized as follows: 1. The addition of water to the crankcase accelerated the deterioration of the additive-reference oil mixture. 2. There were definite tendencies in most additives to corrode the copper-lead bearing strips. 3. The additives did not prevent carbon deposits or sludge formation to any greater degree than the reference oil. 4.

40|$|The {{measurements}} {{from current}} and planned geosynchronous satellites provide quantitative estimates of temperature and moisture profiles, surface temperature, wind, cloud properties, and <b>precipitation.</b> A <b>number</b> of significant observation characteristics remain, they include: (1) temperature and moisture profiles in cloudy areas; (2) high vertical profile resolution; (3) definitive precipitation area mapping and precipitation rate estimates on the convective cloud scale; (4) winds from low level cloud motions at night; (5) {{the determination of}} convective cloud structure; and (6) high resolution surface temperature determination. Four major new observing capabilities are proposed to overcome these deficiencies: a microwave sounder/imager, a high resolution visible and infrared imager, a high spectral resolution infrared sounder, and a total ozone mapper. It is suggested that the four sensors are flown together and used to support major mesoscale and short range forecasting field experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{winter monsoon}} brings {{a lot of}} snow on the Japan Sea side of Japanese Islands. On the contrary, the Pacific side of Japanese Islands has very fine weather. Therefore, weather {{boundaries}} between the Japan Sea side area and Pacific side area are important as the division line of climatic provinces. But, because the position of the weather boundaries differ from day by day, there are many different representations of climatic division. The writer defined the climatic division line with a new method. The ratio of amount of monsoon precipitation to monthly amount of precipitation in January, and the ratio of number of days with monsoon <b>precipitation</b> to <b>number</b> of days with precipitation in January were chosen as the measures of climatic division. As the result, the Japanese Islands were divided to three climatic porvinces, that is, the monsoon precipitation area, the cyclonic precipitation area and the transitional area...|$|R
5000|$|Palmer has {{a climate}} {{similar to that}} of Anchorage, {{although}} with low temperatures that are on average [...] cooler and highs [...] warmer. August is the wettest month both by total <b>precipitation</b> and <b>number</b> of days with precipitation, and likewise, April is the driest. On average, {{over the course of a}} year, there are 28 - 29 days of sub- lows, 22 - 23 days of + highs, and 0.8 days of + highs. The town straddles the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 4b and 5a, indicating the coldest temperature of the year is typically around [...] Palmer is flanked by two glaciers, the Matanuska Glacier and the Knik Glacier. Wind blows off of these glaciers and funnels into the town with terrible consistency. If there is a substantial snowfall, it will often sit for several days before most of it is blown away.|$|R
40|$|For {{the current}} study, the {{volatile}} and semi-volatile composition of several samples of Quercus pyrenaica wood from NW Spain were analyzed and compared. The research {{was performed on}} a wide sample set of more than 100 samples (test tubes) obtained from different stands of this species. The relationship between some silvicultural and site parameters and volatile composition was studied. Altitude {{seemed to be the}} most influential parameter on the volatile composition. However, other factors such as distance from tree center, average annual <b>precipitation,</b> and <b>number</b> of trees per hectare whose effects on the volatile compounds were not significant. The influence of soil texture was not a determining factor while geographical location seemed to have a more specific impact on the extractive volatile content. The content of all extractable compounds studied allowed a good separation of oak samples of the same species according to their geographical origin. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{an analysis of}} the time series of selected meteorological parameters: mean, maximum and minimum air temperatures, sums of effective air temperature values with the temperature thresholds 5 ºC and 10 ºC, average <b>precipitation</b> quantities, <b>number</b> of days with frost, potential evapotranspiration and water balance. Study included data from 10 meteorological stations located on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia for the period 1961 - 2011. Analyzes were performed on a seasonal and annual basis. The obtained results showed a statistically significant positive trends of temperature parameters and potential evapotranspiration, while average precipitation quantities and water balance had a negative trend on the seasonal and annual basis. Positive trend of number of days with frost is present on most stations. In the second part of this paper, the obtained results were associated with the phenological data (data about the development of plants) {{in order to determine the}} intensity of correlation between them...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} climate variability {{and change}} in the Urmia Lake Basin, northwest of Iran. Annual average of the following data time series has been analyzed by statistical methods: dry bulb temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, <b>precipitation,</b> and <b>number</b> of rainy and snowy days. We have also used mean monthly temperature and precipitation data for analysis of drought spells for the period 1964 – 2005 {{to find out whether}} fluctuations in the lake level are attributable to natural drought. Our results indicate that mean precipitation has decreased by 9. 2 % and the average maximum temperature has increased by 0. 8 °C over these four decades. The seasonal changes are particularly visible in winter and spring. Results of the Palmer Drought Severity Index show that on average, drought episodes have hit the Urmia Lake Basin every 5 years and most of them reached severe levels, but recent droughts have become more intense and last longer...|$|R
