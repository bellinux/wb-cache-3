While some researchers favour an unrestricted approach to the teaching {{of all types of}} phrasemes, others adopt a more differentiated view.

Six basic arguments are developed to justify the exclusion of idioms from systematic foreign language teaching: the lack of an empirical basis, complex conditions of use and connotations, the discrepancy between the learner’s general language level and the stylistic level of idioms, metaphorical and / or pictorial expressions as “culturemes”, the conversational treatment of pictorial constructions by native speakers, and the elimination of constructions with an irregular syntactic and / or semantic structure...|$|E

40|$|Architectural discourses {{related to}} {{portable}} buildings are largely positivistic {{and focused on}} structure, materials, and modern technology. Scholars profile small, <b>prefabricated</b> <b>constructions</b> as relocatable, adaptable, and reusable according to the user's contradictions. While romanticizing a unique lifestyle, portable house prototypes open the way for industrial mass production and low-cost housing. Intentionally designed as place-independent units, they can, and often do, remain in one place for a long time. This scenario impacts significantly the social and spatial contexts of a particular locality, as it confronts the territorial claims of special interest groups. What {{is the role of}} portable buildings in such a setting? Who are the decision-makers and decision-making agencies'? This thesis focuses on the difference between the declared design intention described in current architectural literature regarding portable houses and the political and social practice of placing them in one of the world's most contested territories — the West Bank. Methodologically, a discourse survey, developed with experimental, self-made portable and temporary dwellings in 2002, gives an overview of relevant categories of portable houses: prototypes, parasites, and developers. A fourth category, transformers, interprets portable buildings {{within the context of the}} West Bank. This is followed by a material culture study conducted on site in December 2004 /January 2005. Finally, several interviews provide subjective perspectives of portable houses in the West Bank. In addition, the works of the scholars Kronenberg, Kozlovsky, Weizman/Segal, Rotbart, and Foucault provide the basis for much of this analysis. In the extreme case of the West Bank, it was determined that designed as site-independent, portable houses in the West Bank carry significant local and regional meaning. As they are industrially fabricated and quickly deployed in large numbers at various, elevated locations, they become instruments of spatial control (observation, psychological demonstration of Israeli power and intimidation, territorial gain, and presence). Furthermore, portable houses here are appointed a political role by various agencies: defining and extending the national boundaries in a state of political indefiniteness and negotiations. The particular construction technology of `portable house' is used by a culture within a well-considered strategy of war. The reality of transportable buildings outside the architectural discourses is based on mass production, clustered distribution at difficult places with the intention for territorial claim, while maintaining strategic flexibility. Ultimately, portable houses need to be redefined as active instruments [...] rather than neutral products—that create subjective place attachment and identity, actively influence a territorial conflict, and impact spatial order and control. Thus, it can be argued that portable buildings make a territorial claim permanent. Department of ArchitectureThesis (M. Arch. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is a {{sustainable}} alternative to traditional on-site construction methods. However, many challenges still {{exist in the}} <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> process. For example, self-manufacturing or outsourcing decisions are vital to the industrial structure and organization of the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> industry, and the company’s production and operation decision-making. This paper considers a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> supply chain, which is composed of one upstream component manufacturing company and two downstream contractors. The large contractor can get the precast component through self-manufacturing or outsourcing, while the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) contractor can only buy components from the component manufacturer. A comprehensive game model (Cournot-Stackelberg model) under different decisions, that is, component self-manufacturing or outsourcing, was established. By solving the profit functions of different companies in the <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> supply chain, the equilibrium solutions of output, price and profit can be achieved. These solutions of equilibrium indicate the optimal decision on the production and operation, and the profit’s boundary conditions. After assuming relevant parameters, the profit levels of the companies in the supply chain are analyzed via a dynamic simulation in the changing process of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> market size under different behavioral decisions. The conclusions are as follows: (1) the profit levels of all supply chain enterprises and the whole supply chain are increasing with an increase of market size; (2) the downstream contractors and the whole supply chain have a higher profit level under the component self-manufacturing decision, however, on the contrary, the upstream component suppliers get a higher profit level under the component outsourcing decision; (3) the equilibrium output of the SME contractor is reduced under the outsourcing decision of the large contractor, and the SME contractor is at a disadvantage in market competition, which is particularlyfull of risk when the market size is not big enough, but higher profit level can be expected as the market size increases. According {{to the results of}} the game-theoreticanalysis and the numerical simulation, managerial implications are put forward from the angles of extensive publicity, mandatory implementation, strengthening industrial chain integration, and intensifying component factory guidance to promote the development of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction.</b> Finally, the main problems which need to be studied further in the future are presented...|$|R
40|$|<b>Prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is {{believed}} to be energy conserving though opportunities for achieving higher energy efficiency have yet to be fully harnessed. From investigation of a <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> project in Hong Kong, two main problems have been revealed relating to energy consumption, including: i) inefficient management of resources such as labours and machines, and ii) inefficient production, transportation, and on-site assembly of prefabricated components. These problems are primarily caused by lagged information communication and human errors. This paper seeks to offer a solution by developing a Physical Internet-enabled Building Information Modelling System (PI-BIMS) that integrates Auto-ID technologies, BIM, and cloud computing. The PI-BIMS enables real-time collection, communication, and visualization of information across the processes of production, transportation, and on-site assembly. Practical issues of the system implementation are provided through a pilot prototype. It is found that the PI-BIMS helps enhance the resource allocation efficiency and decrease human errors.

On the other hand, prefabrication for residential construction has been used in Thailand for only less than two decades. However, the prefabrication construction in Thailand has grown rapidly from the past five years. Recently, there are many new developers, and contractors who have switched from a traditional construction to prefabrication to keep up the rising in Thai residential market. Moreover, the new minimum wage policy from Thai government has hit Thai construction business very hard. The labor cost has raised more than 40 % in some area (Thai Department of labor, 2013) since 2012. Thai developers see prefabrication as a future and ready to invest more in this type of construction. (Krunthep Thurakit, 2013) Currently, there are many construction products from the U.

40|$|As a {{sustainable}} <b>construction</b> method, <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> is increasingly being adopted worldwide to enhance productivity and {{to alleviate the}} adverse environmental and social effects {{as a result of}} conventional construction activities. In addressing management issues of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction,</b> an impressive number of studies have been published by internationally renowned journals related to construction management over the past decades. However, it seems that a systematic summary on the research development in the management of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> (MPC) discipline is lacking. Therefore, this paper examines the latest research trend in this discipline by analyzing published construction management research in 10 leading journals during the period from 2000 to 2013 (as of end of June) in terms of the annual number of MPC papers, contributions of institutions, adopted data collection and processing methods, and research interest. The analysis reveals that prefabrication is becoming increasingly important to the entire construction industry. Researchers from developed countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, Sweden, and Australia, have made significant contributions {{to the development of the}} prefabrication domain, while those from developing countries, including China, Turkey, and Israel where construction remains as their main economic activity, have shown increasing interest in promoting prefabrication-related research. Major research topics in MPC include “industry prospect”, “development and application”, “performance evaluation”, “environment for technology application”, and “design, production, transportation and assembly strategies”. Moreover, some innovative technologies, such as Global Position System (GPS), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), have been effectively applied in this field and are considered as strong vehicles in improving the performance of future <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> practices. This study is of value in helping scholars gain an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art of MPC research and allows them to continue from the findings of previous studies.

40|$|AbstractModular or <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> has {{gradually}} replacing the traditional on-site construction {{due to the}} benefits provided, notably faster time, reduced costs, better work quality, and less environmental impacts. <b>Prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> guaranties {{more control over the}} quality of components and safety of the construction process. However, some other concerns such as design considerations and coordination of factory and on-site activities, may be easily undermined if an appropriate procurement method is not selected. In a precast concrete construction, for instance, precast members require highly skilled workers, more complex techniques, and a more complex design. Because the design professionals need to concentrate on perfecting the modular design, the intensive administrative work may be neglected. To include these managerial task in a modular construction's equation, this study presents a fundamental understanding of modular and/or pre-fabricated systems and suggests a construction procurement method based on project type to satisfy this short coming and to achieve sustainable modular construction...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} more {{affordable}} homes {{in recent years has}} led to recent resurgences in the use of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> method. Although there have been various environmental advantages associated with <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction</b> techniques, the judgement against it is believed to be based on limited understanding and without the necessary detailed research on its environmental performance. The main environmental issues associated with prefabricated houses lies in its transportation pattern and the effect it has to the overall embodied transport energy. The complexity and dynamics of transportation processes, e. g. from forest to site in the case of building prefabricated timber houses, reveals the importance in having {{a better understanding of the}} significance of embodied transport energy consumption associated with <b>prefabricated</b> <b>construction.</b> Due to high dependency on imported timber, concern has been raised over transport energy consumption when using prefabricated timber elements on UK construction sites in contrast to masonry materials that are readily available locally. This research therefore analyses the embodied transport energy consumption when using prefabricated timber elements for building affordable homes in the UK with particular reference to the use of prefabricated timber wall panelling unit. The evaluation of embodied transport energy has been carried out through the use of process flow analysis. This research has developed a generic process flow model for using prefabricated timber wall system in the UK. Primary data has been gathered through questionnaires to identify the most commonly used prefabricated timber panelling system, its components, the origins of raw material along with the transportation and material processes involved for each component. The questionnaires revealed that open wall panelling system is the most marketed prefabricated timber wall type in the UK. Based on the findings of the questionnaires and the developed process flow model, a number of mathematical formulae have been developed in order to systematically quantify the intricate embodied transport energy consumption associated with using prefabricated timber wall panelling unit on construction sites. Scenario analysis has been employed in order to test the functionality of the system methodology and to demonstrate the way embodied transport energy may vary within a set of variables. The results suggest that the unit difference between the embodied transport energy of a scenario when delivering a single wall panelling unit to site compared to having vehicles fully loaded with panelling units is as much as 16. 83 GJ/panel. The process flow analysis concludes that it is environmentally friendly to employ <b>prefabricated</b> timber frame <b>construction</b> for large housing development projects such that delivery to site is always with a full load. Another important finding is that waste factor of building materials has a significant effect on the overall embodied transport energy consumption especially the waste factor of converting the logs onto plywood and studs used to produce the prefabricated timber wall panelling unit. The research has provided a better understanding of the effect of transport load, choice of transport, and the transportation distances on the overall embodied transport energy for prefabricated building elements and their associated materials. It can be concluded that the developed process flow analysis model has potential to be used as a base model to analyse other type of materials used within <b>prefabricated</b> house <b>construction</b> to aid decision making...|$|R
