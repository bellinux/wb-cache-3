5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of <b>phenformin</b> (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in <b>phenformin.</b> More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Phenformin</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{is a white}} crystalline powder, with {{a melting}} point of 175 to 178 °C; it is soluble at 1 in 8 parts of water and 1 in 15 of ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether. <b>Phenformin</b> is less polar and more lipid soluble and exhibits a higher affinity for mitochondrial membranes than metformin. [...] Its dissociation constant (pKa) is 2.7, 11.8 (at 32 °C), and partition coefficient (log P in octanol/water) = -0.8.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenformin</b> is well absorbed after oral administration. The major {{metabolic}} {{reaction is}} aromatic hydroxylation to form 4-hydroxyphenformin, {{which is then}} conjugated with glucuronic acid. Up to about 50% of a dose is excreted in the urine in 24 h, about two-thirds {{in the form of}} unchanged drug and one-third as the hydroxy metabolite. Following a single oral dose of 50 mg to eight subjects, peak plasma concentrations of 0.08 to 0.18 mg/l (mean 0.13) were attained in about 3 h; plasma concentrations were higher in four subjects who were poor metabolisers of debrisoquine in comparison with the four extensive metabolisers. Following daily oral doses of 50 mg three times a day to 8 subjects, plasma concentrations of 0.10 to 0.24 mg/l (mean 0.18) were reported 2 h after a dose. Plasma half-life of <b>phenformin</b> is 10 to 15 h. <b>Phenformin</b> protein binding in plasma is about 12 to 20%.|$|E
50|$|Buformin (1-butylbiguanide) is an oral {{antidiabetic}} drug of the biguanide class, chemically related to metformin and <b>phenformin.</b> Buformin was marketed by German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal as Silubin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenformin</b> was {{discovered}} in 1957 by Ungar, Freedman and Seymour Shapiro, working for the US Vitamin Corporation. Clinical trials begun in 1958 showed it to be effective, but with gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{biguanide}} {{class of}} antidiabetic drugs, {{which also includes}} the withdrawn agents <b>phenformin</b> and buformin, originates from the French lilac or goat's rue (Galega officinalis), a plant used in folk medicine for several centuries.|$|E
50|$|The related drug {{metformin}} {{is considerably}} safer than <b>phenformin,</b> with three cases of lactic acidosis per 100,000 patient-years compared to 64 cases per 100,000 patient-years, {{and those are}} mostly confined to patients with impaired renal function.|$|E
50|$|Buformin, {{along with}} <b>phenformin</b> and metformin, {{inhibits}} {{the growth and}} development of cancer. The anticancer property of these drugs is due {{to their ability to}} disrupt the Warburg effect and revert the cytosolic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells to normal oxidation of pyruvate by the mitochondria. Metformin reduces liver glucose production in diabetics and disrupts the Warburg effect in cancer by AMPK activation and inhibition of the mTor pathway. Buformin decreased cancer incidence, multiplicity, and burden in chemically induced rat mammary cancer, whereas metformin and <b>phenformin</b> had no statistically significant effect on the carcinogenic process relative to the control group. Buformin also exhibits anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects in endometrial cancer cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenformin</b> is an {{antidiabetic}} drug from the biguanide class. It was marketed as DBI by Ciba-Geigy, but was withdrawn from most {{markets in the}} late 1970s due to {{a high risk of}} lactic acidosis, which was fatal in 50% of cases.|$|E
5000|$|Reintroduction {{of the use}} of biguanides for Type 2 {{diabetes}} in the late 1950s. The initial <b>phenformin</b> was withdrawn worldwide (in the U.S. in 1977) due to its potential for sometimes fatal lactic acidosis and metformin was first marketed in France in 1979, but not until 1994 in the US.|$|E
50|$|Vladimir Dilman first {{proposed}} in 1971 that biguanides like metformin and <b>phenformin</b> may have potential to treat cancer, prevent cancer, and to extend life, {{an idea that}} was subsequently supported by in vitro and animal studies, {{as well as an}} apparent reduction in the incidence of cancer in people taking metformin for diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|Laboratory studies {{attribute}} these apparent {{effects to}} inhibition of mTOR, inhibition of complex I, with <b>phenformin</b> being a more potent inhibitor than metformin, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. [...] It appears that inhibition of complex I may cause diminished TCA cycle intermediate production and decreased mitochondrial ATP production thus resulting in AMPK activation and lower mTOR activity.|$|E
5000|$|Seymour Lester Shapiro (1916 - 1961) was {{an organic}} chemist {{best known for}} his {{pioneering}} work on a class of drugs used to treat symptoms of adult-onset diabetes. <b>Phenformin</b> was marketed under the name [...] "DBI" [...] until it was taken off the market after being linked to increased incidence of lactic acidosis, a potentially fatal condition.|$|E
50|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values.

5000|$|Other related {{compounds}} were being investigated clinically at this time, including biguanide derivatives. This work led ultimately {{to the discovery}} of metformin (Glucophage), currently used for the management of diabetes and the older agent <b>phenformin.</b> [...] The study of galegine and related molecules {{in the first half of}} the 20th century is regarded as an important milestone in the development of oral antidiabetic pharmacotherapy.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effect is {{diarrhea}} and dyspepsia, occurring {{in up to}} 30% of patients. The most important and serious side effect is lactic acidosis, therefore metformin is contraindicated in renal insufficiency. Renal functions should be assessed before starting metformin. <b>Phenformin</b> and buformin {{are more prone to}} cause acidosis than metformin; therefore they have been practically replaced by it. However, when metformin is combined with other drugs (combination therapy), hypoglycemia and other side effects are possible.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} recent discoveries made by Herlyn's lab found that the {{diabetes}} drug <b>phenformin</b> {{could be used to}} treat certain slow-growing, drug-resistant tumor cells in melanoma. In December 2013, it was announced that Herlyn and his colleagues had received a five-year, $12.5 million program project grant (PO1) to continue research on melanoma from multiple angles. In May 2013, L'Oréal Paris announced that Herlyn would lead the Melanoma Research Alliance Team Science Award, which provides more than $750,000 over three years to research the prevention, treatment, and potential cures for melanoma.|$|E
50|$|Galega officinalis (French lilac) {{was used}} in {{diabetes}} treatment for centuries. In the 1920s, guanidine compounds were discovered in Galega extracts. Animal studies showed that these compounds lowered blood glucose levels. Some less toxic derivatives, synthalin A and synthalin B, were used for diabetes treatment, but after the discovery of insulin, their use declined. Biguanides were reintroduced into Type 2 diabetes treatment in the late 1950s. Initially <b>phenformin</b> was widely used, but its potential for sometimes fatal lactic acidosis resulted in its withdrawal from most pharmacopeias (in the U.S. in 1978). Metformin has a much better safety profile, {{and it is the}} principal biguanide drug used in pharmacotherapy worldwide.|$|E
50|$|A {{primary purpose}} of growing 3D cell spheroids in vitro is to test {{pharmacokinetic}} and pharmacodynamic effects of drugs in preclinical trials. Toxicology studies have shown 3D cell cultures to be nearly on par with in vivo studies {{for the purposes of}} testing toxicity of drug compounds. When comparing LD50 values for 6 common drugs: acetaminophen, amiodarone, diclofenac, metformin, <b>phenformin,</b> and valproic acid, the 3D spheroid values correlated directly with those from in vivo studies. Although 2D cell cultures have previously been used to test for toxicity along with in vivo studies, the 3D spheroids are better at testing chronic exposure toxicity because of their longer life spans. The matrix in 3D Spheroids causes cells to maintain actin filaments and is more relevant physiologically in cytoskeletal organization and cell polarity and shape of human cells. The three-dimensional arrangement allows the cultures to provide a model that more accurately resembles human tissue in vivo without utilizing animal test subjects.|$|E

"Developments in {{triazine}} chemistry {{continued in}} our laboratories {{under the direction}} of Shapiro...We selected betaphenyl ethyl triazine as the product to be studied for its diuretic properties. Pharmacological and toxicological studies having been completed, we were about to start clinical trials - when Lederle's Diamox broke into the market. It was obvious to us that Diamox was superior to our triazine compound and we wisely shelved the product. This left us with a fairly large stock of betaphenetheylbiguanide. We had for some time considered investigating the hypoglycemic properties of our biguanide compounds... Of the more than 260 biguanide compounds derivatized on the 1 and 1,5 nitrogens, it is unusual that of the 6 to 8 compounds found to be safe and pharmacologically active as oral hypoglycemic agents we found the very first, the betaphenethyl derivative, proved to be the most effective. The compound, with the generic name <b>Phenformin</b> was, after exhaustive clinical evaluation, finally chosen. After approval by the FDA, it was introduced in 1958 to the medical profession under the trade name DBI, about one year after the introduction of tolbutamide, the first sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic drug marketed in the US.

The subjects were treated with <b>phenformin</b> plus diet or diet alone. Twenty-five of the 137 patients (18 %) died during the study. There were 9 deaths among 54 patients on diet (17 %) and 16 deaths among 83 taking <b>phenformin</b> (19 %). Cumulative survival showed {{no significant differences in}} any year between the two groups, despite higher mean base-line lipid levels in the <b>phenformin</b> group. In a subgroup of 104 patients entering after the first year and randomized to a <b>phenformin</b> or a diet group, 9 deaths among 50 patients (18 %) on diet and 6 deaths among 54 (11 %) taking <b>phenformin</b> occurred.

40|$|<b>Phenformin</b> (phenethylbiguanide; an anti-diabetic agent) plus oxamate [lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) inhibitor] {{was tested}} {{as a potential}} anti-cancer therapeutic combination. In in vitro studies, <b>phenformin</b> was more potent than metformin, another biguanide, recently recognized to have anti-cancer effects, in promoting cancer cell death {{in the range of}} 25 times to 15 million times in various cancer cell lines. The anti-cancer effect of <b>phenformin</b> was related to complex I inhibition in the mitochondria and subsequent overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Addition of oxamate inhibited LDH activity and lactate production by cells, which is a major side effect of biguanides, and induced more rapid cancer cell death by decreasing ATP production and accelerating ROS production. <b>Phenformin</b> plus oxamate was more effective than <b>phenformin</b> combined with LDH knockdown. In a syngeneic mouse model, <b>phenformin</b> with oxamate increased tumor apoptosis, reduced tumor size and (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography compared to control.

Extraction of control, and phenformin-treated sera with petroleum ether for 15 min. revealed that cholesterol and triglyceride were responsible for the turbidity. Different sera produced different turbidities with a given concentration of <b>phenformin.</b> No significant simple correlation existed between turbidity and serum cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels. The turbidities, produced by the addition of a constant concentration of <b>phenformin</b> to a series of diluted serum samples, were linearly related to the amount of serum present. The turbidities acquired by purified very-low density (VLDL), low-density (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fractions with <b>phenformin</b> were additive, and the turbidity of phenformin-treated serum was accounted for by these lipoprotein fractions. Serum free of lipoproteins did not become turbid when exposed to <b>phenformin.</b> <b>Phenformin</b> added to serum which had previously been delipidated, failed to produce turbidity. The turbidity produced by <b>phenformin</b> was reversible, because it could easily be cleared by dialysis.
