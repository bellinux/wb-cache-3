40|$|Annual grass {{invasion}} in the Great Basin has increased fire size, frequency and severity. Post-fire restoration to provide functional native plant communities {{is critical to}} improve resistance to weed invasion. Our ability to successfully re-establish mixtures of native grasses, forbs and shrubs, however, is limited. We {{examined the effects of}} the standard rangeland drill and a minimum-till drill, seeding strategies for small-seeded species, and Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. spp. wyomingensis Beetle 2 ̆ 6 Young) seeding rates on seeding success in burned shrub communities at four sites in the northern Great Basin. Seeded and recovering vegetation, as well as soil physical and chemical characteristics, were monitored for two growing seasons following treatment. In addition, provision was made for long-term evaluation of grazed and non-grazed seedings to assess community dynamics in relation to management practices. Results underscore the impact of precipitation and recovering residual species on seeded species emergence and establishment. Emergence of drill seeded species was generally enhanced when seeded through the rangeland drill compared to the minimum-till drill, but this effect was lost by the second year. Wyoming big sagebrush emergence was erratic, but tended to be greater when seeded through the minimum-till drill at moderate or high rates (approximately 250 and 500 <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed</b> m- 2) compared to the low rate (50 <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed</b> m- 2). Cheatgrass and other exotics were reduced and basal gap lengths decreased where native seedings established or residual natives recovered, but both increased where seedings failed due to low precipitation. Considerable soil erosion occurred in burned areas, as indicated by dust production, soil stability, and soil microrelief. Fire substantially increased dust flux rates due to decreased soil stability; however, neither drill affected these processes. Amounts of soil movement via dust flux rates and changes in soil microrelief varied throughout seasons but were not affected by drilling. While wildfire altered some soil micronutrients, drilling and seeding rates did not alter chemical responses to fire. Further work is needed to link plant and soil responses, which may help to explain plant establishment after fire and seeding treatments.

40|$|Abstract. Integrated Pest Management is {{a system}} that {{combines}} cultural, biological and chemical technologies to reduce insect, fungal and weed populations to levels below those that result in economic damage. Nursery managers in the southern United States currently use many practices to control pests of southern pine seedlings. Over the last three decades, improvements in chemical, cultural, and biological pest control practices have increased seed efficiency (defined as the number of plantable seedlings produced divided by the number of <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed</b> sown) and reduced the percentage of production costs associated with pest control. As crop values increase, the economic thresholds for applying control measures decrease. However, since the statistical power of most trials in bareroot nurseries is low, the likelihood of experiments that detect ‘‘real’ ’ treatment dif-ference (e. g. those that consistently increase seed efficiency to the point where economic returns are affected) will be low. This paper describes some current practices in southern pine nurseries and provides some economic injury levels for various pest control treatments...|$|E

40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) {{is a high}} {{priority}} species for federal and state land management agencies. Sage-grouse are sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) obligates requiring sagebrush for their survival throughout the year.

The objectives of this paper were to review the literature (99 papers), as well as consult experts, to determine which methods {{are most likely to}} eliminate crested wheatgrass and establish sagebrush. No technique eliminates crested wheatgrass in a single application. Grazing and fire have no long-term impacts on crested wheatgrass. Mechanical treatments, such as plowing, disking, and cultivating reduce and eradicate crested wheatgrass, but a flush of invasive annual grasses following mechanical disturbance can make establishment of seeded species difficult.

40|$|Successful {{grass seed}} {{production}} depends on identifying a suitable {{environment for the}} species and proper agronomic practices. Previous research on many species has addressed identifying appropriate agronomic practices for grass seed production, but these studies have not evaluated the effects of environment. By conducting the same experiments in Jiuquan, China (a desert climate) and Tongliao, China (a semiarid continental monsoon climate), the effects of environment, seeding rate, row spacing and their interactions were determined for smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) seed production. Three seeding rates (. 3,. 5, and. 7  g m− 1 <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed)</b> and four row spacings (30, 50, 70, and 90  cm) were evaluated over three years. Jiuquan had comparable seed yield (SY) and greater thousand-seed weight (TSW) than Tongliao. Three-year average SY decreased with increased row spacings at both sites. Results suggest that in both climates, successful smooth bromegrass seed production was possible, but greater TSW is predicted for desert climates with good irrigation conditions than in semiarid continental monsoon climates due to greater sunshine duration (574  h compared with 527  h) and low relative humidity during seed development (48 % vs. 66 %). A seeding rate of. 3  g m− 1 and a row spacing of no wider than 30  cm appears to be adequate for smooth bromegrass seed production in these research locations and in similar ecological regions around the world...|$|E

Data from non-control tests were on a SET per-gram basis. Field establishment differed by the seed quality test on which the seeding rate was based. The best predictor of field establishment was emergence from 4 cm of sand, which had an establishment index (ratio of field-emerged seeds to seeds planted) that was 3. 5 times greater than the PLS method and 36 % greater than no prechill.

Research was initiated in August 2008 at Newcastle, WY; Hettinger, ND; Fruitdale, SD; and Buffalo, SD. Effects of treatment factors on plant frequency during initial establishment were influenced by site environments. Late summer and spring were suitable seeding dates.

Additionally, plant growth regulators (PGRs) were evaluated for annual bluegrass seedhead suppression and turf injury. Mefl uidide at 0. 056 kg ae·ha– 1 (0. 05 lb ae·A– 1), and paclobutrazol, fl urprimidol, trinexapac-ethyl, and trinexapac-ethyl plus ethephon at 0. 28, 0. 42, 0. 382, and 0. 095 plus 3. 82 kg ai·ha– 1 (0. 25, 0. 37, 0. 34, 0. 085 plus 3. 4 lb ai·A– 1), respectively, were applied twice, sequentially with a four-week interval. Contrary to previous research, pre-seeding cultural practices did not improve overseeding success. Annual bluegrass density decreased with increasing perennial ryegrass overseeding rates from 50 % in the non-overseeded to 14 to 17 % when overseeded with rates up to 222 kg <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed·ha– 1, and 4 to 8 % when overseeded with rates between 444 and 888 kg <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> seed·ha– 1.

Specific objectives were to evaluate the effects of time, topography/soil, seeding rate, mulch treatments and soil compaction on-the establishment phase of the restoration in a split-split-split plot experimental design. Three 24 mx 3 Om replicate plots were established on summit, backslope and footslope positions. Each plot was subdivided into four treatment subplots which were planted with locally collected seed at rates of. 3,. 6, and. 9 kg/ha <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed</b> (PLS) (based on Sorghastrum avenaceum PLS). The fourth subplot was a control. One-half of each subplot was mulched with mechanically shredded seed hay. Subplots were further split into areas of soil compaction created by the wheel traffic of planting equipment. Across time, native perennial grass densities decreased and cover increased, while native annual forb density increased as canopy dominance decreased. Native perennial grass establishment was best within the summit and poorest within the footslope positions. Higher levels of soil compaction were deleterious to establishment of native perennial species, especially within the first growing season. Sorghastrum avneaceum plants successfully established under mulch-only applications, while other native perennial grasses had greater cover on mulched than on unmulched plots. Annual forb densities were less on mulched plots. Further, interactions with topographic positions and soil compaction often modified or nullified other treatment effects.

Seed size differences in switchgrass appeared to produce only slight differences in morphological development of shoot and root systems, leaf area, shoot weight, and adventitious root weight from seedling emergence to 6 wk of growth. Adventitious roots formed more quickly on seedlings from heavier than lighter seed, but the advantage to seedling establishment was minimal even when soil moisture appeared to be lacking. By 8 to 10 wk after emergence, growth and development of LS seedlings were similar to HS seedlings. Once seedlings formed two or more adventitious roots, seed size no longer affected establishment and growth.

The objective of this report is to summarize forage yields from the 2006 - 2007 trial. Materials and Methods The test was conducted on a Wilson silt loam soil at the Noble Foundation Headquarters Farm near Ardmore, Okla. The trial consisted of 37 entries; 28 were commercially available varieties and nine were experimental strains. Twelve sources contributed entries to the trial (Table 1). The entries were seeded in a clean-tilled seedbed on Sept. 26, 2006. Each entry was drilled in 5 - by 15 -foot plots, in 7 -inch rows, at 25 lbs/ac (<b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed</b> basis) at a ½-inch planting depth with a HEGE 500 drill. Fertilization consisted of preplant incorporation of 120 lbs N/ac and 23 lbs P 205 /ac on Sept. 19, 2006, and a topdress application of 80 lbs N/acre on March 1, 2007. Broadleaved weeds were controlled with an application of 2, 4 -D amine at one pt/ac on Jan. 29, 2007.

40|$|Fine fuels {{created by}} {{non-native}} annual grasses are a land management problem throughout the United States and beyond. These fuels facilitate the ignition of wildfires and promote their spread, creating hazardous fuel conditions in wildland urban interface areas. For example, fine fuel accumulations from non-native annual grasses in the riparian corridor at Zion National Park threaten the few egress routes from Zion Canyon, creating {{a threat to}} human life should a large wildfire occur there. In addition, when these non-native plants create novel fuel characteristics and fire behavior, they can lead to altered fire regimes that can significantly degrade natural resources. Native riparian plant communities in Zion Canyon have already been degraded by non-native plants, and recurrent fire caused by annual grasses could further reduce native plant diversity. There are very few success stories documenting effective control methods for fuelbeds created by non-native annual grasses. Among the methods {{that have been used}} with variable success rates are direct biomass removal, herbicide treatments, and seeding of less flammable species to compete with and suppress productivity of the non-native annual grasses. In this study we compared biomass removal (burning or mowing applied in fall), herbicide application (imazapic applied at 12 ounces per acre in fall or spring), and seeding of other species (two native shrubs and three perennial grasses applied at 19. 5 pounds per acre <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed</b> in winter). Results suggest that burning may have a more lasting effect than mowing in reducing fine fuel loads, at least extending the period between repeated maintenance a few years versus the current annual program of mowing in Zion Canyon. When burning is coupled with fall herbicide application, additional control of brome grasses might extend the maintenance interval even further due to the reduction in brome grass densities. The effects of seeding {{do not seem to be}} significantly manifested during the initial 3 years of this study, although the ultimate effects might not be obvious for a number of additional years...|$|E
40|$|Three studies {{applicable}} to organic management and cultivation of birdsfoot trefoil (BFT, Lotus corniculatus L.) are presented here. The {{first is a}} histological analysis of lignification in BFT stems that supports recommendations to harvest BFT at approximately 6 weeks of regrowth, or early bloom. Lignification decreases digestibility and is correlated with high shear force required to break BFT stems. The sixth internodes {{from the base of}} 10 BFT and two alfalfa plants were sampled during 15 weeks of midsummer regrowth. The lignified xylary ring reached its maximum radial width by 7. 5 weeks of regrowth, and full bloom was reached by 6. 5 weeks of regrowth. The second study evaluated establishment of BFT, which competes poorly with weeds and produces low yields during establishment. At an organic, irrigated site in northern Utah the effects of autumn vs. spring seeding, seeding rates of 3, 7 20, and 34 kg <b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed</b> (PLS) ha- 1 and use of a companion crop on 3 years of annual yields and foliar cover of mature stands were determined. First year yields increased linearly with seeding rate (P≤ 0. 05). Use of a companion crop reduced first year yields, and did not reduce weed cover. Autumn seeding of BFT alone, following harvest of a summer crop, is recommended for irrigated production. The final study evaluated BFT establishment on five organic dairy farms in souther Idaho and northern Utah. Participating producers broadcast seeded 4 -ha BFT pastures in the fall at a rate of 25 kg PLS ha- 1. All farms achieved high BFT density, but only two farms had higher BFT than weed density. These two farms also had high BFT cover the spring following autumn seeding, and their pastures produced 6000 to 7600 kg of dry matter ha- 1 by 20 June 2012 and supported grazing {{for the remainder of the}} summer. Establishment was enhanced by crop rotation and sprinkler irrigation...|$|E

This project focused on three main {{areas of study}} which will {{have a significant impact}} on the perennial ryegrass seed industry and end users. They are: 1) the effects of alternative nitrogen and growth regulator management practices including their interaction on crop agronomic characteristics and stem rust, 2) the effect of seeding rate and row spacing and their interaction with N rate on crop agronomic characteristics, competition with weeds, and stem rust and 3) the development of a novel breeding strategy (metabolomics-assisted selection) to help with faster and more accurate selection for crown rust resistance in perennial ryegrass. To study the effects of alternative growth regulator and nitrogen management practices, experiments were conducted during 2009 and 2010. Three N application methods (single, two-split, and three-split), five growth regulators (split and single applications of prohexadione Ca or trinexapac ethyl) and two spring N rates (56 or 100 kg N ha- 1) were evaluated in a split-split plot design. Seeding rates (SRs) and row spacing widths (RSWs) in perennial ryegrass seed production are variable and the impacts of these factors on perennial ryegrass seed yield and plant growth characteristics are not well characterized. Experiments were conducted during 2010 and 2011 where five seeding rates [1. 3, 2. 6, 5. 2, 7. 8, and 10. 4 kg PLS (<b>pure</b> <b>live</b> <b>seed)</b> seed ha- 1], three row spacing widths (10, 20, and 30 cm), and three N rates (67, 112, and 157 kg N ha- 1) were evaluated. The goal of metabolomics-assisted selection research was to detect a set of metabolic biomarkers to be used for fast and accurate selection of crown rust resistant perennial ryegrass genotypes. These chemical biomarkers will serve as a "metabolic fingerprint" associated with crown rust resistance in perennial ryegrass. Termed metabolomics-assisted breeding, this technique will lead to faster cultivar development and ultimately reduce fungicide use, making perennial ryegrass seed production a more profitable, marketable and sustainable option for farmers in rural communities in northern Minnesota as well as the Pacific Northwest and Canada...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeeders (peers {{that do not}} request {{anything}} hut {{contribute to}} the system) allow to leverage the capacities of a P 2 P system. While seeding is a natural idea for fllesharing or Video-on-Demand applications, it seems somehow counter-intuitive {{in the context of}} live streaming. This paper aims at describing the feasibility and performance of P 2 P <b>live</b> <b>seeding.</b> After a formal definition of "live seeding" and efficiency, we consider the theoretical performance of systems where the overhead is neglected. We then propose a realistic overhead model and extend the results for this model. The performance of a single seeder and a set of seeders are considered, as it is not always possible to perfectly aggregate individual efficiencies. In details, we provide an explicit upper bound of seeders' achievable efficiency in a P 2 P system with linear overhead. We also propose and study two simple mechanisms that allow to deploy a <b>live</b> <b>seeding</b> architecture while handling seeders aggregation, providing near-optimal seeding...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare hand-assisted laparoscopic donor {{nephrectomy}} and <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy {{techniques in}} live donor nephrectomy. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included all patients submitted to hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy between May 2002 and December 2007. The operative data and post-operative courses were reviewed. Information was {{collected on the}} operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, intra-operative complications, time to first oral intake, length of hospital stay, and post-operative complications. The {{data were analyzed using}} Student's t -tests and Fisher exact tests as appropriate, with statistical significance defined as p < 0. 05. RESULTS: The means of the operative duration, warm ischemia time and intra-operative bleeding were 83 min, 3. 6 min and 130. 9 cc, respectively, for hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, and 78. 4 min, 2. 5 min and 98. 9 cc, respectively, for <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy (p= 0. 29, p< 0. 0001 and p= 0. 08, respectively). Intra-operative complications occurred in 6 % of patients submitted to hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and in 4. 5 % of those submitted to <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy (p= 0. 68). Only one patient from each group required conversion to open surgery; one person receiving hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy had bleeding and one person receiving <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy had low carbon dioxide levels during the warm ischemia period. Compared with patients receiving hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, patients submitted to <b>pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy were able to take their first meal earlier (12. 5 vs. 9. 2 hours, p= 0. 046), were discharged home sooner (2. 8 vs. 1. 4 days, p< 0. 0001) and had fewer post-operative complications (7. 5 % vs. 0. 6 %, p= 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Pure</b> laparoscopic <b>live</b> donor nephrectomy had some advantages over hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in terms of the warm ischemia time, time to first oral intake, length of hospital stay, and post-operative donor complications...|$|R
