25|$|The {{earliest}} pictorial {{evidence for}} the use of eyeglasses is Tommaso da Modena's 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Provence reading in a scriptorium. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the Alps in an altarpiece of the church of Bad Wildungen, Germany, in 1403. These early glasses had convex lenses that could correct both hyperopia (farsightedness), and the <b>presbyopia</b> that commonly develops as a symptom of aging. It was not until 1604 that Johannes Kepler published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct <b>presbyopia</b> and myopia.|$|E
25|$|Correction of <b>presbyopia</b> (a {{need for}} a reading {{prescription}} different from the prescription needed for distance) presents an additional challenge in the fitting of contact lenses. Two main strategies exist: multifocal lenses and monovision.|$|E
25|$|People over 35 {{years of}} age {{are at risk for}} {{developing}} <b>presbyopia.</b> and most people benefit from reading glasses by age 45–50. The cause is lens hardening by decreasing levels of -crystallin, a process which may be sped up by higher temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Eyesight. <b>Presbyopia</b> {{can occur}} by age 50 and it hinders reading {{especially}} of small print in low lighting. Speed with {{which an individual}} reads {{and the ability to}} locate objects may also be impaired. By age 80, {{more than half of all}} Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{are held}} {{together}} by special linking proteins. When too many cross-links form between cells in a tissue, the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, <b>presbyopia</b> and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures {{that are part of}} the body, but not within a cell. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{conditions}} can be corrected using corrective lenses. For <b>presbyopia</b> and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring the near point closer to the eye while for myopia a diverging lens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that curves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity of the cornea.|$|E
25|$|The American {{scientist}} Benjamin Franklin, {{who suffered}} from both myopia and <b>presbyopia,</b> invented bifocals. Serious historians have {{from time to time}} produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of The Gazette of the United States, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the British astronomer George Airy in 1825.|$|E
25|$|Lenses {{are used}} as {{prosthetics}} for the correction of visual impairments such as myopia, hyperopia, <b>presbyopia,</b> and astigmatism. (See corrective lens, contact lens, eyeglasses.) Most lenses used for other purposes have strict axial symmetry; eyeglass lenses are only approximately symmetric. They are usually shaped to fit in a roughly oval, not circular, frame; the optical centres are placed over the eyeballs; their curvature may not be axially symmetric to correct for astigmatism. Sunglasses' lenses are designed to attenuate light; sunglass lenses that also correct visual impairments can be custom made.|$|E
25|$|Defects in vision can be {{explained}} using optical principles. As people age, the lens becomes less flexible and the near point recedes from the eye, a condition known as <b>presbyopia.</b> Similarly, people suffering from hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length of their lens enough to allow for nearby objects to be imaged on their retina. Conversely, people who cannot increase the focal length of their lens enough to allow for distant objects to be imaged on the retina suffer from myopia and have a far point that is considerably closer than infinity. A condition known as astigmatism results when the cornea is not spherical but instead is more curved in one direction. This causes horizontally extended objects {{to be focused on}} different parts of the retina than vertically extended objects, and results in distorted images.|$|E
500|$|Medical {{professionals}} characterize refractive errors such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and <b>presbyopia</b> (the age-related {{blurring of}} near-point vision) as {{consequences of the}} eye's shape and other basic anatomy, {{which there is no}} evidence that any exercise can alter. Bates, however, believed that these conditions are caused by tension of the muscles surrounding the eyeball, which he believed prevents the eyeball from sufficiently changing shape (per his explanation of accommodation) when gaze is shifted nearer or farther. Bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as the consequence of a [...] "mental strain" [...] to see, the relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight. He also linked disturbances in the circulation of blood, which he said is [...] "very largely influenced by thought", not only to refractive errors but also to double vision, crossed-eye, lazy eye, and to more serious eye conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma. His therapies were based on these assumptions.|$|E

Its activities include {{the development of}} vision correction products (including eyeglasses, contact lenses and surgical devices) {{for the treatment of}} myopia (near-sightedness), <b>presbyopia</b> (also known as [...] "aging sight"), hyperopia and astigmatism. It also conducts research in improvements in contact lens technology, treatments for conditions such as dry eye and technologies to detect eye disease and other eye related conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Acuity is {{a measure}} of visual {{performance}} and does not relate to the eyeglass prescription required to correct vision. Instead, an eye exam seeks to find the prescription that will provide the best corrected visual performance achievable. The resulting acuity may be greater or less than 6/6 = 1.0. Indeed, a subject diagnosed as having 6/6 vision will often actually have higher visual acuity because, once this standard is attained, the subject is considered to have normal (in the sense of undisturbed) vision and smaller optotypes are not tested. Emmetropic subjects with 6/6 vision or [...] "better" [...] (20/15, 20/10, etc.), may still benefit from an eyeglass correction for other problems related to the visual system, such as astigmatism, ocular injuries, or <b>presbyopia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} type of {{corrective}} lens is [...] "single vision", which has a uniform refractive index. [...] For people with <b>presbyopia</b> and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. Reading glasses provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have two simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required. [...] Adjustable-focus eyeglasses might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).|$|E
2500|$|Corrective lenses {{are used}} to correct {{refractive}} errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (Hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. Also, few people have eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one may need a [...] "stronger", (i.e. more [...] refracting), lens than the other. A common condition in people over forty years old is <b>presbyopia,</b> which {{is caused by the}} eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Corrective lenses, to bring the image back into focus on the retina, are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. [...] A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. [...] Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting.|$|E
50|$|Laser blended vision {{treatment}} {{is suitable for}} people suffering from <b>presbyopia.</b> People mostly begin to suffer from <b>presbyopia,</b> refractive error {{between the ages of}} 40-45 years. As we age, the natural lens inside the eye grows, leading to a decrease in the ability of the eye to change its focus from distance to near, a process called accommodation (accommodation (eye)). There is still much controversy amongst experts as to the mechanism of accommodation of the eye, which is probably why the actual reversal of <b>presbyopia</b> is still not medically possible.|$|E
