In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was very hard to make <b>people</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E

Thus, he conceptualized what he {{referred to as a}} new humanism or Neohumanism [...]„Neohumanism is humanism of the past, humanism of the present, and humanism – newly explained – of the future.

It will help <b>people</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> human beings(...), will have to accept the great responsibility of taking care of the entire universe...“ Inspired by Indian spiritual philosophy (see advaita vedanta), Sarkar calls for the acknowledgment of the fundamental connectedness not only between individuals and their fellow human beings but also between humans and all life. Sarkar enounces that though physically different, all existence is metaphysically united and fundamentally one collective body composed of all the material and supra-material elements of this universe. Hence PROUT propounds the celebration of diversity and multiculturalism, emphasizing, through its policies, the abolishment of inequality in all its forms, be that religious superiority, racism, sexism, prejudices against social groups, etc. According to Sarkar, PROUT treads a path of socio-economic liberation for the common people [...] , where the desire for a more progressive society is driven by Neohumanistic values stirred by the ancient philosophies of the east.|$|E

60|$|This {{explains}} why, {{for a long}} time, the Christian Church {{refused to}} have anything to do with marriage. The result was, not the abolition of sex, but its excommunication. And, of course, the consequences of persuading people that matrimony was an unholy state were so grossly carnal, that the Church had to execute a complete right-about-face, and try to make <b>people</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it was a holy state: so holy indeed that it could not be validly inaugurated without the blessing of the Church. And by this teaching it did something to atone for its earlier blasphemy. But the mischief of chopping and changing your doctrine to meet this or that practical emergency instead of keeping it adjusted to the whole scheme of life, is that you end by having half-a-dozen contradictory doctrines to suit half-a-dozen different emergencies. The Church solemnized and sanctified marriage without ever giving up its original Pauline doctrine on the subject. And it soon fell into another confusion. At the point at which it took up marriage and endeavored to make it holy, marriage was, as it still is, largely a survival of the custom of selling women to men. Now in all trades a marked difference is made in price between a new article and a second-hand one. The moment we meet with this difference in value between human beings, we may know that we are in the slave-market, where the conception of our relations to the persons sold is neither religious nor natural nor human nor superhuman, but simply commercial. The Church, when it finally gave its blessing to marriage, did not, in its innocence, fathom these commercial traditions. Consequently it tried to sanctify them too, with grotesque results. The slave- dealer having always asked more money for virginity, the Church, instead of detecting the money-changer and driving him out of the temple, took him for a sentimental and chivalrous lover, and, helped by its only half-discarded doctrine of celibacy, gave virginity a heavenly value to ennoble its commercial pretensions. In short, Mammon, always mighty, put the Church in his pocket, where he keeps it to this day, in spite of the occasional saints and martyrs who contrive from time to time to get their heads and souls free to testify against him.|$|E

But these are perilous paths, it must always be remembered. This is no public playground. One may distrust the conventional code, and one may leave it in thought, long before one is justified in leaving it either in expressed opinion or in act. We are social animals; we cannot live alone; manifestly from the nature of the question, here, at any rate, we must associate and group. For all who find the accepted righteousness not good enough or clear enough for them, there is the chance of an ironical destiny.

There is an abominable riff-raff gone into those thickets for purposes quite other than the discovery of the right thing to do, for quite other motives than our high intellectual desire. There are ugly rebels and born rascals, cheats by instinct, and liars to women, swinish unbelievers who would compromise us with their erratic pursuit of a miscellaneous collection of strange fancies and betray us callously at last.
