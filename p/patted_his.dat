500|$|Before {{leaving the}} [...] "Führerbau", Chamberlain {{requested}} a private conference with Hitler. Hitler agreed, {{and the two}} met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning. Chamberlain urged restraint {{in the implementation of}} the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed [...] "Anglo–German Agreement", which contained three paragraphs including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement [...] "symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again". According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected [...] "Ja! Ja!" [...] ("Yes! Yes!") as the Prime Minister read it. The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, [...] "Oh, don't take it so seriously. That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever." [...] Chamberlain, on the other hand, <b>patted</b> <b>his</b> breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, [...] "I've got it!" [...] Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters.|$|E
2500|$|In his summing up, the coroner, H.R. Oswald, {{stated that}} Kempton {{was in a}} {{depressed}} state and short of money, [...] "Her life was precarious, and {{she was one of}} those who tried to turn night into day". He doubted the evidence of Chang which contradicted that of Heinberg but thought there was insufficient evidence to bring a charge of manslaughter against Chang. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, at which, according to the News of the World, [...] "Chang smiled broadly and quickly left the court. As he passed out, several well-dressed girls <b>patted</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, while one ran her fingers through his hair".|$|E
2500|$|All 39 {{episodes of}} The Honeymooners were filmed at the DuMont Television Network's [...] Adelphi Theatre at 152 West 54th Street in Manhattan, {{in front of}} an {{audience}} of 1,000. Episodes never were fully rehearsed because Gleason felt rehearsals would rob the show of its spontaneity. A result was that, while the cast was able to bring a fresh approach to the material, mistakes often were made. Lines either were recited incorrectly or altogether forgotten, and actors did not always follow the scripted action directions. To compensate, the cast developed visual cues for each other. For example, Gleason <b>patted</b> <b>his</b> stomach when he forgot a line, while Meadows would glance at the icebox when someone else was supposed to retrieve something from it.|$|E
