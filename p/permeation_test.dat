40|$|Water-related {{damage to}} {{bituminous}} pavement {{is considered to}} result from penetration of liquid water from the surface and/or subsurface. However, surface courses made of bituminous material such as runway pavements are usually not permeable for liquid water. Therefore, such phenomena {{may be caused by}} moisture vapor in the air. A new moisture <b>permeation</b> <b>test</b> apparatus was developed to analyze the mass transfer. Moisture permeation tests under typical hot summer conditions suggested that atmospheric moisture permeates and accumulates in bituminous mixtures through mass transfer by vapor diffusion despite the water impermeability of bituminous surface mixtures. The moisture <b>permeation</b> <b>test</b> provides an effective approach to analyze water storage mechanisms and moisture-related phenomena such as blistering in bituminous mixtures, although the test apparatus and condition settings require some improvement. 水分による歴青系舗装の損傷は，表面や路床から液状浸入した水が原因であると考えられてきた。しかし，滑走路等のアスファルト舗装表層は実質的に不透水であることが多い。したがって，著者らは大気中の水蒸気（湿気）がこれらの要因であると考え，この検証のために新しい透湿試験装置を開発した。透湿試験から，たとえ表層材料が実質的に不透水性であっても，典型的な夏の暑い日の気象条件においては水蒸気透過による物質移動により大気中の水分が透過し，凝縮した水分が混合物中に多量に蓄積しうることが明らかとなった。試験装置や試験条件に関してさらなる改良を加えることが必要であるものの，透湿試験は水分蓄積メカニズムの解明とブリスタリング現象等の水分に関連する損傷を評価する有効な試験方法である。Research Not...|$|E

Our aim is to create economical hydrothermally stable membranes that can provide high H₂-CO₂ separation at a temperature of 300 degree Celsius, for application in the water-gas shift reactor process. The present work describes the development of novel silica and silica-titania membranes from the controlled oxidative thermolysis of polydimethylsiloxane. The scope of this thesis is fabrication of membranes, material characterization and preliminary gas <b>permeation</b> <b>tests</b> (35 - 80 degree Celsius) on PDMS derived silica membrane films. The developed membranes can withstand up to 350 degree C in air. High permeabilties of small gas penetrants like He, H₂ and CO₂ have been observed and fairly high separation factors of O₂/N₂= 3, H₂/N₂= 14 and H₂/CH₄= 11 have been obtained. As the temperature of operation increases, the permeability of hydrogen increases and the separation factor of H₂ from CO₂ increases. The silica membranes exhibit gas separation factors higher than the respective Knudsen values. Additionally, design and {{construction of a new}} high temperature gas <b>permeation</b> <b>testing</b> system is described, which will cater to gas <b>permeation</b> <b>tests</b> at temperatures up to 300 degree Celsius for future work.

In particular, damage can be drastically accelerated by the intervention of water and some chemicals such as surfactants and salts.

The authors previously pointed out that water storage in bituminous pavement layers is caused by moisture vapor in the air, and developed a new moisture <b>permeation</b> <b>test</b> apparatus to analyze the mass transfer.

Polysulfone was selected as the polymer material in this research since it is glassy type polymer that exhibit good mechanical properties compare to others while 1 -Methyl- 2 -Pyrrolidone (NMP) is chosen as the solvent because it is low toxicity and completely miscible with water, organic acid and alcohol. Polysulfone asymmetric membrane was prepared by mixing a dope, where polysulfone polymer was mixed with 1 -Methyl- 2 Pyrrolidone (NMP). Three sample of solution was prepared with different type of concentration of polysulfone polymer which is 20 wt%, 25 wt% and 30 wt% respectively.

40|$|The {{dialysis}} membrane is a {{key component}} of the haemodialyser. Determination of the membrane solute permeation and ultrafiltration characteristics is important in predicting haemodialyser performance. In some membrane <b>permeation</b> <b>test</b> cells, there are additional mass transfer resistances present due to fluid films adjacent to the membrane surface. This can mask the true permeability of the membrane. Test cell designs should therefore seek to minimise or eliminate any fluid film resistances In this project, solute permeability results were compared using two types of <b>permeation</b> <b>test</b> cells, namely a radial flow cell and a dynamic test cell. In the radial flow cell, fluid streams are directed perpendicular to the membrane surfaces in an attempt to reduce the fluid film thickness. In the dynamic test cell, the fluid streams are passed at high velocity through an open-pore rigid metal support structure that generates localised mixing at the membrane surfaces. Fluid film resistances are proportionately greater for the transfer of low molecular weight solutes and for high flux membranes.

The diffuser was fitted with thermocouples to measure shell temperatures during testing.
