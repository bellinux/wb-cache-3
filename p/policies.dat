40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore how {{innovation}} has become more important in information society <b>policy</b> and what the implications are for <b>policy</b> design, <b>policy</b> coordination and <b>policy</b> evaluation. Design/methodology/approach - Against the background of European information society <b>policy,</b> a case study is done on the <b>policy</b> mix for ICT innovation in The Netherlands. A highly structured qualitative methodology is developed to analyse the relevant <b>policy</b> instruments in information society <b>policy</b> and innovation <b>policy.</b> The methodology includes a typology for rationale, <b>policy</b> instruments and element of the innovation process. Findings - To a large extent, information society <b>policy</b> and innovation <b>policy</b> are complementary. There is some overlap between <b>policy</b> instruments. The rationale and objectives can be more explicit. The <b>policy</b> mix had a positive impact on information communication technology (ICT) knowledge, broadband and e-government.

5|$|The Cuu Long {{conference held}} between 6 and 10 October {{was the first}} provincial-level conference to be held. By 22 October, 21 provinces had held provincial-level party conferences. The central party {{leadership}} faced less criticism on the draft Political Report and socio-economic <b>policies</b> from the provincial-level conferences than by district-level conferences. The provincial-level conferences criticized central <b>policies</b> less and were evasive about critical issues. However, the provincial-level conferences were not completely dormant and scored some minor victories, such as reducing the average age needed to join an executive committee and they adopted a more flexible and efficient mode of planning and organization. As during the district-level conferences, there were certain convocations which attracted attention; the An Giang Party Committee criticized past economic performance, while the Ha Son Binh Congress criticized the irrational management of provincial economic affairs. While these committees criticized past <b>policies</b> or well-known deficiencies, none of them criticized the <b>policies</b> of the central party leadership.|$|E

Though Chamorro's <b>policies</b> changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the <b>policies</b> did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E

30|$|The <b>policy</b> {{innovation}} {{process can}} be divided into three stages: idea conceptualization, <b>policy</b> program design, and <b>policy</b> implementation (Roberts 1992). <b>Policy</b> entrepreneurs need to apply various strategies in different stages to make certain innovative ideas are put into practice. These include the following. (1) Framing the <b>policy</b> problem: <b>Policy</b> entrepreneurs raise new ways of thinking and defining <b>policy</b> problems (Baze and Abolafia 2002) and achieve consensus within a certain scope. (2) Brokering <b>policy</b> programs: In order to popularize their favored <b>policy</b> programs, <b>policy</b> entrepreneurs seek approval as much as possible by lobbying other <b>policy</b> actors; they try to control the political discussion to formulate a new power structure that is friendly to <b>policy</b> idea diffusion and strengthen the legitimacy of the new <b>policy</b> (Riker 1986; Waddock and Post 1991). (3) Establishing <b>policy</b> alliances: <b>Policy</b> entrepreneurs have to accumulate resources with the support of other organizations and individuals until the “opportunity window” opens. (4) <b>Policy</b> experimenting: There can be competition among <b>policy</b> entrepreneurs in the same <b>policy</b> area (Crowley 2003). They thus strive to prove the superiority of their programs to win the competition (Mintrom and Norman 2009).|$|R
