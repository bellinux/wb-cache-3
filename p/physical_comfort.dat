500|$|When Imogen joined Britten, the {{financial}} arrangement was vague; Britten paid {{her on a}} piecemeal basis rather than a regular salary, unaware {{that she had made}} over her rights to her father's estate to her mother and had little money of her own. As a result, she [...] lived very frugally in Aldeburgh, but her commitment to Britten overrode her own <b>physical</b> <b>comfort.</b> For the next dozen years her life was organised around the joint objectives of assisting Britten and developing the Aldeburgh Festival. Although she temporarily put her own compositional ambitions aside, she did not abandon all other activities. She made many choral and vocal arrangements, promoted her father's music, and wrote books, articles and programme notes.|$|E

2500|$|Women's {{clothing}} styles {{retained the}} emphasis on a narrow, inverted conical torso, achieved with boned stays, above full skirts. Hoop skirts continued to be worn, reaching their largest size in the 1750s, and were sometimes replaced by side-hoops, also called 'false hips', or panniers. [...] Court dress {{had little or no}} <b>physical</b> <b>comfort</b> with restriction of movement. Full size hoops skirts prevented sitting and reminded those wearing them to stand {{in the presence of the}} King. Stays forced a proper standing posture. Garments like these could not be washed often because of the fabrics from which they were made. The Enlightenment produced a backlash against sumptuary laws which asserted a stagnant social hierarchy. During the Enlightenment, court dress stayed almost the same while outside of court dress, fashion became less extravagant and shifted more towards comfort rather than courtly display.|$|E

5000|$|The Six Goswamis of Vrindavan were a {{group of}} devotional {{teachers}} (gurus) from the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition of Vedic Religion who lived in India during the 15th and 16th centuries.

[...] Specifically, in poems like The Land of Cockaigne, Cockaigne is a land of contraries, where all the restrictions of society are defied (abbots beaten by their monks), sexual liberty is open (nuns flipped over to show their bottoms), and food is plentiful (skies that rain cheeses). Writing about Cockaigne was a commonplace of Goliard verse. It represented both wish fulfillment and resentment at the strictures of asceticism and death.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Shelby {{was a fair}} average kind of man, good-natured and kindly, and {{disposed}} to easy indulgence of those around him, and {{there had never been}} a lack of anything which might contribute to the <b>physical</b> <b>comfort</b> of the negroes on his estate.

In the film, however, multiple locations outside the Helmer house {{are used for}} visual explication, and to lend dramatic emphasis to plot points. Even within the house, the camera moves from room to room, revealing not just the <b>physical</b> <b>comforts</b> of their home but also its confining nature - its [...] "deadly insularity". The combined effect of Losey's alterations have been praised by some critics for giving the work a comprehensively cinematic quality, and make it [...] "a film rather than a photographed play".|$|R

40|$|Infants {{differ in}} their ability to achieve {{organised}} sleep-wake behaviour. Difficulties in this developmental process are associated with problems falling asleep at bedtime and repeated night awakenings where parental assistance is needed to return to sleep. Studies have shown that a number of maternal psychosocial factors have been linked to differences in infant sleep outcome. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relative contribution of maternal psychosocial factors including depression and anxiety symptoms, perceived past maternal parenting, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, maternal sleep history and the maternal settling strategy of active <b>physical</b> <b>comforting</b> to infant sleep outcome. A further aim was to explore the extent to which these variables affect infant sleep outcome through their link to maternal cognitions about infant sleep...|$|R
60|$|Grace did {{not like}} Canada. Her {{cultivation}} was artificial, but Canada was primitive and stern. In the towns, one found inventions that lightened labor, and brought to the reach of all a <b>physical</b> <b>comfort</b> that in England only the rich enjoyed, but the contrasts were sharp. One left one's hotel, with its very modern furniture, noisy elevators and telephones, and plunged into the wilderness where all was {{as it had been}} from the beginning. Grace shrank from primitive rudeness and hated adventure. Living by rule she distrusted all she did not know. She thought it strange that Barbara, who feared nothing, let her go in front.|$|E

The sheer <b>physical</b> <b>comfort</b> of its arrangements appealed to him, but after all he was not one who had ever studied his bodily ease very much, and what he regarded as the chaste refinement of its adornment had a deeper effect.

For if those pre-successes were all--if they ended at that--if nothing more were yielded than so far appears--a gross materialistic prosperity only--America, tried by subtlest tests, were a failure--has not advanced the standard of humanity a bit further than other nations. Or, in plain terms, has but inherited and enjoy'd the results of ordinary claims and preceding ages.|$|E

60|$|Like a true woman, Mildred {{found her}} {{happiness}} {{with her husband}} and children. Of the latter she had but three; a boy and two girls. The care of the last was early committed to Mrs. Dutton. This excellent woman had remained at Wychecombe with her husband, until death put an end to his vices, though the close of his career was exempt from those scenes of brutal dictation and interference that had rendered the earlier part of her life so miserable. Apprehension of what might be the consequences to himself, acted as a check, and he had sagacity enough to see that the <b>physical</b> <b>comforts</b> he now possessed were all owing to the influence of his wife. He lived but four years, however. On his death, his widow immediately took her departure for America.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a person}} moves up Maslow's {{hierarchy}} of needs, eventually {{they may find}} themselves reaching the summit — self-actualization. Maslow's hierarchy of needs begins with the most basic necessities deemed [...] "the physiological needs" [...] {{in which the individual}} will seek out items like food and water, and must be able to perform basic functions such as breathing and sleeping. Once these needs have been met, a person can move on to fulfilling [...] "the safety needs", where they will attempt to obtain a sense of security, <b>physical</b> <b>comforts</b> and shelter, employment, and property. The next level is [...] "the belongingness and love needs", where people will strive for social acceptance, affiliations, a sense of belongingness and being welcome, sexual intimacy, and perhaps a family. Next are [...] "the esteem needs", where the individual will desire a sense of competence, recognition of achievement by peers, and respect from others.|$|R

60|$|The frost {{had grown}} keener as {{darkness}} crept over the forest, and the towering pines about the clearing rose in great black spires into the nipping air, {{but it was}} almost unpleasantly hot in the little general room of Waynefleet's ranch. Waynefleet, who was fond of <b>physical</b> <b>comfort,</b> had gorged the snapping stove, {{and the smell of}} hot iron filled the log-walled room. There was also a dryness in its atmosphere which would probably have had an unpleasant effect upon anyone not used to it. The rancher, however, did not appear to feel it. He lay drowsily in a big hide chair, and his old velvet jacket and evening shoes were strangely out of harmony with his surroundings. Waynefleet made it a rule to dress for the six o'clock meal, which he persisted in calling dinner.|$|E
60|$|Many {{sensitive}} and fastidious natures are worn {{away by the}} constant friction of what are called little troubles. Without any great affliction, they feel that all the flower and sweetness of their life have faded; their eye grows dim, their cheek care-worn, and their spirit loses hope and elasticity, and becomes bowed with premature age; {{and in the midst}} of tangible and <b>physical</b> <b>comfort,</b> they are restless and unhappy. The constant under-current of little cares and vexations, which is slowly wearing on the finer springs of life, is seen by no one; scarce ever do they speak of these things to their nearest friends. Yet were there a friend of a spirit so discerning as to feel and sympathize in all these things, how much of this repressed electric restlessness would pass off through such a sympathizing mind.|$|E
6000|$|But {{spinning}} {{jenny and}} steam pump are, after all, but toys, possessing an accidental value; and natural knowledge creates multitudes of more subtle contrivances, {{the praises of}} which do not happen to be sung {{because they are not}} directly convertible into instruments for creating wealth. When I contemplate natural knowledge squandering such gifts among men, the only appropriate comparison I can find for her is to liken her to such a peasant woman as one sees in the Alps, striding ever upward, heavily burdened, and with mind bent only on her home; but yet without effort and without thought, knitting for her children. Now stockings are good and comfortable things, and the children will undoubtedly be much the better for them; but surely it would be short-sighted, to say the least of it, to depreciate this toiling mother as a mere stocking-machine--a mere provider of <b>physical</b> <b>comforts?</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether caregivers with more extreme emotional availability scores en-act {{different levels of}} soothing behaviors and whether infants of these caregivers differ in their pain scores across {{the first year of}} life. Methods Cross-sectional analyses (analyses of variance and multivariate analyses of variance) were conducted with parent–infant dyads at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age who had extreme caregiver emotional availability scores. Pain scores were exam-ined using a minimum clinically significant difference. Results Infants with lower pain scores had caregivers who were in the high emotional availability group. This effect was most pro-nounced during the regulatory period at 2 months, and clinically significant differences in pain scores were found during the regulatory period at 12 months. <b>Physical</b> <b>comforting</b> and/or rocking were characteristic of caregivers with high emotional availability. Conclusion This study suggests that caregiver emotional availability, in the extremes, do have clinically meaningful relationships with infant pain regulation.

Whether the soldier has <b>physical</b> <b>comforts</b> or suffers <b>physical</b> hardships may be a factor but is seldom the determining factor in making or unmaking his morale. A cause known and believed in; knowledge that substantial justice governs discipline; the individual's confidence and pride in himself, his comrades, his leaders; the unit's pride in its own will; these basic things, supplemented by intelligent welfare and recreation measures and brought to life by a spirit of mutual respect and co-operation, combine to weld a seasoned fighting force capable of defending the nation." ...|$|R
