50|$|The more {{important}} role of the outlet tester is to check that the outlet is properly wired, with each contact connected to the <b>proper</b> <b>wire</b> in the building's wiring. There are two primary reasons for testing this. First, some devices must have a specific prong connected to the live connection or damage to the device could result. Second, and {{more important}}ly, if the live wire is connected but the neutral or ground wire is not, a dangerous situation could be created by preventing safety mechanisms from operating properly. Furthermore, the ground wire is typically attached {{to the case of}} an electrical device as a safety precaution to carry away current if the insulation on the wires is damaged and the case becomes charged. Although this is an important safety feature on many devices, if the outlet is improperly wired with the ground plug connected to the live wire the safety mechanism has the opposite effect and charges the outside of the device creating the potential for an electric shock for anyone touching the device.|$|R
50|$|Bad wiring {{junctions}} {{can occur}} in utilization equipment, cords, or in-situ wiring and especially in a defective switch, socket, plug, wiring connection and even at the circuit breaker or fuse panels. Terminal screws loosened by vibration, improper tightening or other causes offer increased resistance to the current, with consequent heating and potential thermal creep, which will cause the termination to loosen further and exacerbate the heating effect. In North America, high resistance junctions are sometimes observed at the terminations of aluminum wire circuits, where oxidation has caused increased resistance, resulting in thermal creep. No technology located in a circuit breaker or fuse panel could detect a high-resistance wiring fault as no measurable characteristic exists that differentiates a glow fault from normal branch circuit operation. Power Fault Circuit Interrupters (PFCI) located in receptacles are designed to prevent fires caused by glowing connections in wiring or panels. From the receptacle a PFCI can detect the voltage drop when high current exists in a high resistance junction. In a properly designed and maintained circuit, substantial voltage drops should never occur. <b>Proper</b> <b>wire</b> terminations inside utilization equipment, such as appliances, and cords prevent high-resistance connections {{that could lead to}} fires.|$|R

40|$|SummaryAxon pruning during {{development}} {{is essential for}} <b>proper</b> <b>wiring</b> of the mature nervous system, but its regulation remains poorly understood. We have identified an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, Plum, that is cell autonomously required for axon pruning of mushroom body (MB) γ neurons and for ectopic synapse refinement at the developing neuromuscular junction in Drosophila. Plum promotes MB γ neuron axon pruning by regulating the expression of Ecdysone Receptor-B 1, a key initiator of axon pruning. Genetic analyses indicate that Plum acts to facilitate signaling of Myoglianin, a glial-derived TGF-β, on MB γ neurons upstream of the type-I TGF-β receptor Baboon. Myoglianin, Baboon, and Ecdysone Receptor-B 1 are also required for neuromuscular junction ectopic synapse refinement. Our study highlights both IgSF proteins and TGF-β facilitation as key promoters of developmental axon elimination and demonstrates a mechanistic conservation between MB axon pruning during metamorphosis and the refinement of ectopic larval neuromuscular connections...|$|E

Guidance of vessels and nerves has to be exquisitely regulated to ensure <b>proper</b> <b>wiring</b> of both systems. Several regulators of axon guidance have been identified and some of these are also expressed in endothelial cells; however, the extent to which their guidance functions are conserved in the vascular system is still incompletely understood. We show here that the repulsive netrin receptor UNC 5 B is expressed by endothelial tip cells of the vascular system. Disruption of the Unc 5 b gene in mice, or of Unc 5 b or netrin- 1 a in zebrafish, leads to aberrant extension of endothelial tip cell filopodia, excessive vessel branching and abnormal navigation. Netrin- 1 causes endothelial filopodial retraction, but only when UNC 5 B is present.

40|$|Brain {{function}} operates {{through the}} coordinated activation of neuronal assemblies. Graph theory predicts that scale-free topologies, which include “hubs ” (superconnected nodes), are an effective design to orchestrate synchronization. Whether hubs {{are present in}} neuronal assemblies and coordinate network activity remains unknown. Using network dynamics imaging, online reconstruction of functional connectivity, and targeted whole-cell recordings in rats and mice, we found that developing hippocampal networks follow a scale-free topology, and we demonstrated the existence of functional hubs. Perturbation of a single hub influenced the entire network dynamics. Morphophysiological analysis revealed that hub cells are a subpopulation of g-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) interneurons possessing widespread axonal arborizations. These findings establish a central role for GABAergic interneurons in shaping developing networks and help provide a conceptual framework for studying neuronal synchrony.

How these waves are generated by the retinal network though is still unclear. During stage II retinal waves, Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs) exhibit an intrinsic rhythmic bursting behaviour, triggering waves of activity across the retinal surface.

Here, we propose a biophysical model which reproduces certain intrinsic properties of immature bursting starburst amacrine cells. We perform a bifurca-tions analysis to identify the key mechanisms explaining the bursting behaviour of SACs and isolate two essential biophysical parameters controlling it; the potassium conductance gK and the rest membrane potential VL. This model also explains how different species can exhibit variable interburst intervals, as observed experimentally.

We conducted a preliminary genetic screen based on RNA interference in combination with the GAL 4 -UAS system, followed by mutational analyses.
