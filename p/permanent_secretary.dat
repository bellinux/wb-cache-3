5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as <b>Permanent</b> <b>Secretary</b> to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement.

The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E

5|$|The provincial {{administration}} {{is set up}} purely for administrative purposes. The province is headed by a minister appointed by the President and there are ministries of central government for each province. The administrative head of the province is the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Secretary,</b> appointed by the President. There is a Deputy <b>Permanent</b> <b>Secretary,</b> heads of government departments and civil servants at the provincial level. Central Province is divided into six districts: Chibombo District, Kabwe District, Kapiri Mposhi District, Mkushi District, Mumbwa District and Serenje District. All of the district headquarters {{are the same as}} the district names. There are six councils in the province, each of which is headed by an elected representative, called a councilor. Each councilor holds office for three years. The administrative staff of the council is selected based on the Local Government Service Commission from within or outside the district. The office of the provincial government is located in each of the district headquarters and has provincial local government officers and auditors. Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes and the budgets of the council are audited and submitted every year after the annual budget. The elected members of the council do not draw salaries, but are paid allowances from the council. Central Province is predominantly rural and hence there are no city or municipal councils. The government stipulates 63 different functions for the councils, with the majority of them being infrastructure management and local administration. Councils are mandated to maintain each of their community centres, zoos, local parks, drainage systems, playgrounds, cemeteries, caravan sites, libraries, museums and art galleries. They also work with specific government departments for helping in agriculture, conservation of natural resources, providing postal service, and establishing and maintaining hospitals, schools and colleges. The councils prepare schemes that encourage community participation.|$|E
