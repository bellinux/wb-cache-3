50|$|Peters' <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> {{is among}} the most {{commonly}} available Mormyrid in aquarium stores in the USA. In the aquarium it is timid, preferring a heavily planted environment with subdued lighting and thrives in a tank of more than 200 liters. Ideally, a pipe or hollow log should be provided and the optimum substrate is some soft sand that allows the fish to sift through it with its delicate extended lip. It feeds on small worms(bloodworms being the most common) and aquatic invertebrates such as mosquito larvae, but in the aquarium will accept frozen or flake food. How peaceful an <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> is can depend on the individual; some are quite aggressive with other species, while others are retiring. They may be kept in a community aquarium with peaceful species who share their water preferences. However, unless kept in an aquarium of over 400 liters, it is unwise to keep more than one <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> as they can be territorial. The elephantnose is suggested to be kept in the following conditions: pH of 6.8 to 7.2, water temperature 26C to 28C, and water of medium hardness.|$|R

40|$|The sensory system {{initiating}} C-response {{and electric}} organ discharge (EOD) {{response in the}} hearing specialist <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> was studied in an experimental swing chamber set-up. The swing chamber is specially designed for producing controlled low frequency acoustic stimulus waveforms. The waveforms studied in the experiments were single cycle sinusoids of initial acoustic pressure and particle acceleration in the frequency range 10 Hz to 30 Hz, and mimicked key components in the acoustic signature of charging predatory fish attacks. The aim {{of the study was}} to reveal how initial acoustic pressure and particle acceleration trigger the inner ear sensory system in <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> to produce acoustic EOD- and C-responses. Acoustic startle behaviour was found to be optimally triggered by a combination of acoustic particle acceleration and compression, and very rarely by the same level of acoustic particle acceleration and rarefaction. Startle behaviours were highly directional, and this was ascribed to inner ear detection and coding of the direction of the initial particle acceleration. In the centre of the test chamber, acoustic startle behaviours were triggered by the particle acceleration component alone, but at significantly lower probability than when combined with compression. Startle behaviours observed in response to the low frequency stimuli greatly extended the known audible hearing range in <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish.</b> Contrary to general opinion within the field of fish hearing, it was shown that acoustic pressure sensitivity is of behavioural relevance at very low sonic and infrasonic frequencies. The results of the study support the view that acute acoustic pressure sensitivity evolved independently several times in fish as adaptations to perform differentiated and more adaptable escapes from striking predatory attacks. EOD-responses were produced by the acoustic stimuli, and were significantly stronger to compression stimuli than to rarefaction stimuli. Why <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> emit a strong burst of EODs during acoustic startle behaviour is unclear, but may perhaps be as a distraction of electro-sensitive predators...|$|R
25|$|Play {{behaviour}} {{is often}} considered a correlate of intelligence. One possible example in fish {{is provided by}} the electrolocating Peters' <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> (mentioned above as having one of the largest brain-to-body weight ratios of all known vertebrates). One captive individual was observed carrying a small ball of aluminum foil (a good conductor of electricity) to the outflow tube of the aquarium filter, letting the current push the ball away before chasing after it and repeating the behaviour.|$|R
25|$|Fish hold {{records for}} the {{relative}} brain weights of vertebrates. Most vertebrate species have similar brain-to-body mass ratios. The deep sea bathypelagic bony-eared assfish, has the smallest ratio of all known vertebrates. At the other extreme, the electrogenic <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish,</b> an African freshwater fish, {{has one of the}} largest brain-to-body weight ratios of all known vertebrates (slightly higher than humans) and the highest brain-to-body oxygen consumption ratio of all known vertebrates (three times that for humans).|$|R

50|$|Peters' <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> {{are native}} to the rivers of West and Central Africa, in {{particular}} the lower Niger River basin, the Ogun River basin and in the upper Chari River. It prefers muddy, slowly moving rivers and pools with cover such as submerged branches. It is a dark brown to black in colour, laterally compressed (averaging 23 - 25 cm), with a rear dorsal fin and anal fin of the same length. Its caudal or tail fin is forked. It has two stripes on its lower pendicular. Its most striking feature, as its names suggest, is a trunk-like protrusion on the head. This is not actually a nose, but a sensitive extension of the mouth, that it uses for self-defense, communication, navigation, and finding worms and insects to eat. This organ is covered in electroreceptors, as is {{much of the rest}} of its body. The elephantnose uses a weak electric field, which it generates with specialized cells called electrocytes, which evolved from muscle cells, to find food, to navigate in dark or turbid waters, and to find a mate. Peters' <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> live to about 6-10 years, but there are reports of them living even longer.|$|R

(Myxozoa, Myxobolidae) in <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> (Gnathonemus petersii) imported in Italy from Nigeria are described. Diseased fish were anorexic, lethargic, and exhibited loss of weight, cachexia and death. Mortality was 50 % {{over a period}} of 60 days. Spores were detected in wet mounts of the gut wall, kidney and liver. The Unicauda sp. of this study reports a new fish host, geographic location and host tissue, and could represent a new species...|$|R
50|$|Weakly {{electric}} fish {{generate a}} discharge that is typically {{less than one}} volt. These are too weak to stun prey and instead are used for navigation, object detection (electrolocation) and communication with other electric fish (electrocommunication). Two of the best-known and most-studied examples are Peters' <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> (Gnathonemus petersi) and the black ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons). The males of the nocturnal Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus, a toothless knifefish native to the Amazon basin, give off big, long electric hums to attract a mate.|$|R
5000|$|Peters' elephant-nose fish (Gnathonemus petersii; syn. Gnathonemus brevicaudatus Pellegrin, 1919, Mormyrus petersii Günther, 1862) is an African {{freshwater}} elephantfish in {{the genus}} Gnathonemus. Other names in English include <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish,</b> long-nosed elephant fish, and Ubangi mormyrid, after the Ubangi River. As the Latin name petersii confirms it {{is named after}} someone called [...] "Peters" [...] (probably Wilhelm Peters), although the apostrophe is often misplaced and the common name given as [...] "Peter's elephantnose fish". It uses electrolocation to find prey, and has the largest brain-to-body oxygen use ratio of all known vertebrates (around 0.6).|$|R
40|$|Weakly {{electric}} fish generate {{electric current}} and use hundreds of voltage sensors {{on the surface}} of their body to navigate and locate food. Experiments (von der Emde and Fetz 2007 J. Exp. Biol. 210 3082 - 95) show that they can discriminate between differently shaped conducting or insulating objects by using electrosensing. One approach to electrically identify and characterize the object with a lower computational cost rather than full shape reconstruction is to use the first order polarization tensor (PT) of the object. In this paper, by considering experimental work on Peters' <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> Gnathonemus petersii, we investigate the possible role of the first order PT in the ability of the fish to discriminate between objects of different shapes. We also suggest some experiments that might be performed to further investigate the role of the first order PT in electrosensing fish. Finally, we speculate on the possibility of electrical cloaking or camouflage in prey of electrosensing fish and what might be learnt from the fish in human remote sensing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Electric fish {{navigate}} {{and explore}} their dark and turbid environment with a specialised electric sense. This active electrolocation involves the generation and perception {{of an electric}} signal and fish {{have proven to be}} useful model systems for the investigation of sensory-motor interactions. A well studied example is the <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish,</b> Gnathonemus petersii, which has a characteristic and unique elongated chin covered with hundreds of electroreceptor organs. This highly moveable so-called Schnauzenorgan constitutes the main fovea of the active electrosensory system. Here we present first evidence for a sensory-motor loop relating active electrical sensing to active motor exploration of the environment. Results Both anatomical and behavioural evidence have shown that the moveable Schnauzenorgan is crucial for prey localization. Here we show {{for the first time that}} a motor response (Schnauzenorgan-response, SOR) can be elicited by novel electrosensory stimuli. The SOR could be triggered with highest reliability by novel electrical stimuli near the Schnauzenorgan and, to a lesser extend, near the head of the animal. The probability of evoking the response depended on the magnitude of the amplitude change of the electric input, with bigger changes eliciting SORs more reliably. Similarly, increasing the distance of the stimulus reduced the response. In this respect the SOR is comparable to the well described novelty response, a transient acceleration of the production rate of electric signals, although the latter occurs at a shorter delay and can also be evoked by non-electrical stimuli. Conclusion Our experiments show a novel motor response that is mediated by the active electric sense of Gnathonemus petersii. This response will allow a detailed analysis of the neural system underlying direct interaction between sensory and motor processes in future experiments. </p...|$|R

The published article can be found at: [URL] Myxozoans are metazoan parasites whose traditional spore morphology-based taxonomy conflicts DNA based phylogenies. Freshwater species of the genus Hoferellus are parasites of the excretory system, with several members infecting food and ornamental fish species, as well as amphibians. This study aims to increase our understanding of their molecular diversity and development, aspects about which little is known, and to generate a molecular diagnostic tool to discriminate between different pathogenic and non-pathogenic Hoferellus spp. Methods: SSU and ITS rDNA phylogeny, along with morphological descriptions using light and electron microscopy were used to identify and characterize Hoferellus species collected from the urinary system of fishes and frogs. A PCR-based diagnostic assay was designed to differentiate between cryptic Hoferellus spp in cyprinid fishes commonly cultured in Central Europe. Results: Our phylogenetic results separate the species of Hoferellus into two phylogenetic sublineages which are indistinguishable {{on the basis of}} generic morphological traits: 1) The Hoferellus sensu stricto sublineage, which is composed of the type species Hoferellus cyprini, Hoferellus carassii and a cryptic species, Hoferellus sp. detected only molecularly in common carp. 2) The Hoferellus sensu lato sublineage into which the new species we described in this study, Hoferellus gnathonemi sp. n. from the kidney of the <b>elephantnose</b> <b>fish</b> and Hoferellus anurae from reed frogs, are placed together with Hoferellus gilsoni previously sequenced from European eel. Apart from phylogenetic analyses, we also provide novel ultrastructural data on the phagocytotic nature of some Hoferellus plasmodia and on the elusive intracellular stages ascribed to the presporogonic development of this genus. Conclusions: We provide molecular evidence of the polyphyly of the genus Hoferellus and provide novel morphological details of its members. Based on the presented data, we revise and propose emendation of the genus Hoferellus...|$|R
