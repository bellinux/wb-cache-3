5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E
