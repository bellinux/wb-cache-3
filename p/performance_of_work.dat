2500|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} stated that temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems {{and it was just}} shown that the universe tends to progress so as to maximize entropy, which is expected of any natural system. Thus, it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy. To find this relationship, the relationship between heat, work and temperature is first considered. A heat engine is a device for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy, resulting in the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> and analysis of the Carnot heat engine provides the necessary relationships. The work from a heat engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at the high temperature, qH and the heat ejected at the low temperature, qC. The efficiency is the work divided by the heat put into the system or: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} energy [...] {{of a body}} in an arbitrary state [...] can be determined by amounts of work adiabatically performed by the body on its surrounds when it starts from a reference state [...] Such work is assessed through quantities defined in the surroundings of the body. It is supposed that such work can be assessed accurately, without error due to friction in the surroundings; friction in the body is not excluded by this definition. The adiabatic <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is {{defined in terms of}} adiabatic walls, which allow transfer of energy as work, but no other transfer, of energy or matter. In particular they do not allow the passage of energy as heat. According to this definition, work performed adiabatically is in general accompanied by friction within the thermodynamic system or body. On the other hand, according to Carathéodory (1909), there also exist non-adiabatic walls, which are postulated to be [...] "permeable only to heat", and are called diathermal.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1998, the United Kingdom has fixed a {{national}} minimum wage, and sets outer limits on working time for virtually all workers. Direct wage and working time regulation is a comparatively recent phenomenon, {{as it was}} traditionally left to collective bargaining to achieve [...] "a fair day's wage for a fair day's work". The Truck Acts were the earliest wage regulations whose provisions have survived, requiring workment to be paid in money, and not kind. Now, the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 13 stipulates that employers can only dock employees’ wages (e.g. for missing stock) if the employee has consented to deductions in writing. This, however, does not cover industrial action, so following 18th century common law on part <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> employees who refused to 3 out of 37 hours a week in minor workplace disobedience, had their pay cut for the full 37. From the Trade Boards Act 1909, the UK had set minimum wages according to {{the specific needs of}} different sectors of work. But this system was eroded through the 1980s and eventually repealed in 1993. One wages council that survived was the Agricultural Wages Board, established under the Agricultural Wages Act 1948, however it was abolished in England in October 2013, though boards still operate for Scotland and Northern Ireland.|$|E

60|$|Everything {{connected}} with this dinner was strikingly suggestive {{of the circumstances}} under which it was given. The superabundance of venison and wild-fowl; the cooking done in the open air; the absence of women, and the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> usually allotted to them by bronzed and stalwart voyageurs; the wild scenery in the midst of which it took place; and the mixture of Irish, English, French, Indian, Esquimau, and compound tones, that fell upon the ear as the busy work went on,--all tended to fill the mind with a feeling of wild romance, and to suggest powerfully the idea of being, if we may so express it, far, far away! As the proceedings advanced towards completion, this feeling was rather increased than removed.|$|E
6000|$|Work, {{legitimate}} work, was {{the source}} of all wealth. That was to say, whether it was a sack of potatoes, a grand piano, or a seven-passenger touring car, it came into being only by the <b>performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Where the bunco came in was in the distribution of these things after labor had created them. He failed to see the horny-handed sons of toil enjoying grand pianos or riding in automobiles. How this came about was explained by the bunco. By tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands men sat up nights and schemed how they could get between the workers and the things the workers produced. These schemers were the business men. When they got between the worker and his product, they took a whack out of it for themselves The size of the whack was determined by no rule of equity; but by their own strength and swinishness. It was always a case of [...] "all the traffic can bear." [...] He saw all men in the business game doing this.|$|E
