2500|$|The cornet {{was invented}} by adding valves to the <b>post</b> <b>horn</b> in circa 1828. [...] The valves allowed for melodic playing {{throughout}} the register of the cornet. Trumpets were slower to adopt the new valve technology, so for the next 100 years or more, composers often wrote separate parts for trumpet and cornet. The trumpet would play fanfare-like passages, while the cornet played more melodic passages. The modern trumpet has valves that allow it to play the same notes and fingerings as the cornet.|$|E
2500|$|The name cornet {{derives from}} corne, meaning horn, itself from Latin cornu. While not musically related, {{instruments}} of the Zink family (which includes serpents) are named [...] "cornetto" [...] or [...] "cornett" [...] in modern English to distinguish {{them from the}} valved cornet described here. The 11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica referred to serpents as [...] "old wooden cornets". The Roman/Etruscan cornu (or simply [...] "horn") is the lingual ancestor of these. It is a predecessor of the <b>post</b> <b>horn</b> from which the cornet evolved and was used like a bugle to signal orders on the battlefield.|$|E

2500|$|The flugelhorn is a {{standard}} member of the British-style brass band, {{and it is also}} used frequently in jazz. It also appears occasionally in orchestral and concert band music. Famous orchestral works with flugelhorn include Igor Stravinsky's Threni, Ralph Vaughan Williams's Ninth Symphony, Danzon no. 2 by Arturo Marquez, and Michael Tippett's third symphony. The flugelhorn is sometimes substituted for the <b>post</b> <b>horn</b> in Mahler's Third Symphony, and for the soprano Roman buccine in Ottorino Respighi's Pines of Rome. In HK Gruber's trumpet concerto Busking (2007) the soloist is directed to play a flugelhorn in the slow middle movement. The flugelhorn figured prominently in many of Burt Bacharach's 1960s pop song arrangements. It is featured in a solo role in Bert Kaempfert's 1962 recording of [...] "That Happy Feeling". Flugelhorns have occasionally been used as the alto or low soprano voice in a drum and bugle corps.|$|E
60|$|Other themes denote objects which {{cannot be}} imitatively {{suggested}} by music: for instance, music cannot suggest a ring, and cannot suggest gold; yet {{each of these}} has a representative theme which pervades the score in all directions. In {{the case of the}} gold the association is established by the very salient way in which the orchestra breaks into the pretty theme in the first act of The Rhine Gold at the moment when the sunrays strike down through the water and light up the glittering treasure, hitherto invisible. The reference of the strange little theme of the wishing cap is equally manifest from the first, since the spectator's attention is wholly taken up with the Tarnhelm and its magic when the theme is first pointedly uttered by the orchestra. The sword theme is introduced at the end of The Rhine Gold to express Wotan's hero inspiration; and I have already mentioned that Wagner, unable, when it came to practical stage management, to forego the appeal to the eye {{as well as to the}} thought, here made Wotan pick up a sword and brandish it, though no such instruction appears in the printed score. When this sacrifice to Wagner's scepticism as to the reality of any appeal to an audience that is not made through their bodily sense is omitted, the association of the theme with the sword is not formed until that point in the first act of The Valkyries at which Siegmund is left alone by Hunding's hearth, weaponless, with the assurance that he will have to fight for his life at dawn with his host. He recalls then how his father promised him a sword for his hour of need; and as he does so, a flicker from the dying fire is caught by the golden hilt of the sword in the tree, when the theme immediately begins to gleam through the quiver of sound from the orchestra, and only dies out as the fire sinks and the sword is once more hidden by the darkness. Later on, this theme, which is never silent whilst Sieglinda is dwelling on the story of the sword, leaps out into the most dazzling splendor the band can give it when Siegmund triumphantly draws the weapon from the tree. As it consists of seven notes only, with a very marked measure, and a melody like a simple flourish on a trumpet or <b>post</b> <b>horn,</b> nobody capable of catching a tune can easily miss it.|$|E

5000|$|Sandra Shelton, a {{graduate}} student at the University of Phoenix, was assigned the task of hunting down the West Virginia Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock by her professor, a retired Senior Special Agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General. This moon rock was presented to West Virginia in 1974 and is valued at $5 million. On May 16, 2010, Rick Steelhammer of the Gazette-Mail of Charleston, West Virginia wrote a front-page story documenting Sandra Shelton's investigative findings which revealed that the West Virginia Goodwill Moon Rock was missing. [...] Following that story, retired dentist Robert Conner called Shelton and told her that he had the West Virginia Goodwill Moon Rock. Shelton informed her professor, who advised the Governor's Office. Dr. Conner said that his deceased brother was the former business partner of former West Virginia Governor Arch A.

Out of My Mind has received reviews from The Denver Post, The Columbus Dispatch, Publishers Weekly, Children's Literature, Washington <b>Post,</b> The <b>Horn</b> Book, and The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books. The novel received starred reviews from School Library Journal, Booklist, and Kirkus Reviews. Kirkus Reviews praised the book was [...] "rich in detail of both the essential normalcy and the difficulties of a young person with cerebral palsy", and [...] "descriptions of both Melody’s challenges—“Going to the bathroom at school just plain sucks”—and the insensitivities of some are unflinching and realistic". Publishers Weekly criticized {{that there was a}} [...] "lack of tension in the plot", although it was [...] "resolved halfway through". Booklist stated that Out of My Mind is [...] "a book that defies age categorization, an easy enough read for upper-elementary students yet also a story that will enlighten and resonate with teens and adults". The Bulletin said the novel [...] "make students think twice about their classmates, acquaintances, and siblings with special needs". The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) stated [...] "Draper challenges those who read her story to become activists for those who are different". The Denver Post powerfully concluded: [...] "if there's only one book teens and parents (and everyone else) can read this year, Out of My Mind should be it." [...] VOYA Magazine praised [...] "Melody's triumphs and setbacks as she strives to become a socially accepted classmate and team member are vividly described in this inspirational novel, which will appeal not only to middle school readers but also to anyone who wonders what might be going on in the minds of individuals with severe physical handicaps". The Horn Book exclaimed that the novel is [...] "a powerfully eye-opening book with both an unforgettable protagonist and a rich cast of fully realized, complicated background characters". Children's Literature said [...] "this is a genuinely moving novel". The Washington Post commented [...] "author Sharon Draper creates an authentic character who insists, through her lively voice and indomitable will, that the reader become fully involved with the girl in the pink wheelchair".|$|R

50|$|Working oxen usually require shoes, {{although}} in England not all working oxen were shod. Since their hooves are cloven, two shoes or ox cues {{are required for}} each hoof, unlike the single shoe of a horse. Ox shoes are usually of approximately half-moon or banana shape, either with or without caulkins, and are fitted in symmetrical pairs to the hooves. Unlike horses, oxen are not easily able to balance on three legs while a farrier shoes the fourth. In England, shoeing was accomplished by throwing the ox {{to the ground and}} lashing all four feet to a heavy wooden tripod until the shoeing was complete. A similar technique was used in Serbia and, in a simpler form, in India, where it is still practiced. In Italy, where oxen may be very large, shoeing is accomplished using a massive framework of beams in which the animal can be partly or completely lifted from the ground by slings passed under the body; the feet are then lashed to lateral beams or held with a rope while the shoes are fitted. Such devices were made of wood in the past, but may today be of metal. Similar devices are found in France, Austria, Germany, Spain, Canada and the United States, where they may be called ox slings, ox presses or shoeing stalls. The system was sometimes adopted in England also, where the device was called a crush or trevis; one example is recorded in the Vale of Pewsey. The shoeing of an ox partly lifted in a sling is the subject of John Singer Sargent's painting Shoeing the Ox, while A Smith Shoeing an Ox by Karel Dujardin shows an ox being shod standing, tied to a <b>post</b> by the <b>horns</b> and balanced by supporting the raised hoof.|$|R
