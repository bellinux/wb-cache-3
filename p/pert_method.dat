Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Program evaluation and review techniques (PERT) is an efficient tool for large project management. In actual project control decisions, classical PERT, which is based upon beta distribution, presents a few deficiencies. Generally speaking, classical PERT is explained as the probabilistic approach. On the other hand, activity times in the possibilistic approach such as fuzzy PERT are defined as fuzzy variables instead of random variables used in the traditional probabilistic approaches, which the classical PERT and Monte Carlo simulation. Through this study, we present one way of project scheduling using fuzzy PERT, and apply the possibilistic approach to addressing the uncertainty of a project completion date. Moreover, in fuzzy PERT, we find multiple possible critical paths through a case network, overcoming the shortcomings in the classical PERT, in which critical path is a single and deterministic path, and apply the concept in fuzzy set theory to risk assessment for a project completion date. In recent years, fuzzy <b>PERT</b> <b>methods</b> have been proposed based on possibility theory and fuzzy set theory and developed as an alternate approach to probability theory for quantifying the uncertainty related to activity times.

30|$|Regardless of the {{planning}} methodology adopted, modeling repetitive activities requires careful attention to ensure accuracy since a small error in the estimate of a single repetition translates to a large error over many repetitions. Moreover, effects such as learning and forgetting (Gates and Scarpa, 1972) in repetitive activities can be dramatic and if not properly addressed can lead to significant errors in the estimation of project performance. Uncertainty in activity performance {{must also be taken}} into account since it can significantly impact the accuracy of project performance estimates. Ignoring uncertainty (using a deterministic analysis) leads to optimistic estimates of project performance for concurrent interacting processes, the so-called fallacy of averages. The <b>PERT</b> <b>method</b> is a relatively popular tool used for modeling uncertainty in construction schedules, but it only considers uncertainty along the deterministically derived critical path and therefore underestimates both project uncertainty and project duration. Consequently, the <b>PERT</b> <b>method,</b> while simple to use, is only suitable for projects that have a dominant critical path with a low probability of other paths becoming critical. Indeed, interactions between construction processes are usually sufficiently complicated that stochastic effects can only be modeled accurately using statistical sampling techniques, the most popular of which being the Monte Carlo method.|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2011 Son yıllarda proje yönetimi iş yaşamının vazgeçilmezi haline gelmiştir. Proje yönetiminin öneminin artması ile proje yöneticiliği de çok önemli bir meslek dalı olmuştur. Astronomik rakamlarla yürütülen mega projelerde, işi takip eden şirket ya da kurumların işten kazançlı çıkmaması gibi bir durum elbette düşünülemez. Ancak maksimum kazanç ve kısa zamanda projenin planlaması ve yapılan tahminlerin proje ile örtüşmesi projeyi daha başarılı kılar. Dahası, ihalelere en optimum maliyet ve zamana dayalı teklif verebilmek ancak ve ancak önceden yapılmış doğru bir planlama ile mümkündür. Planlama, proje yönetiminin temelini oluşturan bir unsurdur. Planlamada öncelikle yapılacak işler belirlenir, tanıtılır, işlemler adım adım sıraya konulur ve gerekli metaryeller saptanır. Proje yönetiminde her şey planlanabilir; süre, maliyet, kalite, üretim… vb. Özellikle, proje yönetiminde süre planlaması ve buna bağlı olarak ortaya çıkacak minimum maliyet konuları üzerinde durulmaktadır. Süre planlamasında önemli olan işlemlerin yapılma sürelerinin ya tecrübeye bağlı olarak yapılan kesin çıkarımlarla ya da tahminlerle ortaya konulması, sıralanması ve çakışan işlemlerin belirlenmesidir. Süresel planlamada birçok metod ortaya konmuştur. Bunun ilki ve en eskisi Gantt Diyagramı’ dır. Bu metod basit işlemler için ideal bir metodtur, ayrıca karmaşık işlemlerde ve diyagrama ya da programa yeni eklemeler yapıldığında oldukça hantal bir metod olduğundan çalışmaların hepsini ya da bir kısmını baştan almak gerekebilir. İkinci ve yine eski bir süresel planlama yöntemi devre metodudur ve bu yöntem de tercih edilen bir yöntem değildir. En yaygın planlama yöntemleri CPM ve PERT metodlarıdır. Burada CPM kesin çıkarımlara, PERT de birtakım tahminlere dayanır, bu iki yöntem birbiri ile ilişkili olduğundan bir arada kullanılabilir. Bu yöntemlerin kullanımı gerek zamanlama ve gerekse maliyet planlaması açısından oldukça avantajlıdır ve hantal yöntemler değildirler. Hata oranları da nispeten yok denilecek kadar küçüktür. Harita üretim sektörü açısından düşünüldüğünde CPM ve PERT yöntemleri en uygun yöntemlerdir, çünkü harita projelerinde de birtakım olasılık ve parametre tahminleri söz konusudur. Mevcut tez çalışmasında, Yalova Hacımehmed- 1 mevkiinde yapılacak 3194 / 18. madde uygulaması projesine ait veriler derlenerek CPM ve PERT metodları kullanılarak süre planlaması yapılması ve en düşük maliyet hesaplanması üzerine bir çalışma gerçekleştirilmiştir. Bu tez çalışmasının amacı, projelerde bu başarıyı elde etmek adına proje planlama ve yönetimini irdeleyerek geomatik mühendisliğinde uygulanışının bir avantaj sağlayacağını göstermektir. Project {{management}} {{is the art}} of coordinating human and sources throughout the life of a project by using modern management techniques to achieve predetermined objectives of scope, cost, time, quality and participation satisfaction. Project {{management is}} a systematic proces used to initiate, plan, execute, control and close a project to meet defined objectives. The science and art of project management provides a roadmap for efficient and successful project completion. Project planning is part of project management, which relates to the use of schedules such as Gantt charts to plan and subsequently report progress within the project environment. Project management has been the most important step in business life nowadays. The job which is called as project manager is getting popular by increasing importance of the project management. A project is successful when the needs of the stakeholders have been met. A stakeholder is anybody directly or indirectly impacted by the project. As a first step, it is important to identify the stakeholders in the project. It is not always easy to identify the stakeholders of a project, particularly those impacted indirectly. The science and art of project management provides a proven methodology for accurate and efficient project complement of any size. Thorough and detailed project planning results in a bought-into, approved, realistic, and formalized project plan. Such careful planning saves time and money by proactively addressing risks before they occur, as well as by eliminating the need for changes late in the project. Studies have shown that changes made late in a project could cost up to 100 times as much as if they were made early in project planning. The projects which is called as mega projects are finished by huge amount of money. In those projects project management should be used for more succes. The another important issue is the time of the projects. The time which is between the beginnin {{and the end of the}} project is called project time. In addition, if the project time is as short as possible, the project cost will be decrease. So, the money which is earned from the project will be more. Furthermore, the success of such projects is important for the companies. If the companies have a good project management plan, being unsuccesful is impossible. A project can not be thought without a planning technique of project management. The projects without a plan are always unsuccessful. If a project has a good plan, the predictions will be almost the same as the real. Those predictions are about the time, sources, staff and cost. Depends on time predictions, project manager will decide the beginning, the end and empty time of the project. Also, the cost prediction of the project gives an opportunity of finding the money which is earned from that project. When companies recognize the need to begin developing processes for project management, the starting point is normally the stage-gate process. The stages are managed by cross-functional teams. The gates are structured decision points at the end of each stage. In a good project management, project team focuses too much attention on prepearing for the gate reviews rather than on the actual management of the project. Project management is used to manage the stages between the gates and shorten the time between the gates. That is a critical success factor if the stage-gate process is to be used fort he development and new products. A perfect methodology for project management will provide checklists, forms and guidelines to make sure that critical steps are not omitted. The approximate total cost of the project is determined, a cost-benefit analysis should be made to determine if the estimated value of the information which is obtained. That analysis is included as part of a feasibility study. The project manager is a profession of project management. Project managers may have the responsibility of the project planning relating to construction industry, engineering, architecture and communication techniques. A project manager is the person who creates clear and attainable project objectives showing the project requirements. The project manager aims to create an atmosphere of a cooperative and effective team. A successful Project Manager must effectively manage the resources assigned to the project. That includes the labor hours of the designers, the builders, the testers and the inspectors on the project team. It also include managing any labor subcontracts. However, managing project resources frequently involves more than people management. The project manager must also manage the equipment used for the project and the material needed by the people and equipment assigned to the project. Project management is developed from civil construction and engineering. The father of planning and control of the projects is called Hanry Gantt, who is the Gantt Chart as a project management tool. The another forefather of project management is Hanry Fayol. Both Gantt and Fayol were students of Frederick Winslow Taylor’s Theories Of Scientific Management. In the United States, from the beginning 1950 s, Gantt Charts and other informal techniques were using but after, two mathematical project-scheduling models were developed. The (CPM) ‘‘Critical Path Method’’ was developed from Du Pont Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation for managing plan maintenance projects. The ‘‘Program Evaluation and Review Technique’’ or PERT was developed by Hamilton as a part of a submarine program of USA Navy which is called Polaris. The project planning is a part of project management which is for schedules such as Gantt Charts. Firstly, the project scope should be defined and planning methods for completing the project will be determined. After, the logical dependencies between tasks are defined using a diagram which is giving the total cost of the project. The progress of the project will be analized against the baseline throughout the life of the project. Analyzing progress compared to the baseline is known as earned value management. For management of activities and a project schedule, developing procedures involve giving a detailed schedule at the project definition stage. There are a range of project management techniques which are used to track time and manage resources in a project. When the scope of the project is defined, the project manager with the help of the client requirements capture team proposes the budget and the recources in the project at the beginning of the project. There are lots of different planning types such as time planning, source planning, quality planning, staff planning… etc. Time management encompasses the work required to create realistic time estimates, andultimately an approved schedule for the completion of project activities in the most timely manner possible. It also involves managing the project to ensure adherence to the schedule. Cost management encompasses the work required to create realistic cost estimates, and ultimately an approved budget for the completion of project activities in the most cost effective manner possible. It also involves managing the project to ensure adherence to the budget. No one is happy when work exceeds the budget allocated for it, which is why creating a realistic budget is imperative. In that thesis project we insist on time planning in project management. There are time planning methods such as Gantt Diagrams, <b>PERT</b> and CPM <b>Methods.</b> Gantt Diagrams are widely used in Millitary Applications. Althought, Gantt is a classical <b>method.</b> CPM and <b>PERT</b> <b>Methods</b> are new, usable and widely used methods. Any change in the diagrams of CPM and <b>PERT</b> <b>methods</b> are really easy. These methods are arranged by time intervals of works in the projects. Depends of that time plan, the source plan should be made. Furthermore, a project that is about reconstruction aplication was planned by CPM and <b>PERT</b> <b>methods</b> and I have showed the advanteges and disadvanteges of these methods. That project consists of the application of CPM and <b>PERT</b> <b>Methods</b> about 3194 / 18. artical of the reconstruction law. Aplication of Yalova Hacı Mehmet- 1 Region. Microsoft Office Project Manager is a program which is used for project management and that program has been used for ‘‘Project Management and Planning In Geomatics Engineering’’ project. At the begining of the application, the works are selected and the time intervals for each application are predicted depends on knowledge of the previous projects. Then, the works, the time and critical works are entered into the programme. After that, Gantt Diagram of the project is drawn and CPM Diagram is drawn. Anyway, CPM showed us the beginning and the end of the project and also, the time intervals of each work of the project. Also, it gives an a opportunity of management of the time depends on CPM method. That time management is a programme of cost plan, the cost plan is for both the source management and prediction of the money which is earned from the project. Project management provides significant benefits to companies and to managers when the principles and methodologies are consistently applied. First, project management helps managers identify ill-conceived and directionless projects. After, project management promotes teamwork and communication across departments. Also, project management enables managers to predict costs and make more informed decisions. Shortly, the science and art of project management provides a roadmap for perfect andmore and more successful project completion. Project planning is the most important part of project management, which relates to the use of schedules and report progress within the project environment. Projects can not be successful without using project management techniques. Those techniques are for the perfect plan of each project. As I showed, in that project CPM Technique gives an important opportunity for time and cost planning and cost management is around the work required to create realistic cost predictions, and ultimately an approved budget for the completion of project activities in the most cost effective manner possible. Anyway, projects can not be thought without a good management plan and a project manager. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

Barata Indonesia). Thus obtained the z: Z = ((T (d)) -Te)) / S = (210 - 202) / 5. 472 = 1. 413. From this table, Appendix I (Imam Suharto, 1995; 708) cumulative probability z obtained figures of 0. 92073 means that the possibility of the project can be completed on target T (d) equal to 202 days amounted to 92. 07...|$|E

Early part of thesis describes components of a thermal block. It is followed by the description of action course analysis methods needed for completion of the project's maintenance. With Critical Path Method we can easily determine the longest path throughout the project as durations of activities have exact estimations. <b>Method</b> <b>PERT</b> identifies likely range sizes of activity duration, and acts as an upgrade for CPM analysis. We decided to use beta distribution, for which we needed three estimates of activity duration; optimistic, most likely and pessimistic time. In the second part of thesis we briefly describe the software Pertmaster. We made the project plan and analyzed the risk of project's completion. Resulting critical paths were put through simulation with software programs Pertmaster and Mathematica. Results from the program Pertmaster had minor deviations from the results of Mathematica according to simulations with beta pert distribution. To verify the accuracy of the data, we made extra simulations in both programs with triangular distribution...|$|R

Mediante una revisión bibliográfica sobre el marco de la gerencia de proyectos del PMBOK, y la aplicación de técnicas que permitan mejorar los procesos así como el mejor {{manejo de}} los costos, tiempo y calidad del proyecto. Para tal fin, se ha discutido técnicas en planeación de proyectos, algunos conceptos y herramientas a tomar en cuenta en cualquier tipo de proyecto de edificación. Los métodos de planeación como el diagrama de barras, método del camino crítico, PERT, y software en administración de proyectos, como herramientas necesarias para la correcta guía y definición del proyecto, sin dejar de mencionar la planeación de recursos financieros, humanos y materiales, por consiguiente se debe tomar la técnica más adecuada porque cada proyecto es único. Asimismo, sobre la base de la planeación de actividades, se ha desarrollado técnicas que permitan realizar acciones y monitoreos para saber si se está cumpliendo con los objetivos que se plantearon al inicio del proyecto. Por esto es importante el control de procesos y el correcto control de los recursos en general del proyecto, es parte importante en la ejecución, {{debido a que}} con este seguimiento de avance y control de las actividades, se tiene que ir revisando y reprogramando cada una de ellas para alcanzar los objetivos planteados. Por otro lado, dichas técnicas deben ser implementadas de acuerdo a las metas y objetivos que se propongan los responsables del proyecto así como el correcto orden, en el monitoreo y seguimiento de cada una de las actividades con técnicas de reprogramación y optimización para encaminar el proyecto y cumplir con lo establecido inicialmente. Este enfoque permitirá cumplir con las expectativas del proyecto y cliente. De esta manera, la investigación ha considerado tres proyectos con fines de estudio, en los cuales fueron evaluadas la planeación y actividades de control relacionados con la gerencia de proyectos que se realizan dentro de los mismos. De esta manera, se identificaron los principales factores que repercuten en el desempeño de la gerencia del proyecto. Una vez analizados estos factores, se ha propuesto lineamientos gerenciales, que permitieron corregir las deficiencias de la planeación y control encontradas en los objetos de estudio. The investigation has for objective the project analysis of edification and proposing guidelines to optimize the processes in management of projects in the stages of planning and control of multi-family buildings. By means of a bibliographic revision on {{the frame of the}} management of projects of the PMBOK, and the application of techniques than permit improving the processes as well as the best handling of costs, time and quality of the project. For such end, techniques in planning of projects, some concepts have been discussed and tools to drink in account in any type of project of edification. The methods of planning like the bar chart, critical path <b>method,</b> <b>PERT,</b> and software managed by the administrator of projects, like necessary tools for the correct guide and definition of the project without failing to mention the planning of financial resources,, humans and materials, consequently he must take the best-suited technique because each project is unique. In like manner, on the base of the planning of activities, techniques have been developed, that they permit accomplishing stock and monitorings to know if it is coming true with the objectives that came into question {{to the start of the}} project. For this reason the control becomes of processes and the correct control of resources in general of the project importantly, important part in the execution is, owed to than with this tracking of advance and control of activities, it is been known that to go for checking and reprogramming each join their to attain the presented objectives. In addition, the aforementioned techniques must be implemented according to goals and objectives that they intend the responsible ones belonging to the project as well as the correct order, in monitoring and tracking out of every an one belonging to activities with techniques of rescheduling and optimization stop to put on the right road the project and fulfilling the established initially. This focus will permit fulfilling the expectations of the project and customer. This way, the investigation has considered three projects with intentions of study, in the ones that they were in evaluated the planning and activities of control related with the management of projects that are accomplished inside of the same. This way, they identified the principal factors that have influence upon the performance of the management of the project.

40|$|The goal of {{bioinformatics}} is {{to develop}} innovative and practical methods and algorithms for bio- logical questions. In many cases, these questions are driven by new biotechnological techniques, especially by genome and cell wide high throughput experiment studies. In principle there are two approaches: 1. Reduction and abstraction of the question to a clearly deﬁned optimization problem, which can be solved with appropriate and efﬁcient algorithms. 2. Development of context based methods, incorporating as much contextual knowledge {{as possible in the}} algorithms, and derivation of practical solutions for relevant biological ques- tions on the high-throughput data. These methods can be often supported by appropriate software tools and visualizations, allowing for interactive evaluation of the results by ex- <b>perts.</b> Context based <b>methods</b> are often much more complex and require more involved algorithmic techniques to get practical relevant and efﬁcient solutions for real world problems, as in many cases already the simpliﬁed abstraction of problems result in NP-hard problem instances. In many cases, to solve these complex problems, one needs to employ efﬁcient data structures and heuristic search methods to solve clearly deﬁned sub-problems using efﬁcient (polynomial) op- timization (such as dynamic programming, greedy, path- or tree-algorithms). In this thesis, we present new methods and analyses addressing open questions of bioinformatics from different contexts by incorporating the corresponding contextual knowledge. The two main contexts in this thesis are the protein structure similarity context (Part I) and net- work based interpretation of high-throughput data (Part II). For the protein structure similarity context Part I we analyze the consistency of gold standard structure classiﬁcation systems and derive a consistent benchmark set usable for different ap- plications. We introduce two methods (Vorolign, PPM) for the protein structure similarity recog- nition problem, based on different features of the structures. Derived from the idea and results of Vorolign, we introduce the concept of contact neighbor- hood potential, aiming to improve the results of protein fold recognition and threading. For the re-scoring problem of predicted structure models we introduce the method Vorescore, clearly improving the fold-recognition performance, and enabling the evaluation of the contact neighborhood potential for structure prediction methods in general. We introduce a contact consistent Vorolign variant ccVorolign further improving the structure based fold recognition performance, and enabling direct optimization of the neighborhood po- tential in the future. Due to the enforcement of contact-consistence, the ccVorolign method has much higher computational complexity than the polynomial Vorolign method - the cost of com- puting interpretable and consistent alignments. Finally, we introduce a novel structural alignment method (PPM) enabling the explicit modeling and handling of phenotypic plasticity in protein structures. We employ PPM for the analysis of effects of alternative splicing on protein structures. With the help of PPM we test the hypothesis, whether splice isoforms of the same protein can lead to protein structures with different folds (fold transitions). In Part II of the thesis we present methods generating and using context information for the interpretation of high-throughput experiments. For the generation of context information of molecular regulations we introduce novel textmin- ing approaches extracting relations automatically from scientiﬁc publications. In addition to the fast NER (named entity recognition) method (syngrep) we also present a novel, fully ontology-based context-sensitive method (SynTree) allowing for the context-speciﬁc dis- ambiguation of ambiguous synonyms and resulting in much better identiﬁcation performance. This context information is important for the interpretation of high-throughput data, but often missing in current databases. Despite all improvements, the results of automated text-mining methods are error prone. The RelAnn application presented in this thesis helps to curate the automatically extracted regula- tions enabling manual and ontology based curation and annotation. For the usage of high-throughput data one needs additional methods for data processing, for example methods to map the hundreds of millions short DNA/RNA fragments (so called reads) on a reference genome or transcriptome. Such data (RNA-seq reads) are the output of next generation sequencing methods measured by sequencing machines, which {{are becoming more and more}} efﬁcient and affordable. Other than current state-of-the-art methods, our novel read-mapping method ContextMap re- solves the occurring ambiguities at the ﬁnal step of the mapping process, employing thereby the knowledge of the complete set of possible ambiguous mappings. This approach allows for higher precision, even if more nucleotide errors are tolerated in the read mappings in the ﬁrst step. The consistence between context information of molecular regulations stored in databases and extracted from textmining against measured data can be used to identify and score consistent reg- ulations (GGEA). This method substantially extends the commonly used gene-set based methods such over-representation (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Finally we introduce the novel method RelExplain, which uses the extracted contextual knowl- edge and generates network-based and testable hypotheses for the interpretation of high-throughput data. Bioinformatik befasst sich mit der Entwicklung innovativer und praktisch einsetzbarer Verfahren und Algorithmen für biologische Fragestellungen. Oft ergeben sich diese Fragestellungen aus neuen Beobachtungs- und Messverfahren, insbesondere neuen Hochdurchsatzverfahren und genom- und zellweiten Studien. Im Prinzip gibt es zwei Vorgehensweisen: Reduktion und Abstraktion der Fragestellung auf ein klar definiertes Optimierungsproblem, das dann mit geeigneten möglichst effizienten Algorithmen gelöst wird. Die Entwicklung von kontext-basierten Verfahren, die möglichst viel Kontextwissen und möglichst viele Randbedingungen in den Algorithmen nutzen, um praktisch relevante Lösungen für relvante biologische Fragestellungen und Hochdurchsatzdaten zu erhalten. Die Verfahren können oft durch geeignete Softwaretools und Visualisierungen unterstützt werden, um eine interaktive Auswertung der Ergebnisse durch Fachwissenschaftler zu ermöglichen. Kontext-basierte Verfahren sind oft wesentlich aufwändiger und erfordern involviertere algorithmische Techniken um für reale Probleme, deren simplifizierende Abstraktionen schon NP-hart sind, noch praktisch relevante und effiziente Lösungen zu ermöglichen. Oft werden effiziente Datenstrukturen und heuristische Suchverfahren benötigt, die für klar umrissene Teilprobleme auf effiziente (polynomielle) Optimierungsverfahren (z. B. dynamische Programmierung, Greedy, Wege- und Baumverfahren) zurückgreifen und sie entsprechend für das Gesamtverfahren einsetzen. In dieser Arbeit werden eine Reihe von neuen Methoden und Analysen vorgestellt um offene Fragen der Bioinformatik aus verschiedenen Kontexten durch Verwendung von entsprechendem Kontext-Wissen zu adressieren. Die zwei Hauptkontexte in dieser Arbeit sind (Teil 1) die Ähnlichkeiten von 3 D Protein Strukturen und (Teil 2) auf die netzwerkbasierte Interpretation von Hochdurchsatzdaten. Im Proteinstrukturkontext Teil 1 analysieren wir die Konsistenz der heute verfügbaren Goldstandards für Proteinstruktur-Klassifikationen, und leiten ein vielseitig einsetzbares konsistentes Benchmark-Set ab. Für eine genauere Bestimmung der Ähnlichkeit von Proteinstrukturen beschreiben wir zwei Methoden (Vorolign, PPM), die unterschiedliche Strukturmerkmale nutzen. Ausgehend von den für Vorolign erzielten Ergebnissen, führen wir Kontakt-Umgebungs-Potentiale mit dem Ziel ein, Fold-Erkennung (auf Basis der vorhandenen Strukturen) und Threading (zur Proteinstrukturvorhersage) zu verbessern. Für das Problem des Re-scorings von vorhergesagten Strukturmodellen beschreiben wir das Vorescore Verfahren ein, mit dem die Fold-Erkennung deutlich verbessert, aber auch die Anwendbarkeit von Potentialen im Allgemeinen getested werden kann. Zur weiteren Verbesserung führen wir eine Kontakt-konsistente Vorolign Variante (ccVorolign) ein, die wegen der neuen Konsistenz-Randbedingung erheblich aufwÃ¤ndiger als das polynomielle Vorolignverfahren ist, aber eben auch interpretierbare konsistente Alignments liefert. Das neue Strukturalignment Verfahren (PPM) erlaubt es phänotypische Plastizität, explizit zu modellieren und zu berücksichtigen. PPM wird eingesetzt, um die Effekte von alternativem Splicing auf die Proteinstruktur zu untersuchen, insbesondere die Hypothese, ob Splice-Isoformen unterschiedliche Folds annehmen können (Fold-Transitionen). Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit werden Verfahren zur Generierung von Kontextinformationen und zu ihrer Verwendung für die Interpretation von Hochdurchsatz-Daten vorgestellt. Neue Textmining Verfahren extrahieren aus wissenschaftlichen Publikationen automatisch molekulare regulatorische Beziehungen und entsprechende Kontextinformation. Neben schnellen NER (named entity recognition) Verfahren (wie syngrep) wird auch ein vollständig Ontologie-basiertes kontext-sensitives Verfahren (SynTree) eingeführt, das es erlaubt, mehrdeutige Synonyme kontext-spezifisch und damit wesentlich genauer aufzulösen. Diese für die Interpretation von Hochdurchsatzdaten wichtige Kontextinformation fehlt häufig in heutigen Datenbanken. Automatische Verfahren produzieren aber trotz aller Verbesserungen noch viele Fehler. Mithilfe unserer Applikation RelAnn können aus Texten extrahierte regulatorische Beziehungen ontologiebasiert manuell annotiert und kuriert werden. Die Verwendung aktueller Hochdurchsatzdaten benötigt zusätzliche Ansätze für die Datenprozessierung, zum Beispiel für das Mapping von hunderten von Millionen kurzer DNA/RNA Fragmente (sog. reads) auf Genom oder Transkriptom. Diese Daten (RNA-seq) ergeben sich durch next generation sequencing Methoden, die derzeit mit immer leistungsfähigeren Geräten immer kostengünstiger gemessen werden können. In der ContextMap Methode werden im Gegensatz zu state-of-the-art Verfahren die auftretenden Mehrdeutigkeiten erst am Ende des Mappingprozesses aufgelöst, wenn die Gesamtheit der Mappinginformationen zur Verfügung steht. Dadurch könenn mehr Fehler beim Mapping zugelassen und trotzdem höhere Genauigkeit erreicht werden. Die Konsistenz zwischen der Kontextinformation aus Textmining und Datenbanken sowie den gemessenen Daten kann dann für das Auffinden und Bewerten von konsistente Regulationen (GGEA) genutzt werden. Dieses Verfahren stellt eine wesentliche Erweiterung der häufig verwendeten Mengen-orientierten Verfahren wie overrepresentation (ORA) und gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) dar. Zuletzt stellen wir die Methode RelExplain vor, die aus dem extrahierten Kontextwissen netzwerk-basierte, testbare Hypothesen für die Erklärung von Hochdurchsatzdaten generiert...|$|R
