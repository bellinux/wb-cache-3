40|$|Published in Proteomics 2007 7 : 3800 - 3808 at www. interscience. wiley. comBlack <b>point</b> {{of barley}} <b>grain</b> is a {{disorder}} characterised by a brown-black discolouration at the embryo {{end of the}} <b>grain.</b> Black <b>point</b> is undesirable to the malting industry and results in significant economic loss annually. To identify proteins associated with barley black point we utilised a proteomic approach with 2 -DE to compare proteins from whole grain samples of black <b>pointed</b> and healthy <b>grain.</b> From this comparison two condition-specific proteins were identified: a novel 75 kDa late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein and a barley grain peroxidase 1 (BP 1) that were specifically more abundant in healthy <b>grain</b> and black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain,</b> respectively. Although LEA protein was less abundant in black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain,</b> LEA gene expression was greater suggesting protein degradation had possibly occurred in black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain.</b> Similarly, the increase in BP 1 in black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain</b> could not be explained by gene expression. Western blot analysis also revealed that the identified LEA protein is biotinylated in vivo. The role {{that each of these}} proteins might have in black point development is discussed. Timothy J.

40|$|There are two {{components}} of quality in malting barley: {{the first is}} grain quality {{and the second is}} malt quality. To ensure that malt of the highest quality is produced during the time-limited malting process, the barley must be able to germinate vigorously and uniformly. It has been proposed that black point can affect the germination of barley grains. As a consequence, black <b>pointed</b> <b>grain</b> is routinely downgraded from malt quality to feed quality resulting in substantial losses to the grower. However limited research has been carried out to determine whether black <b>pointed</b> <b>grains</b> behave differently to clean grains during the malting process. Our research found that black point did not reduce germination energy of the <b>grain,</b> with black <b>pointed</b> <b>grains</b> able to germinate as readily as clean grains. This paper discusses germination energy, alphaamylase activity and microscopic investigation of the grain in relation to grain viability and black point, to determine the suitability of black <b>point</b> discoloured <b>grain</b> for use in malting.

50|$|Silo Point, {{formerly}} known as the Baltimore and Ohio Locust <b>Point</b> <b>Grain</b> Terminal Elevator, is a residential complex converted from a high-rise grain elevator {{on the edge of the}} Locust Point neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland. When the original grain elevator was completed in 1923, it was the largest and fastest in the world. The grain elevator rises to 300 feet (94 meters). The silo was built by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1923-1924, with a capacity of 3.8 billion bushels. In 2009 it had been converted from a grain elevator to a condominium tower containing 24 floors and 228 condominiums by Turner Development Group and architect Parameter, Inc.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{molecular}} dynamics simulation method for growth of fully dense nanocrystalline materials crystallized from melt was used with the Stillinger-Weber three-body potential to synthesize nanocrystalline Si with a grain size up to 75 {Angstrom}. Structures of the highly constrained grain boundaries (GBs), triple lines, and <b>point</b> <b>grain</b> junctions {{were found to be}} highly disordered and similar to the structure of amorphous Si. These and earlier results for fcc metals suggest that a nanocrystalline microstructure may be viewed as a two-phase system, namely an ordered crystalline phase in the grain interiors connected by an amorphous, intergranular, glue-like phase. Analysis of the structures of bicrystalline GBs in the same materials reveals the presence of an amorphous intergranular equilibrium phase only in the high-energy but not the low-energy GBs, suggesting that only high-energy boundaries are present in nanocrystalline microstructures...|$|E
30|$|The {{petrographic}} {{data of the}} HST samples revealed {{evidence of}} tight packing and <b>point</b> <b>grain</b> contacts, consequently reduced primary depositional porosity before cementation began (Fig.  7 a). As reported by Morad et al. (2000), eodiagenesis takes place at a depth less than 2  km and temperature less than 70  °C. Samples from well K_A 2 support this postulation (Fig.  7 a). There {{was an increase in}} the rate of sedimentation near the mouth of the Orange River during the late cretaceous (Rust and Summerfield 1990), which led to breaching at this time in the south western Africa margin (Gilchrist et al. 1994). This could have imposed severe pressure on the sediments and hence enhancing the constituent particles to be tightly packed. Other evidence of compaction is the flattening of mica and rock fragment in K_B 1 sample in the LST even distal to the mouth of Orange River (Figs.  4, 5 a, b) and HST samples (Fig.  7 d).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Silicon nitride {{ceramics}} {{with and}} without β-Si 3 N 4 seed addition were prepared via tape casting nonaqueous ceramic slurries, laminating the green ceramic tapes, and gas pressure sintering the green bodies in nitrogen atmosphere. Lu 2 O 3 and SiO 2 were used as sintering additives. The {{results showed that the}} rod-like β-Si 3 N 4 seed was helpful to enhance β-Si 3 N 4 grain growth unidirectionally. The elongated grains grown from seeds were preferentially oriented parallel to the casting direction, resulting in anisotropic microstructure. When a stress was applied with along the grain alignment, the bending strength of the tape-cast Si 3 N 4 with 3 wt % β-Si 3 N 4 seed addition measured at 1500 oC was 738 MPa, which was almost the same as the room temperature bending strength 739 MPa, and the fracture energy can be improved from 301 J/m 2 at room temperature to 781 J/m 2 at 1500 oC. The large fracture energy and bending strength at 1500 oC were attributable primarily to the unidirectional alignment fibrous grains and a high melting <b>point</b> <b>grain</b> boundary phase...|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to monitor the {{prevalence}} of different fungi associated with floret lemma and developing grains of wheat and to assess the subsequent incidence of black point disease under different exposure periods of the spikes to airborne inocula of the causal fungi. Altogether 16 fungi representing 11 genera were detected from lemma and developing grains. The predominant fungi, in order of prevalence, were A. alternata, B. sorokiniana, C. cladosporioides, C. lunata, Fusarium spp. and E. purpurascens. Other fungi occurring less commonly were A. triticina, C. pallescens, Nigrospora sp., Phoma sp., Chaetomium sp., B. tetramera, B. oryzae, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger and Doratomyces sp. The incidence of all the fungi except Fusarium spp. was higher in lemma than in grains. In lemma, A. alternata occurred with the highest frequency, while the incidence of B. sorokiniana was found highest in grains. The population of A. alternata, B. sorokiniana, C. lunata, E. purpurascens and Fusarium spp. increased with the age of lemma and developing grains whereas the incidence of C. cladosporioides increased at early stages but declined at later stages of grain development. Other fungi did not follow any definite pattern in their incidence during grain development. The occurrence of black <b>pointed</b> <b>grains</b> per spike, percent black <b>pointed</b> <b>grains</b> and black <b>point</b> index were found increasing with the increase in exposure period of the spikes to airborne inocula of the causal fungi...|$|R
40|$|We {{have made}} a {{petrographic}} study of 12 samples along the 62 cm profile of Apollo 16 core 60013 / 14 taken at Station 10 near the lunar module. The basic core description and maturity variations have been discussed earlier. This core {{is important because it}} enables a stratigraphic comparison with nearby cores 60001 - 7 and 60009 / 10. These cores form a triangle with sides 35 - 40 m. FMR data show a maturity-match between 60009 / 10 and 60013 / 14. Unfortunately, segments of the core 60001 - 7 are too disturbed for any cm scale comparison. We present new data on the grain size distribution and the modal petrography for six samples from six levels of 60013 using the same approach and rationale used for 60014. We have combined the new data with our previous data on 60014 to plot the variations of grain size distributions and grain type abundances, in the 500 - 1000 m and 90 - 150 micrometers size fractions, with depth. Agglutinate abundances match the I sub s/FeO profile and both show a significant break at a depth of about 45 cm, with lower maturity material below that <b>point.</b> <b>Grain</b> size distributions show that for all analyzed samples, the mean grain size is below 90 micrometers. The two lowest samples are somewhat more coarse-grained {{than the rest of the}} core. The break at about 45 cm is the most prominent feature of the core and was described during the initial dissection as a pronounced change in color from dark to light. It now seems clear that this break is primarily one of maturity rather than of bulk chemical composition...|$|E

40|$|The major end use of {{malting barley}} {{is for the}} {{production}} of beer. The malt can have a significant influence on brewing efficiency and final beer quality. Black <b>pointed</b> barley <b>grain</b> is considered unacceptable by maltsters because of the assumption it may affect the malting process and hence beer quality, by producing off-flavours, darker colour formation and beer staling. However, no evidence has been provided to categorically show that black pointed barley does alter the quality of grain, malt or beer produced. Black <b>pointed</b> and clean <b>grains</b> were malted and quality measurements performed on the wort produced. We investigated a number of malting quality parameters including hot water extract, diastatic power, and viscosity. The association with black point and variation in the colour of wort, total polyphenols in wort and wort pH, was also investigated to establish whether black <b>point</b> discoloured <b>grain</b> is suitable for use in the malting and brewing industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of an enzymatic browning reaction {{as the cause of}} black point in barley was investigated. Black point discolouration appears to be similar to the enzymatic browning characteristic of plant tissues subjected to physical damage, which involves the oxidation of phenolic compounds present in plant tissues by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) or peroxidase (POX) and the transformation of the oxidation products to black or brown pigments. Particularly high levels of oxidative enzymes such as POX and PPO are of particular importance in barley grain, as they are implicated to promote haze, off-flavour and staling of the finished beer. Lipoxygenase (LOX) is widely known to impart cardboard flavour to beer. Activity of the oxidative enzymes PPO, POX and LOX was measured during development of barley varieties differing in susceptibility to black point. The key enzyme for the production of phenolics in plant tissues, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), was also measured. In order to determine differences in enzymatic activity of clean and black <b>pointed</b> <b>grains,</b> and hence the suitability of black <b>pointed</b> barley <b>grain</b> for use in malting and brewing, POX, PPO, LOX and PAL was measured during grain development using enzymatic activity assays, isoelectric focusing and Northern blotting for mRNA expression.
