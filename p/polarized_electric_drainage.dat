Here, we report {{a way of}} harvesting visible light efficiently to boost zeolite catalysis by means of plasmonic gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) supported on zeolites. Zeolites possess strong Brønsted acids and <b>polarized</b> <b>electric</b> fields created by extra-framework cations. The <b>polarized</b> <b>electric</b> fields can be further intensified by the electric near-field enhancement of Au-NPs, which results from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) upon visible light irradiation. The acetalization reaction was selected as a showcase performed on MZSM- 5 and Au/MZSM- 5 (M = H+, Na+, Ca 2 +, or La 3 +). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the intensified <b>polarized</b> <b>electric</b> fields {{played a critical role}} in stretching the C = O bond of the reactants of benzaldehyde to enlarge their molecular polarities, thus allowing reactants to be activated more efficiently by catalytic centers so as to boost the reaction rates.

30|$|For the two inland earthquakes, {{the closure}} {{depicted}} in Fig. 11 (b) {{may be the}} case, because they occurred on the dayside where the Hall conductivity {{is larger than the}} Pedersen conductivity. On the dayside, the ionospheric Hall current which circulates in the ionosphere mainly contributes to the magnetic variation on the ground (e.g., Tamao, 1986; Fujita and Tamao, 1988). For the current closure of the Fig. 11 (b) type, the primary Hall current in the north-south direction closes the current circuit through the field-aligned current. On the other hand, the Hall current which closes in the ionosphere flows mainly in the east-west direction by the <b>polarized</b> <b>electric</b> field in the north-south direction. This <b>polarized</b> <b>electric</b> field is caused by the primary Hall current in the north-south direction driven by the dynamo electric field in the east-west direction, because the dynamo region is limited both in latitude and longitude and the magnetically-conjugate ionosphere in another hemisphere has a finite resistivity. This <b>polarized</b> <b>electric</b> field drives the secondary Hall current in the east-west direction (not shown in Fig. 11 (b)). The resultant magnetic disturbance is in the north-south direction on the ground, i.e., in the H component, because the magnetic field caused by the ionospheric current in the north-south direction is mostly cancelled by the field-aligned currents (Fukushima, 1976). On the other hand, the magnetic field caused by the secondary Hall current is not cancelled and observed on the ground. As seen in Figs. 4, 5, and 8, the tendency that the resonance peaks appear mainly in the H component rather than in the D component is consistent with this expectation.|$|R

The <b>polarized</b> <b>electric</b> field originates from the charge mismatch at the BN-graphene interfaces.

These different regimes provide complementary spectroscopic information at electronic and vibrational levels.

Using canonical transformations, it is shown that the equations of motion {{can be derived from}} a one degree of freedom time-dependent Hamiltonian which has a first integral. As a consequence the system can be shown to be integrable. An equation governing the energy of the particle is obtained. A simple approximate expression for its maximum value is derived for the case when the particle is initially resonant and at rest. This gives the upper limit in frequency of the X-rays emitted when, for instance, an electron hits a high-Z material. The relativistic motion of an electron in a constant homogeneous magnetic field and a transverse electric field is studied. This problem has already been explored by other authors[1, 2]. One of the aims {{of this paper is to}} bring some enlightenment to their discussion by using the Hamiltonian formalism. Another aim is to derive a simple approximate expression for the maximum energy the particle can reach in the interesting physical situation, when the electron is initially resonant and at rest. This gives the upper limit in frequency of the X-rays emitted when the particle hits a high-Z material.
