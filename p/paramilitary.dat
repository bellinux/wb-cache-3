5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a <b>paramilitary</b> unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or bojówki) aiming to create an armed {{resistance}} movement against the Russian authorities. The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in Warsaw; on 28 October 1904, Russian Cossack cavalry attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's <b>paramilitary</b> opened fire on Russian police and military. Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the <b>paramilitary</b> began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.|$|E
5|$|After the 1999 {{vote for}} independence, <b>para{{military}}</b> groups {{working with the}} Indonesian military undertook a final wave of violence during {{which most of the}} country's infrastructure was destroyed.|$|E
5|$|As groups {{supporting}} {{autonomy and}} independence began campaigning, {{a series of}} pro-integration <b>paramilitary</b> groups of East Timorese began threatening violence—and indeed committing violence—around the country. Alleging pro-independence bias {{on the part of}} UNAMET, the groups were seen working with and receiving training from Indonesian soldiers. Before the May agreement was announced, an April <b>paramilitary</b> attack in Liquiça left dozens of East Timorese dead. On 16 May 1999, a gang accompanied by Indonesian troops attacked suspected independence activists in the village of Atara; in June another group attacked a UNAMET office in Maliana.|$|E
50|$|Money {{from drug}} {{trafficking}} allowed <b>paramilitaries</b> to develop extensive military capabilities. In the late 1990s, <b>paramilitaries</b> consolidated {{into a single}} coordinating body called the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia that had national spokesmen who claimed to share political ideas. The <b>paramilitaries</b> became a valid and recognized part of government that stood against liberal ideology. Soon the <b>paramilitaries</b> began to increase troops and enforce combat squads that often resulted in massacres targeting civilian populations. This violence was once again a terror-filled way to control resources such as land, drug production, and trafficking routes.|$|R
50|$|Thus while republican <b>paramilitaries</b> {{caused the}} {{greatest}} number of deaths overall, they caused fewer civilian deaths than loyalist <b>paramilitaries,</b> and had a lower civilian-to-combatant casualty ratio than either of the other two belligerents.|$|R
5|$|In addition, White Eagles <b>paramilitaries</b> {{arrived in}} Borovo Selo in mid-April {{at the request}} of Borovo Selo militia {{commander}} Vukašin Šoškoćanin. The <b>paramilitaries</b> were armed by the Serbian police directly, or the SAO Krajina-aligned local militia under the approval of Serbian officials. By the end of April 1991, the White Eagles in Borovo Selo were joined by Dušan Silni <b>paramilitaries,</b> who were linked to the Serbian National Renewal party.|$|R
5|$|Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville {{were given}} UVF <b>paramilitary</b> {{funerals}} conducted by Free Presbyterian minister William McCrea, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician.|$|E
5|$|The Bijeljina {{massacre}} {{involved the}} killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by Serb <b>paramilitary</b> groups in Bijeljina on 1–2 April 1992 during the Bosnian War. The majority of those killed were Bosniaks (or Bosnian Muslims). Members of other ethnicities were also killed, such as Serbs deemed disloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local <b>paramilitary</b> group known as Mirko's Chetniks and by the Serb Volunteer Guard (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a Serbia-based <b>paramilitary</b> group led by Željko Ražnatović (aka Arkan). The SDG were {{under the command of}} the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), which was controlled by Serbian President Slobodan Milošević.|$|E
5|$|The state government, {{in support}} of miner {{activities}} funded and supported death squads, appropriating over 1 million dollars towards the funding and operation of the <b>paramilitary</b> organizations.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2006, Amnesty International said: Media reports {{suggest that}} over 30,000 <b>paramilitaries</b> have demobilized. However, <b>paramilitaries</b> in {{supposedly}} demobilized areas continue to operate, often under new names, and to commit violations. There is also strong evidence of continued links between <b>paramilitaries</b> {{and the security}} forces. There were also fears that government policies designed to reintegrate members of illegal armed groups into civilian life risked [...] "recycling" [...] them into the conflict.|$|R
5000|$|On July 12, 1997, two planeloads of <b>paramilitaries</b> {{arrived at}} the airport of San José del Guaviare, which {{also served as a}} base for anti-narcotics police. The <b>paramilitaries</b> then {{traveled}} through territories where the Colombian National Army manned checkpoints.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, Belgian {{civilians were}} often subject to {{retaliation}} by <b>paramilitaries</b> and German forces for resistance activity. In August 1944, 20 {{civilians were killed}} by Rexist <b>paramilitaries</b> in a reprisal for a single attack on a Rexist politician in the Courcelles Massacre.|$|R
5|$|A 2010 wiretap {{of another}} suspect {{picked up a}} {{conversation}} with al-Kuwaiti. CIA <b>paramilitary</b> operatives located al-Kuwaiti in August 2010 and followed him back to the Abbottabad compound, which led them to speculate it was bin Laden's location.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991; {{however, the}} full implementation of declaration only came into effect on 8 October 1991. In the meantime, tensions escalated into overt war when the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and various Serb <b>paramilitary</b> groups attacked Croatia. By {{the end of}} 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to control of only about two-thirds of its territory. The various Serb <b>paramilitary</b> groups then began pursuing a campaign of killing, terror and expulsion against the non-Serb population in the rebel territories, killing thousands of Croat civilians and forcing at least 170,000 from their homes.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the end of World War II, many MP 40s were {{captured}} or surrendered (upwards of 200,000) to the Allies and were then redistributed to the <b>paramilitary</b> and irregular forces of some developing countries.|$|E
50|$|JMO {{entered into}} a {{short-lived}} alliance with the Slovenian People's Party and the Croatian Republican Peasant Party. After the alliance broke down in 1925, JMO found itself politically isolated and came under attack from Serbian <b>paramilitaries.</b> At one time the <b>paramilitaries</b> attempted to kill Spaho.|$|R

5|$|In {{the initial}} stages of the War in Afghanistan, USSOCOM forces linked up with CIA <b>Paramilitary</b> Officers from Special Activities Division to defeat the Taliban without the need for {{large-scale}} conventional forces. This {{was one of the biggest}} successes of the global War on Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Civil War (27 January – 15 May 1918) {{concerned}} {{leadership and}} control of Finland during {{the transition from a}} Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I (Eastern Front) in Europe. The war was fought between the Reds, led by the Social Democratic Party and the Whites, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-led senate. The <b>paramilitary</b> Red Guards, composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. The <b>paramilitary</b> White Guards, composed of peasants and middle-class and upper-class factions, controlled rural central and northern Finland.|$|E

5|$|The attack {{took place}} as the CIA {{expanded}} {{its role in the}} Afghanistan War, increasing <b>paramilitary</b> operations, including drone attacks in Pakistan. To accomplish this, the CIA had built a number of bases in the southern and eastern provinces of Afghanistan.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Diệm and the {{execution}} of Cẩn in May 1964, the VNQDD became more active in their strongholds in central Vietnam. Nevertheless, there was no coherent national leadership and groups at district and provincial level tended to operate autonomously. By 1965, their members had managed to infiltrate and take over the Peoples Action Teams (PATs), irregular <b>paramilitary</b> counter-insurgency forces organised by Australian Army advisers to fight the communists, and used them for their own purposes. In December, one VNQDD member had managed to turn his PAT colleagues towards the nationalist agenda, and the local party leadership in Quảng Nam approached the Australians {{in an attempt to}} have the 1000-man PAT outfit formally allied to the VNQDD. The overture was rejected. The politicisation of <b>paramilitary</b> units worked both ways; some province chiefs used the anti-communist forces to assassinate political opponents, including VNQDD members.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 52% of {{the dead}} were civilians, 32% were members/former members of the British {{security}} forces, 11% were members of republican <b>paramilitaries,</b> and 5% were members of loyalist <b>paramilitaries.</b> About 60% of the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% were Protestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Neo-Nazis {{have used}} the white power skinhead scene as a {{recruitment}} base for neofascist <b>paramilitaries</b> like Combat 18. Soccer hooliganism throughout Europe is another source of recruits. Some groups in the white supremacist wing of the militia movement in the United States {{can be seen as}} neofascist <b>paramilitaries.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A 2010 United Nations report stated that: The vast {{majority}} of <b>paramilitaries</b> responsible for human rights violations were demobilized without investigation, and many were effectively granted amnesties. Today, the failure in accountability {{is clear from the}} dramatic rise in killings by illegal armed groups composed largely of former <b>paramilitaries.</b>|$|R
5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing <b>paramilitary</b> group active since 1975.|$|E
5|$|As with {{internment}} in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972, IRA recruitment was boosted, {{resulting in}} a new surge of <b>paramilitary</b> activity. There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin. Security forces fired 29,695 plastic bullets in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared {{to a total of}} around 16,000 bullets and four deaths in the eight years following the hunger strikes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1987, {{the militant}} youth groups had fought not only the Sri Lankan {{security}} forces and the Indian Peace Keeping Force also among each other, with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) eventually eliminating most of the others. Except for the LTTE, many of the remaining organisations transformed into either minor political parties within the Tamil National Alliance or standalone political parties. Some also function as <b>paramilitary</b> groups within the Sri Lankan military.|$|E
40|$|A {{domestic}} power {{faces an}} enemy and commits terrorist atrocities {{to increase the}} likelihood of victory. A foreign patron can grant aid to the power but prefers fewer or no atrocities. The domestic power responds by acquiescing in the creation of uncontrollable <b>paramilitaries</b> that commit even more atrocities. Once the <b>paramilitaries</b> are set up, aid flows and the atrocity level is high. Now suppose the foreign patron is uncertain whether the domestic power can control the <b>paramilitaries.</b> At a pooling equilibrium the domestic power will commit more atrocities than it would commit in isolation to demonstrate to the foreign patron that the <b>paramilitaries</b> are beyond the domestic power’s control. Case studies of Colombia, Northern Ireland, and Middle East illustrate the models. JEL Numbers: D 74, D 82, N...|$|R
