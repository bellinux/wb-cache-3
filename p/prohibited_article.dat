6000|$|We {{not only}} smuggled cargo out, but we smuggled cargo in. The {{favourite}} <b>prohibited</b> <b>article</b> was {{a species of}} metal, that came in plates, like tin, or copper, of which we took in large quantities. It was brought {{to us by the}} smuggling-boats, and thrown on board, very much as the opium was taken out, and we stowed it away in the hold. All this was done in the day-time, but I never heard of any one's following the article into the ship. Once there, it appeared to be considered safe. Then we got sycee silver, which was prohibited for exportation. All came on board in the same manner. For every box of opium sold, the mate got a china dollar as a perquisite. Of course my share on four hundred boxes came to one hundred and thirty-three of these dollars, or about one hundred and sixteen of our own. I am ashamed to say {{there was a great deal}} of cheating all round, each party evidently regarding the other as rogues, and, instead of [...] "doing as they would be done by," [...] doing as they thought they were done by.|$|E
60|$|A {{proposal}} by another person was made the July following {{the date of}} this project: {{it appears to have}} been early in the formal delivery at the board: this was for the export of one thousand four hundred and eighty chests. This, too, was accepted, but with new conditions and restrictions: for in so vast and so new an undertaking great difficulties occurred. In the first place, all importation of that commodity is rigorously forbidden by the laws of China. The impropriety of a political trader, who is lord over a great empire, being concerned in a contraband trade upon his own account, did not seem in the least to affect them; but they were struck with the obvious danger of subjecting their goods to seizure by the vastness of the prohibited import. To secure the larger adventure, they require of the China factory that Colonel Watson's ship should enter the port of Canton as an armed ship, (they would not say a ship of war, though that must be meant,) that her cargo should not be reported; they also ordered that other measures should be adopted to secure this <b>prohibited</b> <b>article</b> from seizure. If the cargo should get in safe, another danger was in view,--the overloading the Chinese market by a supply beyond the demand; for it is obvious that contraband trade must exist by small quantities of goods poured in by intervals, and not by great importations at one time. To guard against this inconvenience, they divide their second, though the smaller adventure, into two parts; one of which was to go to the markets of the barbarous natives which inhabit the coast of Malacca, where the chances of its being disposed of by robbery or sale were at least equal. If the opium should be disposed of there, the produce was to be invested in merchandise salable in China, or in dollars, if to be had. The other part (about one half) was to go in kind directly to the port of Canton.|$|E
50|$|Prohibit the re-introduction of {{the death}} penalty. If this is not deemed desirable, Article 40.4.5° should be retained. If it is <b>prohibited,</b> <b>Article</b> 28.3.3° will require {{amendment}} so {{that the death penalty}} cannot be imposed in any circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|The {{freedom of}} {{scientific}} research is embodied in Chapter V. However, precedence is afforded {{to the protection of}} human dignity and other fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the freedom of research is qualified (Article 15). Research carried out on human beings is under strict controls set forth by the convention (Article 16). The general rules on consent stipulated in Chapter II must be observed in the context of research. In addition, the creation of embryos in vitro for the purposes {{of scientific research}} is expressly <b>prohibited</b> (<b>Article</b> 18).|$|E
5000|$|Right to life, {{with capital}} {{punishment}} expressly <b>prohibited</b> (<b>Article</b> 11). Capital punishment had been abolished in Colombia in 1910 through a constitutional amendment. The Constitutional Court {{has ruled that}} the right to life is not absolute. In sentence C-355/06, the Court's opinion said that [...] "despite its constitutional relevance, life does not have the character of a value or an absolute right and must be weighed with the other values, principles and constitutional rights." [...] Two of the notable exceptions to the right to life ruled constitutional by the Constitutional Court are assisted suicide (decriminalized by sentence C-239/97) and abortion in case of danger to the mother's life, life-threatening fetal defects, rape, incest or non-consensual fertilization (sentence C-355/06).|$|E

50|$|After 16 {{years of}} non-constitutional {{government}} from 1959 to 1975, the revolutionary government of Cuba sought to institutionalize the revolution {{by putting a}} new constitution to a popular vote. The Constitution of 1976 was adopted by referendum on 15 February 1976, {{in which it was}} approved by 99.02% of voters, in a 98 % turnout. It took effect on 24 February 1976. This constitution called for a centralized control of the market and re-committed the state to providing its citizens with access to free education and health care, as in the 1940 constitution. The state was further granted the power to regulate the activities of religious institutions and the private ownership of media was <b>prohibited.</b> <b>Article</b> 53 gave citizens freedom of speech, and Article 54 gave citizens the right to assemble.|$|E
5000|$|The Agreement {{stated that}} the {{signatory}} nations were [...] "fully determined {{to bring about the}} gradual and effective suppression of the manufacture of, internal trade in and use of prepared opium". Article I required that, with the exception of retail sale, the importation, sale and distribution of opium be a monopoly of government, which would have the exclusive right to import, sell, or distribute opium. Leasing, according, or delegating this right was specifically <b>prohibited.</b> <b>Article</b> II prohibited sale of opium to minors, and Article III prohibited minors from entering smoking divans. Article IV required governments {{to limit the number of}} opium retail shops and smoking divans as much as possible. Articles V and VI regulated the export and transport of opium and dross. Article VII required governments to discourage the use of opium through instruction in schools, literature, and other methods.|$|E

5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles.</b> Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|R
50|$|The C&ED {{prevents}} and detects smuggling activities {{under the}} Import and Export Ordinance and enforces the licensing controls on <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles</b> by inspecting cargoes imported and exported by air, sea and land; processing passengers and their baggage at entry /exit points; and searching aircraft, vessels and vehicles entering and leaving Hong Kong. The Joint Police/Customs Anti-Smuggling Task Force {{is dedicated to}} combating smuggling activities by sea. The Control Points Investigation Division is tasked to strengthen the intelligence collection capability at the land boundary and suppress the cross-boundary smuggling activities.|$|R
50|$|The Oviedo Convention {{incorporates}} {{provisions to}} address concerns relating to {{research into the}} human genome.

Genetic testing {{as a tool for}} discrimination is <b>prohibited</b> under <b>Article</b> 11, while Article 12 allows genetic testing only for health or for scientific research linked to health purposes. The overarching theme is that genetic testing is reserved for health-related purposes only. Similarly, modification of the human genome, for reasons other than health-related is generally <b>prohibited</b> under <b>Article</b> 13 of the Convention.|$|R

60|$|She {{took off}} her kerchief and her gown and calmly {{submitted}} to the woman's rough hands as they wandered with sureness and accuracy to the various pockets and folds that might conceal <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles.</b> The woman did her work with peculiar stolidity; she did not utter a word when she found the tiny steel files and placed them on a table beside her. In equal silence she laid the little dagger beside them, and the purse which contained twenty gold pieces. These she counted in front of Marguerite and then replaced them in the purse. Her face expressed neither surprise, nor greed nor pity. She was obviously {{beyond the reach of}} bribery--just a machine paid by the prison authorities to do this unpleasant work, and no doubt terrorised into doing it conscientiously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, many sorts. Anything may {{break loose}} if it's ill packed, and, as almost every {{sort of thing}} passes through the post, it would be {{difficult}} to describe 'em all. Here is a list, however, that may give you an idea of what kind of things the public sent through our mail-bags last year. A packet of pudding, a steam-gauge, a tin of cream, a bird's wing, a musical box, packet of snowdrops, fruit sweets, shrimps, and sample potatoes; a dormouse, four white mice, two goldfinches, a lizard and a blind-worm, all alive; besides cutlery, medicines, varnish, ointments, perfumery, articles of dress; a stoat, a squirrel, fish, leeches, frogs, beetles, caterpillars, and vegetables. Of course, many of these, such as live animals, being <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles,</b> were stopped and sent to the Returned Letter Office, but were restored, on application, to the senders." ...|$|R
50|$|Polygamy {{was officially}} criminalized in Vietnam during the 1950s, with a lengthy prison {{sentence}} as punishment.

Polygamous marriages are <b>prohibited</b> by <b>article</b> 64 of the constitution, which stipulates that a lawful marriage must be monogamous.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of the {{conversation}} that succeeded, the officers explained to me the difficulties they had to contend with, which certainly are not trifling. As to station, they said that made no great difference, your duchess being usually an inveterate smuggler. Travellers are not content to supply their own wants, but they purchase for all their friends. This I knew to be true, though not by experience, you will permit me to say, the ambassador's bags, half the time, containing more <b>prohibited</b> <b>articles</b> than despatches. But, notwithstanding this explanation, I did not deem the case of one who bought only for himself the less hard. It is so easy to conceal light articles, that, except in instances where is reason for distrust, it were better to confide in character. If anything could induce me to enter seriously into the contraband, it would be such treatment.|$|R

(Even this interpretation of the Constitution, however, drew criticism.) Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato reaffirmed the policy in 1962.|$|R
