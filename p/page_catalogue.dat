40|$|I {{was one of}} two British artists {{selected}} to participate in this international exhibition of contemporary printmaking in Cremona, Italy. Artists were selected by the scientific committee of the A. D. A. F. A. Invitation was a consequence of exhibiting at international Print Biennales in: Varna, Bulgaria 2001 (a major Prizewinner); International Biennale of Drawing and Graphic Arts in Gyor, Hungary 2003 (invited artist, only Scot) ISBN 963 212 249 6); International Triennale of Graphic Art in Bitola, Macedonia 2001 (ISBN 9989 - 9896 - 1 - 3). The work explores issues of ‘place’ – my working context being rural and remote from mainstream artistic centres. Delicate Structures and Centre Spot are comments on the changing landscape of the north east of Scotland, from rural to semi industrial and the notion of ‘worth’. The prints (each 230 x 330 mm) were executed using the intaglio process developed by myself and taught at an annual workshop at the Printmaking Centre (also now at the Institute of American Indian Arts) Santa Fe, New Mexico. This specific process, along with examples of from my work and working practices, are described in the new book Collagraphs and mixed media printmaking. Harthill, B. and Clarke, R. (2005) A&C Black, London ISBN: 0 - 7136 - 6396 - 0. One of the works exhibited is now in the international collection of Graphic Art at the Cremona Civic Museum. 170 artists exhibited including Robert Rauschenberg, Jim Dine, Chuck Close, Sandro Chia. Full colour 182 <b>page</b> <b>catalogue</b> and DVD accompanied this exhibition.

The work, consisting of 101 short sections, shot within a single, simple set (which can be read as an office space, laboratory, domestic kitchen etc) seeks to play with the ‘everyday’. Where architectural form often dictates physical activity the action depicted alters the reading of the physical space. Each action takes an everyday object and alters its function, slightly. The tabletop on which the actions occur becomes everything from an office desk to a landscape. It seeks to playfully look at how everyday objects can be re-invented and therefore re-examined. And how within sterile environments (the office, the factory, the gallery) elements of play exist...|$|E

40|$|International Contemporary Drawing Art’ {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{initiatives}} of the International Drawing Research Institute, reported to be the largest contemporary drawing exhibition ever in mainland China. The exhibition brought together artists from Australia, UK and China. The 152 <b>page</b> <b>catalogue</b> International Contemporary Drawing Art, ISBN 7 - 80690 - 133 - 7 /J 10311 illustrates the works from each artist, with an introduction by Fan Di An, the most respected art theorist and curator in China. The exhibition includes drawings from the most significant contemporary artists in China. To be part of the organizational structure behind the exhibition, together with being included in this exhibition offered a unique opportunity to participate in an exhibition, viewed by thousands of visitors. Esson’s work was subsequently was used in a Chinese drawing reference book ‘Configuration and Intention’ by A. Yu, published by Liaoning Art Publishing, Shenyang 2005. The Australian contributors were selected by Dr Peter Hill, artist and former editor of Alba magazine. The exhibition was the inaugural exhibition at the new Xian Academy of Fine Art Gallery, and was organized in relation to the International Drawing Art Conference at which I presented a paper - ‘The Private and Public Face of Drawing’ October 24 / 25. As an extension of this cross-cultural drawing event, Esson I worked with Ian Howard, (Australian artist), Wang Xu, (Chinese artist), and Xin Jun Qin (Chinese Peoples Liberation Army Officer and artist) on an artist’s army drawing project over three days, which was included in the International Contemporary Art exhibition as ‘From The Soil They Come’...|$|E
40|$|The Central Academy of Fine Art is {{the most}} {{important}} art institution in China. The exhibition was {{in the form of a}} survey show covering about twenty years of Esson’s drawing practice and the evolution of visual narratives during this time. The Australian Cultural Attaché in Beijing, John Kelly, opened the exhibition. Dong Hua University was originally a textile university but has transformed since 1951 into a leading Design and Fashion University in Shanghai. The university campus in central Shanghai houses an important gallery, which exhibits the work of international fine artists and designers. The exhibition was opened by Li Keling the Dean of the Art and Design Fashion Institute. The works in the two exhibitions were fundamentally the same, although there were variations and different emphasis, which corresponded to the two different exhibition titles. This was Esson’s first major solo exhibition in China and although a survey show, it also concentrated on the cultural influences that have informed his work since 2000. Regular visits in China provided a rich vein of philosophical and visual material to be examined and new metaphors invented. Exhibiting the work at the source of the influence created important responses and fostered fresh challenges for future re-investigation. Each exhibition was accompanied by a series of lectures offering keen debate and critical appraisal. A 32 <b>page</b> <b>catalogue</b> was produced for the two exhibitions titled ‘Imagine My Heart Was Yours: Michael Esson Drawing 1996 – 2005 ’, with essay by Alan Krell, and published with assistance from the University of New South Wales, Asia...|$|E
40|$|Clout {{developed}} out {{of sustained}} interest by Bracey into {{the expansion of}} painting into other media and with breaking down and questioning the boundaries of what painting can be, in terms of media and subject. Through further research into {{the power of the}} miniature and media’s use of image, Bracey spent one year producing Clout. The work consists of 7000 individual paintings on the heads of roofing nails, 1000 of which were shown in John Moores exhibition. Each painting portrayed a different image and subject, reflecting the visual saturation of contemporary culture. The miniaturisation process seduces the viewer into closer engagement and micro-curated exhibitions emerge through viewer choices and interests. From the large choice available each viewer will make different selections dependant on variables of each personality such as cultural associations, eye height and attention span, reflecting wider concerns within society. The John Moores competition is widely acknowledged as Britain’s leading painting exhibition and takes place biennially to form a major component of the Liverpool Biennial. Clout was selected by 5 judges (Ann Bukantas, Gavin Turk, Gill Hedley, Callum Innes and Jarvis Cocker) from more than 1900 entries for this prestigious exhibition. Among the 55 other artists were leading artists such as Ian Davenport, Alexis Harding and Lisa Milroy. Clout came third in the visitor’s choice award for the exhibition. The exhibition also featured a 136 <b>page</b> <b>catalogue</b> (ISBN 1 - 902700 - 28 - 7) and was widely reviewed in art journal and newspapers.

40|$|The purpose {{behind this}} solo {{exhibition}} {{and its associated}} educational programmes was primarily to explore cross-cultural dialogue and research pedagogical strategies complimentary to changing social conditions and religious ideologies. The exhibition, curated by Abdullah Syed (University of Karachi) and Roohi Ahmed (Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture) was carefully selected to create a visual conversation and examine how drawing can be an immediate and profound method of intellectual connection. The metaphor of {{the title of the}} exhibition refers to the political turbulence in Pakistan, and provided an evocative parallel with personal instability. The images negotiate this territory through political and private narratives. The impact of an exhibition is often difficult to determine, however the response to this exhibition generated not only intelligent and positive reviews in the critical press, but created an awareness of my personal research and how it resonates outside a ‘western’ cultural tradition. The exhibition was covered by Karachi TV, and reviewed in The Dawn, International News Karachi, and The Daily Times, Karachi. A 56 <b>page</b> <b>catalogue</b> ‘Where All The Butterflies Go’ accompanied the exhibition and explored the rationale behind the exhibition through an 8 page interview and an illuminating essay by Abdullah Syed. The exhibition and catalogue sponsored by the ZVMG Rangoonwala Trust. The project also included a series of lectures and workshops intended to enhance the educational exchange aspects of the exhibition. The 3 day drawing workshops at both Karachi University and Indus Valley School of Art, demanded a flexible and innovative approach to this subject given the cultural sensitivities and restrictive conditions. Apart from formal lectures at these two venues I also presented papers at the Textile Institute of Pakistan and at Agha Khan University...|$|E
40|$|Ai Wu Ji Wu, {{which was}} also titled The Power of Drawing in Beijing, was a solo {{travelling}} exhibition that was exhibited in three venues in Northern China – Beijing, Shenyang and Shi Jia Zhong. The exhibition was comprised of 46 works mostly large scale drawings produced over 20 years, and was selected to demonstrate the development of visual language through the drawing process. The most recent and substantial component of the exhibition being based on work since 2000 {{and the influence of}} China upon my work. This exhibition contained 18 new or previously unseen works which were added to a larger body of the survey exhibition. Today Museum and Art Gallery is the first non- governmental not for profit art museums in China which is linked to the Today Art Publishing House. It promotes major Chinese and International artists. The gallery boasts two significant venues in Beijing. The exhibition was reviewed by J. Wang “The Power of Drawing” in Oriental Art No. 6, 2006. A major work ‘Jiang Xin Bi Xin I’ was purchased by Today Museum for its permanent collection. Lu Xun Academy of Fine Art {{is one of the top}} three art institutions in China. The gallery provided three large spaces for the exhibition and the show was reviewed in the Journal of Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts as ‘See What I think and How I Think. ’ The Academy purchased five of the works for their collection and the exhibition was covered by television by two different TV companies - Lioning TV Channel on 'Talk Show' televised on the 25 th November 2006, and Liao Ning Satellite TV Channel on 'Every Morning' on the 27 th November 2006.

40|$|For this {{exhibition}} Bracey {{was commissioned by}} curator Annabel Lucas and firstsite gallery {{to develop a new}} body of work inspired by research into zoo design and parallels between issues of display common to galleries and zoos. The resulting artwork culled from experiences of both, to produce a hybrid system of the two, a major concern being that the visitor to the gallery constructs their own route of experience, rather than following a prescribed formula. 26 individual pieces were made from a host of media. Although there was only one traditional oil painting on canvas, all of the work was a questioning of painting in the expanded field. Examples of other outcomes are photography, origami, laser cut acrylic plastic and my first foray into video. The work continued issues related to the miniature, and of several units combining to make a whole, both in individual pieces and the exhibition as a whole. The series was commissioned by Firstsite through a research and development stipend of £ 4, 155. New work was shown alongside earlier work at Colchester: Palette (1997 -present); an ongoing oil painting, Healthy Snacks (2002 / 3); a mountain of colour, created with pistachio shells, Clout (2003 - 6), thousands of painted roofing nails and Various Titles (2004 / 5); hundreds of small canvases. To accompany the Colchester exhibition, Bracey I wrote and designed a guide pamphlet, delivered 2 public talks and a Firstsite paper was produced with a commissioned essay by Judith Palmer.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a system and {{procedure}} for classifying and cataloguing the textile, costume, and slide collections of the Clothing, Textile, and Related Arts (CTRA) Department at Oregon State University. Investigation was made by letter, personal visit, interview with faculty and curators, and literature research to identify different purpose and use statements classifying and cataloguing systems, catalogue files, and criteria for evaluating the system and procedure. The investigation resulted in the development of a purpose and use statement based on the collection characteristics and user needs; identification of user needs; criteria for evaluating the proposed system and procedure; and the recommended system and procedure. Robert Chenhall developed a system for cataloguing in the computer age. The system contains 91 data fields and can be established as a manual or computerized file. The Chenhall system was adapted for CTRA using 39 of the 91 data fields. Eleven of the data fields were subdivided to meet the expressed needs of the users. Data field definitions and instructions were developed and arranged into a Classifying and Cataloguing Manual. The Manual procedure was tested and revised to meet the established criteria. Sample word lists were developed and reference resources were recommended to maintain vocabulary control. Basic rules were established to provide the cataloguer with a basis for consistency in recording information and use of the system. Procedures were developed and included in the Manual for completing the cataloguing process including instructions for the ledger <b>page,</b> <b>catalogue</b> worksheet, donated objects, label preparation, establishing data files such as Documentation File and History of Ownership, and establishing catalogue card files such as Subject-Index File, Registration-Accession File, and Appraisal File. A recommended test and evaluation of the proposed Subject- Index File was established to determine ease of use after the file is implemented. The CTRA department head will review the test and evaluation results to determine if any further changes are needed to improve ease of use of the Subject-Index File for information retrieval...|$|E
