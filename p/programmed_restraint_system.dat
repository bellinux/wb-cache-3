40|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} plan {{to reduce the risk of}} death and serious injury in rollover crashes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has reinitiated a <b>program</b> to characterize <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> response in rollovers. A rollover restraint tester (RRT) is utilized to produce a 180 degree roll followed by a simulated roof-to-ground impact. Recognizing the unpredictability of the real world rollover phenomenon, this test provides a repeatable and consistent dynamic environment for suitable lab evaluation. Similar NHTSA research during the mid- 1990 s demonstrated an excursion reduction of up to 75 % when an inflatable belt was compared to the standard three-point belt with a 50 th percentile male [Rains, 1998]. Technologies being considered include integrated seat systems, pyrotechnic and electric resetable pretensioners, four-point belt systems, and inflatable belts. High speed video data are collected and analyzed to examine occupant head excursion throughout the tests and are presented for discussion. Though repeatable, concern about the real world relevancy of the RRT dynamics have been focused toward the absence of a mechanical component for lateral motion. This component is not inbuilt to the test fixture. This research attempts to determine if reasonably reduced excursion is possible in the simulated rollover. This research has been constrained to examining <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> focused to the seat. Future research to include a partial vehicle cab structure is planned to allow evaluation of devices that utilize it for a reaction surface; such as rollover air bags. Restraint advancements have primarily been focused on frontal and side crash performance. It is believed that many of these advancements can also aid in reducing occupant excursion during a rollover crash. Improving restraint effectiveness in rollovers may further enhance protection for belted, non-ejected occupants in rollovers...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} steel road <b>restraint</b> <b>system,</b> which is currently in use on European public roads. Observations of installed systems indicate that the current road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> design is far too stiff, which results in unacceptable decelerations during the vehicle impact. The global stiffness of the <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> in the initial phase of an impact is largely attributed to the distance spacer design. The purpose {{of this research is}} to improve the currently road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> design by means of computational simulations. The impact severity and stiffness of current and new design have been evaluated with dynamic nonlinear elasto-plastic analysis of a three-dimensional road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> {{within the framework of the}} finite element method with LS-DYNA code. Computational simulations were verified with full scale crash tests. Computational analyses prove that the currently used road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> is impropriate and that the new road <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> design assures controllable elasto-plastic deformation and crash energy absorption which in turn decreases the decelerations of an impact vehicle and consequently increases the safety of vehicle passengers...|$|R

40|$|A <b>restraint</b> <b>system's</b> main {{function}} is to restrain its occupant when his vehicle is subjected to acceleration. If the <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> is rigid and well-fitting (to eliminate slack) then it will transmit the vehicle acceleration to its occupant without modifying it in any way. Few present-day <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> are stiff enough to give this one-to-one transmission characteristic, and depending upon their dynamic characteristics {{and the nature of}} the vehicle's acceleration-time history, they will either magnify or attenuate the acceleration.

In the general case of an arbitrary acceleration input, a computer must be used to determine the optimum dynamic characteristics for the <b>restraint</b> <b>system.</b> Analytical solutions can be obtained for certain simple cases, however, and these cases are considered in this paper, after the concept of dynamic models of the human body is introduced.

40|$|When small {{children}} travel in minibuses, during for example daycare transports, they seldom have adequate protection {{in terms of}} crash safety. To be sufficiently protected the child should travel in a rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> (CRS).

The main issues are {{that it can be}} hard and time consuming to secure a conventional child <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> and that the available space in a minibus is limited.

40|$|This {{study was}} made within the Child Safety group at Volvo Car Corporation.   The {{purpose of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to study the different aspects of rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>systems,</b> which is the safest way for small children to travel, in order to suggest improvements {{in the development of}} child <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> The studies included scientific articles regarding child safety and fatally injured children in car accidents, both in Sweden and internationally. The overall aim is to find factors that enables the increase in usage of rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>systems,</b> including the increase of usage time to as long as possible.   Swedish accident data, obtained by the Swedish Traffic Data Acquisation, was studied. It was found that the fatally injured children during car accidents in Sweden between the years 2000 - 2016 commonly were involved in extraordinarily accident scenarios with an outcome independent of how they were restrained. The literature study and the survey that was made were both supporting the statement of inconvenience while using rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> The inconvenience often corresponded to different types of misuse. The main issue with rearward facing according to the responding parents was lack of leg space, both for their child but also for the driver and the front seat passenger. These issues made some parents turning their children forward facing at early age, whereas they could still fit in the rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>system.</b>   One key in order to increase the global use of rearward facing child <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> lies in changes of the materials and design. A more lightweight and compact design is suggested, providing a more spacious travel environment for the children and easier mounting for the parents.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the targets for fatality reduction in car accidents set by Governments in Europe, USA and Japan {{can only be}} met by using advanced technologies that will include {{a broad range of}} sensors to monitor the crash likelihood and severity, vehicle condition, occupant type and posture. Information provided by these sensors can be used to increase the effectiveness of <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> On the basis of information on the vehicle and the occupant status during the crash event, restraint parameters such as belt force and airbag outflow could be controlled real-time {{in such a way that}} injury levels sustained by the occupants are minimized. Real-time control during the crash event enables <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> to adapt to real world conditions and offers improved performance in terms of injury reduction over a much broader range of impact scenarios. This paper introduces the concept of real-time control of <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> and presents the results of a numerical study to assess potential reduction in terms of injury severity and injury-related costs provided by real-time <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> control in real world conditions.
