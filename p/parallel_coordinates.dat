5000|$|Adding more {{dimensions}} in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> (often abbreviated ||-coords or PCs) involves adding more axes. The value of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> is that certain geometrical properties in high dimensions transform into easily seen 2D patterns. For example, {{a set of}} points on a line in n-space transforms {{to a set of}} polylines in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> all intersecting at n &minus; 1 points. For n = 2 this yields a point-line duality pointing out why the mathematical foundations of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> are developed in the Projective rather than Euclidean space. A pair of lines intersects at a UNIQUE point which has TWO coordinates and, therefore, can correspond to a UNIQUE line which is also specified by TWO parameters (or TWO points). By contrast, more than two points are required to specify a curve and also a pair of curves may not have a UNIQUE intersection. Hence by using curves in ||-coords instead of lines the point <--> line duality is lost, together with all the other properties of Projective Geometry, and the known nice higher-dimensional patterns corresponding to (hyper)planes, curves, several smooth (hyper)surfaces, proximities, convexity and recently non-orientability.. The goal is to map n-dimensional RELATIONS into 2D patterns. Hence, <b>Parallel</b> <b>Coordinates</b> is NOT a point-to-point mapping but rather a nD subset to 2D subset mapping, and as explained in the 2009 textbook, there is NO LOSS of information. Note: even a point in nD is NOT mapped into a point in 2D but to a polygonal line -- a subset of 2D.|$|E

50|$|Statistical {{distributions}} reveal trends {{based on}} how numbers are distributed. Common examples include histograms and box-and-whisker plots, which convey statistical features such as mean, median, and outliers. In addition to these common infographics, alternatives include stem-and-leaf plots, Q-Q plots, scatter plot matrices (SPLOM) and <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> For assessing a collection of numbers and focusing on frequency distribution, stem-and-leaf plots can be helpful. The numbers are binned based on the first significant digit, and within each stack binned again based on the second significant digit. On the other hand, Q-Q plots compare two probability distributions by graphing quantiles against each other. This allows the viewer {{to see if the}} plot values are similar and if the two are linearly related. SPLOM is a technique that represents the relationships among multiple variables. It uses multiple scatter plots to represent a pairwise relation among variables. Another statistical distribution approach to visualize multivariate data is <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Rather than graphing every pair of variables in two dimensions, the data is repeatedly plotted on a parallel axis and corresponding points are then connected with a line. The advantage of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinates</b> is that they are relatively compact, allowing many variables to be shown simultaneously.|$|E

In time series visualization, there exists a natural predecessor and successor; therefore in this special case, there exists a preferred arrangement.

40|$|The three {{dimensional}} <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot (3 -D PCP) is a visualization {{method to}} detect hidden information in data by using human spatial perception. The 3 -D PCP proposed in this dissertation can display several characteristics of multiple variables simultaneously. First, it can show {{all the information}} of each observation at a glance. Second, it can make some non-linear structures in data clear. Finally, {{it is useful to}} find piecewise linear relationships of variables and their conditions. 　　The basic idea of the 3 -D PCP has already appeared in the <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot. The <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot can visualize multi dimensional data on a two dimensional plane. Coordinates of all variables are set in parallel. In the standard form of <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot the bottom position of each axis corresponds to the minimum value of each variable, and the top to the maximum value. One observation corresponds to one set of connected lines. <b>Parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot can shows the characteristic between two adjoining axes of variables directly. If two variables have a correlation coefficient of 1, lines expressing observations are located horizontally. If two variables have correlation coefficient -l, lines of them cross in one point in the middle between two axes. 　　However, relations between two variables whose positions are apart more than two axes are not clearly shown immediately. Another serious problem of static <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot {{is that it is not}} easy to distinguish one observation from another when the number of observations is large. To solve these problems, several interactive techniques have been developed including highlighting by brushing operations. The 3 -D PCP can show the same effect as the highlighting by brushing operation in a <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot by extending it into 3 -dimensional space. We choose one variable as a reference variable, usually a response variable. The 3 -D PCP places connected lines expressing observations in 3 -dimensional spaces by sorting them according to the values of the reference variable. This observation-wise 3 -D PCP representation is useful for illustrating the characteristics of observations such as outliers. 　　The 3 -D PCP has another representation in which values of observations on each variable are connected by lines. It is called variable-wise connection representation and is useful to see relations between the reference variable and other variables. For example, the connected lines expressing the variable which has strong linear relationships with the reference variable are located around a straight line expressing the reference variable. It is well known that the scatterplot matrix can show relationships between variables clearly. However, if the number of variables is large, the single scatterplot elements become too small to be seen properly. The 3 -D PCP can show more variables than a scatterplot matrix. It is sometimes more suitable to show characteristics of data simultaneously than using a static representation of scatterplot matrlx. 　　We note that the 3 -D PCP can detect particular non-linear relations, i. e. interaction by two variables, through observation-wise connection representation. This relationship is detected by the special pattern of the angles of connected lines expressing observations. As explained earlier, a correlation coefficient near 1 or - 1 between two variables whose axes are adjacent produces parallel or crossing patterns in <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plots. Similar patterns can be detected in 3 -D PCP. If we find the change of such patterns at specific values of the reference variable, we conclude that the structures of data are different for each region of the reference variables. In such cases, it is natural to divide the data into several groups in which the structures have no more changes. We propose to draw many 3 -D PCPs corresponding to the groups simultaneously and use a lattice layout, which places many graphs on a grid. We show that they are useful to identify the interaction between two variables by analyzing simulation and real data. 　　We realize our 3 -D PCP by using the Java language. Java has several advantages for implementing modern data visualization methods. It is a pure object oriented programming language and has well-designed standard graphics libraries which are useful to realize 2 -D and 3 -D graphics and interactive graphical user interfaces. These libraries can work as useful components of statistical graphics and be in incorporated by using so-called design patterns. Design patterns are suggested solutions to common problems often appearing in object-oriented software development. Our implementation is based on several design patterns for generality and reusability. Our software enables us to analyze data by utilizing advanced interactive operations given by Java. We show that the 3 -D PCP and the software are expected to lead to new achievements in the field of data visualization. 　　This dissertation is set out as following. Chapter 1 surveys issues of information visualization and basic statistical graphics used in multivariate data visualization such as scatterplot, scatterplot matrix, 3 -D scatterplot and <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plot.

Considering the characteristics of speckle noise and the spatial distribution of ship wakes along a line with certain width in SAR images, a new method using a nonparametric Grayscale <b>Parallel</b> <b>Coordinate</b> Transform (GPCT) is proposed. In this method, the original grayscale SAR image will be transformed into a <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> space by a new extended nonparametric GPCT, and the obvious points with high accumulation value will be detected by a modified iterative thresholding method. Then, the detected obvious points will be clustered according to its spatial distribution, and the center of each class will be determined to evaluate the lines of ship wakes.

The results can be used visually (in kinemages) and quantitatively to analyze the detailed interactions between molecular surfaces, most extensively for the purpose of validating and improving the molecular models from experimental x-ray crystallography data.

40|$|Analyzing data to find trends, correlations, {{and stable}} {{patterns}} {{is an important}} task in many industrial applications. This paper proposes a new technique based on <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> visualization. Previous work on <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> methods has shown that they are effective only when variables that are correlated and/or show similar patterns are displayed adjacently. Although current <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> tools allow the user to manually rearrange the order of variables, this process is very time-consuming {{when the number of}} variables is large.

In addition, the system can filter data according to rules sets imported from other data mining tools. This feature was found very helpful in practice, because it enables decision makers to visually identify interesting rules and data segments for further analysis or data mining.

Two important methods for visualizing high-dimensional data involve the <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> system and the grand tour. Another technique which we have dubbed saturation brushing is the third method. The <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> system involves methods in high-dimensional Euclidean geometry, projective geometry, and graph theory while the the grand tour involves high-dimensional space filling curves, differential geometry, and fractal geometry.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} some {{graphical}} techniques for cluster analysis of high-dimensional data. <b>Parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> plots and <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> density plots are graphical techniques which map multivariate data into a two-dimensional display. The method has some elegant duality properties with ordinary Cartesian plots so that higher-dimensional mathematical structures can be analyzed. Our high interaction software allows for rapid editing {{of data to}} remove outliers and isolate clusters by brushing. Our brushing techniques allow not only for hue adjustment, but also for saturation adjustment. Saturation adjustment allows for the handling of comparatively massive data sets by using the #-channel of the Silicon Graphics workstation to compensate for heavy overplotting. The grand tour is a generalized rotation of coordinate axes in a high-dimensional space. Coupled with the full-dimensional plots allowed by the <b>parallel</b> <b>coordinate</b> display, these techniques allow the data analyst to explore data which is both high-dimensional and massive in size. In this paper we give a description of both techniques and illustrate their use to do inverse regression and clustering. We have used these techniques to analyze data {{on the order of}} 250, 000 observations in 8 dimensions. Because the analysis requires the use of color graphics, in the present paper we illustrate the methods with a more modest data set of 3848 observations.
