25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} wet sump system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and <b>pushrods</b> are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray.

25|$|Most radial engines use {{overhead}} poppet valves {{driven by}} <b>pushrods</b> and lifters on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, {{with a few}} smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder. A few engines use sleeve valves such as the 14-cylinder Bristol Hercules and the 18-cylinder Bristol Centaurus, which are quieter and smoother running but require much tighter manufacturing tolerances.|$|E
25|$|The design {{featured}} a horizontally opposed, four-cylinder layout {{with a single}} camshaft operating poppet valves through <b>pushrods</b> that were hollowed to save weight. The crankshaft was supported on ball bearings which allowed a simple 'splash' lubrication system to be used. Cooling was by water with the cylinders being encased in copper jackets. Although the engine ran well, it was not placed into production. The only order was a small contract from the British Government for use in airships.|$|E

Inclusion of unsteady aerodynamics had little effect on the correlation. In the absence of <b>pushrod</b> damping, reduction in <b>pushrod</b> stiffness from the baseline value had an adverse effect on vibratory hub loads in forward flight.

25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the camshaft, the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of <b>pushrods</b> and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders.

25|$|A rudder is {{a primary}} control surface used to steer a ship, boat, submarine, hovercraft, aircraft, or other {{conveyance}} that moves through a fluid medium (generally air or water). On an aircraft the rudder is used primarily to counter adverse yaw and p-factor and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull (watercraft) or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft's stern, tail, or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag. On simple watercraft, a tiller—essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever arm—may {{be attached to the}} top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a helmsman. In larger vessels, cables, <b>pushrods,</b> or hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as <b>pushrods,</b> tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we focus}} on {{development}} of algorithms for estimating the severity of air leakage and for predicting the out-of-adjustment of <b>pushrod</b> in an air brake system of heavy commercial vehicles. The leakage of air from the brake system causes {{a reduction in the}} steady-state pressure in the brake chamber and an increase in the lag of the braking pressure response thereby increasing the stopping distance of the vehicle. Currently a presence of leak in the system is detected for the severities of leak that cause the reservoir pressure to drop below a threshold, such as, the leakage of compressed air due to rupture of the reservoir or of the hoses carrying the compressed air. The leakage of air is also possible due to several other reasons such as, cracks in the hoses, loose couplings between the hoses etc. The severities of leak, corresponding to such situations, do not lead to the reservoir pressure drop below the threshold; therefore, their presence remains undetected. For the detection and estimation of such severities of leak, a diagnostic scheme has been given and is based on a model developed for the mass ow rate of the leakage of air from the air brake system. Out-of-adjustment of the <b>pushrod</b> is the extension of <b>pushrod</b> beyond a prede- ned value and for safety concerns, an extension beyond this value is not desired. Currently no warning system is available for monitoring the out-of-adjustment of <b>pushrod,</b> except, during the safety inspection. Inspection of the <b>pushrod</b> for outof- adjustment is the most labor-intensive and time consuming task during a typical safety inspection procedure. For efficient and continuous monitoring of the <b>pushrod</b> for out-of-adjustment, a diagnostic algorithm for estimating the steady-state <b>pushrod</b> stroke has been developed. The scheme is expected to expedite the inspection process for the out-of-adjustment of <b>pushrod.</b> Experimental data from the air brake test setup at Texas A and M University has been used for corroborating both the models. Also, the problem of parameter estimation of sequential hybrid systems such as the air brake system, has been addressed. The " nature of the air brake system stems from the system being in di erent modes corresponding to di erent values of the displacement of the <b>pushrod</b> and is a result of di erent spring compliances associated with the <b>pushrod</b> in di erent ranges of its displacement. The air brake system is " in the sense that as the pressure increases, the displacement of the <b>pushrod</b> increases and there is a distinct sequence of modes that the system will transition through and upon a reduction in pressure, the sequence of modes is revisited in the reverse order. The mode to mode transition of the air brake system is governed by the parameters, such as, the clearance between the brake pad and the brake drum. The problem of estimation, that has been addressed, is as follows: Suppose the pressure in the air brake system were to be measured and that the motion of the <b>pushrod</b> is not measured. Is it possible to estimate the nal displacement of the <b>pushrod</b> without knowing the parameters, such as the clearance, that govern the system to transition from one mode to another...|$|R
