Many young female members said they want to undergo <b>post-secondary</b> <b>education,</b> and some told Fortuny they were degree students.

There are also many opportunities for post-secondary institutions to expand their abilities and capacity in developing and delivering appropriate content supporting these unique, self-governing environments in Canada. We explore the experiences of students from a rural First Nation in Canada with <b>post-secondary</b> distance <b>education,</b> focusing on how different delivery methods offer both opportunities and challenges for community-based students.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of <b>post-secondary</b> prison <b>education</b> {{programs}} {{is to increase}} the education level of prisoners and improve their chances of success upon release. However, in order to accomplish this goal of success after release, prisoners must first participate in the education programs. This is especially crucial for female prisoners, many of whom enter prison more socially, economically, and educationally disadvantaged than male prisoners. This analysis aims to determine whether there is a difference is male and female participation in <b>post-secondary</b> prison <b>education</b> programs. In addition, this analysis also aims to determine what factors make male and female inmates more likely to participate in <b>post-secondary</b> prison <b>education</b> programs. The results demonstrate that sex alone is not a significant predictor for participation in <b>post-secondary</b> prison <b>education.</b> However, when combined with other factors sex does become a significant predictor of participation. Factors that are significant predictors of participation {{for both males and females}} include previous education, income prior to incarceration, receiving visits from children, time served on the current sentence, participation in a racial or ethnic group, participation in parenting classes, and participation in life skills or community adjustment programs...|$|R
