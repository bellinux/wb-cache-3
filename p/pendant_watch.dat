In the 1970s he designed a bracelet watch (1973), a <b>pendant</b> <b>watch</b> (1976), and a fluorescent lighting system (1977).

50|$|Nurses were {{actively}} discouraged from wearing jewellery which might distract from their purpose and get caught on patient skin during care activity. A fob watch or <b>pendant</b> <b>watch</b> is considered synonymous with nursing. The fob watch frees the nurses' hands for client care and prevents the wrist watch becoming a vector for disease. Watches are sometimes given as a token rite-of-passage gift from parents to young nurses, {{who are making}} the transition into nurses' quarters and live {{away from home for}} the first time.|$|E

50|$|Zeno's history {{begins in}} 1868 with watchmaker Jules Godat, {{the founder of}} a small pocket watch {{manufacturing}} company (Godat & Co.) in La Chaux-de-Fonds, {{in the heart of}} the Swiss watchmaking industry. He produced, in very small quantities, fine pocket watches featuring solid silver cases and lady <b>pendant</b> <b>watches.</b> He built a small factory, which was taken over in 1920 by A. Eigeldinger & Fils.|$|R
50|$|Among the Le Cheminant models at {{this time}} were ladies’ watches {{with a variety of}} gold bracelets, children’s <b>watches,</b> <b>pendant</b> and nurses’ <b>watch.</b> All {{incorporated}} the Incabloc Shock Protection System. The Master Mariner series was one of their best-known lines and some models bore a close resemblance to high-end models on the market, such as the Precision Astrochon by Ollech and Wajs and chronographs by Rotary.|$|R
50|$|Rapidly {{changing}} fashions in clothing {{brought new}} styles of jewelry. Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were {{intended for the}} upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts {{of women in the}} twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs. As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders. The invention of the wrist-watch before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver. <b>Pendant</b> <b>watches,</b> hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{acceptability}} {{and value of}} three wearable GPS devices for older persons and individuals with a disability and safety concerns when accessing the community. Methods: This pilot study explored six wearers’ and their support persons’ experience of using three different wearable GPS devices (a <b>pendant,</b> <b>watch,</b> and mini GPS phone), each for a two-week period. Results: Participants identified safety as the main value of using a wearable GPS device. The acceptability and value of these devices was strongly influenced by device features, ease of use, cost, appearance, {{the reliability of the}} GPS coordinates, the wearer’s health condition and the users familiarity with technology. Overall, participants indicated that they preferred the pendant. Conclusions: Wearable GPS devices are potentially useful in providing individuals who have safety concerns with reassurance and access to assistance as required. To ensure successful utilization, future device design and device selection should consider the user’s familiarity with technology and their health condition. This study also revealed that not all wearable GPS devices provide continuous location tracking. It is therefore critical to ensure that the device’s location tracking functions address the wearer’s requirements and reason for using the device. Implications for Rehabilitation The acceptability and usability of wearable GPS devices is strongly influenced by the device features, ease of use, cost, appearance, the reliability of the device to provide accurate and timely GPS coordinates, as well as the health condition of the wearer and their familiarity with technology. Wearable GPS devices need to be simple to use and support and training is essential to ensure they are successfully utilized. Not all wearable GPS devices provide continuous location tracking and accuracy of location is impacted by line of sight to satellites. Therefore, care needs to be taken when choosing a suitable device, to ensure that the device’s location tracking features are based on the wearer’s requirements and value behind using the device...|$|E
5000|$|The {{very first}} watch that {{somebody}} adapted {{to wear on}} a wrist is unknown. The first series of purpose-made wrist watches was produced by Girard-Perregaux in 1880 for the German Navy. During World War I numerous companies, including Omega, Longines, and others produced wrist watches for the military. These watches were of virtually identical style with an enamel dial, wide white numerals, and a luminescent radium hour hand. Often they did not bear {{the name of the}} manufacturer, though the movement, originally designed in the 1890s for ladies’ <b>pendant</b> <b>watches,</b> was marked [...] "Swiss". From pocket watches those trench watches inherited hinged front and back covers. The lugs for a strap looked like a thick wire attachment to the classical round shape of pocket watches rather than an integrated part of the body of the later and modern wrist watches.|$|R

50|$|Styles {{changed in}} the 17th century and men began to wear watches in pockets instead of as <b>pendants</b> (the woman's <b>watch</b> {{remained}} a <b>pendant</b> into the 20th century). This {{is said to have}} occurred in 1675 when Charles II of England introduced waistcoats. To fit in pockets, their shape evolved into the typical pocket watch shape, rounded and flattened with no sharp edges. Glass was used to cover the face beginning around 1610. Watch fobs began to be used, the name originating from the German word fuppe, a small pocket. The watch was wound and also set by opening the back and fitting a key to a square arbor, and turning it.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Simrita and Viraj keep {{bumping into}} each other when they both travel to Italy independently; the former to make some quick cash as a model to pay her medical bills, and the latter, with Lucky, to chill out and take a {{vacation}} {{from all of the}} marital stress Lucky has been facing back home. Upon returning home, Simrita is given a <b>watch</b> <b>pendant</b> by her aunt Dolly (Kirron Kher) to wear as a good luck charm. The pendant hangs from a bracelet on her wrist. Viraj gets seriously hurt in an accident at work and is brought for emergency surgery to the hospital where Simrita is an intern. Much to each other's irritation, Simrita is given the charge to perform surgery on Viraj. After the surgery, while looking at the X-rays, she is horrified to discover that the watch on her wrist has accidentally ended up in Viraj's stomach.|$|R

This {{is said to have}} occurred in 1675 when Charles II of England introduced waistcoats. [...] This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. To fit in pockets, their shape evolved into the typical pocketwatch shape, rounded and flattened with no sharp edges. Glass was used to cover the face beginning around 1610. Watch fobs began to be used, the name originating from the German word fuppe, a small pocket. Later in the 1800s Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. The watch was wound and also set by opening the back and fitting a key to a square arbor, and turning it.|$|R
