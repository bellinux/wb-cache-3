40|$|It is {{not clear}} whether {{treatment}} for anxiety, depression and life difficulties by community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in primary care is effective or cost-effective. Community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> are asked to focus their attention on patients with a diagnosis of severe and enduring mental health problems. The one previous study of community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in primary care found no difference in outcome at 6 months, but patients with community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> care had fewer days off work over the study period. Problem solving by general practitioners (GPs) and community nurses {{has been shown to be}} effective for emotional disorders and depression in primary care. Treatment by community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> may have advantages in that it could reduce GP time and prescribing. Patients may prefer community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> care to <b>psychiatric</b> referral and community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> may prefer mixed case loads. This study was designed in order to inform policy on this issue. This paper describes the design of a randomized controlled trial and economic evaluation comparing community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> problem-solving treatment, generic community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> care and usual GP care for patients with anxiety, depression and life difficulties. If referral to community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> proves not to be effective or cost-effective GPs should be advised against referring patients with these types of problems.

This lack of mobilization of the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> as a resource person in the mental health services, is associated with her supervisors who are the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> managers. The purpose of this research was to develop and describe a model that could be implemented to guide the mobilization of the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> as a resource person in the mental health services in order to facilitate her mental health. The research also focused on developing guidelines for the implementation of the model for the mobilization of the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> as a resource person. The model: "Mobilization of the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> as a resource person: an interactive process", together with its operational guidelines was developed by using a theory generative design, that is, qualitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual in nature. This model was developed according to Chinn and Kramer's (1995) approach to theory generation, namely: identification of the central concepts for the model by conducting a field study to explore and describe the views of the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> and those of the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> managers with regard to the mobilization of the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> as a resource person in the mental health services of Gauteng; analysing the data gathered through focus groups interviews from the sample of the advanced <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> and form the sample of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> managers using Strauss and Corbin's (1990) open, axial, and selective coding approach to guide data analysis; analysing the data by identifying, defining, classifying the concepts and placing them into relationship with each other to form relationship statements as the conceptual framework for the model; describing the model using strategies proposed by Chinn and Kramer (1995) and then subjecting the model to evaluation by experts in theory generation; describing the guidelines for the implementation of the model in the clinical setting...|$|R

25|$|In 1913 Johns Hopkins University was {{the first}} college of nursing in the United States to offer <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> {{as part of its}} general curriculum. The first <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> textbook, Nursing Mental Diseases by Harriet Bailey, was not {{published}} until 1920. It was not until 1950 when the National League for Nursing required all nursing schools to include a clinical experience in psychiatry to receive national accreditation. The first psychiatric nurses faced difficult working conditions. Overcrowding, under-staffing and poor resources required the continuance of custodial care. They were pressured by an increasing patient population that rose dramatically {{by the end of the}} 19th century. As a result, labor organizations formed to fight for better pay and fewer hours. Additionally, large asylums were founded to hold the large number of mentally ill, including the famous Kings Park Psychiatric Center in Long Island, New York. At its peak in the 1950s, the center housed more than 33,000 patients and required its own power plant. Nurses were often called “attendants” to imply a more humanitarian approach to care. During this time, attendants primarily kept the facilities clean and maintained order among the patients. They also carried out orders from the physicians.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{psychiatry}} and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing,</b> although disjointed, {{can be traced back}} to ancient philosophical thinkers. Marcus Tullius Cicero, in particular, was the first known person to create a questionnaire for the mentally ill using biographical information to determine the best course of psychological treatment and care. Some of the first known psychiatric care centers were constructed in the Middle East during the 8th century. The medieval Muslim physicians and their attendants relied on clinical observations for diagnosis and treatment.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} duty of a psychiatric nurse {{is to maintain}} a positive therapeutic relationship with patients in a clinical setting. The fundamental elements of mental health care revolve around the interpersonal relations and interactions established between professionals and clients. Caring for people with mental illnesses demands an intensified presence and {{a strong desire to}} be supportive. Dziopa and Ahern assert that there are nine critical mental health aspects of the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> practicum: understanding and empathy, individuality, providing support, being there/being available, being 'genuine', promoting equality, demonstrating respect, demonstrating clear boundaries, and demonstrating self-awareness for the patient.|$|E
40|$|Background: A&E {{departments}} are key points of contact {{for many people}} with mental health problems. Various models of care have been developed in A&E departments for delivering mental health services, but few have been assessed for effectiveness. The present study aimed {{to assess the impact}} of a dedicated A&E <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> service on several outcomes relevant to patients and clinicians.   Methods: A crossover design was used to introduce a dedicated <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> service (comprising four experienced community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses)</b> into two busy UK A&E departments. Standardised assessments were completed for each patient, and a random sample of these independently assessed for quality. Data were also collected on the number of patients assessed, <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> time employed, waiting times, onward referrals, repeat attendances, patient satisfaction, and staff views.   Results: A&E staff referred about a third of patients judged to have mental health problems to the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> service; approximately half of those assessed had a psychiatric history. On average, assessments took 60 min and over 90 % of the formulated management plans were judged appropriate by independent assessors. The <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> intervention had little impact on waiting times or satisfaction levels for mental health patients, although there was evidence of a change in onward referral patterns.   Comment: <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> assessment services have been introduced in many A&E departments, although the evidence base for the effectiveness of this development is not well established. This study presents evidence that <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> can provide an accurate assessment and referral service with advantages for patient care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:Registered {{nursing is}} a core {{profession}} staffing psychiatric hospitals. However, strategic planning {{to address a}} critical national workforce shortage of registered nurses has not included <b>psychiatric</b> registered <b>nurses.</b> The lack of informa-tion thwarts policy decisions to adequately staff registered nurses for safe and effective psychiatric inpatient environments. OBJECTIVE:This study describes and compares demographic,educational,and employment characteristics of hospital-based <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> with nonpsychiatric nurses at the national level. It is hypothesized that significant differences between psy-chiatric and nonpsychiatric nurses exist, requiring special planning for recruitment and retention of <b>psychiatric</b> registered <b>nurses.</b> DESIGN:A weighted sample of 1, 113, 277 hospital-based registered nurses was identified from the 2000 National Sam-ple Survey of Registered Nurses. Of these, 33, 891 hospital-based <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> were identified. RESULTS:Hospital-based <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> are older, with a significantly lower proportion of younger entrants into the field. They are more diverse in race, education, gender, and marital status than nonpsychiatric <b>nurses.</b> <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> {{are also more likely}} than nonpsychiatric nurses to have an associate degree in nursing with a previous bachelor’s degree in another field. They have a higher rate of job turnover than nonpsychiatric nurses and have a slightly lower gross annual salary. CONCLUSION: Evi-dence suggests that <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> will age out of the workforce faster than nonpsychiatric nurses. It is imperative that re-sources for the recruitment and retention of registered nurses be directed toward the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> workforce. J A...|$|R

25|$|The formal {{recognition}} of psychiatry {{as a modern}} and legitimate profession occurred in 1808. In Europe, {{one of the major}} advocates for mental health nursing to help psychiatrists was Dr. William Ellis. He proposed giving the “keepers of the insane” better pay and training so more respectable, intelligent people would be attracted to the profession. In his 1836 publication of Treatise on Insanity, he openly stated that an established nursing practice calmed depressed patients and gave hope to the hopeless. However, <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> was not formalized in the United States until 1882 when Linda Richards opened Boston City College. This was the first school specifically designed to train nurses in psychiatric care.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> {{or mental}} health nursing is the {{appointed}} {{position of a}} nursing that has specialized in mental health and cares for {{people of all ages}} with mental illness or mental distress, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychosis, depression, dementia and many more. Nurses in this area receive specific training in psychological therapies, building a therapeutic alliance, dealing with challenging behavior, and the administration of psychiatric medication. In most countries, a psychiatric nurse will have to have attained a bachelor's degree in nursing to become a registered nurse (RN) and specialise in mental health. Degrees vary in different countries, and are governed by country-specific regulations. Psychiatric nurses work in hospitals, mental institutes, correctional institutes, and many other facilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{advanced}} practice nursing role {{began to}} take shape in the mid-20th century United States. Nurse anesthetists and nurse midwives were established in the 1940s, followed by <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> in 1954. The present day concept of the APRN as a primary care provider was created in the mid-1960s, spurred on by a national shortage of medical doctors. The first formal graduate certificate program for nurse practitioners was created by Henry Silver, a physician, and Loretta Ford, a nurse, in 1965, with a vision to help balance rising healthcare costs, increase the number of healthcare providers, and correct the inefficient distribution of health resources. In 1971, The U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Elliot Richardson, made a formal recommendation in expanding the scope of the nursing practice and qualifying {{them to be able to}} serve as primary care providers. During the mid 1970s to early 1980s, the completion of a master's degree became required in order to become a certified nurse practitioner. In 2012, discussions have risen between accreditation agencies, national certifying bodies, and state boards of nursing about the possibility of making the DNP as the new minimum of education for NP certification and licensure by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} {{put off by}} Mrs Burton-Cox's attitude, Mrs Oliver {{decides to}} resolve the issue after consulting with Celia about her parents' death, and invites her friend Hercule Poirot to solve the disquieting puzzle. Together, they conduct interviews with several elderly witnesses associated with the case, whom they term “elephants”, based on the assumption that, like the proverbial elephants, they may have long memories. Each individual witness recalls a different set of circumstances, but Poirot notes two items of significance - the first being that Margaret Ravenscroft was seriously bitten by the otherwise devoted family dog a few days before her death, and that she had four wigs in her possession {{at the time of her}} death. Further investigation by himself and Mrs Oliver soon reveals that her maiden name was Preston-Grey, and that she had an identical twin sister called Dorothea. While Margaret led a fairly ordinary life, her sister spent protracted periods of her life in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nursing</b> homes, after she was strongly suspected of being involved in two violent incidents: the first occurred in India when, following the death of her husband, Major Jarrow, Dorothea drowned their infant son and blamed it on an Indian ayah; the second occurred in Malaya when she was with the Ravenscrofts, in which she attacked the child of a neighbor of theirs. She soon joined them at their home in Overcliffe, whereupon she apparently sleep-walked off a cliff one evening and died; the deaths of Alistair and Margaret occurred less than a month after this.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> working in the community are changing their occupational base. They are working increasingly {{as members of a}} mental health multi-disciplinary team. This is a report on aspects {{of the role of the}} <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> working in such teams. Freidson's professional-dominance thesis is used as a theoretical framework to assess the occupational status of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> working in the community mental health team. In particular, the levels of clinical autonomy experienced by the nurse are explored. Four community mental health teams are examined, using Diary-interview Schedules to record how new clients are processed by the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse.</b> The other members of the teams were interviewed (as were the managers to whom the nurses were accountable) using Focused-interview Schedules. Furthermore, Field-notes were made of substantive, methodological, and pre-analytical observations made during visits to the team centres. The report concludes that although there is an occupational hierarchy and inter-disciplinary rivalry in the teams, the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> enjoys a large amount of de facto clinical autonomy. The <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurse</b> has also a dynamic and invariably unsupervised influence on the creation and pathway of psychiatric careers for those who are referred to her or him. Recommendations include the need to affirm authoritative leadership in the team, and for formal supervisory procedures to be installed. It is also recommended that <b>psychiatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in the community should re-assess their occupational strategy of professionalisation, with a view to a re-alignment with medical practitioners...|$|R
