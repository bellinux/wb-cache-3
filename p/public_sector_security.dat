However, in the <b>public</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>security</b> issues hinder institutions from adopting cloud computing. To solve these security challenges, in this paper, we propose a methodology for information security management, which quantitatively classifies the importance of information in cloud systems in the public sector. In this study, we adopt a Delphi approach to establish the classification criteria of the proposed methodology in an objective and systematic manner. Further, through a case study of a public corporation, we try to validate the usefulness of the proposed methodology. The results of this study will help public institutions to consider introducing cloud computing and to manage cloud systems effectively and securely...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{the current status of}} police and {{security}} education in Australian universities and technical colleges. The study was undertaken in the context of calls for greater professionalisation of policing and security along with a variety of conduct scandals that have driven reform agendas for both sectors. The study found that police studies had a significant profile in universities {{with a wide range of}} courses available, but virtually no profile in technical and further education (TAFE) colleges. Conversely, protective security offerings were proportionately more prominent in the TAFE sector than in universities. Courses in information and communication technology security were more common across universities and TAFE. The research also found that, of the 39 Australian universities, 9 have research centres related generally to policing and security. These also appeared to favour policing over security. We argue that these findings should be of concern, given the fact that private and <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>security</b> services have eclipsed police, in numbers at least, in many jurisdictions. Security should, we argue, be counted as an equal partner with police in crime prevention services. In addition, we argue that those engaged in security management should be given greater opportunities for study at the university level. Moreover, security studies should have an expanded research focus. © Springer Science+Business Media B. V. 2009...|$|E

30|$|As {{regards the}} {{security}} layers, {{on the one}} hand, Fig.  6 shows that the largest fraction of securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, were issued by General Governments, followed by debt securities issued by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem (1.13 trillion euros), Rest of the World (1.06 trillion euros), and Other Financial Institutions (1.00 trillion euros). Non-financial Corporations and Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds play only a minor role as issuing counterparties of the securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem. The fact that General Governments {{play a key role}} as an issuing counterparty of the securities held by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem could be explained as follows. The expectation of the public security purchases by the Eurosystem and the subsequent increase in the prices of the purchased securities may have generated an increase in the purchases of public securities by the private banking sector in order to sell them to the Eurosystem. However, our data, being data on holdings and issuances, are not able to provide empirical evidence of the aforementioned speculation. On the other hand, with particular reference to the APP securities, as we can see from Fig.  7, {{at the end of the}} second quarter of 2017, the largest fraction of APP securities held by the Eurosystem was issued by the institutional sector General Governments, amounting to 1.61 trillion euros, followed by securities issued by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem (0.31 trillion euros), and Non-Financial Corporations (0.04 trillion euros). In fact, the majority of purchases carried out by the Eurosystem within the APP until now have been <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>security</b> purchases (European Central Bank 2017 a).|$|E

Investment holdings in the total market and amongst insurance companies are used as benchmarks. One main finding is that there was a great deal of variation in the size of bank investments relative to total assets, with no evidence of a 'norm' investments ratio. Another finding is that although there is some evidence of greater diversity over time, conservatism - and especially the continued heavy reliance on <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>securities</b> - is more evident. Overall, there was a commitment to a high liquidity, risk-averse approach to portfolio management which contributed to bank stability and limited the financing of the private sector. banking history, investments, capital markets, bank stability, portfolio management,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the global financial crisis on euro area cross-border financial flows by comparing recent developments with the main pre-crisis trends. Two prominent features of the period of turmoil were (i) the sizeable deleveraging of external financial exposures by the private sector and, in particular, the banking sector from 2008 and (ii) the significant changes in the composition of euro area cross-border portfolio flows, as investors shifted from equity to debt instruments, from long-term to short- term debt instruments and from private to <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> <b>securities.</b> Since 2009 such trends have started reversing. However, as balance sheet restructuring by financial and non-financial corporations continues, cross-border financial flows have remained well below pre-crisis levels. The degree of resumption and volatility of crossborder financial activity may have a major bearing on growth prospects for the euro area and may also matter from a financial stability perspective. We argue that the recent experience, first of extraordinary growth and then of scaling down of international financial activity, calls for enhanced monitoring of developments in crossborder financial flows so that the underlying risks to the domestic economy stemming from the financial sector can be better assessed. Looking forward, successful implementation of policy actions to promote macroeconomic discipline and enhance financial regulation and supervision could influence, inter alia, the composition and volume of cross-border capital flows, contributing to a more efficient and sustainable allocation of resources.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the determinants of}} male and female pay in the <b>public</b> and private <b>sectors</b> by estimating a joint model of sector allocation and wage determination using cross-sectional data from the Egyptian 1987 and 1997 labour force surveys. A model of compensating wage differentials is defined and estimated, in order to quantify the value of arguably the three most important non-pecuniary aspects of <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> employment: job <b>security,</b> fringe benefits (especially comprehensive retirement pensions) and lower effort and shorter hours which allow workers to supplement income through obtaining a second job. Estimates of the public-private differentials, correcting for differences in characteristics and selectivity, indicate a <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> disadvantage for males and a small advantage for females in 1987. Relative <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> wages improved {{for both males and females}} in 1997, and when adjustments for non-wage benefits are included, <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> premia are observed in all segments of the <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> for both males and females.
