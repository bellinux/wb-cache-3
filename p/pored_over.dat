5|$|In September 1828 Balzac {{visited the}} home of a family friend and retired general, the Baron de Pommereul, in Fougères. He spent several weeks {{learning}} about the insurrection (which Pommereul had fought against). He <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> his host's books and interviewed the townspeople about their experiences {{during the time of the}} uprising. Pommereul owned a castle which had been the headquarters of the Comte de Puisaye, a royalist leader involved with a failed invasion of royalist exiles at Quiberon. This incursion had been aided by the Chouans, and Balzac began collecting events and people as inspiration for his novel.|$|E
5|$|The researching, planning, {{design and}} {{programming}} {{of the game}} took about six months and between 200 and 300 hours of work. All the footage and pictures in the game {{were taken from the}} internet. Final Fantasy VI influenced the sprite-based design. Many of the songs in the game are MIDI versions of 1990s grunge and alternative bands such as Radiohead, Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins. Ledonne paid meticulous attention to detail, including giving players access to the exact inventory the gunmen used on their rampage. He watched videos, read newspaper articles and <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> 11,000 pages of documents released by the county government regarding the massacre and the killers.|$|E

25|$|The Pantisocrats {{were also}} heavily {{influenced}} by contemporary travel accounts of the new world. Many writers who visited the new world (including J. P. Brissot, Thomas Cooper, and Joseph Priestley) described a fresh and inviting country, whose inhabitants were untainted by the evils of society. Coleridge and Southey <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> these and other accounts of the American continent.|$|E
25|$|In late November 1993, {{the bill}} for the Clinton health care plan of 1993 was {{introduced}} in the Congress and made publicly available. The Wall Street Journal then published an op-ed by McCaughey in which said she had <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> the entire bill and concluded that it had price controls that would cause rationing, and the bill was dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Sophie Germain {{thought that}} if the {{geometry}} method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited her in her house, encouraging her in her studies.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, the FBI {{assigned}} Mulder to the Violent Crimes Unit. Around this time, Mulder {{first came}} across the X-Files, an obscure FBI section dealing with cases relating to the paranormal; he <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> these cases in his spare time, becoming obsessed with them. In 1991, Mulder re-opened the X-Files with Special agent Diana Fowley, but Fowley left shortly thereafter. Mulder investigated the X-Files by himself until March 1992, when Dana Scully, an instructor at the FBI Academy's Forensic Science Research and Training Center, was partnered {{with him for the}} purpose of applying scientific reasoning to Mulder's work and theories.|$|E
25|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany, the units that comprised the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) were selected in early May and ordered to Europe within 30 days. The Army, needing transports to get the men and materiel to France, re-formed the Army Transport Service. A committee of shipping executives <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> registries of American shipping and, on 28 May 1917, selected Lenape and thirteen other American ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough coal in their s for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea. After Lenape discharged her last load of passengers, she was officially chartered by the Army on 1 June.|$|E

(Her father was a palace guard of King Louis Phillipe who fled to the U.S. as a political refugee.) A week later, on February 14, 1855, Thaddeus and Leontine wed. Their union would produce ten children, seven girls and three boys. Lowe continued with his scientific endeavors and the dream of owning his own balloon with the wild idea of making a transatlantic flight via the high winds he observed. He <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> the book of John Wise, A System of Aeronautics which had specific instructions for the construction of aerostats, the cutting, the sewing, the leak proofing.|$|E

25|$|Construction on the Hubbard House's two-story front {{elevation}} began around 1872 {{at the urging}} of Mrs. Hubbard who felt the family had outgrown the small cottage that occupied the site from 1857 until 1872. Despite her desires and Silas Hubbard's prominent position as the only doctor in Hudson, the family had little money with which to pursue the addition to their home. Hubbard was known not to push his clients for payment. In response, Elbert and his mother <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> Silas' records searching for any one they thought might be able to make payment through labor or construction materials. Elbert, already a considerable salesman by 1872, then rode about McLean County to obtain cash, materials and promises of labor from his father's clientele. Soon the new section of the house was completed.|$|E

[...] His name was removed from the title page of most subsequent editions. [...] According to a study of the Manual by critic Joseph Jones in Canadian Notes & Queries, a literary journal, some later editions experienced a falloff in quality. [...] Nevertheless, Jones says the Manual stands as an icon of its age.

500|$|Herzig-Yoshinaga and her husband, John [...] "Jack" [...] Herzig, <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> {{mountains}} of {{documents from the}} War Relocation Authority, a task that [...] "was roughly equivalent to indexing all the information in a library, working from a card catalog that only gave a subject description by shelf, without giving individual book titles or authors." [...] Their efforts resulted in the discovery of evidence that the US Government perjured itself before the United States Supreme Court in the 1944 cases Korematsu v. United States, Hirabayashi v. United States, and Yasui v. United States which challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} relocation and incarceration. The government had presented falsified evidence to the Court, destroyed evidence, and had withheld other vital information. [...] This evidence provided the legal basis Japanese Americans needed to seek redress and reparations for their wartime imprisonment. The Herzigs' research was also valuable in their work with the National Coalition for Japanese American Redress (NCJAR), which filed a class-action lawsuit against the US Government on behalf of the incarcerees. The US Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiff.|$|E

He practised {{tailoring}} clothing on his dolls and designed swimsuits for the neighbourhood girls when not yet 10 years old. Roy Thomas, the art teacher at Ossie's secondary school – himself heavily-involved in fabric art – recognised Ossie's creative flair and gave him a large collection of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar magazines. Clark <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> these magazines and absorbed the glamour and cutting edge fashion.|$|E

[...] A good friend of his father, the King of Tripura Bir Chandra Manikya, offered Sarasvati a position as secretary and historian at the royal court, which afforded him enough financial independence for pursuing his studies independently. Taking advantage of his access to the royal library, he <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> both Indian and Western works of history, philosophy, and religion, and started his own astronomy school in Calcutta. After the king died in 1896, his heir Radha Kishore Manikya requested Sarasvati to tutor the princes at the palace and offered him full pension, which Siddhanta Sarsvati accepted till 1908.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the date}} set for {{departure}} arrived {{and the financial}} difficulties in undertaking the journey remained unsolved, the would-be emigrants began to lose excitement and resolve. Besides their lack of funds, other concerns challenged the Pantisocrats. Contrary to the glowing travel narratives that Coleridge <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> while researching the prospect of settling in America, other accounts of American life were less encouraging, and described a difficult and laborious existence. In a review of Thomas Cooper’s Some Information Respecting America, (one of the positive accounts of the New World that Coleridge consulted) a reviewer describes Cooper and those like him as “rival auctioneers, or rather show-men, stationed for the allurement of incautious passengers. 'Pray, ladies and gentlemen, walk in and admire the wonders of Kentucky—Pray, stop and see the incomparable beauties of the Susquehanna.'” ...|$|E

[...] Others in his entourage were taken down to have his building plans explained to them as they <b>pored</b> <b>over</b> the model.
