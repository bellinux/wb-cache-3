5|$|The {{teeth and}} gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are {{generally}} sharp, lasting {{as long as}} the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from <b>physiologic</b> sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In a toothache, nerves are stimulated by either exogenous sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or endogenous factors (such as inflammatory mediators).|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and <b>physiologic</b> stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} <b>physiologic</b> {{constriction}} of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|The calcium {{sensitivity}} of the sarcomere, that is, the calcium concentration at which muscle contraction occurs, is directly determined by the calcium binding affinity of cNTnC. To date, there are no known post-translational modifications of cTnC that impact its calcium binding affinity. However, calcium binding by cNTnC is a dynamic process that can be impacted by the closed-to-open conformational equilibrium of cNTnC, the domain positioning of cNTnC, or the relative availability of cTnI148-159, the <b>physiologic</b> binding partner of cNTnC. The closed-to-open equilibrium of cNTnC can be shifted towards the open state by small compounds (see section below on troponin-binding drugs). Domain positioning of cNTnC can be impacted by phosphorylation of cTnI, of which the most important site in humans is Ser22/Ser23. The availability of cTnI148-159 depends on the blocked-closed-open equilibrium of tropomyosin on actin, which can be impacted by any interactions involving the thin filament, including actin-myosin cross-bridging and length dependent activation (also known as stretch activation or the Frank Starling law of the heart). All of these processes can be impacted by mutations (see section below on disease-causing mutations).|$|E
25|$|When a tooth {{is picked}} up, it {{should always be}} grasped by the enamel on the crown. Finger {{pressure}} on the tooth root cells will cause cell crushing. Any attempt to clean off any debris should be avoided. Debris should always be washed off gently with, at the very least, a <b>physiologic</b> saline. Even {{with the use of}} a <b>physiologic</b> saline, the “scrubbing” of the tooth root to remove debris must be avoided. When placed in a <b>physiologic</b> solution, the tooth should be gently agitated to permit the cleansing of the tooth root. At the same time that this agitation occurs, the bumping of the tooth root against a hard surface such as glass, plastic or even cardboard must also be avoided. For the same reasons, the method in which the knocked-out teeth are transported must be carefully selected. Placing the knocked-out teeth in transporting vehicles such as tissues and handkerchiefs can be damaging and transporting them in glass or cardboard containers can also be potentially damaging to the cells. In addition to the potential damage that the hard surface can cause, glass containers have the added possibility of breakage or leakage of the <b>physiologic</b> storage fluid. If the glass container does not have a tightly fitting top, then during the transportation, the <b>physiologic</b> storage solution can spill out and the teeth can fall, once again, on the floor and, at the same time, be out of a <b>physiologic</b> environment.|$|E
25|$|In normal resting hearts, the <b>physiologic</b> {{rhythm of}} the heart is normal sinus rhythm (NSR).|$|E
25|$|Convergence-accommodative {{micropsia}} is a <b>physiologic</b> {{phenomenon in}} which an object appears smaller as it approaches the subject.|$|E
25|$|Hexokinase III/C is substrate-inhibited by glucose at <b>physiologic</b> concentrations. Little {{is known}} about the {{regulatory}} characteristics of this isoform.|$|E
25|$|Both {{anatomic}} and <b>physiologic</b> methods allow {{early detection}} before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. Anatomic methods {{are more expensive}} {{and some of them}} are invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, <b>physiologic</b> methods are often less expensive and safer. But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.|$|E
25|$|<b>Physiologic</b> saline has {{a fairly}} {{compatible}} osmolality {{and will not}} cause cell swelling but it lacks the metabolites and glucose necessary for maintenance of normal cell metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{names for}} this enzyme are: humanhexokinaseIV, hexokinaseD, and ATP:D-hexose6-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.1.1 (previously 2.7.1.2). The common name, glucokinase, {{is derived from}} its {{relative}} specificity for glucose under <b>physiologic</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Physiologic</b> phimosis, {{common in}} males 10 {{years of age}} and younger, is normal, and does not require intervention. Non-retractile {{foreskin}} usually becomes retractable during the course of puberty.|$|E
25|$|The major <b>physiologic</b> {{triggers}} {{of adrenaline}} release center upon stresses, such as physical threat, excitement, noise, bright lights, and high ambient temperature. All of these stimuli are processed {{in the central}} nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Most healthy kidneys contain enough <b>physiologic</b> {{reserve to}} {{compensate}} for this NSAID-induced decrease in blood flow. However, those subjected to additional injury from phenacetin or paracetamol may progress to analgesic nephropathy.|$|E
25|$|Vigorous {{physical}} activity (such as exercise or hard labor) increases the body's demand for oxygen. The first-line <b>physiologic</b> {{response to this}} demand {{is an increase in}} heart rate, breathing rate, and depth of breathing.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{traditional}} diagnostic {{methods such as}} angiography and stress-testing, other detection techniques have been developed in the past decades for earlier detection of atherosclerotic disease. Some of the detection approaches include anatomical detection and <b>physiologic</b> measurement.|$|E
25|$|If {{patients}} have been receiving daily high doses {{for five days}} or less, they can be abruptly stopped (or reduced to <b>physiologic</b> replacement if patients are adrenal-deficient). Full adrenal recovery can be assumed to occur by a week afterward.|$|E
25|$|When {{treated with}} GH, a {{deficient}} child {{will begin to}} grow faster within months. Other benefits may be noticed, such as increased strength, progress in motor development, and reduction of body fat. Side-effects {{of this type of}} <b>physiologic</b> replacement are quite rare.|$|E
25|$|The loss of <b>physiologic</b> {{timing of}} atrial and {{ventricular}} contractions, or sometimes called AV dyssynchrony, leads to different mechanisms of symptoms production. This altered ventricular contraction will decrease cardiac output, {{and in turn}} will lead to systemic hypotensive reflex response with varying symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The resting {{position}} of the temporomandibular joint is not with the teeth biting together. Instead, the muscular balance and proprioceptive feedback allow a <b>physiologic</b> rest for the mandible, an interocclusal clearance or freeway space, which is 2 to 4mm between the teeth.|$|E
25|$|Physiologically, {{research}} has linked pre-eclampsia {{to the following}} <b>physiologic</b> changes: alterations in {{the interaction between the}} maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, endothelial cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among vasoactive substances, decreased intravascular volume, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
25|$|Post operatively, kidneys are {{periodically}} {{assessed by}} ultrasound to assess for the imaging and <b>physiologic</b> changes that accompany transplant rejection. Imaging also allows evaluation of supportive {{structures such as}} the anastomosed transplant artery, vein, and ureter, to ensure they are stable in appearance.|$|E
25|$|Potassium channel efflux is {{inhibited}} by magnesium. Thus hypomagnesemia {{results in}} an increased excretion of potassium in kidney, resulting in a hypokalaemia. This condition is believed to occur secondary to the decreased normal <b>physiologic</b> magnesium inhibition of the ROMK channels in the apical tubular membrane.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{supplements}} of nitric oxide, {{the response is}} short-lived because, as a normally produced internal <b>physiologic</b> control mechanism, increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance, which {{is the reason that}} the effectiveness of sustained use of nitroglycerin for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days.|$|E
25|$|Hypothermia {{can occur}} with transfusions with large {{quantities}} of blood products which normally are stored at cold temperatures. Core body temperature can go down as low as 32°C and can produce <b>physiologic</b> disturbances. Prevention {{should be done with}} warming the blood to ambient temperature prior to transfusions.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} patient factors {{can lead to}} CTS, {{including}} heredity, size of the carpal tunnel, associated local and systematic diseases, and certain habits. Non-traumatic causes generally happen {{over a period of}} time, and are not triggered by one certain event. Many of these factors are manifestations of <b>physiologic</b> aging.|$|E
25|$|Another {{limitation}} of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater <b>physiologic</b> resources and partly because it involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. More detail is provided in the menarche article.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiology}} of micturition and the <b>physiologic</b> {{basis of its}} disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion, especially at the supraspinal level. Micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and, like defecation, subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition.|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{generally}} has negative health effects, because smoke inhalation inherently poses challenges to various <b>physiologic</b> {{processes such as}} respiration. Diseases related to tobacco smoking {{have been shown to}} kill approximately half of long-term smokers when compared to average mortality rates faced by non-smokers. Smoking caused over five million deaths a year from 1990 to 2015.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{glucocorticoid}} levels {{resulting from}} administration {{as a drug}} or hyperadrenocorticism have effects on many systems. Some examples include inhibition of bone formation, suppression of calcium absorption (both of {{which can lead to}} osteoporosis), delayed wound healing, muscle weakness, and increased risk of infection. These observations suggest a multitude of less-dramatic <b>physiologic</b> roles for glucocorticoids.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance is a <b>physiologic</b> {{process where}} the body adjusts to a {{medication}} that is frequently present, usually requiring higher doses of the same medication over time {{to achieve the same}} effect. It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction.|$|E
25|$|Class III {{molecules}} have <b>physiologic</b> roles unlike classes I and II, but are encoded {{between them}} in the short arm of human chromosome 6. Class III molecules include several secreted proteins with immune functions: components of the complement system (such as C2, C4, and B factor), cytokines (such as TNF-α, LTA, and LTB), and heat shock proteins.|$|E
25|$|There {{are certain}} testing {{procedures}} for Hybrid IIIs {{to ensure that}} they obtain a correct humanlike neck flexure, and {{to ensure that they}} would react to a crash in a similar way that human bodies would. Using cadavers for these topics of research is more realistic than using a dummy for <b>physiologic</b> reasons, but it arises many moral dilemmas.|$|E
25|$|Thrombocytosis* is a {{condition}} characterized by an excess of platelets. Most cases are <b>physiologic</b> (caused by exercise) or reactive (secondary to some cancers, blood loss, or certain drugs). Rarely the condition {{is caused by a}} primary bone marrow disorder. In this last case, the platelets may not function normally, causing the blood to not clot properly.|$|E
25|$|Any {{glucocorticoid}} can {{be given}} in a dose that provides approximately the same glucocorticoid effects as normal cortisol production; this {{is referred to as}} <b>physiologic,</b> replacement, or maintenance dosing. This is approximately 6–12mg/m²/day of hydrocortisone (m² refers to body surface area (BSA), and is a measure of body size; an average man's BSA is 1.9 m²).|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{increase}} cholesterol LDL {{production by}} increasing production and activity of HMG-CoA reductase. These include the <b>physiologic</b> stress hormone cortisol and commonly used medicines for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or connective tissue disorders. Other steroid hormones and drugs are also implicated. In contrast, the thyroid hormone decreases cholesterol production. Hence, hypothyroidism (lack of thyroid hormone) causes hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
