It has broad application prospects in using low-grade energy, such as solar energy, biomass emergy and industrial waste heat. In this paper, Schmidt Method used in the Stirling engine working cycle is analyzed theoretically, and the Stirling engine power output is calculated. The effects of temperature and the average cycle pressure on the output characteristics of the system are analyzed. Theoretical calculations show that the output characteristics can be improved significantly by adjusting the heating temperature and the average cycle pressure. An experiment station is then designed and constructed for the research on Stirling engine power output characteristics. Experimental results show that by improving <b>pre-charge</b> <b>pressure</b> in the working chamber with low temperature conditions, the system can achieve higher power output and thermal efficiency. <b>Pre-charge</b> <b>pressure</b> in the working chamber is adjusted to 2 MPa, when the heater tube wall temperature reaches 650 â„ƒ, the output power exceeds 1750 W, and the effective efficiency will be 23. 3 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{charging}} process {{is one of}} the critical processes in the hydro-pneumatic driveline storage system. It converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle braking and coasting to the compression energy. This energy is stored in the storage device called the accumulator. The system is planned to be used on the dual hydro-pneumatic hybrid driveline and applied to a hydraulic hybrid passenger car. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find the effect of charging parameters on the storage performance through simulation. Through the storage behavior, the desirable and optimal sizing of the accumulator can be selected. The paper emphasized on the effect of pressure elevation, <b>pre-charge</b> <b>pressure,</b> effective volume, thermal reaction and required time of the accumulator's {{charging process}}. The circuit of charging process has been designed and simulated by using the hydraulic tool in the Automation Studio software. The simulation results were corroborated through the component specification for data rationality. Through the simulation, it was found that <b>pre-charge</b> <b>pressure</b> had a significant effect on the charging process. It determined the efficiency of the effective volume. The higher the pressure elevation, the higher the effective volume. Nevertheless, the more energy required to compress the nitrogen gas in the bladder. Besides, in term of volume displacement, higher volume displacement reduced charging time and lower the fluid temperature. The simulation had been positively highlighted the critical point in charging process which later on, benefited the sizing process in the component selection specification. ...|$|E

Due to the outlet of the relief valve being connected to the tank, the pressure drop of the relief valve is frequently equal to the inlet pressure. Accordingly, the energy loss of the relief valve is very high in some cases and this will worsen {{with an increase in}} the rated pressure of the hydraulic system. In order to overcome the disadvantage of overflow energy loss in a relief valve, a hydraulic energy regeneration unit (HERU) is connected to the outlet of the relief valve to decrease the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of the relief valve. The overflow loss, which is characterized by the pressure drop, can be reduced accordingly. The approach is to convert the overflow energy loss in hydraulic form and allow for release when needed. The configuration and working principle of the relief valve with HERU is introduced in this present study. The mathematical model is established to obtain the factors influencing the stability of the relief valve. The working pressure of the hydraulic accumulator (HA) is explored. Furthermore, the control process of the operating state of the HA is scheduled to decide whether to regenerate the energy via the HERU. The software AMESim is utilized to analyze the performance and characteristics of the relief valve with HERU. Following this, the test rig is built and used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed relief valve with HERU. The experimental results show that the relief valve with the HERU connected to its outlet can still achieve better pressure-regulating characteristics. The energy regeneration efficiency saved by the HA is up to 83. 6 %, with a higher <b>pre-charge</b> <b>pressure</b> of the HA. This indicates that the proposed structure of the relief valve with HERU can achieve a better performance and higher regeneration efficiency...|$|E
