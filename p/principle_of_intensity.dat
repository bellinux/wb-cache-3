50|$|The {{more intense}} the {{material}} taught, {{the more likely}} it will be retained. A sharp, clear, vivid, dramatic, or exciting learning experience teaches more than a routine or boring experience. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> implies that a student will learn more from the real thing than from a substitute. For example, a student can get more understanding and appreciation of a movie by watching it than by reading the script. Likewise, a student is likely to gain greater understanding of tasks by performing them rather than merely reading about them. The more immediate and dramatic the learning is to a real situation, the more impressive the learning is upon the student. Real world applications that integrate procedures and tasks that students are capable of learning will make a vivid impression on them.|$|E

Game designers also place heavy emphasis on feedback, which goes with practice as part of exercise. Games use the technique of simplicity to reduce distractions, balance difficulty versus skill, and accurately correlate actions to corrective feedback. This impacts flow and motivation and increases the positive feelings toward the activity, which links back {{to the principles of}} exercise, readiness, and effect. Games use immersion and engagement as ways to create riveting experiences for players, which is part of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity.</b> Finally, part of the primary appeal of games is that they are fun.

Particular attention is given to surface recombination, which reduces the photocurrent conversion efficiency, and to photocurrent multiplication, which leads to quantum efficiencies greater than unity. The advantages of non steady-state photocurrent measurements are considered, and it is shown that the coupling of electron and hole fluxes via the surface leads to a characteristic time or frequency dependence of the photocurrent conversion efficiency. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) is described, and its application is illustrated with several examples, including the reduction of oxygen at p-GaAs and the photooxidation of Si in NH 4 F.

40|$|In {{this article}} it is {{proposed}} that the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> motivational <b>intensity</b> theory (Brehm & Self, 1989) apply to effort mobilization for challenges with consequences for performers’ self-esteem and selfdefinition (i. e., self-involvement). Accordingly, involvement of the self makes success important and thus justifies the mobilization of high resources. However, up to this level of maximally justified resources, actual effort is mobilized in correspondence to subjective task difficulty as long as success is possible. We report a series of experimental studies that have operationalized effort intensity as cardiovascular reactivity during task performance and used multiple manipulations of self-involvement (social evaluation, self-awareness, ego involvement, personal goals) and task difficulty.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present thesis was to extend {{knowledge}} of the impact of implicit affect in the process of effort mobilization. The implicit-affect-primes-effort model (Gendolla, 2012, 2015) makes specific predictions and gives explanations for the influence of implicit affect on effort mobilization. Briefly, the IAPE model posits that implicit affect influences effort through its impact on subjective demand, which in turn influences effort according to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> motivational <b>intensity</b> theory (Brehm & Self, 1989). The present thesis focused on implicit fear, which is an implicit affect that was not studied to date. Based on the IAPE model (2012, 2015) implicit fear should activate the difficulty concept, which should increase experienced task demand and in turn determine effort mobilization according to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> motivational <b>intensity</b> theory (Brehm & Self, 1989). We conducted four studies to test these predictions...|$|R

The theoretical model of rock breakage by mechanical tool was developed based on the rock fracture mechanics and the solution of Boussinesq’s problem, and it could explain the process of rock fragmentation as well as predicating the peak reacting force. The theoretical model of rock breakage by coupled mechanical and hydraulic action was developed according to the superposition <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> factors at the crack tip, and the reacting force of mechanical tool assisted by hydraulic action could be reduced obviously if the crack with a critical length could be produced by mechanical or hydraulic impact. The experimental results indicated that the peak reacting force could be reduced about 15 % assisted by medium water pressure, and quick reduction of reacting force after peak value decreased the specific energy consumption of rock fragmentation by mechanical tool.

40|$|Whereas {{specialized}} frequency-encoding {{patterns in}} the human auditory cortex are generally accepted, termed tonotopicity, a similar <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> encoding—amplitopicity—is debated controversially. This {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study describes the relationship of the activation volume and the spatial distribution of activated clusters under different sound pressure levels (SPL) across the temporal plane including the transverse temporal gyrus (TTG). Nine healthy subjects with no hearing deficiencies were investigated using an echo-planar imaging technique at 1. 5 T. A boxcar stimulation paradigm was applied with a 5 -Hz pulsed sine tone of 1000 Hz frequency at three SPLs of 70, 82, and 90 dB. Linear cross-correlation analysis (correlation coefficient > 0. 3 corresponding to P < 0. 08) of the functional data set revealed bilateral BOLD response within the auditory cortex of the nine subjects with moderate increase of activation volume for higher sound pressure levels. With increasing sound pressure a two-dimensional drift of cortical activation was observed (a) from the ventral to the dorsal edge and (b) from lateral to medial parts of TTG. This latero-medial drift therefore mimics the well-accepted principle of tonotopy for frequency-encoding neurons. This study demonstrates the existence of an amplitopic pattern of intensity-encoding neuronal clusters that in part resembles the tonotopic distribution of frequency-encoding neurons. This finding has to be integrated into the understanding of the auditory organization for the interpretation of higher auditory functions such as sound perception or speech...|$|E

40|$|State of research: Absolute {{distance}} measuring systems for large distances are usually {{based on the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> modulated light. The achievable resolution depends on the modulation frequency. Because photodetector bandwidths arrive at a physical limit, it seems that these systems have reached their limit. Interferometric distance measurements can only {{be done in a}} relative manner and a corner cube has to be mounted at the moving object. During measurement the laser beam sould not be interrupted; measurements at technical surfaces, i. e. optically rough surfaces, can't be performed. Aim of research: In this project a new concept for interferometric, absolute distance measurements for larger distances is examined. Besides specular reflecting objects technical surfaces shall also be used as targets. Further {{it should be possible to}} perform distance measurements at rotating objects. These targets introduce an additional signal modulation which can't be handled by conventional {{distance measuring}} systems. Method: An acusto-optical modulator generates the second wavelength in a double-heterodyne interferometer. A high frequency shift is aspired to increase the system resolution. On the other hand the decreasing unambiguity can be overcome by a multiple tone technique. Signal pickup and evaluation is performed at the comparable low heterodyne frequency. Results: After pre-experiments using a HeNe laser with suppressed carrier technique (resolution 60 nm, unambiguity 28 #mu#m) a laser diode based double-heterodyne interferometer with an UHF-AOM was realised. This set-up achieves a resolution of 45 #mu#m at 0. 3 m unambiguity. Unambiguity is increased to 50 m by means of a multiple tone method. The surface under test can be either a specular reflecting or diffuse scattering one. In addition distance measurements at rotating targets during system integration are possible. The system resolution is limited by the AOM frequency available at project start. Meanwhile AOM's with 9 times higher frequencies are available with comparable diffraction efficiencies. Applications: The double-heterodyne method has a high potential for industrial geodetic applications. The main advantage of this coherent method is its application onto technical surfaces. (orig.)

First, I discuss what it means for Kant to attribute intensive magnitude to the soul, starting with his response to Mendelssohn where Kant introduces the soul’s intensity as a metaphysical notion immanent to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> rational psychology. I show, however, that in Kant ’s counter-argument there occurs a subtle though crucial shift in perspective – from the soul’s substance to its powers. Then I move on to consider three fundamental variants upon the soul’s <b>intensity</b> – <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> representation, of life, and of cognition – each governed, I argue, by the implied notions <b>of</b> measure <b>of</b> <b>intensity</b> and its balance.
