5|$|In {{preparation}} for the referendum, every household in Quebec was sent {{a draft of the}} Act Respecting the Future of Quebec (also referred to as the Sovereignty Bill), with the announcement of the National Commission on the Future of Quebec to commence in February 1995. The Commission was boycotted by the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> the Liberal Party of Canada, and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.|$|E
25|$|From 1963 to 1994 {{there was}} a New Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> which split from the party over issues of Quebec {{sovereignty}} and after several mergers with other left-wing parties formed Québec solidaire in 2006.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, he {{contributed to}} the monthly L'aut'journal. He was {{nominated}} the New Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> candidate in a 1992 provincial by-election. His nomination was controversial, and resulted in the federal New Democratic Party denouncing its former provincial wing (ties {{between the two parties}} had been severed in 1989) and seeking legal options in an attempt to force the provincial party to change its name.|$|E
50|$|Considering its modest {{results in}} the 2003 {{elections}} (1.06% of the votes or 1.50% if the Green <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Québec's</b> votes were included), the UFP was a marginal party.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, he was Vice-President of the Progressive Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada's <b>Quebec</b> {{campaign}} and Chairman {{of the electoral}} campaign in 1988.|$|R
50|$|It {{received}} 0.55% of {{the popular}} vote in the 2014 Quebec election. The current leader is Alex Tyrrell. Nominated as party leader on September 21, 2013 and then aged 25, he became the youngest <b>party</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> and Canada.|$|R
25|$|Although enjoying {{strong support}} among {{organized}} labour and rural {{voters in the}} Prairies, McLaughlin tried to expand their support into Quebec without much success. In 1989, the New Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> adopted a sovereigntist platform and severed its ties with the federal NDP. Under McLaughlin, the party did manage to win an election in Quebec {{for the first time}} when Edmonston won a 1990 by-election.|$|E
25|$|Duplessis first won {{the seat}} as a Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> {{candidate}} in the 1927 Quebec election. In the 1931 election, he was reelected in his seat, but Conservative leader Camillien Houde lost both the election and his own seat. The Conservative caucus chose C. E. Gault to be interim Leader of the Opposition but, after Houde resigned as party leader in 1932, Duplessis won {{the leadership of the}} party during the 1933 convention over the only other candidate, Onésime Gagnon.|$|E
25|$|A major {{weakness}} of the party since 1885 was its inability to win support in Quebec, estranged significantly by that year's execution of Louis Riel. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 exacerbated the issue. Even though the Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> dominated politics in that province for the first 30 years of Confederation at both the federal and provincial levels, in the 20th century the party {{was never able to}} become a force in provincial politics, losing power in 1897, and dissolving in 1935 into the Union Nationale, which took power in 1936 under Maurice Duplessis.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 {{she became}} {{co-chair}} of the election campaign for the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada in <b>Quebec.</b> In May 2010 she was elected President <b>of</b> the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada (<b>Quebec)</b> (LPCQ) by the Board of directors to replace Marc Lavigne who had resigned for personal reasons {{a few months after}} having been elected by the delegates at the October 2009 convention. Lucienne Robillard was also {{co-chair of the}} Electoral Commission of the LPCQ in 2010 and 2011 until the commission was dissolved {{at the start of the}} 2011 electoral campaign.|$|R
50|$|Maps {{prior to}} 1927 wildly {{disagreed}} {{on the actual}} position of the border, instead of agreeing upon marking the area as being disputed. Maps after 1927 tended {{to agree with the}} decision, but due to protests, some mapmakers in Quebec still disagreed. In the 60's, logos of the two biggest political <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> (PLQ & UN) both included the shape of the province as including all of Labrador. Disagreements persist even today (to a lesser extent), as Quebec insists on including the rest of the gulf's basin in its maps, separated with a dotted line saying 1927 border, non-final. Newfoundland complains in 2014, even though older electoral maps showed the same.|$|R
2500|$|For the 2004 {{election}} the Bloc {{adopted the}} slogan Un parti propre au Québec, {{a play on}} words that can be translated either as [...] "A <b>party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec's</b> own" [...] ("a party proper to Quebec") or as [...] "A clean party in Quebec". The Bloc won 54 seats in the House of Commons, tying its previous record from the 1993 campaign. For the 2006 election, the Bloc used the slogan Heureusement, ici, c'est le Bloc! ("Fortunately, the Bloc is here!"). The Bloc were expected to easily win more than 60 seats {{at the start of}} the campaign, and they did in fact take six seats from the Liberals. However, the unexpected surge of the new Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada in parts <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> particularly in and around Quebec City, led to the Bloc losing eight seats to the Tories. Coupled with an additional loss to André Arthur, an independent candidate, the Bloc recorded a net loss of three seats.|$|R
25|$|Position of many federalists from English-speaking Canada and Quebec. Seen as {{the only}} way to avoid the secession of Quebec. Since the rise of the {{sovereignty}} movement, this option seems to gather a solid 40% of support among Quebec voters. Efforts to reform the Canadian constitution in order recognize Quebec's specificity (or distinct society) and provide a means to accommodate its need for greater autonomy have resulted in the Meech Lake Accord which collapsed before it came into effect and the Charlottetown Accord which was rejected by a majority of Canadians and also a majority of Quebecers in referendum in 1992. The option is still supported, with more or less of energy, by the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Quebec, the New Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> and {{the federal}} NDP agreed in 1989 to sever their {{structural}} ties after the Quebec party adopted the sovereigntist platform. Since then, the federal NDP is not integrated with a provincial party in that province; instead, it has a section, the Nouveau Parti démocratique-Section Québec/New Democratic Party Quebec Section, whose activities in the province are limited to the federal level, whereas on the provincial level its members are individually free to support or adhere to any party. However, following the 2011 election, it was announced the NDP planned on recreating a provincial party in Quebec {{in time for the}} next Quebec general election. While the party was registered with the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec, it failed to nominate any candidates.|$|E
25|$|The federalist nationalists are nationalists {{who believe}} it {{is best for the}} people of Quebec to reform the Canadian {{confederation}} in order to accommodate the wish of Quebecers to continue to exist as a distinct society by its culture, its history, its language, and so on. They recognize the existence of the Quebec political (or civic) nation; however, they do not think Quebecers truly wish to be independent from the rest of Canada. Before the arrival of the Parti Québécois, all major Quebec parties were federalist and nationalist. Since then, the party most associated with this view is the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec.</b> On two occasions, federalist nationalists of Quebec attempted to reform the Canadian federation together with allies in other provinces. The 1990 Meech Lake Accord and the 1992 Charlottetown Accord were both ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|His brother, Pierre Paradis, is {{a veteran}} Liberal <b>Party</b> member <b>of</b> the <b>Quebec</b> National Assembly and a provincial cabinet minister. The Paradis {{brothers}} are political allies.|$|R
50|$|In January 1994, {{he became}} leader <b>of</b> the <b>Quebec</b> Liberal <b>Party</b> and Premier <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Liberal leader Robert Bourassa. He then lost the 1994 provincial election to Jacques Parizeau of the Parti Québécois.|$|R
50|$|In August 2011, Mendès {{announced}} her candidacy {{for the presidency}} <b>of</b> the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada. She was defeated in her race for the presidency by Mike Crawley, but remained a committed member <b>of</b> the <b>party,</b> making appearances on CTV and CBC's Power and Politics representing the party. In June 2012, Mendès became President <b>of</b> the Liberal <b>Party's</b> <b>Quebec</b> wing, the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada (<b>Quebec).</b>|$|R
500|$|Parizeau's {{resignation}} led to Bouchard {{becoming the}} leader of the PQ and Premier unopposed. While Bouchard maintained a third referendum was forthcoming provided [...] "winning conditions" [...] occurred, his government's chief priority became reform of the Quebec economy. Daniel Johnson would resign as leader of the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> and after significant pressure in English Canada, Charest resigned as national PC leader and was acclaimed as leader of the Quebec Liberals. Bouchard would defeat Charest in the 1998 election, and subsequently continue his government's focus on austerity.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout these {{constant}} frictions {{between the}} federal government and the provincial government, the Quebec nationalist movement transformed itself into an independence movement. The Ralliement national (RN), led by Gilles Grégoire, and the Rassemblement pour l'indépendance nationale (RIN), led by Pierre Bourgault and Hubert Aquin, were founded in 1960 and quickly became political parties. In [...] 1967, René Lévesque, who until then had been a leading figure in the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> quit the Liberals to found the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association (MSA).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} premiership, discontent inside the Liberal Party became evident. The more [...] "radical" [...] left {{wing of the party}} left the Liberals and formed a new party, the Action libérale nationale. [...] Paul Gouin, the son of Lomer Gouin and {{grandson}} of Honoré Mercier, joined this new party. Later, the Action Libérale Nationale merged with the Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> to form the Union Nationale party under the leadership of Maurice Duplessis, who had become famous by exposing the Taschereau cabinet's misdeeds before the Accounts Committee of the Legislative Assembly.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Socreds elected Lorne Reznowski {{as their}} leader, {{in an attempt}} to revive the <b>party</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>Quebec.</b> Reznowski, an anglophone Manitoban, {{presented}} himself as a candidate in the October 16, 1978, by-elections and fared extremely poorly with 2.76% of votes in the riding of Saint Boniface. He resigned quickly thereafter and replaced as acting leader by Charles-Arthur Gauthier.|$|R
50|$|He won {{a seat in}} the Quebec Legislative Assembly in 1875 but the {{election}} was overturned a year later. He served as president <b>of</b> the Conservative <b>Party</b> Association <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> for several years and was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1878 as a Conservative representing Montmagny, Quebec. He was re-elected in the 1882 election but was defeated in 1887.|$|R
50|$|Born in La Patrie, Quebec, {{he studied}} law and was {{admitted}} to the Bar <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> in 1909. Active in the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada in <b>Quebec,</b> he was called to the Canadian Senate in 1940 representing the senatorial division <b>of</b> Rougemont, <b>Quebec.</b> He died in office in 1954. From 1949 to 1953, he was the Speaker of the Canadian Senate.|$|R
2500|$|By 1909, Laurier {{had been}} able to build the Liberal Party a base in Quebec, which had {{remained}} a Conservative stronghold for decades due to the province's social conservatism and to the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, which distrusted the Liberals' anti-clericalism. The growing alienation of French-Canadians from the Conservative Party due to its links with anti-French, anti-Catholic Orangemen in English Canada aided the Liberal Party. [...] These factors, combined {{with the collapse of the}} Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec,</b> gave Laurier an opportunity to build a stronghold in French Canada and among Catholics across Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Groulx {{and other}} intellectuals {{settled into a}} partial {{alliance}} with Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> leader Adelard Godbout, who served as Premier from 1939 to 1944. They soon broke with him {{on account of his}} submission to the federal Liberals. Yet in 1944 they opposed Duplessis [...] again, this time placing their hopes in another new party, the Bloc populaire Canadien, led by André Laurendeau. Future Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau was part of this young party, which soon suffered the same fate as the previous third party, the ALN. After the 1948 election, the Bloc populaire Canadien disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s the party finally {{overturned}} the padlock law giving new energy {{and hope to}} the party despite difficult times with the Khrushchev revelations and the continued pressure of the Cold War. Moving to better put into practice what it saw as a deeper political understanding of the national question, the CPC in Quebec re-organized as the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> in November 1965, reflecting what it now termed the multi-national reality of Canada as [...] "a state {{with more than one}} nation within its borders". The PCQ emerged as a [...] "distinct entity" [...] of the CPC, with shared membership and, at the same time, full control over its policies and administration including its own constitution.|$|E
50|$|Born in Montreal, Quebec, {{she was the}} {{president}} <b>of</b> the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada in <b>Quebec</b> and the riding association of Mount Royal, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's riding. She {{was appointed to the}} senate on 26 March 1979 on the recommendation of Pierre Trudeau. She represented the senatorial division <b>of</b> Montarville, <b>Quebec</b> until her resignation on 31 January 1999.|$|R
50|$|The Bloc Québécois, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Gilles Duceppe, lost its position of Official Opposition, falling to third place. Duceppe, who lacked the charisma of his predecessor Lucien Bouchard, nonetheless made progress by emphasizing the lack of possibility of constitutional reform. The <b>party</b> captured 44 <b>of</b> <b>Quebec's</b> 75 seats.|$|R
50|$|Trépanier {{supported}} Daniel Johnson's successful bid {{to succeed}} Robert Bourassa as leader <b>of</b> the <b>Quebec</b> Liberal <b>Party</b> and premier <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> in January 1994. When Johnson became premier on January 11, 1994, he appointed Trépanier {{to a full}} cabinet position as minister of revenue security. She also retained ministerial responsibility for {{the status of women}} and the family.|$|R
2500|$|The {{debate about}} Québécois {{nationhood}} centres {{on the question}} of the status of the province of Quebec and its primarily French-speaking population. During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, the term Québécois largely replaced French Canadian as an expression of cultural and nationalist identity as French Canadians asserted themselves culturally. The modern Québécois identity is secular and based on a social democratic ideal of the Quebec State promoting Quebec French culture and language in the arts, education, and business within the province. Politically, this resulted in a movement towards more provincial autonomy. Quebec federalists in the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> argued for more autonomy within Canada, while Quebec sovereigntists, mostly within the Parti Québécois, argued for outright independence from Canada. Quebec nationalists increasingly referred to provincial institutions as being [...] "national", changing the name of the provincial [...] "Legislative Assembly" [...] to the [...] "National Assembly of Quebec" [...] in 1968, for example.|$|E
2500|$|Premier Maurice Duplessis and his Union Nationale party {{emerged from}} the ashes of the Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quebec</b> and the Paul Gouin's Action libérale {{nationale}} in the 1930s. This political lineage dates back to the 1850s Parti bleu of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, a center-right party in Quebec that emphasized provincial autonomy and allied itself with Conservatives in English Canada. Under his government, the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches maintained the control they previously gained over social services such as schools and hospitals. The authoritarian Duplessis used the provincial police and the [...] "Padlock Law" [...] to suppress unionism and gave the Montreal-based Anglo-Scot business elite, as well as British and American capital a free rein in running the Quebec economy. His government also continued to attempt to prevent circulation of books banned by the Catholic Church, combated communism and even tried to shut down other Christian religions like the [...] Jehovah's Witnesses who evangelized in French Canada. The clergy used its influence to exhort Catholic voters to continue electing with the Union Nationale and threaten to excommunicate sympathisers of liberal ideas. For the time it lasted, the Duplessis regime resisted the North American and European trend of massive State investment in education, health, and social programs, turning away federal transfers of funds earmarked for these fields; he jealously guarded provincial jurisdictions. [...] Common parlance speaks of these years as [...] "La Grande Noirceur" [...] The Great Darkness, as in the first scenes of the film Maurice Richard.|$|E

He began his involvement in northern Quebec in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its operations, the group was {{composed}} of businessmen and political organizers of three federalist political parties - the Liberal <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada, the <b>Quebec</b> Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada. The president of Option Canada was Claude Dauphin, an aide to Paul Martin, at the time Canadian minister of finance.|$|R
50|$|Ouimet, {{a strong}} sovereigntist, {{maintained}} a <b>party</b> wholly independent <b>of</b> the federal Greens during his leadership; {{as a result}} Bramann created an organization called the Green <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> Canada in <b>Quebec,</b> a predominantly Anglophone entity that nominated federal candidates only. There was open antipathy between Ouimet and Bramann. Neither was affiliated with Écologie-Montreal.|$|R
