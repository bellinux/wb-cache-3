40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Belgian {{third-party}} payer {{wishes to}} set reimbursement tariffs {{at a level}} that reflects the costs of orthotic braces. This article aims to calculate production and distribution costs of a prefabricated hard neck and knee brace and to explore whether Belgian tariffs and actual retail prices correspond with estimated costs of these two braces. METHODS: The cost model considered manufacturing costs, general overheads, research and development costs, warehousing costs, profit and distribution margins. Data were gathered from manufacturers, a production site visit, desk research, a decomposition of finished products and stakeholder interviews. The price year was 2007. RESULTS: The cost model estimated a retail <b>price</b> of <b>euro</b> 55 -euro 150 for the neck brace, depending on assumptions. The estimated retail price for the neck brace was lower than the reimbursement tariff of euro 194 and the actual retail <b>price</b> of <b>euro</b> 241. The estimated retail <b>price</b> of <b>euro</b> 331 -euro 694 for the knee brace was lower than the actual retail <b>price</b> of <b>euro</b> 948. CONCLUSIONS: Actual retail prices and reimbursement tariffs for a neck brace and a knee brace exceeded prices based on estimated costs. Therefore, there appears to be scope for reducing tariffs. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The Dutch {{changeover}} to {{euro banknotes}} and coins proceeded both remarkably smoothly and rapidly. After one week, over 90 % of all cash payments {{were being made}} in euro. Fears of the payment system breaking down, always rampant among businesses and the public alike, did not materialise. Fears of price rises on the other hand, were not entirely unfounded, as evidenced by a survey held by the Bank among retailers in January. The changeover from guilders to euro has pushed consumer prices up by 0. 2 - 0. 4 %, in part because retailers passed the ensuing costs on to their customers, but also because prices were rounded up towards attractive <b>euro</b> <b>prices.</b> In time, {{the introduction of the}} euro willpresumably lead to lower <b>prices.</b> <b>Euro</b> cash-changeover; survey; <b>price</b> impact of cash-changeover...|$|R

40|$|Currently, nearly 90 % of all {{prices of}} {{consumer}} goods and services in the Netherlands are psychological, conveniently broken or round prices. After converting these `attractive' guilder <b>prices</b> into <b>euro</b> using the official conversion rate, the resulting <b>euro</b> <b>prices</b> are generally not attractive. The Dutch public is concerned that retailers will not round their <b>euro</b> <b>prices</b> symmetrically upwards and downwards to the next attractive pricing point but only upwards? This paper investigates the question `What would be {{the effect on the}} consumer price index (CPI) if prices were systematically rounded upwards'. Firstly, the attractive pricing points are determined empirically using the actual price sample underlying the Dutch CPI. Secondly, different rounding scenarios are investigated and the likelihood of the worst-case scenario is discussed. It turns out that the euro introduction may cause an increase of the CPI by 0. 7 % at most. However, due to competition in the retail sector, this scenario is very unlikely.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis group B {{are among}} the main causes of {{invasive}} bacterial meningitis infections in infants. Worldwide, these diseases lead to significant mortality, morbidity and costs. The societal impact is especially severe since {{the majority of cases}} occur in very young infants. A combination vaccine consisting of 9 -valent conjugated pneumococcal and meningococcal B components is currently being developed. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the potential impact and cost effectiveness from the societal perspective of vaccinating infants in The Netherlands with this combination pneumococcal and meningococcal B vaccine versus no vaccination. A Markov cycle model was developed using epidemiological and healthcare resource use data from 1996 to 2001. This model was used to project the annual costs, benefits and health gains associated with vaccinating all newborns. The base year for the costing was 2003 and all costs and health effects were discounted at 4 %. The results of the analysis are expressed in costs per QALY and both probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses were used to identify the robustness of the results. Annually, an average of 755 cases of invasive pneumococcal and meningococcal B infection occurred in infants aged 0 - 10 years in The Netherlands. Introduction of the combination vaccine would prevent 201 cases of meningococcal B meningitis and 165 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease per year. Additionally, 3410 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia and 46, 350 cases of otitis media would be prevented. Vaccination would save 35 lives per year and prevent 71 cases of severe sequelae. This translates into 860 life-years gained, or 1128 QALYs gained. Alongside these health gains, vaccination would prevent euro 17, 681, 370 of direct medical and indirect costs attributable to meningococcal and pneumococcal infections in The Netherlands. Depending on vaccine price, cost effectiveness varied from <b>euro</b> 3160 (vaccine <b>price</b> per dose <b>euro</b> 20) to euro 32, 170 (vaccine <b>price</b> <b>euro</b> 60 per dose) per QALY. Base-case cost effectiveness (vaccine <b>price</b> <b>euro</b> 40) was euro 17, 700 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to changes in incidence, vaccine price and duration of protective efficacy. Our results suggest that the introduction of a combination meningococcal B and pneumococcal vaccine into the Dutch infant vaccination programme is potentially cost effective compared with no vaccinatio...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 70 % of Belgian {{consumer}} prices {{are to be}} considered as attractive prices, namely psychological prices, fractional prices - i. e. prices which are convenient to pay - and round prices. Conversion of these <b>prices</b> into <b>euro</b> generally leads to prices which are no longer attractive {{and it is very}} likely that retailers will round their <b>prices</b> to attractive <b>euro</b> <b>prices.</b> The public fears that rounding will be upward rather than symmetric. This paper simulates in the first instance a worst-case scenario, whereby all attractive BEF prices are systematically rounded up to the nearest attractive <b>euro</b> <b>price.</b> The effect on the consumer price index ranges from 0. 54 to 0. 72 %. Such a scenario is however very unlikely, as factors such as competition on product markets, the currently prevailing demand conditions, the commitments made by organisations representing the enterprise sector and the vigilant attitude of consumers restrain the possibility of rounding up. In order to obtain a more realistic picture, the paper investigates in a second step whether rounding-up effects were found after the major change in VAT rates in April 1992. These effects seem marginal, although it should be acknowledged that it was difficult to isolate rounding effects from regular price changes. Any ex post assessment of the euro changeover will face a similar identification problem. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} impact of oil shocks on euro-area {{macroeconomic}} variables by estimating a new-Keynesian small open economy model with Bayesian methods. Oil price is determined according to supply and demand conditions in the world oil market. We find that the impact of an increase in the price of oil depends upon the underlying sources of variation: when the driver of higher oil prices is an increase {{in the rest of the}} world’s aggregate demand, both euro-area GDP and CPI inflation increase, whereas negative oil supply shocks and positive worldwide oil-specific demand shocks have stagflationary effects on the euro-area economy. Moreover, the increase in oil prices during the 2004 - 2008 period did not induce stagflationary effects on the euro-area economy because it was associated with positive aggregate demand shocks in the rest of the world. Similarly, a drop in world aggregate demand helps to explain the recent (2008) simultaneous drop in oil <b>prices,</b> <b>euro</b> area GDP and inflation - particularly its fuel component...|$|R

In the first, conducted in December 2004, 202 students were first presented with high or low anchor values and then estimated the average price of a ‘‘new Turkish mid-sized car’’ in different currencies (TL, NTL and Euro). Although anchoring bias was not significantly different across familiar (TL) and unfamiliar currencies (NTL and <b>Euro),</b> <b>price</b> estimates in <b>Euro</b> and NTL were significantly higher than those in TL. In the second experiment, carried out 6 months later, 212 adult consumers estimated the prices of 13 items in one of three currencies.

However, {{there were no significant differences}} between TL and NTL, suggesting that Turkish consumers had quickly adapted.
