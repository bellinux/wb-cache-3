When applied to a bus-based network, this central hub re-broadcasts all transmissions received from any <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> to all peripheral nodes on the network, sometimes including the originating node. All peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the central node only.

50|$|The star {{topology}} reduces {{the probability of}} a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes (computers, etc.) to a central node.

The failure of a transmission line linking any <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> to the central node will result in the isolation of that <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> from all others, but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected. However, the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes.|$|E

50|$|Blood endothelial cells (BECs) are {{specialized}} vascular endothelial cells. In the thymus, they {{line the}} high endothelial venules where lymphocytes originate.

50|$|In a {{small world}} network with a degree {{distribution}} following a power-law, deletion of a random node rarely causes {{a dramatic increase in}} mean-shortest path length (or a dramatic decrease in the clustering coefficient). This follows from the fact that most shortest paths between nodes flow through hubs, and if a <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> is deleted it is unlikely to interfere with passage between other peripheral nodes. As the fraction of peripheral nodes in {{a small world}} network is much higher than the fraction of hubs, the probability of deleting an important node is very low. For example, if the small airport in Sun Valley, Idaho was shut down, it would not increase the average number of flights that other passengers traveling in the United States would have to take to arrive at their respective destinations. However, if random deletion of a node hits a hub by chance, the average path length can increase dramatically. This can be observed annually when northern hub airports, such as Chicago's O'Hare airport, are shut down because of snow; many people have to take additional flights.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stochastic}} dynamics of strongly-coupled excitable elements {{on a tree}} network. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>nodes</b> receive independent random inputs which may induce large spiking events propagating through {{the branches of the}} tree and leading to global coherent oscillations in the network. This scenario may be relevant to action potential generation in certain sensory neurons, which possess myelinated distal dendritic tree-like arbors with excitable nodes of Ranvier at <b>peripheral</b> and branching <b>nodes</b> and exhibit noisy periodic sequences of action potentials. We focus on the spiking statistics of the central node, which fires in response to a noisy input at <b>peripheral</b> <b>nodes.</b> We show that, in the strong coupling regime, relevant to myelinated dendritic trees, the spike train statistics can be predicted from an isolated excitable element with rescaled parameters according to the network topology. Furthermore, we show that by varying the network topology the spike train statistics of the central node can be tuned to have a certain firing rate and variability, or to allow for an optimal discrimination of inputs applied at the <b>peripheral</b> <b>nodes.</b> Comment: 15 pages 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|The term “peripheral node addressins” {{describes}} {{a set of}} several endothelial adhesion molecules, which collectively bind to L-selectin and react with monoclonal antibody MECA- 79. They regulate lymphocyte recirculation through peripheral nodes. Their expression {{is thought to be}} restricted to a specialized vascular segment within the node, called the high endothelial venule. In certain chronic skin diseases, however, postcapillary venules of the skin may also acquire a high endothelial venule-like morphology. Employing immunohistochemistry on cryostat sections, we found these skin endothelial cells – like <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> high endothelial venules – to be reactive with monoclonal antibody MECA- 79. Tissue lysates from the same specimens were then analyzed by immunoprecipitation using recombinant human L-selectin Fc-chimeras followed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody MECA- 79. In contrast to <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> endothelium, which mainly expressed <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> addressin moieties of molecular sizes 90 – 110 kDa and 160 kDa, endothelial cells in cutaneous T cell lymphoma skin lesions expressed an additional and not yet defined 220 kDa <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> addressin-like molecule. Most surprisingly, even in normal skin specimens, we found a distinct subset of endothelial cells located around hair follicles constitutively expressing 90 – 110 kDa <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> addressin-like moieties. It is intriguing to speculate that – in analogy to the role of <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> addressins in peripheral nodes – the induced expression of <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> addressins in chronic T cell mediated skin diseases is responsible for a sustained lymphocyte recruitment.

40|$|A {{network with}} core-periphery {{structure}} consists of core nodes that are densely interconnected. In contrast to community structure, {{which is a}} different meso-scale structure of networks, core nodes can be connected to <b>peripheral</b> <b>nodes</b> and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nodes</b> are not densely interconnected. Although core-periphery structure sounds reasonable, we {{argue that it is}} merely accounted for by heterogeneous degree distributions, if one partitions a network into a single core block and a single periphery block, which the famous Borgatti-Everett algorithm and many succeeding algorithms assume. In other words, there is a strong tendency that high-degree and low-degree nodes are judged to be core and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nodes,</b> respectively. To discuss core-periphery structure beyond the expectation of the node's degree (as described by the configuration model), we propose that one needs to assume at least one block of nodes apart from the focal core-periphery structure, such as a different core-periphery pair, community or nodes not belonging to any meso-scale structure. We propose a scalable algorithm to detect pairs of core and periphery in networks, controlling for the effect of the node's degree. We illustrate our algorithm using various empirical networks.

40|$|Selectin-ligand {{interactions}} (bonds) mediate leukocyte {{rolling on}} vascular surfaces. The molecular basis for differential ligand recognition by selectins is poorly understood. Here, {{we show that}} substituting one residue (A 108 H) in the lectin domain of L-selectin increased its force-free affinity for a glycosulfopeptide binding site (2 -GSP- 6) on P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1 (PSGL- 1) but not for a sulfated-glycan binding site (6 -sulfo-sialyl Lewis x) on <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> addressin. The increased affinity of L-selectinA 108 H for 2 -GSP- 6 was due to a faster on-rate and to a slower off-rate that increased bond lifetimes {{in the absence of}} force. Rather than first prolonging (catching) and then shortening (slipping) bond lifetimes, increasing force monotonically shortened lifetimes of L-selectinA 108 H bonds with 2 -GSP- 6. When compared with microspheres bearing L-selectin, L-selectinA 108 H microspheres rolled more slowly and regularly on 2 -GSP- 6 at low flow rates. A reciprocal substitution in P-selectin (H 108 A) caused faster microsphere rolling on 2 -GSP- 6. These results distinguish molecular mechanisms for L-selectin to bind to PSGL- 1 and <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> addressin and explain in part the shorter lifetimes of PSGL- 1 bonds with L-selectin than P-selectin...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{cognitive}} function of brain tumor patients is affected during the treatment. There {{is evidence that}} gliomas and surgery alter the functional brain connectivity but studies on the longitudinal effects are lacking. Methods: We acquired longitudinal (pre- and post-radiotherapy) resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} on three selected glioblastoma patients. These cases were selected to study three models: a lesion involving a functional hub within a central system, a lesion involving a <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> within a central system and a lesion involving a <b>peripheral</b> <b>node</b> of a non-central system. Results: We found that, as expected, the tumor lesion affects connections in close vicinity, but when the lesion relates to a functional hub, these changes involve long-range connections leading to diverse connectivity profiles pre- and post-radiotherapy. In particular, a global but temporary improvement in the post-radiotherapy connectivity was obtained when treating a lesion close to a network hub, such as the posterior Cingulate Cortex. Conclusions: This suggests that this node re-establishes communication to nodes further away in the network. Eventually, these observed effects seem to be transient and on the long-term the tumor burden leads to an overall decline of connectivity following the course of the pathology. Furthermore, we obtained that the link between hubs, such as the Supplementary Motor Area and posterior Cingulate Cortex represents an important backbone by means of which within and across network communication is handled: the disruption of this connection seems to imply a strong decrease in the overall connectivity...|$|E
