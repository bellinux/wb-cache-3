Samples were milled and pasting properties were evaluated. There were marked differences in pasting characteristics which {{were attributed to}} the pH of the <b>starch</b> <b>pearls.</b> The milled alkaline <b>starch</b> <b>pearls</b> showed high cold paste viscosities and setback ratios while the acidic milled starch had low cold paste viscosities and setback ratios. Furthermore, in alkaline milled starch, the addition of sugar drastically lowered the setback ratios while the setback ratios of the milled acidic starches were minimally affected. From the laboratory preparation of <b>starch</b> <b>pearls</b> from commercial tuber starches (potato and cassava), {{it appeared that the}} process of pearling effected a mild starch modification which increased the stability ratio of the milled <b>starch</b> <b>pearl</b> compared to the unprocessed starch. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

40|$|<b>Starch</b> <b>pearls</b> are {{extremely}} {{sensitive to the}} rate of drying. Fast drying leads to poor quality of final cooked (rehydrated) products. The objectives {{of this study were}} to reduce the lengthy drying time by incorporating low-power microwave finish drying and to evaluate the rehydrated quality of <b>starch</b> <b>pearls.</b> The effects of temperature and relative humidity on the drying rates of <b>starch</b> <b>pearls</b> in the constant-rate period were determined. When evaluating the saving of time, microwave energy efficiency and rehydration quality, the best results were obtained when combined natural convection and microwave finish drying were carried out at low power levels (119 - 143 W). Microwave finish drying reduced the natural convective drying time by about 50 - 75 %, with an improvement in quality, as indicated by higher unbroken ratio, less cooking loss and shorter cooking time...|$|R
5000|$|Sago [...] is a starch {{extracted}} from the spongy centre, or pith, of various tropical palm stems, especially that of Metroxylon sagu. It is a major staple food for the lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Moluccas, where it is called saksak, rabia and sagu. The largest supply of sago comes from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. Large quantities of sago are sent to Europe and North America for cooking purposes. It is traditionally cooked and eaten in various forms, such as rolled into balls, mixed with boiling water to form a glue-like paste (papeda), or as a pancake. Sago is often produced commercially {{in the form of}} [...] "pearls" [...] (small rounded starch aggregates, partly gelatinized by heating). Sago pearls can be boiled with water or milk and sugar to make a sweet sago pudding. Sago pearls are similar in appearance as the <b>pearled</b> <b>starches</b> of other origin, e.g. cassava starch (tapioca) and potato starch, and they may be used interchangeably in some dishes.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, making <b>starch</b> <b>pearls</b> uses a {{different}} process of roasting. To form the pearls, the tapioca grit {{can be cut}} or extruded {{into the shape of}} pearls, either small (3mm) or large (6-8mm). The pearls are subjected to a form of heat-moisture treatment, which can extend shelf life up to 2 years.|$|R

40|$|Slow release {{formulations}} of acephate and carbofuran encapsulated in <b>pearl</b> corn­ <b>starch</b> or corn flour granules {{were applied to}} the soil at seeding time of potted 2 ̆ 7 Caldwell 2 ̆ 7 wheat in the laboratory. Dosages of these insecticides were adjusted to a standard of IO kg/ha of a 102 ̆ 210 granular formulation of carbofuran. The residual action of these insecticide treatments against Rhopalosiphum padi were compared with those obtained with that of carbofuran 150 at corresponding dosages and foliar sprays of solutions of acephate (252 ̆ 210 EC) at 0. 22 ̆ 210 and carbofuran (4 F) at 1. 252 ̆ 210, applied 12 d after seedling emergence. The residual action of carbofuran 150, which controlled R. padi since seedling emergence, lasted 28. 5 d. The slow release granular {{formulations of}} carbofuran began to provide control (3 ̆e 502 ̆ 210 aphid mortality) on days 13. 3 and 17. 9 after seeding. They controlled the insect until days 31. 6 and 35. 5 after seeding. The two corresponding granular formulations of acephate began to provide control on days 15. 0 and 17. 0 after seeding and con­ trolled the aphids until days 31. 5 and 32. 8 after seeding. The foliar sprays of acephate and carbofuran provided control for 18. 3 and 36. 2 d from application, respectively. The slow release granular formulations provided control of R. padi, an important vector of barley yellow dwarf virus, during early. stages of wheat development...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} were synthesized by gel-combustion method using a novel bio-fuel tapioca <b>starch</b> <b>pearls,</b> {{derived from}} the tubers of Mannihot esculenta, to investigate the photocatalytic degradation of ccaffeine. The ZnO photocatalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-visible spectroscopy. X-ray diffractometry result for the ZnO nanoparticles exhibit normal crystalline phase features. All observed peaks {{can be indexed to}} the pure hexagonal wurtzite crystal structures. There are no other impurities in the diffraction peak. In addition, SEM measurement shows that most of the nanoparticles are spongy and spherical in shape and fairly mono dispersed. A significant degradation of the Caffeine was observed when the catalyst was added into the solution even without the UV light exposure. In addition, the photo degradation increaseds with the photocatalyst loading. Besides the photocatalyst loading, the effect of some parameters on the photo degradation efficiency such as initial concentration and pH were also studied...|$|R
40|$|Skim milk was ultrafiltered {{to three}} lactose/protein ratios and spray dried. The skim milk powder was {{extruded}} with <b>pearled</b> corn <b>starch</b> at different moisture contents, protein contents, lactose/protein ratios, and feed rates (control variables). Response surface methodology and a central composite in cube experimental design were used. This design required 30 experimental runs with 16 factorial points, 8 axial points, and 6 center points for replication. The physical and functional properties evaluated were expansion ratio, product temperature, bulk density, color, shear stress, viscosity, and water absorption index (response variables). Scanning electron microscopy {{was done to}} evaluate the microstructural attributes of the extrudates. A quadratic model was used to express the response variables {{in terms of the}} control variables. Response surfaces were generated by assigning center point values to 2 of the 4 control variables and then solving the fitted equations as a quadratic in the remaining 2 control variables. An increase in moisture content decreased expansion ratio, product temperature, color, and water absorption index, and increased bulk density, shear stress, and viscosity. An increase in protein content decreased product temperature, shear stress, viscosity, and water absorption index, increased color, and had no effect on expansion ratio and bulk density. An increase in lactose/protein ratio decreased product temperature, viscosity, and water absorption index, and had no effect on expansion ratio, bulk density, color, and shear stress. Feed rate did not have significant individual effect on any response variable. Expansion ratio had a negative correlation with bulk density (r = - 0. 61) and shear stress (r = - 0. 62) and a positive correlation with product temperature (r = 0. 52). Bulk density and shear stress were positively correlated (r = 0. 69), and product temperature and water absorption index were positively correlated too (r = 0. 81). Expansion ratio, bulk density, color, and shear stress were chosen to determine a combined set of extrusion conditions most likely to produce an extrudate with properties suitable for a snack-type product...|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, the {{processing}} of sago starch predates that of cassava, having been established before 1416. With its introduction, cassava, which is a much shorter term crop, quickly replaced sago palm as the preferred raw material among starch processors. Hence, except for a small amount serving the fresh food market, cassava is planted in Malaysia mainly for starch processing. The cassava area in Peninsular Malaysia has declined steadily to 1, 631 ha in 1997 after peaking in 1976 at 20, 913 ha. This decline {{is due to the}} curbing of illegal cultivation; land alienation policy with a bias against cassava; switching from cassava to more lucrative crops; rising costs of production; low prevailing price for cassava roots; and competition for land for agricultural and non-agricultural activities during the economic boom prior to July 1997. Of the eight starch factories reported in Perak in 1984, only two are still in operation. Recently, in Sabah, a starch factory opened to process roots supplied through contract farming from an area of more than 3, 000 ha. In trade, cassava starch takes the form of flour, flakes, <b>pearls</b> and <b>starch</b> powder. There is a growing demand for starch with imports amounting to 88, 210 tonnes in 1997. Most of this starch is used in food industries, particularly for making monosodium glutamate (using about 3, 000 tonnes of starch per month). Other significant users are manufacturers of glucose, bakery and biscuit products, textiles and paper. There is also increasing interest in growing edible varieties of cassava for processing into snacks. The future potential in terms of domestic demand for cassava starch is very good. Since the onset of the economic downturn faced by Southeast Asia, the Malaysian government has actively encouraged agriculture (to offset the country’s huge food import bill amounting to almost US$ 2. 9 billion a year) by providing easier access to farmland. There is recent renewed enthusiasm for planting cassava for production of starch, dried chips for livestock feed and sweeteners (high fructose glucose syrup or HFGS). For large-scale mechanized cassava production, certain prerequisites of soil type, terrain, climate and farm size matching the factory’s capacity, must be satisfied. While land is hard to come by in Peninsular Malaysia, more than 80, 000 ha of land are still available in Sabah. Starch is the most likely product to be feasible and profitable in the immediate future compared to dried chips and HFGS production, because of a high demand in the local market, and a well-established technology for starch processing. Stable, high-yielding varieties with intermediate to high starch content to ensure higher starch recovery are required; better still if they can be harvested early. The potential of using cassava as a carbohydrate-rich animal feedstuff is promising, but being low in protein compared to maize, additional protein is required from another source, entailing extra costs. Also, it is costly to dry cassava by artificial means. Although it is technically possible to produce HFGS from cassava, it involves converting starch by enzymatic processes – a complicated and expensive procedure. This does not seem economically feasible in the immediate future, given the current low world price for sugar. Instead, modified starches and their products have very good future potential as profitable agro-based industries. Modification of starches not only expands their scope of utilization by altering their physico-chemical characteristics, but also increases their value as compared to native starch. An alternative use of cassava, which has some prospects, is the production of snack foods. Although oil-fried crisps and crackers are traditional snacks produced by cottage industries, only recently have attempts been made by larger food processors to improve their quality and packaging, and to target the more up-market urban consumer and overseas market. Preliminary work at MARDI has shown that cassava makes a very good raw material for extruded snacks...|$|R
