5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated {{with the idea of}} a Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. <b>Put</b> <b>simply,</b> success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E

To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E

25|$|What {{is often}} {{confusing}} about the Celsius measurement {{is that it}} follows an interval system but not a ratio system; that it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale. This is <b>put</b> <b>simply</b> by illustrating that while 10°C and 20°C have the same interval difference as 20°C and 30°C the temperature 20°C is not twice the air heat energy as 10°C. As this example shows, degrees Celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Put</b> <b>simply,</b> ion {{suppression}} {{describes the}} {{adverse effect on}} detector response due to reduced ionisation efficiency for analyte(s) of interest, resulting from the presence of species in the sample matrix which compete for ionisation, or inhibit efficient ionisation in other ways. Use of MS/MS {{as a means of}} detection may give the impression that there are no interfering species present, since no chromatographic impurities are detected. However, species which are not isobaric may still have an adverse effect on the sensitivity, accuracy and precision of the assay owing to suppression of the ionisation of the analyte of interest.|$|E
25|$|Red figure is, <b>put</b> <b>simply,</b> {{the reverse}} of the black figure technique. Both were {{achieved}} by using the three-phase firing technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In Attica, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy clay slip. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.|$|E

25|$|Psychosis {{may involve}} {{delusional}} beliefs, {{some of which}} are paranoid in nature. <b>Put</b> <b>simply,</b> delusions are false beliefs that a person holds on to, without adequate evidence. It can be difficult to change the belief, even with evidence to the contrary. Common themes of delusions are persecutory (person believes that others are out to harm them), grandiose (person believing that they have special powers or skills), etc. Persons with Ekbom syndrome may have delusional beliefs of an imaginary parasite infestation, whereas depressed persons might have delusions consistent with their low mood (e.g., delusions that they have sinned, or have contracted serious illness, etc.). Karl Jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into primary and secondary types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions are typically understood as being influenced by the person's background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity; also religious, superstitious, or political beliefs).|$|E
500|$|Both towers share {{a similar}} three-petal {{triangular}} footprint for stability and a tapering form, with sheer height and wind being the biggest structural design challenge. The smooth, sloped façade of Kingdom Tower particularly induces a beneficial {{phenomenon known as}} [...] "wind vortex shedding," [...] whereas normally when wind swirls around the leeward side of a building, rushing in from both sides to fill the low pressure zone, it would create tornado-like vortices, which would rock the building {{from side to side}} due to variations in pressure, direction, and velocity, the dynamic façade of Kingdom Tower creates an infinite timing differential (whereas Burj Khalifa is limited by the number of steps) in air pressure exertion in any one particular direction, thus creating a more stable structure, as there is no broad area of outstanding pressure or depression at any given time. <b>Put</b> <b>simply,</b> a smooth taper is more aerodynamic than an irregular or jagged taper, while both are advantageous over rectangular geometries. At Jeddah Tower's height, it is considered essentially unfeasible to use a traditional square design.|$|E

Humble, genuinely engaging and passionate about public service, Mauboy, <b>put</b> <b>simply,</b> is really nice". Anna Byrne of the Herald Sun observed, [...] "It's clear this endearing unpretentiousness is not a fame facade.

500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics was {{the first}} edited {{collection}} devoted to the [...] "political turn in animal ethics", and the first [...] "book-length attempt at seeking to define the contours" [...] of this literature. The book engages with what the editors call [...] "animal political philosophy", which they identify as an academic literature at the meeting point of animal ethics, political philosophy and real-world but theory-driven politics. Wissenburg and Schlosberg posit that this literature, though at one time {{only a small part}} of more morally-focused animal ethics, has developed into a separate field of enquiry in its own right. They single out two key texts: Robert Garner's 2013 A Theory of Justice for Animals (Oxford University Press) and Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's 2011 Zoopolis (Oxford University Press). Recognising the editors' identification of the political turn in animal ethics, Garner, writing with Siobhan O'Sullivan and Alasdair Cochrane, argues that the literature is both made distinct and unified by its focus on justice; contributions to this literature, these authors argue, [...] "imagine how political institutions, structures and processes might be transformed so as to secure justice for both human and nonhuman animals. <b>Put</b> <b>simply,</b> the essential feature of the political turn is this constructive focus on justice." ...|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{to their}} {{domination}} by Alexander the Great, the Sogdians {{from the city}} of Marakanda (Samarkand) became dominant as traveling merchants, occupying a key position along the ancient Silk Road. They played {{an active role in the}} spread of faiths such as Manicheism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism along the Silk Road. The Chinese Sui Shu (Book of Sui) describes Sogdians as [...] "skilled merchants" [...] who attracted many foreign traders to their land to engage in commerce. They were described by the Chinese as born merchants, learning their commercial skills at an early age. It appears from sources, such as documents found by Sir Aurel Stein and others, that by the 4th century they may have monopolized trade between India and China. A letter written by Sogdian merchants dated 313 AD and found in the ruins of a watchtower in Gansu was intended to be sent to merchants in Samarkand, warning them that after Liu Cong of Han Zhao sacked Luoyang and the Jin emperor fled the capital, there was no worthwhile business there for Indian and Sogdian merchants. Furthermore, in 568 AD a Turko-Sogdian delegation travelled to the Roman emperor in Constantinople to obtain permission to trade and in the following years commercial activity between the states flourished. <b>Put</b> <b>simply,</b> the Sogdians dominated trade along the Silk Road from the 2nd century BC until the 10th century.|$|E

The two of them played bridge at nights while {{they waited for the}} Cosmotron to become available. Cronin had built a new kind of detector, a spark chamber spectrometer, and Fitch realized that it would be perfect for experiments with K mesons (now known as kaons), which Yale University physicist Robert Adair had suggested had interesting properties worth investigating. They could decay into either matter or antimatter. Along with two colleagues, James Christenson and René Turlay, they set up their experiment on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven. They discovered an unexpected result. The decay of neutral K mesons did not respect CP symmetry.

500|$|More recent {{research}} has revealed {{that it was only}} Dr Francisco who told the news people that Elvis apparently died of heart failure. In fact, the doctors [...] "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then. That would be a matter of weeks." [...] One of the examiners, Dr E.

[...] "Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [...] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments." [...] Therefore, Frank Coffey is of the opinion that a plausible cause of Elvis' death is [...] "a phenomenon called the Valsalva maneuver (essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppage— plausible because Elvis suffered constipation, a common reaction to drug use)..."
