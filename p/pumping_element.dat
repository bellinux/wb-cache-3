The <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> {{consists}} of a single helical rotor, which intermeshes with a double helical resilient stator, to create the moving cavities that transport the slurry. Both components suffer from weaL at different rates, due to relative sliding movement of the rotor to the stator, and the presence of the abrasives carried within the slurry. for a pump manufacturer to remain active in the market they must provide the customer with optimised material selection, for both wearing parts, at a competitive price. Wear is not an intrinsic material property and its value is dependent upon the conditions within each individual tribological system. In order to improve or optimise the wear life of a system, it is first vital to understand the complexity of the mechanisms that generate the material loss. This thesis achieves this goal, with specific reference to a pumping system, by analysing the wear mechanisms of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> components in progressive cavity pumps and evaluating how the wear severity changes with the system parameters. The in-depth study has enabled a new wear model to be proposed which describes how the behaviour of the abrasive particles contribute to the wearing process, in the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> of a progressive cavity pump. Hard particle laboratory wear tests were reviewed and assessed to determine their suitability for assessing the wear performance of rotor and stator materials. It was concluded that no one standard laboratory test was suitable and recommendations are given for two tribometers which specifically meet the tribological needs of the pumping syste...|$|E
40|$|Improved efficiency, better {{controllability}} and {{low noise}} {{are the most}} demanding features form a displacement machine now-a-days. Most of the conventional displacement machines are basically a reciprocating <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> controlled by valve plates or {{with the help of}} check valve [1]. This kind of hydraulic machines loose efficiency dramatically at partial displacement because all of the pistons remain at high pressure at the cycle time and due to pressure inside the piston leakage and shear losses increases. One approach to improve the efficiency of the displacement machine can be controlling each hydraulic piston by using programmable faster valves called digital valve. As the total displacement will be controlled digitally, the total system is called Digital Displacement Technology. In digital displacement machine it is possible to disconnect some of the pistons from the load and the piston will connect only with the low pressure side, minimizing losses due to leakage and shear. As the valve will control directly with digital controller it will eliminate the necessity of servo-hydraulic control required by conventional systems. Digital valves can open fully and close again with the input signal within one revaluation of the shaft, so it gives better control to the <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> results reduction in hysteresis and increase the linearity of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element.</b> In Digital Displacement machines by controlling the valves pistons are connected with the machine when pressure is equal, but in the traditional machines piston connection was pre-determined with the shaft angle. By doing the piston control efficiency of the machine will improve and the sound generates for the decompression flow will be reduced [17]. Also energy storage and recovery can be possible by using accumulator...|$|E

40|$|High {{stiffness}} / {{low mass}} materials or structures reduce structure weight in transportation, but show little inherent damping. A new composite material that exhibits high stiffness and high damping might reduce issues with vibration in mechanical systems and structures. The material comprises three constituents: negative springs, positive springs, and damping elements. These components help achieve high stiffness with passive adaptive response over a frequency range. When applying sinusoidal loads on the material, the positive/negative spring interface oscillates, but body is relatively steady. This material needs a damping element to dissipate the vibrational energy at the interface. This research proposes new damping elements with novel properties {{starting with the}} fluid <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> from the Synthetic Multifunctional Materials program. The low-hydraulic-radius hourglass (LHG) machine modified from Hawkins? original design provides high stiffness with a high damping ability. The LHG machine pumps a fluid and dissipates energy by viscous dissipation and mass transfer. This pumping creates a hysteresis effect that indicates the energy dissipation. Stacking LHG layers using Newtonian fluids in the LHG channel or a single layer using non-Newtonian fluids can produce passive adaptive damping through a frequency range. Shear thinning fluids placed in the LHG machine?s channel provide adaptive performance by changing their dynamic viscosity. Experiments show passive adaptive damping up to tan ? one with a shear thinning fluid from 0. 1 to 10 Hz. Computational fluid-solid interaction studies suggest a theoretical shear thinning fluid that produces high passive adaptive damping...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCytochrome c oxidase is a redox-driven proton pump which {{converts}} {{atmospheric oxygen}} to water and couples the oxygen reduction {{reaction to the}} creation of a membrane proton gradient. The structure of the enzyme has been solved; however, the mechanism of proton pumping is still poorly understood. Recent calculations from this group indicate that one of the histidine ligands of enzyme's CuB center, His 291, may play the role of the <b>pumping</b> <b>element.</b> In this paper, we report on the results of calculations that combined first principles DFT and continuum electrostatics to evaluate the energetics of the key energy generating step of the model—the transfer of the chemical proton to the binuclear center of the enzyme, where the hydroxyl group is converted to water, and the concerted expulsion of the proton from δ-nitrogen of His 291 ligand of CuB center. We show that the energy generated in this step is sufficient to push a proton against an electrochemical membrane gradient of about 200 mV. We have also re-calculated the pKa of His 291 for an extended model in which the whole Fea 3 –CuB center with their ligands is treated by DFT. Two different DFT functionals (B 3 LYP and PBE 0), and various dielectric models of the protein have been used in an attempt to estimate potential errors of the calculations. Although current methods of calculations do not allow unambiguous predictions of energetics in proteins within few pKa units, as required in this case, the present calculation provides further support for the proposed His 291 model of CcO pump and makes a specific prediction that could be targeted in the experimental test...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} a charge-insertion process that models the {{deprotonation}} of a histidine side chain {{in the active}} site of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) using both the continuum electrostatic calculations and the microscopic simulations. The group of interest is a ligand to CuB center of CcO, which has been previously suggested {{to play the role}} of the proton <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> in the enzyme; the group is located near a large internal water cavity in the protein. Using the nonpolarizable Amber- 99 force field in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we have calculated the nuclear part of the reaction-field energy of charging of the His group and combined it with the electronic part, which we estimated in terms of the electronic continuum (EC) model, to obtain the total reaction-field energy of charging. The total free energy obtained in this MDEC approach was then compared with that calculated using pure continuum electrostatic model with variable dielectric parameters. The dielectric constant for the “dry” protein and that of the internal water cavity of CcO were determined as those parameters that provide best agreement between the continuum and microscopic MDEC model. The nuclear (MD) polarization alone (without electronic part) of a dry protein was found to correspond to an unphysically low dielectric constant of only about 1. 3, whereas the inclusion of electronic polarizability increases the protein dielectric constant to 2. 6 – 2. 8. A detailed analysis is presented as to how the protein structure should be selected for the continuum calculations, as well as which probe and atomic radii should be used for cavity definition. The dielectric constant of the internal water cavity was found to be 80 or even higher using “standard” parameters of water probe radius, 1. 4 Å, and protein atomic radii from the MD force field for cavity description; such high values are ascribed to the fact that the standard procedure produces unphysically small cavities. Using x-ray data for internal water in CcO, we have explored optimization of the parameters and the algorithm of cavity description. For Amber radii, the optimal probe size was found to be 1. 25 Å; the dielectric of water cavity in this case is in the range of 10 – 16. The most satisfactory cavity description, however, was achieved with ProtOr atomic radii, while keeping the probe radius to be standard 1. 4 Å. In this case, the value of cavity dielectric constant was found to be in the range of 3 – 6. The obtained results are discussed in the context of recent calculations and experimental measurements of dielectric properties of proteins...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{model for}} energy {{conversion}} in Complex I is proposed {{that is a}} conservative expansion of Mitchell's Q-cycle using a simple mechanistic variation of that already established experimentally for Complex III. The model accommodates the following proposals. (1) The large number of flavin and iron–sulfur redox cofactors integral to Complex I form a simple but long electron transfer chain guiding submillisecond electron transfer from substrate NADH in the matrix to the [4 Fe– 4 S] cluster N 2 close to the matrix–membrane interface. (2) The reduced N 2 cluster injects a single electron into a ubiquinone (Q) drawn from the membrane pool into a nearby Qnz site, generating an unstable transition state semiquinone (SQ). The generation of a SQ species is the primary step in the energy conversion process in Complex I, as in Complex III. In Complex III, the SQ at the Qo site near the cytosolic side acts as a strong reductant to drive electronic charge across the membrane profile via two hemes B to a Qi site near the matrix side. We propose that in Complex I, the SQ at the Qnz site near the matrix side acts as a strong oxidant to pull electronic charge across the membrane profile via a quinone (Qny site) from a Qnx site near the cytosolic side. The opposing locations of matrix side Qnz and cytosolic side Qo, together with the opposite action of Qnz as an oxidant rather than a reductant, renders the Complex I and III processes vectorially and energetically complementary. The redox properties of the Qnz and Qo site occupants can be identical. (3) The intervening Qny site of Complex I acts as a proton <b>pumping</b> <b>element</b> (akin to the proton pump of Complex IV), rather than the simple electron guiding hemes B of Complex III. Thus the transmembrane action of Complex I doubles to four (or more) the number of protons and charges translocated per NADH oxidized and Q reduced. The Qny site does not exchange with the pool and may even be covalently bound. (4) The Qnx site on the cytosol side of Complex I is complementary to the Qi site on the matrix side of Complex III and can have the same redox properties. The Qnx site draws QH 2 from the membrane pool to be oxidized in two single electron steps. Besides explaining earlier observations and making testable predictions, this Complex I model re-establishes a uniformity in the mechanisms of respiratory energy conversion by using engineering principles common to Complexes III and IV: (1) all the primary energy coupling reactions in the different complexes use oxygen chemistry {{in the guise of}} dioxygen or ubiquinone, (2) these reactions are highly localized structurally, utilizing closely placed catalytic redox cofactors, (3) these reactions are also highly localized energetically, since virtually all the free energy defined by substrates is conserved in the form of transition state that initiates the transmembrane action and (4) all complexes possess apparently supernumerary oxidation–reduction cofactors which form classical electron transfer chains that operate with high directional specificity to guide electron at near zero free energies to and from the sites of localized coupling...|$|E
