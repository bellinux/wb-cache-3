40|$|Enantiomerically pure {{substances}} {{are extremely}} important in <b>producing</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and other biologically important chemicals. To produce enantiomerically pure compounds {{is difficult because}} they have identical physical properties; this makes the separation of enantiomers nearly impossible. Our research, however, uses the enzyme Oxinitrilase to create an enantiomerically pure base molecule {{that can be easily}} manipulated into more useful compounds. As such, no difficult separations are necessary. We then couple this enzymatic chemistry with two synthetic catalysts?a ruthenium Grubbs and a palladium (0) catalyst. This methodology provides access to several synthetically and biologically important molecules, including Anisomycin, Prozac, and a family of glycosidase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Mutagenic activity, {{measured}} by the bacterial fluctuation assay and thioether concentration in urine from workers at a chemical plant <b>producing</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> and explosives, was determined before and after exposure.

The same strain responded only weakly when the S- 9 mix was used; with Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA no effect of exposure was observed. Urinary thioether concentration was higher among smokers than among non-smokers, but occupational exposure had no effect. Urinary mutagenicity testing may be a useful tool for screening potentially genotoxic exposures in complex chemical environments...|$|E

40|$|Plant-made {{pharmaceuticals}} (PMPs) offer {{promise as}} efficient and cost-effective {{products for the}} treatment of human and animal diseases. An advantage of <b>producing</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> in maize is the large storage capacity and stability for proteins and starch in seed, allowing for manufacturing recombinant proteins such as antigens and antibodies. Other advantages of the maize system include safety, high yields, and scalability of production and processing. However, the benefits of this technology must be balanced against potential health and environmental risks that may be associated with its use. Because PMPs presently have no provision for regulatory tolerance, their inadvertent occurrence in foods and feeds remains an important economic consideration, even when the health and environmental risks are low. Pollen drift is considered a source of potential contamination of maizemade pharmaceuticals in the food chain. In addition to physical and temporal isolation requirements, open field pharmaceutical maize production also calls for controlled pollen release. Here, we describe two strategies {{to address the issue of}} transgenic pollen drift. First, we describe the development and genetic transformation of a tissue culture-amenable male-sterile line using biolistic- or Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods. Secondly, we describe the introgression of a transgene from male-fertile transgenic maize to male-sterile germplasm by conventional breeding. After six seasons of breeding, this second strategy allows us to obtain 100 % transgenic seeds from an open-field production using a non-transgenic line as the pollinator...|$|E
