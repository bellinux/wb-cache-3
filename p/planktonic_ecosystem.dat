40|$|Here {{we present}} a nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton (NPZ) model that has {{arbitrary}} size-resolution within the phytoplankton- and zooplankton-state variables. The model assumes allometric scaling of biological parameters. This particular version of the model (herbivorous zooplankton only) has analytical solutions that allow efficient exploration {{of the effects of}} allometric dependencies of various biological processes on the model's equilibrium solutions. The model shows that there are constraints on the possible combinations of allometric scalings of the biological rates that will allow ecosystems to be structured as we observe (larger organisms added as the total biomass increases). The diversity (number of size classes occupied) of the ecosystem is the result of simultaneous bottom-up and top-down control: resources determine which classes can exist; predation determines which classes do exist. Thus, the simultaneous actions of bottom-up and top-down controls are essential for maintaining and structuring <b>planktonic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> One important conclusion from this model is that there are multiple, independent ways of obtaining any given biomass spectrum, and that the spectral slope is not, in and of itself, very informative concerning the underlying dynamics.

Consistent with particle transport theory—the physics of movement within fluids—these considerations are suggestive that formation into arrangements, microcolonies, or biofilms could be either less profitable to bacteria when phage predation pressure is high or require more effective phage-resistance mechanisms than seen among bacteria not living within clonal clusters.

Here, the ‘mean field approximation’ fails due to ‘biological Reynolds fluxes’ arising from nonlinearity in the fine-scale biological interactions and unresolved spatial variability. We investigate the domain-scale behaviour of two-component, 2 D reaction–diffusion plankton models producing transient dynamics, with spatial variability resulting only from the initial conditions. Failure of the mean field approximation can be quite significant for sub grid-scale mixing rates applicable to practical ocean models. To improve the approximation of domain-scale dynamics, we investigate implicit spatial resolution methods such as spatial moment closure. For weak and moderate strengths of biological nonlinearity, spatial moment closure models generally yield significant improvements on the mean field approximation, especially at low mixing rates. However, they are less accurate given weaker transience and stronger nonlinearity. In the latter case, an alternative ‘two-spike’ approximation is accurate at low mixing rates. We argue that, after suitable extension, these methods may be useful for understanding and skillfully predicting the large-scale behaviour of marine ecosystems. <br/...|$|R

Since 1995, marine and atmospheric data have been collected twice a year along a 13, 500 km transect between 50 °N and 52 °S in the Atlantic Ocean. This transect encompasses a range of biogeographical provinces including the subtropical gyres and the equatorial and coastal upwellings. The sampling strategy is described in Robinson et al. (2006 a), and for the last six cruises has involved continuous surface seawater and atmospheric sampling, and twice daily deployment of the CTD, bio-optical sensor rig and mesozooplankton nets. Up to 70 determinands were measured on each cruise (see Table 2 in Robinson et al., 2006 a). The programme has included 18 research cruises, involving 180 scientists from 11 countries (Fig. 2), contributing to 170 refereed publications and 70 Ph. D. theses. This unique, spatially extensive, decadal dataset continues to be made available to the wider community through the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) (www. bodc. ac. uk). <br/...|$|R
40|$|Planktonic organisms play crucial {{roles in}} oceanic food webs and global {{biogeochemical}} cycles. Most {{of our knowledge}} about the ecological impact of large zooplankton stems from research on abundant and robust crustaceans, and in particular copepods. A number of the other organisms that comprise planktonic communities are fragile, and therefore hard to sample and quantify, meaning that their abundances and effects on oceanic ecosystems are poorly understood. Here, using data from a worldwide in situ imaging survey of plankton larger than 600 µm, we show that {{a substantial part of}} the biomass of this size fraction consists of giant protists belonging to the Rhizaria, a super-group of mostly fragile unicellular marine organisms that includes the taxa Phaeodaria and Radiolaria (for example, orders Collodaria and Acantharia). Globally, we estimate that rhizarians in the top 200 m of world oceans represent a standing stock of 0. 089 Pg carbon, equivalent to 5. 2 % of the total oceanic biota carbon reservoir. In the vast oligotrophic intertropical open oceans, rhizarian biomass is estimated to be equivalent to that of all other mesozooplankton (plankton in the size range 0. 2 - 20 mm). The photosymbiotic association of many rhizarians with microalgae may be an important factor in explaining their distribution. The previously overlooked importance of these giant protists across the widest ecosystem on the planet changes our understanding of marine <b>planktonic</b> <b>ecosystems...</b>|$|R
