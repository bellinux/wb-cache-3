5|$|Devotees offer abhishek, {{a ritual}} of <b>pouring</b> water {{on to the}} murti of Nilkanth Varni, and express their reverence and prayers for spiritual upliftment and {{fulfilment}} of wishes.|$|E
5|$|During the credits, Stewie tries (and fails) to make {{believe he}} is eating his {{broccoli}} by <b>pouring</b> it onto Brian's plate.|$|E
5|$|May 2012 - Construction workers started <b>pouring</b> {{concrete}} on {{the foundations}} {{that will hold}} the rail columns.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremony}} {{was preceded by}} a week of oral catechism and several days of fasting. The actual ceremony involved <b>pouring</b> water over the segregated groups of men and women, although {{it is possible that}} their heads were immersed instead, and anointed with the chrism.|$|E
5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for <b>pouring</b> lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people <b>pouring</b> into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Contracts {{were signed}} at Spring's tavern {{and it was}} {{arranged}} for the fight to take place at Hanslope, Buckinghamshire. But as a vast crowd of spectators began <b>pouring</b> into Hanslope the venue was switched {{at the last minute}} to Salcey Green, just inside Northamptonshire, thus rendering the Buckinghamshire constables powerless to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are {{already beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been <b>pouring.</b> Emigration is positively and decidedly setting that way; but as yet it is mere worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, nothing more.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} exchange of strikes, Silva landed a direct right hook on Jackson's face, stunning Jackson and sending him backpedaling towards the ropes. Silva closed {{the distance and}} secured a Muay Thai clinch. From here, Silva landed approximately 5 knee strikes to Jackson's head, causing him {{to fall into the}} ropes, unconscious and with blood <b>pouring</b> out of his face. Silva was declared the winner by Knockout at 3:26 of the 2nd round to remain the Pride Middleweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 engines of the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how <b>pouring</b> fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Binky's cagemate Nuka {{suddenly}} became sick with the parasitic disease sarcocystosis, dying from associated liver failure on July 14, {{a week after}} her symptoms began. Shortly thereafter, Binky showed signs of the disease. On the morning of July 20, he went into convulsions and died. Zoo visitors left bouquets of flowers outside the bears' empty enclosure, and the zoo's memorial service saw a high turnout despite <b>pouring</b> rain. The bears were buried on zoo grounds.|$|E
5|$|In the Third Round, Queens Park Rangers of the Third Division South {{were beaten}} 1–0 at Loftus Road. The pitch was muddy {{and the weather}} was <b>pouring</b> rain {{in a game that}} was inevitably poor in quality, settled in the 50th minute by Albert Leake {{following}} a long ball played by John Cunliffe.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Jeffries won {{the contest}} and was flown to Detroit {{to join the}} band. Jeffries was allowed to bring along his best friend. He was given a Lost Weekend T-shirt and a hat. He was also brought on stage and had a large sheet cake smashed in his face which was {{followed}} by about a dozen people <b>pouring</b> champagne on him.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{thatched}} {{houses in}} Little Thetford {{was destroyed by}} fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, {{the cause of the}} fire at the c.13th-century six-room building was not known. Fireworks were being discharged {{at the other end of}} the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and <b>pouring</b> water on its thatched roof.|$|E
5|$|Opening of {{the park}} were held on 23 May 1981, with Ontario Premier William G. Davis and Taft Broadcasting President Dudley Taft presiding. The ceremonies {{included}} four children, representing the Arctic, Pacific, Atlantic, and Great Lakes regions of Canada, each <b>pouring</b> a vial of water from their home regions into the park's fountain. Hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky also appeared as a special guest, helping to raise the Canadian flag on the bridge near the waterfall.|$|E
5|$|President Bush {{declared}} Louisiana {{a federal}} disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance. FEMA set up three locations to apply in Mississippi and Louisiana. Applications began <b>pouring</b> in, 153,000 {{by the time}} of the deadline. Over $311million in aid was granted to Louisiana. A total of $50million of that money was in the form of low interest loans, and not actual grants.|$|E
5|$|The French Army {{authorised}} fresh {{attempts to}} increase {{the strength of the}} fortifications in the autumn of 1939, but severe winter weather prevented the <b>pouring</b> of concrete and the delivery of the necessary materials. On 11 April 1940, General Charles Huntziger asked for another four divisions to work on the defences but was refused.|$|E
5|$|The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, February 17, 2014, {{the first}} episode. Fallon had several celebrities come {{on stage and}} give him $100 bills paying off bets that they lost because he got to host The Tonight Show. Colbert was the last celebrity and he came with $100 in a bucket of pennies, <b>pouring</b> them down Fallon's clothes.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun <b>pouring</b> in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pouring</b> {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
5|$|Toads {{have a more}} {{sinister}} reputation. It was believed in European folklore that they were associated with witches as their familiar spirits and had magical powers. The toxic secretions from their skin was used in brewing evil potions, but was also put to use to create magical cures for human and livestock ailments. They {{were associated with the}} devil; in John Milton's Paradise Lost, Satan was depicted as a toad <b>pouring</b> poison into Eve's ear.|$|E
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the first Swift station, located at Airport Road in south Everett, was held on December 3, 2008, and was attended by Community Transit CEO Joyce Eleanor, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and the mayors of Everett and Marysville. Stations were constructed in two phases: the first consisting of utility relocation and <b>pouring</b> of the concrete shelter pad; the second being {{the installation of the}} shelters, beacons, and other amenities beginning in June 2009. The first station to be completed, a training facility at the Merrill Creek bus base, was opened during a media event on May 5, 2009; in September 2009, the first station on the line was completed at 196th Street in Lynnwood.|$|E
5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for <b>pouring</b> boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head <b>pouring</b> out water into a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning the same to all), indicating that the water was freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|Elaine holds a baby shower for {{her friend}} Leslie at Jerry's apartment, while Jerry is {{performing}} in Buffalo. George is excited, as {{he expects the}} baby shower {{to be the perfect}} opportunity to confront the woman who gave him the worst date of his life by <b>pouring</b> Bosco chocolate sauce on his red collared shirt while doing performance art. Jerry is frustrated by his television's bad reception, and is convinced by Kramer to have cable illegally installed by two Russians (Vic Polizos and James Lashly).|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time, the Italian Grand Prix {{was held at}} the Livorno Circuit rather than the {{traditional}} venue of Monza. Caracciola took pole position, and despite two false starts caused by spectators <b>pouring</b> onto the track, held his lead {{for the majority of the}} race and won from his teammate Lang by just 0.4seconds. In doing so Caracciola clinched the European Championship for the second time. He backed up the win with another at the Masaryk Grand Prix two weeks later. He trailed Rosemeyer for much of the race until the Auto Union skidded against a kerb and allowed the Mercedes into the lead.|$|E
5|$|Forgemasters, {{founded in}} 1805, {{is the sole}} {{remaining}} independent steel works {{in the world and}} dominates the north east of Sheffield around the Lower Don Valley. The firm has a global reputation for producing the largest and most complex steel forgings and castings and is certified to produce critical nuclear components, with recent projects including the Royal Navy's Astute-class submarines. The firm also has the capacity for <b>pouring</b> the largest single ingot (570 tonnes) in Europe and is currently in the process of expanding its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included <b>pouring</b> {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, <b>pouring</b> trash all over the town. At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five miles down the road.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{almost half}} of the Tories' {{campaign}} funds were spent in Quebec, a province in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue <b>pouring</b> money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec, it could attain a majority. Churchill's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.|$|E
5|$|Jim {{has taken}} over the role of Macbeth. It is {{mentioned}} that Tony fell off the battlements on stage, and is in hospital. Felicity has been sacked after she was accused of sexual harassment. Laura arrives to congratulate Jim, and he thanks her for encouraging him. He is distant, eventually asking her to leave him to prepare alone. As he puts on his crown in front of the mirror, he hears the sound of whispering, and sees blood <b>pouring</b> from both his eyes and the mirror.|$|E
5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that has started to spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by <b>pouring</b> hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Long before {{non-indigenous}} people {{explored the}} region, tribes of Native Americans fished and hunted along the slough. In the early 19thcentury fur trappers and explorers including Lewis and Clark visited the area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from the east. The newcomers farmed, cut timber, built houses, {{and by the}} early 20thcentury established cities, shipping ports, roads, rail lines and industries near the slough. Increased investment in the floodplain led to larger losses during floods, and these losses prompted levee building that greatly altered the area. A flood <b>pouring</b> through a levee break in 1948 destroyed the city of Vanport, which was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Matabele raiding parties {{attacked}} the retreating column six times during its two-week journey back to Bulawayo. In <b>pouring</b> rain, the dishevelled men were soon mostly on foot, existing off horse meat and wearing makeshift shoes made from ammunition wallets. Forbes felt so humiliated {{by the events}} that he retreated from command in all but name, surrendering de facto control to Commandant Raaff. In leading the column back to Bulawayo, Raaff repeatedly drew on his experience from the Anglo-Zulu War to ensure {{the survival of the}} haggard men. He avoided several Matabele ambushes, and at one point set up a convincing decoy camp that the Matabele fired on for half a day, wasting much of their ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before <b>pouring</b> it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from <b>pouring</b> in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
