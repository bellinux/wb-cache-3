50|$|After {{the release}} of Surface 3, a docking station will be {{released}} with 4 USB ports (including 2 USB 3.0), a Gigabit Ethernet port, an additional Mini DisplayPort (which in contrast to Surface Pro 3's docking station's port, can't be used simultaneously with the port on the Surface 3, {{as it is a}} <b>PassThru</b> port), a 3.5 mm audio socket for audio input/output and a storage for Surface Pen.|$|E
50|$|Lotus Development {{acquired}} cc:Mail, Inc. (formerly PCC Systems), {{which was}} a Silicon Valley startup, in 1991 and used the cc:Mail technology to enhance Lotus Notes. Lotus Notes features derived from cc:Mail included Shared Mail, client type-ahead addressing, enhancements to the Notes MTA (also called Router), and the Notes <b>Passthru</b> feature. Lotus developed a version of cc:Mail Remote for the HP 95LX. cc:Mail Remote was {{also included in the}} built-in software of the HP 100LX, HP 200LX and HP OmniGo 700LX.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} <b>passthru</b> (patching card information) got homebrew code running, several {{people started to}} produce and sell the {{so-called}} PassMe devices. Currently, the BIOS of the Nintendo DS has been disassembled and will lead to passthrules cards. PassMe v1 could simply use any Nintendo DS Game Card to operate, while PassMe v2 required on-board memory for game specific booting, which would combat with later versions of the Nintendo DS's firmware that blocked nongame-specific boots. However, this required SRAM in the media that the PassMe was booting to, and thus did not operate with some media devices, such as the Game Boy Advance Media Player (CF/SD).|$|E
50|$|Internal Revenue Service Form 8900 is used {{to claim}} the tax credit by the {{taxpayer}} at a maximum of $3500 per short line track mile per year or 50% of qualified railroad track maintenance paid or incurred during the year whichever is less. Form 8900 {{is used to}} assign tax credits between eligible taxpayers {{who have come to}} an agreement to transfer tax credits. Eligible taxpayers for this credit are short line railroads, transporters who use the railroad property and any taxpayer who furnishes goods and services to a short line railroad. Shareholders or partners of these eligible taxpayer may receive a <b>passthru</b> of these credits on form K-1.|$|E
50|$|In {{a credit}} card or debit card {{transaction}}, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant. The acquiring bank then pays the merchant {{the amount of the}} transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or independent sales organization (ISO), which {{is often referred to as}} a discount rate, an add-on rate, or <b>passthru.</b> For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine).|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{has grown}} to be hugely popular and used by people of all {{different}} backgrounds and professions. Individual web pages are created by just about everyone {{whether or not they}} have any development experience or not. PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) {{is one of the more}} popular scripting languages used by beginners and advanced users. It is an attractive alternative to Java for the novice user but little do they know there are some frightening vulnerabilities that can be exploited by clients looking to cause problems or gain access to private information or resources that cannot be tied to them. A few of these exploits include remote and local file inclusion or execution. Through these basics types of vulnerabilities a malicious client could gain complete access to a web server. To avoid these attacks a web developer needs to take care when writing PHP scripts. The most common mistake made by developers is to unknowingly expose internal variables to clients or when access is needed not properly sanitizing them to ensure the values make sense for the context in which they are being used. If un-sanitized variables are used in conjunction with certain PHP function calls private files can be accessed or remote files can be uploaded and executed. A few of the more dangerous PHP functions calls are _GET[] or <b>passthru().</b> These functions need to be used with care or disabled by the system administrator to avoid problems with badly written PHP scripts. To aid in the detection of potential vulnerabilities the authors of this paper implemented a Vulnerability Detection Tool (VDT). The tool is a jav...|$|E
