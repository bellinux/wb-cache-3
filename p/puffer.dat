5|$|The Environmental Protection Agency has {{designated}} the Corpus Christi Bay system as an estuary of national significance. More than 234 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} bay, including the Gafftopsail catfish, Hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic cutlassfish, Black drum, Red drum, Southern flounder, Crevalle jack, Ladyfish, Inshore lizardfish, Atlantic midshipman, Silver perch, Pinfish, Smooth <b>puffer,</b> Scaled sardine, Bighead searobin, Sand seatrout, Spotted seatrout, Sheepshead, Gray snapper, Common snook, and the Tripletail.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of <b>puffer</b> fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E
50|$|In captivity, Congo <b>puffers</b> require large tanks {{with the}} {{temperature}} between 23 and 26°C. They {{are sensitive to}} both nitrites and nitrates, so overfiltration is required.

25|$|Born in North Crosby, Ontario, on November 1, 1861, <b>Puffer</b> {{was the son}} of a United Empire Loyalist. He married Charlotte Ann Gilmore, {{with whom}} he would have seven children, on July 1, 1885. They came west in 1889 and homesteaded near Olds, before finally {{settling}} in Lacombe in 1893. <b>Puffer</b> was engaged in several businesses, dealing in cattle, lumber, dairy products, and farm implements. In 1900, he established a butchery in Lacombe next to a laundry operated by Hop Chung, a Chinese immigrant. When Chung wished to bring his wife and children over from China but could not afford the C$500 head tax, <b>Puffer</b> paid it; Chung's family arrived in Lacombe in 1908, making his wife one of the first Chinese women in Alberta. In 1911 both Puffer's butchery and Chung's laundry burnt down, and they rebuilt a single building to share.|$|E
25|$|When the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway (A) scandal {{divided the}} Liberal caucus, <b>Puffer</b> {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government of Premier Alexander Cameron Rutherford. When Rutherford's government fell and was replaced with that of fellow Liberal Arthur Sifton, <b>Puffer</b> joined Rutherford and his allies in voting against the new administration on its 1910 plan to confiscate the money raised by the A from a provincially guaranteed bond issue (on the grounds that it had defaulted on its obligations). However, he did not join Rutherford in supporting a 1913 Conservative motion of non-confidence against the government, which decried Sifton's handling of the A issue; instead, <b>Puffer</b> read a statement on behalf of several representatives saying that, while Rutherford's concerns were legitimate, it was premature to pass final judgment until the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had ruled on the legality of the government's plan.|$|E

5000|$|Cases of {{neurological}} symptoms, including numbness and tingling of {{the lips}} and mouth, {{have been reported}} to rise after the consumption of <b>puffers</b> caught in the area of Titusville, Florida, U.S. The symptoms generally resolve within hours to days, although one affected individual required intubation for 72 hours. [...] As a result, Florida banned the harvesting of <b>puffers</b> from certain bodies of water.|$|R
25|$|The hogchoker {{flatfish}} {{have been}} historically {{abundant in the}} river, where farmers would use them for inexpensive livestock feed, giving the fish its name. Other unique fish found in the river include the northern pipefish, the lined seahorse, and the northern <b>puffer.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Clyde <b>puffer</b> {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{coal-fired}} and single-masted cargo ship built mainly on the Forth and Clyde canal and which provided a vital supply link around the west coast and Hebrides islands of Scotland. Built between 1856 and 1939, these stumpy little steamboats achieved an almost mythical status thanks largely to the short stories Neil Munro wrote about the Vital Spark and her captain Para Handy, which produced three television series.|$|E

50|$|<b>Puffers</b> {{are able}} to move their eyes independently, and many species can change the color or {{intensity}} of their patterns in response to environmental changes. In these respects, they are somewhat similar to the terrestrial chameleon. Although most <b>puffers</b> are drab, many have bright colors and distinctive markings, and make no attempt to hide from predators. This is likely an example of honestly signaled aposematism.|$|R

25|$|William Franklin <b>Puffer</b> (November 1, 1861 – April 22, 1948) was a Canadian {{politician}} {{who served in}} the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1905 until 1917. Born in Ontario, he came west and settled in Lacombe, where he operated a butchery, among other interests. He was elected to the legislature in Alberta's first provincial election, and returned to office in each of the next two before being defeated in the 1917 election. He subsequently made two unsuccessful attempts to reclaim his seat.|$|E
25|$|VIC 27 renamed Auld Reekie, which starred as the Vital Spark in {{the third}} BBC TV Para Handy series, was berthed at Crinan Basin for 14 years deteriorating. She was {{purchased}} (Oct 2006) by {{the owner of the}} Inveraray Maritime Museum who carried out some work on her but she has since been resold to a new owner who has already started on her major restoration work. As she is the oldest surviving steam-powered <b>puffer</b> in existence she must be restored and preserved as part of Scotland's heritage afloat.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{psychology}} {{is a form}} of psychology centered on societal structures and gender. Feminist psychology critiques the fact that historically psychological research has been done from a male perspective with the view that males are the norm. Feminist {{psychology is}} oriented on the values and principles of feminism. It incorporates gender and the ways women are affected by issues resulting from it. Ethel Dench <b>Puffer</b> Howes {{was one of the first}} women to enter the field of psychology. She was the Executive Secretary of the National College Equal Suffrage League in 1914.|$|E
50|$|Marine finfish {{culture is}} {{dominated}} by bastard halibut (Paralichthys olivaceus), Korean rockfish (Sebastes schlegeli), mullet, seabass, yellowtail, red seabream, black seabream, brown croaker and <b>puffers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{source of}} {{tetrodotoxin}} in <b>puffers</b> {{has been a}} matter of debate, but it is increasingly accepted that bacteria in the fish's intestinal tract are the source.|$|R
25|$|While at Stanford, Mosher taught organic {{chemistry}} and conducted research in natural products chemistry and stereochemistry. He and his graduate student Melanchton Brown identified a deadly toxin {{produced by the}} California newt living in Stanford's Lake Lagunita, calling it tarichatoxin. They soon discovered {{that it was the}} same toxin produced by the <b>puffer</b> fish, used in a rare type of sushi that if prepared incorrectly could paralyze and kill human diners. Mosher determined the structure of the toxin, which is known as tetrodotoxin. Mosher worked on many other natural products including both plant pigments and toxic substances.|$|E
25|$|Fashionable {{clothing}} {{in the early}} 1980s included both unisex and gender-specific attire. Widespread fashions {{for women in the}} early 1980s included sweaters (including turtleneck, crew neck, and v-neck varieties); fur-lined <b>puffer</b> jackets; tunics; faux-fur coats; velvet blazers; trench coats (made in both fake and real leather); crop tops; tube tops; knee-length skirts (of no prescribed length, as designers opted for choice); loose, flowy, knee-length dresses (with high-cut and low-cut necklines, varying sleeve lengths, and made in a variety of fabrics including cotton, silk, satin, and polyester); high-waisted loose pants; embroidered jeans; leather pants; and designer jeans. Women's pants of the 1980s were, in general, worn with long inseams – a style carried over from the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|From {{this basic}} type of <b>puffer</b> three {{varieties}} developed: inside boats continued in {{use on the}} Forth and Clyde canal, while shorehead boats extended their range eastwards into the Firth of Forth and westwards {{as far as the}} Isle of Bute and from there up the length of Loch Fyne, their length kept at 66ft (20 m) to use the canal locks. Both these types had a crew of three. Puffers of a third type, the outside boats, were built for the rougher sea routes to the Hebrides islands with a crew of four and the length increased to 88ft (27 m) still allowing use of the larger locks on the Crinan Canal which cuts across the Kintyre peninsula. There were more than 20 builders in Scotland, mainly on the Forth and Clyde canal at Kirkintilloch and Maryhill, Glasgow.|$|E
50|$|Figure 8 <b>puffers</b> grow {{to about}} 8 cm long. They are {{colourful}} fish, with greenish yellow patterns on their backs. These patterns vary greatly from fish to fish, but the markings {{either side of}} the caudal fin resemble the number eight, or eye-spots (earning the species another common name as 'Eye-spot puffer'). Figure 8 <b>puffers</b> are relatively peaceful among Tetraodontidae, and have been kept successfully with other fish such as bumblebee gobies and mollies, but as with all pufferfish there is a risk that tankmates will not be tolerated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>puffer's</b> {{unique and}} {{distinctive}} natural defenses help compensate for its slow locomotion. It moves by combining pectoral, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. This makes it highly maneuverable, but very slow, {{and therefore a}} comparatively easy predation target. Its tail fin is mainly used as a rudder, {{but it can be}} used for a sudden evasive burst of speed that shows none of the care and precision of its usual movements. The <b>puffer's</b> excellent eyesight, combined with this speed burst, is the first and most important defense against predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{middle section}} of the Robert Frost Trail {{traverses}} the Connecticut River Valley {{in the vicinity of}} eastern Amherst, south Leverett, and abutting towns. Highlights along the way include the 1000 acre Lawrence Swamp, Pomroy Pond, Harkness Brook Ravine, Amethyst Brook, the Mount Orient ledges, Atkins Reservoir, Cushman Brook Ravine, <b>Puffer's</b> Pond, and the Leverett Knobs. The ledges of Mount Orient and the swimming beach at <b>Puffer's</b> Pond are popular locally. Harkness Brook, Amethyst Brook, and Cushman brook offer shaded brookside walking and cascades. Lawrence Swamp is a major local wildlife habitat and aquifer.|$|R
