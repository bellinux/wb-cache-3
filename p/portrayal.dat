In addition, six characters {{and their respective}} actors made the list of 'The 100 Greatest Movie Characters', also compiled by Empire, with Viggo Mortensen's <b>portrayal</b> of Aragorn ranking No. 15, Ian McKellen's <b>portrayal</b> of Gandalf ranking No. 30, Ian Holm's <b>portrayal</b> of Bilbo Baggins (shared with Martin Freeman for his <b>portrayal</b> of the same character in The Hobbit films) ranking No. 61, Andy Serkis' <b>portrayal</b> of Gollum ranking No. 66, Sean Astin's <b>portrayal</b> of Samwise Gamgee ranking No. 77, and Orlando Bloom's <b>portrayal</b> of Legolas ranking No. 94.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the decline}} over time in wives as being portrayed solely as housekeepers, the <b>portrayal</b> of mothers as the primary {{physical}} care takers of children {{has been on the}} decline. Instead, there has been an increase in the <b>portrayal</b> of mothers as facilitating recreational activities with their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Tom won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series {{twice for}} her <b>portrayal</b> of Victoria, and {{received}} nominations for eight other Emmy awards. Critics praised Tom's <b>portrayal</b> of the character, though her marriages {{at an early}} age were criticized.

3000|$|Our {{paradigm}} {{to answer}} these questions is to perform [...] "cross-modality" [...] emotion transfer. In each of three experiments, we extract a DESIRE from human <b>portrayals</b> of emotion, and use that DESIRE to generate robot <b>portrayals</b> in a different modality. Both the source and generated <b>portrayals</b> are then evaluated by human raters. If both the source and generated <b>portrayals</b> are rated as the same emotion, then we can say that DESIRE is sufficient to represent that emotion across the two modalities.|$|R
40|$|Using content analysis, {{the current}} study {{examines}} sex-role <b>portrayals</b> in Australian television advertisements and contrasts the results with previous studies. The findings indicate that <b>portrayals</b> of women are actually becoming more stereotypical {{in a way that}} favours traditional roles. Role <b>portrayals</b> appear to be increasingly distant from women's actual experience. In the global context, this finding is unusual given that many international studies suggest that role <b>portrayals</b> are becoming relatively more reflective of current realities. This study adds to the current literature by highlighting the importance of longitudinal studies...|$|R
5|$|As {{was common}} in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) played {{a young man}} (Peter). The play's script assigns {{dialogue}} to three numbered villagers in the opening scene. The named character of Jacques has no more lines than any of these and disappears after {{the first page of}} the script. Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish caricature. Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad <b>portrayal</b> and interpolations show that Gilbert had little control of Righton's <b>portrayal</b> of the part.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} nation's {{official}} censors ordered scenes {{cut from the}} film. According to Xinhua, the state news agency of the People's Republic of China, ten minutes of footage containing Chow Yun-fat's <b>portrayal</b> of Singaporean pirate Sao Feng were trimmed from versions of the film which may be shown in China. Chow is onscreen for twenty minutes in the uncensored theatrical release of the film. No official reason for the censorship was given, but unofficial sources within China have indicated that the character gave a negative and stereotypical <b>portrayal</b> of Chinese people.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{negative}} stereotypes of black masculinity prevalent in American public opinion are linked to negative media <b>portrayals</b> of African American men. Using both theming analysis and survey experiment methods, I ask whether or not positive media <b>portrayals</b> of African American men offset negative stereotypes of black masculinity. The central finding is that one-time exposure to positive media <b>portrayals</b> of African American men decrease levels of racial resentment. I then close by considering the implications the results have on media <b>portrayals</b> as well as opinions of ordinary citizens...|$|R
40|$|Research {{on gender}} <b>portrayals</b> in {{advertising}} are prolific and mostly focus on stereotypical roles. However, {{there is no}} previous research report analysing <b>portrayals</b> that fall into the “other” category of female roles. This paper aims to provide an outline of female role <b>portrayals</b> in advertising and, importantly, to examine the “other” role category for new <b>portrayals.</b> A quantitative content analysis was conducted on samples of South African magazine and television advertisements. The findings indicate that the stereotypical decorative role was prevalent in magazine advertisements. In television advertisements the product user was the person most often featured. A {{detailed analysis of the}} “other” category in both media revealed four new role <b>portrayals.</b> These new roles represent a different view of the modern woman and may be used to differentiate effectively those brands in media that are cluttered with advertising messages. The research provides direction for future content analytic studies on the topic of female <b>portrayals</b> in advertising. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{literature}} on “image of aging ” suggests {{that exposure to}} positive <b>portrayals</b> of old age has positive downstream consequences for older adults. This study examined whether these positive consequences might have limits, such that they occurred for <b>portrayals</b> of old age that were positive, but not those that were extremely positive. Method. Younger and older adults were allowed to selectively view (Study 1)   or were experimentally exposed to (Studies 2 and 3)   <b>portrayals</b> of old age of different levels of positivity. Their attention (Study 1)   and physiological responses (Study 2)   toward the <b>portrayals,</b> as well as perception of personal aging (Study 1)   and memory performance (Study 3)   after the exposure, were assessed. Results. Findings from 3 studies suggested that older adults have a less negative perception of personal aging (Study 1)   and a stronger calming physiological response (Study 2)   when being exposed to <b>portrayals</b> of old age that were positive, but not extremely positive. Moreover, extremely positive <b>portrayals</b> lowered downstream memory performance (Study 3)   and attracted less attention from older adults when they found these <b>portrayals</b> unrealistic (Study 1) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Portrayals</b> of {{characters}} with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in films and TV series {{are subject to}} intense debate over whether such representations are accurate. Inaccurate <b>portrayals</b> are a concern as they may lead to increased stereotypes toward the condition. We investigate whether <b>portrayals</b> {{of characters}} with autism spectrum disorder in film and TV-series align with DSM- 5 diagnostic criteria.

50|$|Media <b>portrayals</b> of Indigenous Australians {{fall into}} a range of categories, which {{academics}} and commentators have described as often negative or stereotyped.

50|$|Since the 1970s, fictional <b>portrayals</b> {{of people}} with autism, Asperger syndrome, and other ASCs have become more frequent. Public {{perception}} of autism is often based on these fictional <b>portrayals</b> in novels, biographies, movies, and TV series. These depictions of autism in media today are often made {{in a way that}} brings pity to the public and their concern of the topic, because their viewpoint is never actually shown, leaving the public without knowledge of autism and its diagnosis. <b>Portrayals</b> in the media of characters with atypical abilities (for example, the ability to multiply large numbers without a calculator) may be misinterpreted by viewers as accurate <b>portrayals</b> of all autistic people and of autism itself.|$|R

40|$|Advertising {{images have}} a history of being criticized for its {{manipulative}} character and negative <b>portrayals</b> of men and women. Previous studies have shown that advertising images have a distorting effect on society. There have been lively debates in Sweden the past years about gender equality and how stereotypical <b>portrayals</b> of men and women inhibit the progress towards an equal society. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how gender is constructed in Swedish advertising images published in Swedish newspapers today. The theoretical framework used in this study consists of former studies of stereotypic <b>portrayals</b> and theories of semiotics, gender and representation. To study signs present in the images a qualitative method and a semiotic perspective was used. The result showed that the studied images contained a lot of stereotypic <b>portrayals</b> of men and women. It was surprising to see such heavy use of stereotypes considering the awareness present in Swedish debates regarding negative <b>portrayals</b> of gender...|$|R
