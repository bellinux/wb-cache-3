An important consequence of cloning is that it may cause variability on the item parameters. Therefore, a multilevel item response model is presented in which it is assumed that the item parameters of a three-parameter logistic model describing response behavior are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution associated with a <b>parent</b> <b>item.</b> In this approach to item calibration, only distributions of item parameters are estimated. Therefore, the savings in item calibration costs for the item cloning model are potentially enormous. A marginal maximum likelihood and a Bayesian item-calibration procedure are formulated.

40|$|Item cloning {{techniques}} can greatly {{reduce the cost}} of item writing and enhance the flexibility of item presentation. An important consequence of cloning is that it may cause variability in the item parameters. Recently, Glas and van der Linden (in press, 2005) proposed a multilevel item response model where it is assumed that the item parameters of a 3 -parameter logistic (3 PL) model or a 3 -parameter normal ogive (3 PNO) model are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution associated with a <b>parent</b> <b>item.</b> In the sequel, the model will be referred to as the item cloning model, which will be abbreviated ICM. Several procedures for item bank calibration and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) were proposed. The latter procedures were developed under the usual assumption that the item parameters are known. However, in practice, item parameters have to be estimated, which introduces an error component that can have substantial effects. For the standard 3 PL model, van der Linden and Glas (2000, 2001) show that capitalization on estimation error can lead to a substantial loss of precision. In the present report, this finding is corroborated for the ICM. It is shown that the problem can be solved by a Bayesian item selection procedure where the uncertainty about the item parameters is taken into account by implicating their posterior distributions. These posterior distributions are generated using the Gibbs Sampler. A simulation study is presented to illustrate the performance of the method...|$|E

Two procedures for updating the parameter estimates in the ICM are compared. In the first procedure, the MCMC procedure is run on the combined original and new data set. In the second procedure, the estimates obtained on the original data set are used as priors in an MCMC run using the new data only. Results of simulation studies indicated that the second procedure tended to lead to some loss of precision in the parameter estimates. However, in the simulation studies presented here, this loss was limited. On the other hand, the gain in computation time for the second method was not substantial either...|$|E

40|$|Sequential data streams {{describe}} {{a variety of}} real life processes: from sensor readings of natural phenomena to robotics, moving trajectories and network monitoring scenarios. An item in a sequential data stream often depends on its previous values, subsequent items being strongly correlated. In this thesis we {{address the problem of}} extracting the most significant sequential patterns from a data stream, with applications to real-time data summarization and classification and estimating generative models of the data. The first contribution of this thesis is the notion of Conditional Heavy Hitters, which describes the items that are frequent conditionally – that is, within the context of their <b>parent</b> <b>item.</b> Conditional Heavy Hitters are useful in a variety of applications in sensor monitoring, analysis, Markov chain modeling, and more. We develop algorithms for efficient detection of Conditional Heavy Hitters depending on the characteristics of the data, and provide analytical quality guarantees for their performance. We also study the behavior of the proposed algorithms for different types of data and demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by experimental evaluation on several synthetic and real-world datasets. The second contribution of the thesis is the extension of Conditional Heavy Hitters to patterns of variable order, which we formalize in the notion of Variable Order Conditional Heavy Hitters. The significance of the variable order patterns is measured in terms of high conditional and joint probability and their difference from the independent case in terms of statistical significance. The approximate online solution in the variable order case exploits lossless compression approaches. Facing the tradeoff between memory usage and accuracy of the pattern extraction, we introduce several online space pruning strategies and study their quality guarantees. The strategies can be chosen depending on the estimation objectives, such as maximizing the precision or recall of extracted significant patterns. The efficiency of our approach is experimentally evaluated on three real datasets. The last contribution of the thesis is related to the prediction quality of the classical and sequential classification algorithms under varying levels of label noise. We present the "Sigmoid Rule" Framework, which allows choosing the most appropriate learning algorithm depending on the properties of the data. The framework uses an existing model of the expected performance of learning algorithms as a sigmoid function of the signal-to-noise ratio in the training instances. Based on the sigmoid parameters we define a set of intuitive criteria that are useful for comparing the behavior of learning algorithms in the presence of noise. Furthermore, we show that there is a connection between these parameters and the characteristics of the underlying dataset, hinting at how the inherent properties of a dataset affect learning. The framework is applicable to concept drift scenarios, including modeling user behavior over time, and mining of noisy time series of evolving nature...|$|E

The 56 items of the Measure of Processes of Care questionnaire (MPOC- 56) all reflect elements of family-centred service. In this study, we investigated which elements of family-centred service are rated important by parents of children with cerebral palsy by adding a question on importance to each item of the MPOC- 56 (MPOC- 56 -I). MethodsIn total, 175 parents of children with cerebral palsy completed the MPOC- 56 -I. For each MPOC <b>item,</b> <b>parents</b> were asked to rate the importance on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (not important at all) up to and including 4 (very important). We used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to further explore the variation in parents' importance ratings. ResultsParents' importance ratings of the MPOC- 56 items varied. The percentage of <b>parents</b> rating an <b>item</b> important (importance rating 3 or 4) varied between 43. 8 % and 96. 8 %. The percentage of <b>parents</b> rating an <b>item</b> unimportant (rating 0 or 1) varied between 0. 0 % and 20. 3 %, and the percentage of <b>parents</b> rating an <b>item</b> neutral (rating 2) varied between 3. 0 % and 36. 0 %.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of engineering changes is to redesign product/component parts to perform better or to be produced more efficiently. Frequent engineering changes, however, contribute to scheduling instability in multi-level product structures in addition to obsolete inventories. In this paper, we consider progressive probabilities of engineering changes {{as opposed to the}} constant probabilities generally assumed in most related studies. Realistically, the probability of changing a part at a certain level is affected by the changes in its parent levels. Thus, the likelihood of changes may progressively cascade from the top {{to the bottom of the}} product structure. An analytical procedure is developed to compute progressive probabilities of engineering changes. Then, a sensitivity analysis is performed to see how the shape of product structure and component commonality affect resultant progressive engineering changes for the lower-level items in the product structure.

In this paper, a multi-stage lot-sizing problem is formulated under a specified component lot-splitting policy for the case of noninstantaneous production of items and constant demand for the end item. Optimal and heuristic solution procedures for the formulated problem are provided, including experimental results of comparison between these procedures. It is shown that considerable cost savings can result if the component lot-splitting approach is employed under favorable conditions in multi-stage manufacturing environments. In addition, reduced inventory levels are achieved which translate into lower working capital requirements and a less cluttered shop floor. The heuristic procedure is recommended as an acceptable alternative to the optimal procedure if the number of items in the multi-stage system is large or if inventory carrying and setup/order costs cannot be accurately estimated. Further, component lot-splitting considerations may be ignored if production rates of facilities in the system are in balance.

Culturally-based approaches to measurement development can begin to identify parental feeding practices in specific cultural groups. This study used qualitative and quantitative methods to develop and test the Parental Feeding Practices (PFP) Questionnaire for use with Mexican American <b>parents.</b> <b>Items</b> reflected both <b>parent’s</b> use of control over child eating and child-centered feeding practices. Methods In the qualitative phase of the research, 35 Latino parents participated in focus groups. Items for the PFP were developed from focus group discussions, as well as adapted from existing parent feeding practice measures. Cognitive {{interviews were conducted with}} 37 adults to evaluate items. In the quantitative phase, mothers and fathers of 174 Mexican American children ages 8 – 10 completed the PFP and provided demographic information. Anthropometric measures were obtained on family members. Results Confirmatory factor analyses identified four parental feeding practice dimensions: positive involvement in child eating, pressure to eat, use of food to control behavior, and restriction of amount of food. Factorial invariance modeling suggested equivalent factor meaning and item response scaling across mothers and fathers. Mothers and fathers differed somewhat in their use of feeding practices. All four feeding practices were related to child body mass index (BMI) percentiles, for one or both parents. Mothers reporting more positive involvement had children with lower BMI percentiles. Parents using more pressure to eat had children with lower BMI percentiles, while parents using more restriction had children with higher BMI percentiles. Fathers using food to control behavior had children with lower BMI percentiles. Conclusions Results indicate good initial validity and reliability for the PFP. It can be used to increase understanding of parental feeding practices, children’s eating, and obesity among Mexican Americans, a population at high risk of obesity. </p...|$|R
