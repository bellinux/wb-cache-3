25|$|The Rear of the Armed Forces {{includes}} an unusually {{diverse range of}} services, for example medical services, firefighters, logistical services, economic analysts, scientific units, and combat-ready formations for maintaining and <b>protecting</b> <b>rear</b> installations such as pipelines and railways. The Rear also has its own central staff organization.|$|R
2500|$|When the Union Army {{threatened}} Chattanooga, the Confederate States Army would (from its naturally <b>protected</b> <b>rear)</b> first reinforce Chattanooga's garrison from Atlanta. [...] When sufficient {{forces had}} been deployed to Chattanooga {{to stabilize the}} situation and hold the line, the Confederates would then launch a counterattack from Chattanooga with {{the advantage of a}} local superiority of men and materiel. [...] It was this process that the Andrews raid sought to disrupt.|$|R

50|$|On 13 February 1861, a {{passenger}} train {{ran into the}} rear of a freight train at Didcot Junction. The guard of the freight train had failed to adequately <b>protect</b> the <b>rear</b> of his train.|$|R
50|$|Tactically {{the battle}} {{resulted}} in a Union victory because they broke the Confederate line and drove through the gap. Strategically, the Confederates were successful in stalling the Union advance {{and were able to}} <b>protect</b> McLaws' <b>rear.</b>|$|R
40|$|Infrared {{hemispherical}} reflectance measurements {{that were made}} on 58 chromic acid anodized tray clamps from LDEF are described. The measurements were made using a hemiellipsoidal mirror reflectometer with interferometer for wavelengths between 2 - 15 microns. The tray clamps investigated were from locations about the entire spacecraft and provided the opportunity for comparing the effects of atomic oxygen at each location. Results indicate there was essentially no dependence on atomic oxygen fluence for the surfaces studied, but there did {{appear to be a}} slight dependence on solar radiation exposure. The reflectances of the front sides of the tray clamps consistently were slightly higher than for the <b>protected</b> <b>rear</b> tray clamp surfaces...|$|R

5000|$|On 3 September 1881 {{there was}} a {{collision}} at Bow Road when a train ran {{into the back of}} a stationary train which had failed at the station. The driver and fireman of the moving train were killed and 11 passengers were injured. In the inquiry that followed the cause was deemed to be the failure of the signalman to <b>protect</b> the <b>rear</b> of the train by setting signals to [...] "danger". The train crew were criticised in that while they had noticed the signals were not at [...] "danger", they had failed to inform the signalman. The guard of the first train was also criticised for not having properly <b>protected</b> the <b>rear</b> of the failed train.|$|R
5000|$|The {{driver was}} found to not have {{approached}} {{the scene of the}} derailment with [...] "the caution demanded of him", according to the initial departmental inquiry, and that the guard of the breakdown train had failed to adequately <b>protect</b> the <b>rear</b> of it.|$|R
50|$|Initially, he was {{in charge}} of an army {{division}} stationed near St.Petersburg and then the Observation Corps, formed by Shuvalov himself and designated to <b>protect</b> the <b>rear</b> of the regular army. He also held the post of a conference minister and managed the artillery and weapons chancelleries.|$|R
50|$|The {{subsequent}} inquiry {{blamed the}} crew of the first train for neglecting to <b>protect</b> the <b>rear</b> of their train, and the enginemen (particularly the driver) of the second train for failing to proceed with caution knowing that they must have passed several signals without observing them.|$|R
50|$|On 5 November 1926, a {{milk tank}} train became divided near , Hampshire. The train crew failed {{to inform the}} {{signalman}} or <b>protect</b> its <b>rear</b> {{in the belief that}} the issue could be resolved quickly. A passenger train was in a rear-end collision with it. One person was killed.|$|R
2500|$|Sher Shah withdrew to the east, but Humayun did not follow: {{instead he}} [...] "shut himself {{up for a}} {{considerable}} time in his Harem, and indulged himself in every kind of luxury." [...] Hindal, Humayun's 19-year-old brother, had agreed to aid him in this battle and <b>protect</b> the <b>rear</b> from attack, but he abandoned his position and withdrew to Agra, where he decreed himself acting emperor. When Humayun sent the grand Mufti, Sheikh Buhlul, to reason with him; the Sheikh was killed. Further provoking the rebellion, Hindal ordered that the Khutba, or sermon, in the main mosque at Agra be read in his name, a sign of assumption of sovereignty. When Hindal withdrew from <b>protecting</b> the <b>rear</b> of Humayun's troops, Sher Shah's troop quickly reclaimed these positions, leaving Humayun surrounded.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the battle}} of Preston he was unhorsed and in danger, but helped <b>protecting</b> the <b>rear</b> during the retreat to Wigan, where his {{regiment}} joined the main army. Subsequently he was compelled to surrender to General John Lambert, and was sent a prisoner to Newcastle. He bought his freedom a year later.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the Indians drew near, and {{scattering}} themselves round the little entrenchment, began to discharge clouds of arrows at it, but, fortunately, without doing any damage. An inaccessible cliff <b>protected</b> their <b>rear,</b> and behind a projection of this the trappers' horses were secured. The breastwork lay immediately in front.|$|R
50|$|Kitchener's force wheeled left in echelon {{to advance}} up Surgham ridge and then southwards. To <b>protect</b> the <b>rear,</b> a brigade of 3,000 mainly Sudanese, {{commanded}} by Hector MacDonald, was reinforced with Maxims and artillery {{and followed the}} main force at around 1350 m. Curiously, the supplies and wounded around Egeiga were left almost unprotected.|$|R

As quartermaster, Cosgrave succeeded in obtaining a cow and her calves, which they milked to help feed the garrison.|$|R
50|$|The 2nd Engineer Battalion was {{the organic}} combat {{engineer}} battalion {{assigned to the}} 2nd Infantry Division. The battalion was ordered to hold the town of Kunu-Ri <b>protecting</b> the <b>rear</b> and right flank of the Eighth Army as it retreated. Companies from the battalion were attached to two infantry regiments, the 9th and 38th, to fill gaps in the defending lines.|$|R
50|$|Bell's hinge-back {{tortoise}} is {{a medium-sized}} light brown tortoise. They can {{grow up to}} 22 cm. On the back of its shell, the tortoise has a 90 degree hinge which, when closed, can <b>protect</b> its <b>rear</b> legs and tail from predators. This broad band of flexible connective tissue is located between the 4th and 5th costals and the 7th and 8th peripherals in adults.|$|R
50|$|Ord, {{leading the}} 10,000 strong 3rd Brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves set out west from Langley {{to clear the}} south bank of the Potomac River of Confederate pickets and partisans in Fairfax and Loudoun. At Colvin Run Mill, Ord left half his force to <b>protect</b> his <b>rear</b> and prevent his force from being cut off from their base at Langley. The battle {{resulted}} in a Union victory.|$|R
50|$|The Jatimatic lacks {{a folding}} stock common for {{this class of}} firearm; the weapon is instead fired {{unsupported}} from the hip or raised arm, without resting the firearm on the shooter's shoulder. However, aftermarket stocks are available which fasten to the lower side of the pistol grip and give it much greater accuracy, while also <b>protecting</b> the <b>rear</b> sight from being bent or broken.|$|R
50|$|The Visa's rear {{parcel shelf}} was in two hinged sections, one in the car, {{the other on the}} tailgate, to allow objects that were {{slightly}} too tall to still fit without removing the shelf. When carrying larger loads, the part of the shelf attached to the tailgate could be folded up, and fixed with the elasticated support strings, to <b>protect</b> the <b>rear</b> window and heated rear screen elements.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1943 the Germans lost their {{strategic}} initiative on the Eastern front and were dislodged far to the West. Lithuania {{was no longer a}} remote and quiet country to <b>protect</b> their <b>rear.</b> Due to unsuccessful military and labour mobilization, and spreading armed underground activities of the Soviets, the German forces consolidated the mass repressions in Lithuania, but proclaimed the locals responsible for the acts of sabotage.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Westport {{began in}} earnest {{on the morning of}} the October 23. Pleasonton's cavalry was hot on the tail of Price's army, having engaged his rear guard in nearby Independence the {{previous}} day. Brig. Gen. John S. Marmaduke's Confederate division had stopped Pleasonton just west of Independence, and now held the west bank of the Big Blue at Byram's Ford to <b>protect</b> Price's <b>rear</b> from an expected Union attack.|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{simplifying}} the fabrication process of our near-industrial n-type silicon solar cells with screen-printed aluminium-alloyed rear emitter. We investigate the structural and electrical properties of Al emitters alloyed on differently prepared Si surfaces. We {{demonstrate that the}} formation of a proper emitter neither requires a planar nor a non-diffused rear surface, thus allowing both-sided surface texturing and both-sided phosphorous doping during the n+ front surface field diffusion without the need of an additional <b>protecting</b> <b>rear</b> masking layer. On textured surfaces a careful choice of the printing and alloying conditions is essential to obtain Al-p+ emitters without shunts in form of locally non-alloyed regions. By adjusting the alloying conditions or by applying a simple rear surface conditioning step, shunts can be effectively prevented, thereby simultaneously increasing the internal reflectance and reducing the Al-p+ emitter saturation current density. Al alloying on P-diffused rear surfaces is shown to be uncritical. In summary, we demonstrate that Al alloying for p+ emitter formation can be easily realised on textured and P-diffused surfaces leading to a much more flexible fabrication of our n-type silicon solar cells...|$|R

Before it left on the March to the Sea, XVII Corps absorbed part of the detachment of XVI Corps that had served with Sherman.|$|R
50|$|Early open-bodied touring-type {{automobiles}} used tonneau covers to <b>protect</b> unoccupied <b>rear</b> seats. As {{early as}} the 1930s, lakes racers, searching for that extra competitive edge, pulled a page directly from early aircraft construction and skinned the cockpits of their roadsters and streamliners with removable canvas. The skins covered gaping cockpits that would otherwise disturb airflow and create undue drag; as a result, tonneau-equipped cars ultimately went faster with a given amount of power.|$|R
50|$|During the Valley Campaigns of 1864, while General Philip Sheridan {{drove up}} the Shenandoah Valley he faced a {{significant}} threat to his rear and supply lines from Mosby's Rangers based east of the Blue Ridge in Loudoun and Fauquier. Subsequently, {{he was forced to}} dedicate significant resources to <b>protecting</b> his <b>rear.</b> Furthermore, Mosby and other partisans in Loudoun routinely raided Union garrisons in Fairfax County and along the Potomac River in Maryland.|$|R
