The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying <b>perishable</b> <b>goods</b> such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing <b>perishable</b> <b>goods</b> to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E

It has to be sold immediately to customers whose offers arrive on-line. More formally, we consider the online scheduling problem with preemptions, where each job j is revealed at release time rj, has processing time pj, deadline dj and weight wj. The goal is to maximize the total weight of all jobs completed on time. Our main result is that if all jobs have processing time not more than k, then the deterministic competitive ratio of this problem is Θ(k / log k). ...|$|R

In many cases, later roads for motor vehicles follow paths used by bullock carts which followed tracks made for humans. These in turn in some cases became highways – with attendant problems all over New Zealand (but especially in the more mountainous regions), as the geography and contours of a slow-speed road {{laid out in the}} first half of the 20th century usually do not conform to safety and comfort criteria of modern motor vehicles.|$|E

The economy has a single <b>perishable</b> <b>good</b> and fiat money within an overlapping generations framework with two possible extraneous events. The analysis uses the dynamic adjustment of market prices during voluntary trade to establish paths of current spot prices whose limit points are rational expectations equilibria. The paper shows that there is a sub-set of paths whose limit points are self-fulfilling if they are perfectly correlated with extraneous events. It is this sub-set that constitutes sunspot equilibria. Two implications of this approach follow: (a) the likelihood of this existence is generally low; and (b) adding an asset (or a commodity) to the economy invalidates the demonstration of existence.

25|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the galley, there was no clear distinction between ships of trade and war other than their actual usage. River boats plied the waterways of ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2700–2200 BC) and seagoing galley-like vessels were recorded bringing back luxuries from across the Red Sea in the reign of pharaoh Hatshepsut. Fitting rams to the bows of vessels sometime around the 8th century BC resulted in a distinct split in the design of warships, and set trade vessels apart, at least when it came to use in naval warfare. The Phoenicians used galleys for transports that were less elongated, carried fewer oars and relied more on sails. Carthaginian galley wrecks found off Sicily that date to the 3rd or 2nd century BC had a length to breadth ratio of 6:1, proportions that fell between the 4:1 of sailing merchant ships and the 8:1 or 10:1 of war galleys.

Each agent is a potential producer and consumer of a service (or <b>perishable</b> <b>good)</b> but has stochastic preferences that determines his taste for the good in each period in time. Money serves as a medium of exchange as well as a store of value. We prove existence of stationary fix-price equilibria with exogenously given quantity of money in which transactions can take place at non-Walrasian prices.

This paper {{examines}} {{a dynamic}} {{version of the}} newsboy problem in which a decision maker must maintain service capacity from several sources to meet demand for a <b>perishable</b> <b>good,</b> subject {{to the cost of}} providing sufficient capacity, and penalties for not meeting demand. The focus application is the real-time operation of an electric power network in which there are multiple sources of power that are distinguished by their cost, as well as their responsiveness in terms of ‘ramp rate’. A complete characterization of the optimal outcome is obtained when normalized de-mand is modeled as Brownian motion. The optimal policy is affine: It is characterized by affine switching curves in the multidimensional state space. The optimal affine pa-rameters are functions of variability in demand, production variables, and the cost of insufficient capacity...|$|R

The stage game {{does not have an}} equilibrium in pure strategies. We run experiments for markets with two and three identical firms. Firms tend to cooperate to avoid fights, but when they fight bankruptcies are rather frequent. On average, pricing behavior is closer to that for pure quantity than for pure price competition and price and efficiency levels are higher for two than for three firms. Consumer surplus increases with the number of firms, but unsold production leads to higher efficiency losses with more firms. Over time prices tend to the highest possible one for markets both with two and three firms. Experiments, Oligopoly, Collusion...|$|R

In the implemented treatments subjects are asked to make both production and pricing decisions given different information sets. We investigate how subjects decide on prices and quantities in response to signals from the firms' internal conditions, i. e., individual profits, excess demand, and excess supply, and the market environment, i. e., aggregate price level. We find persistent heterogeneity in individual behavior, with about 46 % of market followers, 28 % profit-adjusters and 26 % demand adjusters. Nevertheless, prices and quantities tend to converge to the monopolistically competitive equilibrium and we find that subjects' behavior is well described by learning heuristics...|$|R
5|$|At these lower prices, ice {{began to}} sell in {{considerable}} volumes, with the market moving beyond the wealthy elite to {{a wider range of}} consumers, to the point where supplies became overstretched. It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve <b>perishable</b> <b>good,</b> rather than for direct consumption. Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised a new form of horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). Sawdust to insulate the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|R
