5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level in}} the game is {{intended}} to have a unique theme, in either fiction or game mechanic. In one level, the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover. In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given a device that lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift {{back and forth between}} the two <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{images of}} Szczerbiec from various <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> {{indicate}} that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on the hilt in variable configurations. The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated {{on each side of}} the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was different, with the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of the hilt displayed the symbols of all four of the Evangelists.|$|E

5000|$|For any finite <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> t, {{there can}} be only finitely many events in the flow that occur at time t or earlier. This implies that in which flow, one can always point to the <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> at which the flow originated. The flow itself can be infinite; in such case, at any <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> {{eventually}} a new event {{will appear in the}} flow.|$|R
50|$|A data {{synchronization}} {{point is}} a <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> It is {{used to assess the}} way in which data backups relate to each other. Data backups need to be related to each other correctly when considering the time of day they were made, or their relationship to computer system activity events. A data synchronization {{point is a}} <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> when a set of backups exist which if restored from can be synchronized to the same <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> Often this <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> is some hours before the last backup is completed, i.e., some hours before the data synchronization point. Backups that have no synchronization points are generally useless.|$|R
5|$|The overall {{effort by}} Someshvara IV {{to rebuild the}} Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After {{the fall of the}} Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas {{continued}} warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western Deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|In the story, Booster Gold {{is charged}} by Rip Hunter {{to go back}} in time and save Barbara from being shot by the Joker. Booster arrives at the {{carnival}} shortly after the Joker has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape (after the Joker torments him), but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip removes Booster moments before he is killed, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate to Booster that some <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point.|$|E
40|$|A two-way causal {{relationship}} between telecommunications infrastructure investment and economic development, {{established for the}} US economy in previous analysis, is tested at the more localized state and sub-state level and for two specific sub-categories of telecommunications infrastructure investment - central office equipment, and cable and wire. For time series of these two sub-categories of telecommunications investment compiled for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and two countries within Pennsylvania this analysis tests two causal hypotheses consistent with the US national-level analysis: First, the level of economic activity at any <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> is a reliable predictor ('cause') {{of the amount of}} telecommunications investment at a later <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> Second, the amount of telecommunications investment at any <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> is a reliable predictor ('cause') of the level of economic activity at a later <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|After {{retiring}} to stud full-time, {{he had a}} {{very successful}} career. He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter Easy Date won the All American Futurity in 1974. Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired Pie In the Sky, the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner. More than 1,500 of his offspring earned their AQHA Race Register of Merit, and nine became World Champion Quarter Running Horses. Besides the horses already mentioned, the champions include My Easy Credit, Extra Easy, Easily Smashed, Easy Angel, Easy Move, and Megahertz. His foal Sunset Gallant Jet was the 1979 and 1980 AQHA High Point Cutting & Chariot Racing Co-Champion. At various <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> Easy Jet has led the AQHA's lists of All-time leading sires of sires, All-time leading sires of Register of Merit qualifiers, All-time leading sires of stakes winners, and All-time leading broodmare sires. In March 2008, he still led the list of All-time leading sires of Quarter Horse racehorses by winners, and on the corresponding list ordered by earnings, he ranks fourth. As a broodmare sire, or maternal grandsire, of racehorses, Easy Jet led the All-time leading lists by winners in March 2008, and the same list ordered by earnings had him second. As of 2008, his offspring had earned over $26,000,000 on the racetrack. In total, he sired 2,507foals in 25years of breeding.|$|E

25|$|Often such {{problems}} {{are subject to}} linear equality constraints that prevent all objectives from being simultaneously perfectly met, especially {{when the number of}} controllable variables is less than the number of objectives and when the presence of random shocks generates uncertainty. Commonly a multi-objective quadratic objective function is used, with the cost associated with an objective rising quadratically with the distance of the objective from its ideal value. Since these problems typically involve adjusting the controlled variables at various <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and/or evaluating the objectives at various <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> intertemporal optimization techniques are employed.|$|E
