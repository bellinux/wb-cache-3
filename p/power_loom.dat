25|$|Improvements to the <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> in {{the early}} 1840s, and the {{construction}} of a railway line in 1846, led to greater investment in power looms in Blackburn {{in the second half of}} that decade. The railway brought opportunities for expansion of the cotton trade, and in subsequent decades many new mills were constructed: between 1850 and 1870, 68weaving-only and four combined weaving/spinning mills were built and nine weaving mills were built per decade between 1870 and 1890.|$|E

50|$|Malegaon is {{major hub}} for cloth weaving using {{early twentieth century}} <b>power</b> <b>looms.</b> The era of <b>power</b> <b>looms</b> in Malegaon emerged after 1935. Malegaon was a {{traditional}} handloom-weaving centre in Maharashtra. Most of the preparatory work before weaving like starching the yarn, transferring it over the tubes, preparing tanabana {{was done by the}} women. Even after <b>power</b> <b>looms</b> were introduced, women continued to help their menfolk in the weaving procedure.|$|R
25|$|In 1830, {{using an}} 1822 patent, Richard Roberts {{manufactured}} the first loom with a cast-iron frame, the Roberts Loom. In 1842 James Bullough and William Kenworthy, made the Lancashire Loom. It is a semiautomatic <b>power</b> <b>loom.</b> Although it is self-acting, {{it has to}} be stopped to recharge empty shuttles. It was the mainstay of the Lancashire cotton industry for a century, when the Northrop Loom invented in 1894 with an automatic weft replenishment function gained ascendancy.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of modern textile machinery {{such as the}} spinning jenny, <b>power</b> <b>loom,</b> and cotton gin brought in more profits, and cotton towns, “more benign than the British” came to be established in the country. Following the end of slavery in the southern states the boll weevil, a pest from Mexico, began to spread across the United States, affecting yields drastically as it moved east. The fashion cloth of the blue jeans furthered boom of cotton for three decades. Adoption of chemical pesticides to reduce diseases and thus increase yield of the crop further boosted production. Further innovations {{in the form of}} genetic engineering and of nanotechnology are an encouraging development for the growth of cotton.|$|E
25|$|These {{represent}} three 'leading sectors', {{in which}} there were key innovations, which allowed the economic take off by which the Industrial Revolution is usually defined. This is not to belittle many other inventions, particularly in the textile industry. Without earlier ones, such as the spinning jenny and flying shuttle in the textile industry and the smelting of pig iron with coke, these achievements might have been impossible. Later inventions such as the <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> and Richard Trevithick's high pressure steam engine were also important in the growing industrialisation of Britain. The application of steam engines to powering cotton mills and ironworks enabled these {{to be built in}} places that were most convenient because other resources were available, rather than where there was water to power a watermill.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>power</b> <b>looms,</b> the cloth industry in Malegaon flourished due to increased productivity. Many people bought <b>power</b> <b>looms</b> and very few were left with handlooms.It has an estimated 3 lakh <b>power</b> <b>looms</b> producing about 1 crore (10 million) meters of cloth every day. It attracts workers from various part of India, majority of migrants from U.P., Khandesh and Deccan, due to lower cost of living and Muslim dominance.|$|R

25|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1808 in Mystic, Connecticut, {{the son of a}} blacksmith. As a boy, Mason spent time in his father's shops. He left home at the age of {{thirteen}} and worked as an operator in the spinning room of a small cotton factory in Canterbury, Connecticut. He was a born mechanical genius and could repair the most complicated machine in the mill. At the age of sixteen he went to East Haddam, where a mill for the manufacture of thread was being established, to start the machines. At seventeen he worked at the machine shop connected with the mill, where he stayed for three years. It was here he set up the first <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> in the country for the manufacture of diaper linen. He also constructed an ingenious loom for the weaving of damask table cloths.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> {{efficiency}} {{meant that}} weaving, {{the primary source}} of wealth and income for handloom weavers, began to transfer from the cottage industry to factories. This led to high rates of unemployment: according to figures published in March 1826, some 60% of all handloom weavers in Blackburn and Rishton, Lower Darwen and Oswaldtwistle were unemployed. High unemployment led to the Lancashire weavers' riots. At 3:00pm on 24 April 1826 a mob arrived in Blackburn after attacking powerlooms in Accrington. Proceeding to Bannister Eccles' Jubilee Factory on Jubilee Street, the mob destroyed 212powerlooms in the space of 35minutes. They then turned their attention to John Houghton and Sons' Park Place factory, located nearby, and destroyed another 25 looms, before seeking more machinery to attack. The crowd began to disperse at around 6:00pm, troops having arrived at 3:30pm to try to quell the rioting.|$|E
25|$|The plain Hattersley Domestic Loom was {{specially}} {{developed for}} cottage or home use {{and designed to}} replace the wooden handloom; the Domestic is similar in construction to a <b>power</b> <b>loom.</b> It was introduced ca.1900 and the makers claimed that a speed of 160 picks per minute could be easily attained with from 2 to 8 shafts weaving a variety of fabrics. Because foot pedals, or treadles, operate the loom it is still classed as a handloom, but {{it is much easier}} and faster to weave as all the motions of the loom are connected via crankshaft and gear wheels. Because the loom is designed to use only one shuttle when weaving, giving a solid colour in the weft, it is termed a plain loom. The cast metal chair, manufactured along with the loom, can be raised or lowered to suit, and the seat rocks forward and back as the weaver treadles the loom.|$|E

25|$|Before 1800, most cloth {{was made}} in home workshops, and housewives sewed it into {{clothing}} for family use or trade with neighbors. In 1810 {{the secretary of the}} treasury estimated that two-thirds of rural household clothing, including hosiery and linen, was produced by households. By the 1820s, housewives bought the cloth at local stores, and continued their sewing chores. The American textile industry was established during the long period of wars from 1793 to 1815, when cheap cloth imports from Britain were unavailable. Samuel Slater secretly brought in the plans for complex textile machinery from Britain, and build new factories in Rhode Island using the stolen designs. By the time the Embargo Act of 1807 cut off trade with Britain, there here were 15 cotton spinning mills in operation. These were all small operations, typically employing fewer than 50 people, and most used Arckwright water frames powered by small streams. They were all located in southeastern New England. In 1809 the number of mills had grown to 62, with 25 under construction. To meet increased demand for cloth several manufacturers resorted to the putting-out system of having the handloom weaving done in homes. The putting-out system was inefficient because of the difficulty of distributing the yarn and collecting the cloth, embezzlement of supplies, lack of supervision and poor quality. To overcome these problems the textile manufacturers began to consolidate work in central workshops shops where they could supervise operations. Taking this to the next level, in 1815 Francis Cabot Lowell of the Boston Manufacturing Company built the first integrated spinning and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using plans for a <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> that he smuggled out of England. This was the largest factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the Tariff of 1816, competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many smaller operations were being forced out of business.|$|E
500|$|The Turk {{was visited}} in London by Rev. Edmund Cartwright in 1784. He was so {{intrigued}} by the Turk that he would later question whether [...] "it {{is more difficult to}} construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game". Cartwright would patent the prototype for a <b>power</b> <b>loom</b> within the year. Sir Charles Wheatstone, an inventor, saw a later appearance of the Turk while it was owned by Mälzel. He also saw some of Mälzel's speaking machines, and Mälzel later presented a demonstration of the speaking machines to the researcher and his teenage son. Alexander Graham Bell obtained a copy of a book by Kempelen on speaking machines after being inspired by seeing a similar machine built by Wheatstone; Bell went on to file the first successful patent for the telephone.|$|E

6000|$|But turn to {{consider}} {{the magnitude of the}} change that has come about with the era of machinery and the indescribable increase which it has brought to man's power over his environment. There is no need to recite here in detail the marvelous record of mechanical progress that constituted the [...] "industrial revolution" [...] of the eighteenth century. The utilization of coal for the smelting of iron ore; the invention of machinery that could spin and weave; the application of the undreamed energy of steam as a motive force, the building of canals and the making of stone roads--these proved but the beginnings. Each stage of invention called for a further advance. The quickening of one part of the process necessitated the [...] "speeding up" [...] of all the others. It placed a premium--a reward already in sight--upon the next advance. Mechanical spinning called forth the <b>power</b> <b>loom.</b> The increase in production called for new means of transport. The improvement of transport still further swelled the volume of production. The steamboat of 1809 and the steam locomotive of 1830 were the direct result of what had gone before. Most important of all, the movement had become a conscious one. Invention was no longer the fortuitous result of a happy chance. Mechanical progress, the continual increase of power and the continual surplus of product became {{an essential part of the}} environment, and an unconscious element in the thought and outlook of the civilized world.|$|E
