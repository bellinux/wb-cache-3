40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate {{the possibility of using}} a clay from the city of Silva Jardim, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the composition of <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> body. The clay investigated was a plastic kaolinitic type with white color. Initially, a typical porcelain body composed of the mixture of this clay with feldspar, quartz, kaolin and talc was prepared. Specimens were then obtained from this porcelain mixture by uniaxially pressing samples until a dry density of 2. 0 g/cm 3 was achieved. These specimens were then fired at 1180 °C in a laboratory furnace. Physical and mechanical properties related to linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural rupture strength, determined by Weibull statistical method, were evaluated. Microstructural analysis for the experimental body was performed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and mercury porosimetry. The technological properties of the elaborated composition satisfied the <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> standard specifications.

The study then reviews the major scientific and technological advances, focusing principally on the developments in raw materials compositions resulting from the introduction of certain key raw materials to enhance composition quality. As the interpretation of unfired body microstructure, and the relation of unfired tile microstructure to processability and to sintered tile microstructure and properties have drawn particular attention from the scientific community, the paper addresses these issues in depth.

40|$|<b>Porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> is a {{high-performance}} ceramic tile, in which quartz {{is a major}} compositional component. After the firing cycle, macroscopic residual stresses develop in the product {{as a result of}} rapid cooling. Further, during cooling, the presence of quartz particles also increases natural flaw size. Both phenomena significantly affect the product's mechanical behaviour. This study examines the effect of quartz particle size on the mechanical behaviour of <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> subjected to two very different cooling rates: a rapid or a slow cooling rate. A series of <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> compositions were designed for this purpose, in which quartz particle size was varied. The mechanical behaviour of the sintered pieces was evaluated on the basis of linear elastic fracture mechanics. It was verified that, in the slowly cooled material, the modulus of elasticity and fracture energy increased, and natural flaw size decreased as quartz particle size decreased. However, fracture energy also diminished in pieces that contained excessively small particles, with an advanced state of dissolution. For the rapidly cooled material, though the larger sized quartz particles debonded at higher temperatures owing to thermal stress, their presence, even in small quantities, contributed to natural flaw growth. The lower fracture energy associated with this last type of piece also favours this phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> is {{a ceramic}} product with high {{technical}} and aesthetic performance, whose composition is formulated from {{a mixture of}} clay or kaolin, quartz and feldspar. This paper is {{the first part of}} a study focusing on determining the influence of the <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> composition on mechanical behaviour of sintered bodies. Seven compositions were prepared according to a simplex-centroid mixture design for a triaxial mixture, comprised of kaolinite, quartz and albite. The mixtures were processed reproducing industrial conditions: wet mixing followed by spray-drying, forming by pressing and fast firing with maximum temperatures ranged from 1210 to 1260 °C. The presence of kaolinite increases the dry apparent density in a significant way up to 30 wt%. Because of the fast firing, the microstructure is directly influenced by particle packing after forming. The internal porosity presented little change as a function of starting composition in the tested intervals. The surface porosity of the polished product increased with higher amounts of quartz. The results obtained in this first part of the study showed how the starting and end composition could generate the microstructure and suggest its influence on the mechanical properties of the <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile,</b> which will be later analysed {{in the second part of}} this paper...|$|R

The Irwin equation and the experimental data were treated according to a Taylor's series expansion. This methodology {{made it possible to}} evaluate the mechanisms which are more relevant for strengthening and the role of each component of the system. It was observed that the phase composition affects markedly the mechanical strength of <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile</b> mainly by changes in fracture energy. Young's modulus and flaw size have also a notable but less important influence. Wide variations in flaw size can cause a more severe impact on the mechanical strength. In turn, the fracture energy is equally affected by the state of microscopic residual stress and the deflection in crack propagation. Regarding to the contributions of the each phase component, it was noticed that mullite and kaolinite glass significantly worsen the fracture energy while quartz particles have a decisive contribution on increasing the fracture energy. Finally, the results confirm once again that the Selsing equation can be used for estimating microscopic residual stress on quartz particles in <b>porcelain</b> <b>tile...</b>|$|R
