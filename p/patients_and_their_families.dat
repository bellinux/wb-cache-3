The American Medical Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a physician's recommendation for the HPV vaccine also contributes to low vaccination rates and controversy surrounding the vaccine. A 2015 study of national physician communication {{and support for the}} HPV vaccine found physicians routinely recommend HPV vaccines less strongly than they recommend Tdap or meningitis vaccines, find the discussion about HPV to be long and burdensome, and discuss the HPV vaccine last, after all other vaccines. Researchers suggest these factors discourage patients and parents from setting up timely HPV vaccines. In order to increase vaccination rates, this issue must be addressed and physicians should be better trained to handle discussing the importance of the HPV vaccine with <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b>|$|E

25|$|Soldiers {{who claimed}} to have been exposed to {{chemical}} warfare have often presented with unusual medical conditions which has led to much controversy. The lack of information has left doctors, <b>patients,</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> in the dark in terms of prognosis and treatment. Nerve agents such as sarin, tabun, and soman are believed to have the most significant long-term health effects. Chronic fatigue and memory loss have been reported to last up to three years after exposure. In the years following World War One, there were many conferences held in attempts to abolish the use of chemical weapons all together, such as The Washington Conference (1921–22), Geneva Conference (1923–25) and the World Disarmament Conference (1933). Although the United States was an original signatory of the Geneva Protocol in 1925, the US Senate did not formally ratify it until 1975.|$|E
25|$|Her husband {{left his}} {{engineering}} firm and enrolled at Columbia University in 1971 {{with a major}} in hospital planning. It was his master's degree thesis that provided the framework for the Connecticut Hospice. Wald conducted a two-year research program studying how terminally ill patients fared {{at home or in}} a healthcare facility, and tracked how <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> felt throughout the process. After returning to the United States, she organized a team of doctors, clergy and nurses to investigate the needs of dying patients. In 1974, she, along with two pediatricians and a Yale medical center chaplain, founded the first hospice in the United States at the Connecticut Hospice, located in Branford, Connecticut. Initially the program provided home care, and had its first inpatient location in 1980, a 44-bed facility in Branford. Disagreements had been brewing within the board about her vision for the hospice program, and she was forced to resign shortly after its opening.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} {{are two of}} the most feared cancer treatment-related side-effects for cancer <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> In 1983, Coates et al. found that patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea {{and vomiting}} as the first and second most severe side-effects, respectively. Up to 20% of patients receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed, or even refused, potentially curative treatments. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are common with many treatments and some forms of cancer. Since the 1990s, several novel classes of antiemetics have been developed and commercialized, becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens, and helping to successfully manage these symptoms in a large portion of patients. Effective mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes-crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient and more efficient treatment cycles, due to less stoppage of treatment due to better tolerance by the patient, and due to better overall health of the patient.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Bachelor's thesis was to examine through {{literature}} review the already existing written measures assessing {{the needs of the}} <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members concerning support and counselling. The objective was to provide a “cross-section ” of these. The focus of the thesis was on family nursing, {{which is part of the}} good nursing care of today. The idea for the thesis came from the Pirkanmaa Hospital District. There are not that many written measures assessing the needs of the <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members. The literature review resulted in seven different written measures that were taken under study. These written measures were all somehow disease specific. None of the measures were targeted both to <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> family members, they were only either or. However some of the measures assessed both the need of support and counselling, and not only one of the needs. The author recommends further research of family nursing in adult setting and development of more universal measures assessing the need of support <b>and</b> counselling of <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members, which could be adopted to use amongst different kind of patient groups...|$|R

25|$|The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) {{has been}} shown to be quite {{effective}} for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to have families intervene and support the teens. Working with BN <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent's food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.|$|E
