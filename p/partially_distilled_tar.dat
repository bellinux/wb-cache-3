50|$|Robert Wilson first {{produced}} {{sulphuric acid}} and fertilisers at Urlay Nook near Egglescliffe in 1833 {{and this was}} Teesside's first great chemical works. In 1859 rock salt deposits were discovered at Middlesbrough by Henry Bolckow and Vaughan while boring for water {{at a depth of}} 1,206 feet and this led to the move to Teesside of the heavy chemical industry. In 1860 William James established an alkali company at Cargo Fleet and in 1869 Samuel Sadler also set up a factory nearby. Sadler's works produced synthetic aniline and alzarine dyestuffs and <b>distilled</b> <b>tar.</b> The introduction of the Solvay Process to make alkali in 1872 made the Tyneside alkali industry uneconomic but it was a real boost to Teesside industry which was invigorated by the discovery of further salt deposits at Port Clarence near Seal Sands by Bell Brothers in 1874. The Solvay process or ammonia-soda process is still today the major industrial process for the production of sodium carbonate. The process was developed into its modern form by Ernest Solvay during the 1860s and it requires salt brine and limestone as basic raw materials. The worldwide production of soda ash in 2005 has been estimated at 42 billion kilograms. Salt manufacture for human consumption by panning had taken place at Seal Sands since Roman times and in the 20th century, extraction of salt from the salt strata below ground in the Seal Sands area, known as the Saltholme Brine Fields, has left salt caverns which are now used as liquid/gas strorage facilities for the process industry.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study those factors which control {{the rate at which}} salts, such as magnesium chloride and sodium chloride, are removed from titanium sponge. The sponge was prepared by reducing titanium tetrachloride with either magnesium or sodium, and the resulting sponge salt mixtures were treated by vacuum evaporation to remove the salts. As the temperature, bulk density, and surface to volume ratio of samples were varied, measurements were made of the rate of salt evaporation in a vacuum. A constant-rate and falling-rate period were observed during the drying process. An apparatus was constructed and measurements were made of the thermal diffusivity of titanium sponge compacts and industrial titanium sponge. A computer program was developed to incorporate experimentally determined data to simulate both heat and mass transfer during the salt removal process for an industrial sized sponge cake. The program yields transient concentration and temperature profiles throughout the sponge cake and shows the effect of controllable variables such as sponge geometry, reactor size and heat transfer boundary conditions. An estimate of the mass transport coefficient within a sponge block was made by comparing experimentally determined and computer calculated salt concentration profiles of <b>partially</b> <b>distilled</b> sponge compacts...|$|R
40|$|Synthesizing {{complex and}} large {{molecules}} out of small molecules derived by fermentation processes {{is a key}} factor for future processes based on renewable resources. Promising steps are the self-condensation of alcohols and the cross-condensation of alcohols with acetone. The presented continuous heterogeneous-catalytic gas-phase process {{makes it possible to}} condense small alcohols and ketones to larger hydrocarbon molecules containing only one atom of oxygen per molecule. After an optional oxygen-removing step such as hydrotreatment, fuel-identical hydrocarbons including jet fuel can be obtained. A tailor-made carbon chain distribution and additionally carbon-chain branching can be achieved. The choice of raw materials, the process conditions and the recycling of intermediate products are tuning factors. The crude or <b>partially</b> <b>distilled</b> product can be used neat as drop-in fuel for diesel. The intermediates – longer ketones, primary and secondary alcohols – also serve as value-added raw materials and intermediates for many chemical applications, i. e. plasticizers, surfactants, alkenes, solvents, fatty alcohols, and lubricants. The presented process offers an attractive alternative to other competing processes producing long-chain hydrocarbons, like Fischer-Tropsch or hydrotreatment of fats and oils. Being based on inexpensive, long-term stable and commercially available catalysts and designed {{for a wide range of}} possible raw materials optionally stemming from residues, the suggested route is ready for scale-up. Future process development can be performed on data already gathered on a bench-scale process allowing the production of 10 liters of purified product per week...|$|R

25|$|Because wood-tar {{creosote}} is {{used for}} its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with {{a higher proportion of}} those chemicals to other phenolics. The creosote can be obtained by <b>distilling</b> the wood <b>tar</b> and treating the fraction heavier than water with a sodium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid. This produces a crude creosote, which is purified by re-solution in alkali and re-precipitation with acid and then redistilled with the fraction passing over between 200° and 225° constituting the purified creosote.|$|R

40|$|Anthraquinone (AQ) (9, 10 -anthracenedione) is an {{important}} compound in commerce. Many structurally related AQ derivatives are medicinal natural plant products. Examples include 1 -hydroxyanthraquinone (1 -OH-AQ) and 2 -hydroxyanthraquinone (2 -OH-AQ), which are also metabolites of AQ. Some commercial AQ is produced by the oxidation of anthracene (AQ-OX). In the recent past, the anthracene used was <b>distilled</b> from coal <b>tar</b> and different lots of derived AQ often contained polycyclic aromatic hy-drocarbon contaminants, particularly 9 -nitroanthracene (9 -NA).

5000|$|Set up in 1633, {{a private}} pitch boilery started to produce pitch (by boiling tar) on the island, pitch {{at the time}} being both {{frequently}} used at the city's abundant shipyards and an important national trade item. The operations must have had quite an impact, since Queen Christina (1626-1689) when handing the area over to the city in 1647, explains she wished to see storehouses built on Bäck- eller Tiärholmen (The [...] "Pitch" [...] or [...] "Tar Islet") for [...] "the advantage and benefit {{of the city and}} the residents". Thus having both its name and reputation set, the islet was bestowed a <b>tar</b> <b>distilling</b> workshop, originally intended for the north-eastern shores of Södermalm, replacing the boilery during the 1680s. Private entrepreneurs took charge of the island in 1717 and, in spite of a devastating fire in 1723, developed it into an important part of their trading house.|$|R
50|$|The simple phenols are not {{the only}} active element in wood-tar creosote. In solution, they {{coagulate}} albumin, which is a water-soluble protein found in meat; so they serve as a preserving agent, but also cause denaturation. Most of the phenols in the creosote are methoxy derivatives—they contain the methoxy group linked to the benzene nucleus (O - CH3). The high level of methyl derivates created from the action of heat on wood (also apparent in the methyl alcohol produced through distillation) make wood-tar creosote substantially different from coal-tar creosote. Guaiacol is a methyl ether of pyrocatechin, while creosol is a methyl ether of methyl-pyrocatechin, the next homolog of pyrocatechin. Methyl ethers differ from simple phenols in being less hydrophilic, caustic and poisonous. This allows meat to successfully be preserved without tissue denaturation, and allows creosote {{to be used as a}} medical ointment.Because wood-tar creosote is used for its guaiacol and creosol content, it is generally derived from beechwood rather than other woods, since it distills with a higher proportion of those chemicals to other phenolics.
