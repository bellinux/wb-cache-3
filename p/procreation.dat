5|$|The poem {{is part of}} the Fair Youth {{sequence}} (which comprises sonnets 1–126 in {{the accepted}} numbering stemming from the first edition in 1609). It is also the first of the cycle after the opening sequence now described as the <b>procreation</b> sonnets. Some scholars, however, contend that it {{is part of the}} <b>procreation</b> sonnets, as it addresses the idea of reaching eternal life through the written word, a theme they find in sonnets 15–17. In this view, it can be seen as part of a transition to sonnet 20's time theme.|$|E
5|$|The term gene was {{introduced}} by Danish botanist, plant physiologist and geneticist Wilhelm Johannsen in 1905. It is inspired by the ancient Greek: γόνος, gonos, that means offspring and <b>procreation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Larissa Lai's novel Salt Fish Girl (2002) depicts lesbian {{relationships}} {{in the context of}} a dystopian corporate future. The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to <b>procreation</b> and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E
5|$|A similar tale {{of divine}} {{seduction}} appears in Greek mythology, where Zeus, a king-of-the-gods figure akin to Indra, seduces Alcmene by assuming {{the form of}} her husband, resulting in {{the birth of the}} legendary hero Heracles. Like Ahalya, Alcmene falls victim to Zeus's trickery in some versions or, recognising his true identity, proceeds with the affair in others. The main difference between the tales is that the raison-d'être of Alcmene's seduction is the justification of Heracles's divine parentage, so she is never condemned as an adulteress or punished; in contrast, Ahalya faces the ire of the scriptures as her encounter is regarded as purely erotic (not resulting in <b>procreation).</b>|$|E
5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through family of origin, marriage and <b>procreation</b> as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples of patriarchal attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however be noted that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. In these communities, {{the head of the}} family is the oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively gender-neutral.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and <b>procreation</b> of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of <b>procreation</b> in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E
5|$|In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna {{are portrayed}} as icons of affection and {{intimate}} friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet {{and when they are}} thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for <b>procreation</b> and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.|$|E
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers, {{but have not}} been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus, and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps {{the result of the}} physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of <b>procreation,</b> including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of senescence. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, African buffalo, and rhinoceros. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality.|$|E

25|$|The {{encyclical}} {{opens with}} an assertion of the competency of the magisterium of the Catholic Church to decide questions of morality. It {{then goes on}} to observe that circumstances often dictate that married couples should limit the number of children, and that the sexual act between husband and wife is still worthy even if it can be foreseen not to result in <b>procreation.</b> Nevertheless, it is held that the sexual act must retain its intrinsic relationship to the <b>procreation</b> of human life.|$|E

25|$|On January 10, 2007, the Washington Defense of Marriage Alliance, {{an activist}} {{organization}} that, despite its name, favored marriage rights for same-sex couples, filed a voter initiative, Initiative 957, to incorporate {{part of the}} Andersen decision into state statutes by making <b>procreation</b> a requirement for all marriages in Washington State. The group's stated rationale was to prompt public examination of the premise that marriage exists {{for the purpose of}} <b>procreation</b> and to create a test case in which Andersen would be reversed. The initiative's sponsors withdrew it on July 3, after failing to gather a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the November ballot.|$|E
25|$|Married couples {{should also}} {{understand}} that sexual relations within marriage are divinely approved {{not only for the}} purpose of <b>procreation,</b> but also as a way of expressing love and strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife.|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 17 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is the final poem of what are {{referred}} to by scholars as the <b>procreation</b> sonnets (Sonnets 1-17) with which the Fair Youth sequence opens.|$|E
25|$|In the 1870s feminists {{advanced}} {{the concept of}} voluntary motherhood as a political critique of involuntary motherhood and expressing a desire for women's emancipation. Advocates for voluntary motherhood disapproved of contraception, arguing that women should only engage in sex {{for the purpose of}} <b>procreation</b> and advocated for periodic or permanent abstinence.|$|E
25|$|Cott {{was then}} cross-examined by David Thompson, who {{asked about her}} {{personal}} feelings on same-sex marriage to establish {{that she was an}} advocate rather than a dispassionate scholar. Defense counsel argued that marriage has traditionally been {{between a man and a}} woman because it provided a stable unit for <b>procreation</b> and child rearing.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanics}} of male orgasm {{are similar in}} most male mammals. Females of some mammal and some non-mammal species, such as alligators, have clitorises. There has been ongoing research about the sexuality and orgasms of dolphins, a species which apparently engages in sexual intercourse {{for reasons other than}} <b>procreation.</b> The duration of orgasm varies considerably among different mammal species.|$|E
25|$|An {{idea that}} avoids these {{shortcomings}} {{is that the}} Scandinavians might have practiced selective <b>procreation</b> leading to a shortage of women, and that the Vikings main motive for emigration was to acquire wives, although this would not explain why the Vikings chose to settle in other countries rather than bringing the women back with them to Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|Benedict {{broadened the}} meaning for sodomy to all sexual acts {{not related to}} <b>procreation</b> that were {{therefore}} deemed counter nature (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Every action {{specifically}} {{intended to}} prevent <b>procreation</b> is forbidden, except in medically necessary circumstances. Therapeutic means necessary to cure diseases are exempted, even if a foreseeable impediment to <b>procreation</b> should result, but only if infertility is not directly intended. This is held to directly contradict the moral order which was established by God. Abortion, even for therapeutic reasons, is absolutely forbidden, as is sterilization, even if temporary. Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (e.g., hysterectomy), {{if they are not}} specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), Natural family planning methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 19 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare and is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the final sonnet of the initial <b>procreation</b> sequence. The sonnet addresses time directly with the instruction to destroy its own weapons and to leave Shakespeare's beloved, the fair youth, unscathed. The theme is redemption, through art, of time's inevitable decay.|$|E
25|$|The Hindu {{tradition}} of Brahmacharya places great emphasis on abstinence {{as a way}} of harnessing the energy of body and mind towards the goal of spiritual realization. In males, the semen (Vīrya) is considered sacred, and its preservation (except when used for <b>procreation)</b> and conversion into higher life-energy (Ojas) is considered essential for the development of enhanced intellectual and spiritual capacities.|$|E
25|$|Since {{marriage}} is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and <b>procreation.</b> This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, {{whether he or she}} is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to zina, or adultery.|$|E
25|$|Many Orthodox hierarchs and theologians {{from around}} the world lauded Humanae vitae when it was issued. Among these Orthodox leaders, some teach that marital {{intercourse}} should be for <b>procreation</b> only, while others do not go as far and hold a view similar to the Roman Catholic position, which allows Natural Family Planning on principle {{while at the same time}} opposing artificial contraception.|$|E
25|$|After the Supreme Court {{issued its}} {{directive}} that courts must approve injunctions for same-sex marriage based on constitutional protections that rights must be equally provided without distinction to all people, PAN Deputy, María Eugenia Campos Galván, presented an initiative to the Chihuahuan Congress to limit marriage to {{one man and}} one woman {{for the purpose of}} <b>procreation.</b> Her proposal was supported by the PAN block of legislators.|$|E
25|$|The {{realistic}} {{detail in}} Moche ceramics {{may have helped}} them serve as didactic models. Older generations could pass down general knowledge about reciprocity and embodiment to younger generations through such portrayals. The sex pots could teach about <b>procreation,</b> sexual pleasure, cultural and social norms, a sort of immortality, and transfer of life and souls, transformation, {{and the relationship between}} the two cyclical views of nature and life.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle's {{analysis}} of <b>procreation</b> describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness {{as he did}} to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness {{need to be in}} women as well as men.|$|E
25|$|In some religions, {{some groups}} of people are {{expected}} to remain unmarried and to abstain from sex completely. These groups include monks, nuns, and priests in various sects of Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity. Chastity is required of the respective sacerdotal orders. The Shakers, on the other hand, impose chastity in the form of celibacy for all members, even forgoing <b>procreation</b> such as the case with the castration cult.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{does not}} {{consider}} at all illicit the use of those therapeutic means necessary to cure bodily diseases, even if a foreseeable impediment to <b>procreation</b> should result therefrom, {{so long as the}} contraceptive effect is not directly intended for any motive whatsoever. For example, the use of hormonal contraception as treatment for endometriosis rather than with contraceptive intent is not considered to conflict in any way with Catholic teaching.|$|E
25|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} {{declares}} his admiration {{and love for}} the beauty of youth, but warns this figure of youth that he will lose it if he doesn't revitalize himself through offspring. The primary arguments made in this <b>procreation</b> sonnet are the maintenance of self-identity and duty to one's own heritage. His tone throughout the sonnet is intimate, highlighting the theme of affection for youth that is prevalent in the first seventeen sonnets.|$|E
