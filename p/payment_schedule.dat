25|$|As part of Medicare's pricing system, {{relative}} value units (RVUs) {{are assigned to}} every medical procedure. One RVU translates into a dollar value that varies by region and by year; in 2005 the base (not location adjusted) RVU equaled roughly $37.90.

Thanks to John Wesley Powell, head of the U.S. Geological Survey, and Marsh's contacts with {{the rich and powerful}} in Washington, Marsh was placed {{at the head of the}} consolidated government survey and was happy to be out of the sensationalist spotlight. Cope was much less well-off, having spent most of his money purchasing The American Naturalist, and had a hard time finding employment thanks to Marsh's allies in higher education and his own temperament. Cope began investing in gold and silver prospects in the West, and braved malarial mosquitos and harsh weather to search for fossils himself. Due to setbacks in mining and a lack of support from the federal government, Cope's financial situation steadily deteriorated, to the point that his fossil collection was his only significant asset. Marsh, meanwhile, alienated even his loyal assistants, including Williston, with his refusal to share his conclusions drawn from their findings, and his continually lax and infrequent <b>payment</b> <b>schedule.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of {{commonly}} used <b>payment</b> <b>schedules</b> on the execution of investment projects which are produced to order over prolonged periods of time. It is shown that even if the parties settle on execution terms which maximize their joint benefits (assumed to reflect authentic social values), the contractor will generally be able�to secure additional gain, while creating social waste, by shifting the delivery date over time. Moreover, when payments are tied to work progress, he may also have an incentive to deploy inputs inefficiently over time for any given termination date. Some methods which eliminate those diseconomies, while preserving efficient features of existing <b>payment</b> <b>schedules,</b> are developed under increasingly complex assumptions concerning the project's nature. These methods are also adapted for an inflationary environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Contractual {{agreements}} {{have assumed}} significant complexity {{in recent times}} because {{of the emergence of}} strategies like outsourcing and partnering in the successful completion of large software development, manufacturing, and construction projects. A client and contractor enter into an agreement for a project either by bidding or negotiation. Effective and efficient bidding, negotiation, and subsequent monitoring are hindered by the lack of appropriate decision support tools for the management of project finances. Progress payments to the contractor are an important issue in project management because of their potential impact on project finances and activity schedules. In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously determining the amount, location, and timing of progress payments in projects from a client's perspective. We develop three mixed-integer linear programming models, based on some practical methods of determining <b>payment</b> <b>schedules</b> from different types of project contracts. We discuss properties of the models and draw insights about the characteristics of optimal <b>payment</b> <b>schedules</b> obtained with each model by an experimental study on a sample of 10 small projects. Our analysis shows that, contrary to current practice, the client obtains the greatest benefit by scheduling the project for early completion such that the payments are not made at regular intervals. It is also cost effective for the client to make payments either {{in the early stages of}} the project or toward the end, even though this causes considerable variation in the time gap between payments. We also evaluate the impact of the client's preferred <b>payment</b> <b>schedules</b> on the contractor's finances and activity schedules, and draw some conclusions on the interdependence of payment and project parameters on the objectives of both parties entering the contractual agreement. ...|$|R
