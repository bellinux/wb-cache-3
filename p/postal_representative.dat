60|$|It {{gives me}} {{pleasure}} {{to report a}} decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding years. The receipts {{for the fiscal year}} 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficiency in the Department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that Department in the interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a correspondence through the Department of State with foreign governments proposing a convention of <b>postal</b> <b>representatives</b> for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received.|$|R
50|$|In Sweden, no law {{has been}} {{introduced}} about compulsory identity documents. However, {{there is no law}} forbidding an authority or company to demand to see one, otherwise refusing service. Identity documents are needed in Sweden in certain commonly occurring situations, e.g. purchases using debit- or credit cards when not using a PIN, or picking up a package at the <b>postal</b> service <b>representatives,</b> or for age checking when purchasing alcoholic beverages, or to get medical care and medicines. A valid Swedish identity document is also required for opening a bank account or other situations where the use of Swedish personal identity number is required, although this varies from organisation to organisation. Car drivers mandatorily need the driver's license, and the police is also allowed to randomly check driver's licenses for drivers, normally done in combination with sobriety checks.|$|R

(Henry IV Part I, 3. 1. 53) Bill number 22, {{introduced}} by Congressman John McHugh in the first session of the 105 th Congress of the United States, proposes the most fundamental changes to American postal laws since 1970, when Congress abolished the Post Office Department and established the United States Postal Service. 2 Since Mr. McHugh chairs the only congressional committee devoted to postal policy 3 and the United States carries about 40 percent of the world’s mail, HR 22 — called the “Postal Reform Act of 1997 ” — has attracted a degree of attention in postal policy circles. The United States <b>Postal</b> Service, <b>representatives</b> of the large American direct mail industry, and competitors like United Parcel Service have all offered their alternatives to HR 22. This paper views HR 22 in the perspective gained by a consideration of these other proposals {{as well as a}} consideration of postal reform measures being implemented or studied in other developed countries. 1 POSTAL REFORM PROPOSALS IN THE UNITED STATES In the United States, as elsewhere, scholars and political activists have urged a variety of fundamental postal reforms ranging from repeal of the postal monopoly to sale of the Postal Service to private shareholders to breakup into regional units.

40|$|While {{scientific}} {{consensus and}} political and media messages {{appear to be}} increasingly certain, public attitudes and action towards the issue {{do not appear to}} be following suit. Popular and academic debate often assumes this is due to ignorance or misunderstanding on the part of the public, but some studies have suggested political beliefs and values may play a more important role in determining belief versus scepticism about climate change. The current research used two <b>representative</b> <b>postal</b> surveys of the UK public to: measure scepticism and uncertainty about climate change; determine how scepticism varies according to individual characteristics, knowledge and values; and examine how scepticism has changed over time. Findings show denial of climate change is less common than the perception that the issue has been exaggerated. Scepticism was found to be strongly determined by individuals’ environmental and political values (and indirectly by age, gender, location and lifestyle) rather than by education or knowledge. Between 2003 and 2008, public uncertainty about climate change has remained remarkably constant, although belief that claims about the issue are exaggerated has doubled over that period. These results are interpreted with reference to psychological concepts of motivated reasoning, confirmation bias and ‘finite pool of worry’. Implications for communication and policy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This study aims to {{describe}} the development, testing and optimization of a new standard instrument, the Consumer Quality Index (CQ-index ®) Long-term Care, for measuring client experiences with long-term care in the Netherlands. Methods Three versions of the CQ-index questionnaires and protocols for study sampling and data collection were developed, designed for interviews with residents of nursing or residential care homes and <b>postal</b> surveys among <b>representatives</b> of psychogeriatric residents and homecare clients. From July to November 2006 a pilot study was conducted among 2, 697 clients of 68 nursing or residential care homes, 2, 164 representatives of clients in 57 psychogeriatric care institutions, and 1, 462 clients of 19 homecare organizations. We performed psychometric analyses and descriptive analyses, and evaluated the pilot study. Results The pilot study showed the feasibility and usability of the instruments, supported the multidimensionality of the questionnaires and showed first findings on client experiences and possibilities for quality improvement. Nine scales applied to all care settings: shared decision making, attitude and courtesy, information, body care, competence and safety of care, activities, autonomy, mental well-being, and availability of personnel. The pilot resulted in three optimized questionnaires and recommendations for nationwide implementation. Conclusions The CQ-index ® Long-term Care provides a good basis to investigate the quality of nursing homes, residential care homes and homecare from the clients' perspective. This standardized instrument enables a nationwide comparison {{of the quality of}} long-term care for the purpose of transparency and quality assurance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alcohol {{consumption}} {{has been}} regarded as an important contributor to the high premature mortality rates. The objective {{of this paper was}} to provide an overview and comparison of alcohol consumption and its sociodemographic determinants among adults in Estonia and Finland. Methods: The study was based on a 25 - 64 -year-old subsample of nationally <b>representative</b> <b>postal</b> cross-sectional surveys conducted in Estonia (n = 10, 340) and Finland (n = 19, 672) during 1994 - 2006. Abstinence, frequency, and the amount of alcohol consumed were examined. Logistic regression models were used to test the socio-demographic differences in alcohol consumption {{at least once a week}}. The effect of socio-demographic factors on pure alcohol consumed per week was calculated using linear regression. Results: The proportion of abstainers was 1. 5 times higher among women than men in both countries. Throughout the study period, the amount of alcohol consumed per week increased for both genders in Estonia and for women in Finland, but was stable for men in Finland. In the final study year, medium risk amount of alcohol consumed per week was nearly 1. 5 times higher among men in Estonia than in Finland, but about half that among women in Estonia than in Finland.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{relatively}} low recorded alcohol consumption level, the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and neighbouring Finland suffer from similar harmful consequences related {{to the use of}} alcoholic beverages, including socio-economic inequalities in alcohol related mortality. Comparative evidence is needed to understand harmful drinking patterns and to implement preventive alcohol policies also in the Baltic countries. This study compared heavy and binge drinking by sex, age, education, urbanisation and marital status in the Baltic countries and Finland. Methods The data were nationally <b>representative</b> <b>postal</b> surveys conducted in Estonia (n = 6271), Latvia (n = 6106), Lithuania (n = 7966) and Finland (n = 15764) during 1994 – 2002. The criterion for heavy drinking was at least 15 portions weekly among men, and at least five among women, and for binge drinking at least six portions per one occasion. Results Heavy drinking was more common among younger participants in all countries, and in Latvia among the less-educated. Among Finnish men, and among women from all countries except Latvia, the better-educated were more often heavy drinkers. In Latvia and Finland, urban men, and in all countries, urban women, were more often heavy drinkers. Heavy drinking was more common among non-married Lithuanian and Finnish men, and Finnish women. Binge drinking was more common among less-educated Estonian and Latvian men, and among younger and less-educated women in all countries. Conclusion Our results support the continued power of traditional drinking habits in the North Eastern part of Europe. In the future the target groups for prevention of excessive drinking should also include young and less-educated women in all four countries studied. </p...|$|R

Results: Over 52 000 adults aged 1875 years and living in 19 centres in 12 countries took part. In most centres, and overall, the reported prevalence of asthma was lower in older adults (adjusted OR for 6574 years compared with 1524 years: 0. 72; 95 % CI: 0. 630. 81). In all centres, {{there was a strong}} association of asthma with CRS (adjusted OR: 3. 47; 95 % CI: 3. 203. 76) at all ages. The association with asthma was stronger in those reporting both CRS and allergic rhinitis (adjusted OR: 11. 85; 95 % CI: 10. 5713. 17). CRS in the absence of nasal allergies was positively associated with late-onset asthma.

40|$|Even though Sweden is {{considered}} a high trust society, research on this topic is primarily based on a few standardized survey questions. It is also known {{that there is a}} robust pattern of less trustful young people compared to older ones. Still, a satisfactory explanation of this fact is lacking. Thus, the first aim of this dissertation is to map trust among young adults and middle-aged individuals. The second aim is to examine by which factors and in what way different dimensions of trust are determined, focusing on individuals’ life course and consequently experiences. Analytical principles from the life course tradition are used as a theoretical framework. Data is derived from a Swedish cross-sectional nationally <b>representative</b> <b>postal</b> survey on trust, and qualitative interviews using a mixed-methods approach. A multi-dimensional concept of trust is suggested. Participants report relatively high levels of trust in known and unknown people, confidence in institutions, normative notions of trust, security, and trustful behaviour. Trust also seems to be structured according to a closeness principle. Young adults display lower trust levels in general. However, in some respects the pattern is reversed, particularly regarding domains they are expected to be more familiar with. Contrary to the well-established idea of generalised trust derived from predispositions and primary socialization, and particularised trust originating from experiences in adulthood, {{the results of this study}} suggest that unique combinations of factors, both individual characteristics and experiences, might explain each of the different dimensions. Often there is a sphere-specific relationship between experiences and later trust, i. e. experiences from one sphere of life seem to exclusively affect trust within the same sphere. It is suggested that as people grow older they accumulate what is called experience capital, which might benefit trust and contribute to an explanation of the age differences...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: These were as follows: {{to study}} incompleteness of data, herein called item non-response, {{generated}} by a self completion questionnaire; to identify the characteristics of item non-responders {{and the types of}} questions liable to high item non-response rates; and to discuss possible reasons for item non-response. DESIGN: Item non-response patterns in 12, 307 responders (62 %) to a <b>representative</b> <b>postal</b> survey based on a stratified sample drawn from family health services authorities' (FHSA) registers were investigated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were analysed for item non-response in three groups depending on when the questionnaire was returned (wave analysis). The overall completion rate of the questionnaire was examined and the natural logarithm of the proportion of completed questions was used as an outcome variable in multiple regression analysis. Item nonresponse to key questions and questions of different types was examined. RESULTS: Wave analysis: the overall completion rate of the questionnaire was 86 % in questionnaires returned before the first reminder and 83 %- 84 % in those sent back after subsequent reminders. Overall pattern of item non-response; respondents failed to complete a mean of 15 % and a median of 10 % of the questionnaire. All questions in the questionnaire had some item non-response, ranging from 1 % to 85 %. Completion rates were associated with gender, age, indicators of lower socioeconomic status, and general health status. Individual questions: particular types of questions were liable to have higher item non-response, for example, linked binary questions. CONCLUSIONS: Item non-response in population postal surveys is likely to present problems in the interpretation of data by introducing bias additional to that of total non-response. Item non-response does not increase greatly with later returns, suggesting that the quality of data across responses generated by two reminders is similar. There are obstacles to reducing item non-response, such as respondent error or socioeconomic and health characteristics of the general population, that cannot be totally overcome. However, the evidence that individuals tend to complete only options within questions that apply to them and their positive behaviour is useful information for those designing questionnaires and interpreting survey data...|$|R

In Finland, alcohol consumption at least once a week was more prevalent among women of ethnic minority, but the amount of pure alcohol drunk per week was lower for both gender groups of ethnic minority. Compared to married/cohabiting respondents, alcohol consumption at least once a week was less pronounced among single respondents in Finland, divorced or separated women in both countries, and widowed respondents in Estonia. Greater amount of alcohol consumed per week was more prevalent among single and divorced or separated respondents in Finland, but only among divorced or separated men in Estonia. Frequency of alcohol consumption was lower among less educated than higher educated respondents in Finland, but not in Estonia. The amount of consumed alcohol per week was higher among less educated men in Estonia, but lower among women with basic education in Finland. Conclusions Alcohol consumption has increased in Estonia and Finland. National alcohol policies should reflect findings of alcohol epidemiology in order to introduce measures that will reduce alcohol related harm in the population effectively. </p...|$|R
