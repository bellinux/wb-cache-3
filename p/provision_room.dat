40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, the {{creation}} of supportive environments for encouraging mothers to breastfeed their children {{has emerged as a}} key health issue for women and children. The <b>provision</b> of lactation <b>rooms</b> and breast pumping breaks have helped mothers to continue breastfeeding after returning to work, but their effectiveness is uncertain. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of worksite breastfeeding-friendly policies and work-related factors on the behaviour of working mothers. Methods This study was conducted at a large Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer in August-September 2003. Questionnaires were used to collect data on female employees' breastfeeding behaviour, child rearing and work status when raising their most recently born child. A total of 998 valid questionnaires were collected, giving a response rate of 75. 3 %. Results The results showed that 66. 9 % of survey respondents breastfed initially during their maternity leave, which averaged 56 days. Despite the <b>provision</b> of lactation <b>rooms</b> and breast pumping breaks, only 10. 6 % mothers continued to breastfeed after returning to work, primarily office workers and those who were aware of their company's breastfeeding-friendly policies. Conclusion In conclusion, breastfeeding-friendly policies can significantly affect breastfeeding behaviour. However, an unfavourable working environment, especially for fab workers, can make it difficult to implement breastfeeding measures. With health professionals emphasizing that the importance of breastfeeding for infant health, and as only females can perform lactation, it is vital that women's work "productive role" and family "reproductive role" be respected and accommodated by society. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore {{whether and how}} spatial aspects of children's hospital wards (single and shared rooms) impact upon family-centred care. Background Family-centred care has been widely adopted in paediatric hospitals internationally. Recent hospital building programmes in many countries have prioritised the <b>provision</b> of single <b>rooms</b> over shared rooms. Limited attention has, however, {{been paid to the}} potential impact of spatial aspects of paediatric wards on family-centred care. Design Qualitative, ethnographic. Methods Phase 1; observation within four wards of a specialist children's hospital. Phase 2; interviews with 17 children aged 5 – 16 years and 60 parents/carers. Sixty nursing and support staff also took part in interviews and focus group discussions. All data were subjected to thematic analysis. Results Two themes emerged from the data analysis: ‘role expectations’ and ‘family–nurse interactions’. The latter theme comprised three subthemes: ‘family support needs’, ‘monitoring children's well-being’ and ‘survey–assess–interact within spatial contexts’. Conclusion Spatial configurations within hospital wards significantly impacted upon the relationships and interactions between children, parents and nurses, which played out differently in single and shared <b>rooms.</b> Increasing the <b>provision</b> of single <b>rooms</b> within wards is therefore likely to directly affect how family-centred care manifests in practice. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses need {{to be sensitive to the}} impact of spatial characteristics, and particularly of single and shared rooms, on families’ experiences of children's hospital wards. Nurses’ contribution to and experience of family-centred care can be expected to change significantly when spatial characteristics of wards change and, as is currently the vogue, hospitals maximise the provision of single rather than shared rooms...|$|R

40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{the development of}} the legal (de jure) independence requirements of national and European supervisory authorities in European law. The European legislator recently strengthened the legal and political independence of national supervisors in the telecommunications and energy sectors. Moreover, European supervisors in the telecommunications, energy and financial sectors have been created. The national supervisors are represented in these new European bodies through their participation in the European supervisors’ regulatory boards. The independence principle is one of the legal safeguards to prevent independence problems at national level being transferred to European level en vice versa, and has been laid down as a cornerstone of the regulations establishing the new European supervisors. These developments illustrate that the independence of supervisors has gained importance in European law. However, the specification of the independence principle has taken place in an ad hoc and piecemeal way and the different European <b>provisions</b> leave <b>room</b> for controversies. Therefore, {{it is too early to}} argue, that the principle of the independence of European and national supervisors has acquired the status of a general principle of European law. Instead this article provides some suggestions as to how the European independence requirements could be interpreted in the light of recent case law of the European Court of Justice reconciling a sufficient degree of independence on the one hand with the need for adequate provisions for transparency and political and legal accountability on the other hand...|$|R

50|$|Househill Mansion {{was built}} in the early 19th century to replace an earlier house on the lands of Househill {{belonging}} to the Dunlop family. It became the home of John Cochrane and his wife Catherine Cranston, proprietor of Miss Cranston's Tearooms including the Willow Tearooms in Glasgow designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. In 1904 she commissioned Mackintosh to re-create the interior of her home, including redecoration of <b>rooms,</b> <b>provision</b> of new fire-surrounds and design of furniture. One end of the music room was semicircular in plan, and he extended the shape into the room with a horizontal rail at picture rail height about two feet (600 mm) clear of the curved wall which continued round into the room space to complete the circle. This horizontal circle was supported on a curved screen of narrow vertical slats for much of its length in the room, and on fittings against the wall which incorporated benches and window seats in his typical style. The centre of the circle was marked by a similarly slatted light fitting hanging from the ceiling. Catherine Cranston sold the house in 1920 after her husband died.

40|$|Plate {{waste in}} {{hospitals}} {{refers to the}} served food that remains uneaten by patients. High levels of plate waste contribute to malnutrition-related complications in hospital, {{and there are also}} financial and environmental costs. Plate waste is typically measured by weighing food or by visual estimation of the amount of food remaining on the plate, with results presented as the percentage by weight of the served food, or by calculating the protein, energy or monetary value of the waste. Results from 32 studies in hospitals show a median plate waste of 30 % by weight (range: 6 - 65 %), much higher than in other foodservice settings. Levels are lower in hospitals using a bulk food delivery system compared to plated meal delivery. Reasons for these high levels can relate to the clinical condition of patients, food and menu issues (such as poor food quality, inappropriate portion sizes, and limited menu choice), service issues (including difficulty accessing food and complex ordering systems), and environmental factors (such as inappropriate meal times, interruptions, and unpleasant ward surroundings). Strategies to minimize waste include reduced portion sizes with food fortification, bulk meal delivery system, feeding assistance, <b>provision</b> of dining <b>rooms,</b> and protected meal times...|$|R

The aim of harm reduction efforts is to minimise the risks stemming from shared use of drug-use paraphernalia, such as needle exchange programmes.

The report notes that specific risk {{factors that contribute to}} risky drug practices include youth, a shorter injecting history, confinement to prison, homelessness and being involved in a sexual relationship with another intravenous drug user.
