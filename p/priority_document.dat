50|$|The INGO ISF-ApD and Same District Council (Tanzania) {{developed}} a methodology to update WPM data {{and use them}} to help inform planning decisions. First activity was to prepare a District Water and Sanitation <b>priority</b> <b>document.</b> A set of objective criteria were defined (using WPM information) in order to rank communities based on service level and infrastructure status. Criteria used included among others coverage, need for rehabilitation, seasonality of services, quality of water delivered, and poor management. Each criterion produced one different ranking, and this enabled an accurate prioritization of future interventions and rehabilitations in the district, a part from defining a wide range of related supporting activities. The <b>priority</b> <b>document</b> was approved and issued in September 2009 by the District Authority, and it was also used to set the priorities for all sector-related stakeholders operating within the district.|$|E

Otherwise, the validity of an issued patent may be challenged as to the priority date of its claims that purport to relate back to an insufficient [...] "provisional". Furthermore, during the year after filing the first provisional (and prior to filing a non-provisional application), it may be useful to file additional provisional applications as improvements are made, and then claim priority of those found useful in drafting the non-provisional application(s).|$|E

50|$|The PCT system enables an {{applicant}} {{to file a}} single patent application in a single language. The application, called an international application, can, at a later date, lead to the {{grant of a patent}} in any of the states contracting to the PCT. WIPO, or more precisely the International Bureau of WIPO, performs many of the formalities of a patent application in a centralised manner, therefore avoiding the need to repeat the steps in all countries in which a patent may ultimately be granted. The WIPO coordinates searches performed by any one of the International Searching Authorities (ISA), publishes the international applications and coordinates preliminary examination performed by any one of the International Preliminary Examination Authorities (IPEA). Steps such as naming inventors and applicants, and filing certified copies of <b>priority</b> <b>documents</b> can also be done centrally, and need not be repeated.|$|R

The majority of this work has been conducted in developing countries and with disenfranchised communities, where participatory mapping associated with natural resource management is more widely practiced.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Medicare is a popular program that millions of Americans depend on for covering their essential health needs.

For example, stakeholders expect that Medicare will price services prudently; that providers will be treated fairly and paid accurately; and that beneficiaries will clearly understand their program options and will receive services that meet quality standards. In addition, there are expectations that the agency will be prepared to implement restructuring or added benefits in the context of Medicare reform. Today's Medicare, although successful in some areas, {{may not be able to}} meet these expectations effectively without further congressional attention to its multiple missions, capacity, and flexibility.
