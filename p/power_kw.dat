Similar to the way that solar leases helped solar become {{mainstream}} by allowing more homeowners to go solar with zero money down, Green Charge aims to help more businesses utilize energy storage by offering systems at zero upfront cost.The idea of power efficiency builds off the difference between energy (kWh) and <b>power</b> (<b>kW).</b> Energy efficiency focuses on reducing the amount of energy consumed while power efficiency focuses on reducing the rate at which energy is used, also known as peak demand.|$|E
50|$|Engineers have {{at their}} {{disposal}} many meters, {{that are able to}} read and display electrical power waveforms and calculating parameters of the waveforms. These parameters may include, for example, current and voltage RMS, phase relationship between waveforms of a multi-phase signal, power factor, frequency, THD, active <b>power</b> (<b>kW),</b> reactive power (kVAr), apparent power (kVA) and active energy (kWh), reactive energy (kVArh) and apparent energy (kVAh) and many more. In order to sufficiently monitor unforeseen events, Ribeiro et al. explains that {{it is not enough to}} display these parameters, but to also capture voltage waveform data at all times. This is impracticable due to the large amount of data involved, causing what is known the “bottle effect”. For instance, at a sampling rate of 32 samples per cycle, 1,920 samples are collected per second. For three-phase meters that measure both voltage and current waveforms, the data is 6-8 times as much. More practical solutions developed in recent years store data only when an event occurs (for example, when high levels of power system harmonics are detected) or alternatively to store the RMS value of the electrical signals. This data, however, is not always sufficient to determine the exact nature of problems.|$|E

In {{the framework of the}} Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian and the Quantum Boltzmann equation for the time evolution of the density matrix of polarizations, we calculate the intensity of circular polarizations generated by the collision of two linearly polarized laser beams and estimate the rate of generation. As a result, we show that the generated circular polarization can be experimentally measured, on the basis of optical laser beams of average <b>power</b> <b>KW,</b> which are currently available in laboratories. Our study presents a valuable supplementary to other theoretical and experimental frameworks to study and measure the nonlinear effects of photon-photon interaction in the quantum electrodynamics.

40|$|Power factor {{reflects}} how efficiently {{industries and}} organizations use electricity. Power factor compares {{the amount of}} useful work that is extracted from {{the total amount of}} electric energy supplied. This paper proposes a conceptual design of microcontroller based automatic power correction (APFC Relay) for 1 phase and 3 phase circuit with intension to be used in power factor load applications. As can be seen from power factor definition, if PF is near unity, the apparent power (KVA value approaches near actual <b>power</b> (<b>KW).</b> This is possible if, and only if KVAR (reactive power) is kept to a minimum. In practice, this reactive power KVAR is Inductive in nature (major loads are inductive). This reactive power is compensated by countering it with capacitive KVAR in the circuit and can bring system KVAR value near zero. The designing of the power factor correction is to ensure the entire power system always preserving almost unity power factor and thus optimizing the current consumption. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: While a {{significant}} {{effort has been}} made to reduce marine diesel exhaust emissions, {{there is a need to}} examine the world fleets and assess the current levels of engine emissions. This paper introduces an emission assessment scheme that the authors have applied to analyse the US fishing fleet with length L. 22. 9 m. The present results give an estimate that the 1051 vessels in the US fishing fleet produce 306 tonnes/day of nitrous oxides (NOx). The largest power values are found in the decades of 1960 to 1980. The actual <b>power</b> (<b>kW)</b> is compared with a reference power (kWo) using the powering index ratio (PIR 5 kW/kWo). It was found that 50 – 80 per cent of the power in seiners, trawlers, and crabber/trapper/clam vessels have a PIR. 2. 5. Based on this assessment, it is clear that a large number of trawlers and seiners are overpowered – resulting in high diesel engine NOx emissions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We have {{searched for}} nonastrophysical {{emission}} {{lines in the}} optical spectra of 577 nearby F, G, K, and M main-sequence stars. Emission lines of astrophysical origin would also have been detected, such as from a time-variable chromosphere or infalling comets. We examined ∼ 20 spectra per star obtained during 4 years with the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer at a resolution of 5 km s 1, with a detection threshold 3 % of the continuum flux level. We searched each spectrum from 4000 to 5000 A ˚ for emission lines having widths too narrow to be natural from the host star, {{as well as for}} lines broadened by astrophysical mechanisms. We would have detected lasers that emit a <b>power</b> <b>kW</b> for a typical beamwidth of ∼ 0. 01 (diffraction limitP 1 50 from a 10 m aperture) if directed toward Earth from the star.

Measured reductions in temperature, <b>power</b> (<b>kW)</b> and energy (kWh) were used to develop a predictive model that correlates ambient temperature distribution profiles, building demand reduction profiles and electricity network peak demand times.

The basic parameters and dimensions of a generator for a voltage of 500 kW and power 10 kW are presented. The generator is designed to power a tandem charged-particle accelerator.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} some performance parameters with cost comparison for a four-cylinder diesel engine {{under a variety of}} operating conditions, before and after converting to dual fuel engine. The experiment used a converted dual fuel diesel engine which can run on a hybrid mixture of diesel and natural gas (NG). The focus of this study is on the engine thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature, lubricating oil temperature, air fuel ratio, specific fuel cost, and specific fuel consumption under different operating conditions. A comparison of the cost economy of pure diesel engine and gradually converted dual fuel engine is also performed. Performance parameters with engine <b>power</b> (<b>kW)</b> are compared as well.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The ELETTRA RF {{system is}} {{composed}} of four 500 MHz cavities distributed along the ring [1]. Each cavity is fed by an independent 60 kW RF plant. The RF system has been now operating {{for more than one}} and a half years. The operating hours vary from 4070 to 6560 depending on the plant. In routine operation the gap voltage of each cavity is set to 600 kV peak [2]. Injection is performed at 1 GeV at the nominal frequency (499. 654 MHz). Beam energy is ramped to 2 GeV without acting on the RF parameters. At 2 GeV the RF frequency is shifted to 499. 652 MHz for orbit and beam quality optimisation.
