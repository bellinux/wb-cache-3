5|$|Chenery {{needed a}} {{secretary}} {{to handle all}} the fan mail and hired the William Morris Agency to manage public engagements. Secretariat responded to his fame by learning to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> the camera.|$|E
5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5|$|The {{album cover}} depicts Muddy Waters at the Newport Jazz Festival holding a semi-acoustic guitar. When the photographer, Burt Goldblatt, {{asked him to}} <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> the cover, Waters left his Fender Telecaster (which he played during the concert) {{on the stage and}} instead held the semi-acoustic guitar, {{belonging}} to his friend John Lee Hooker.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, she <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Vanity Fair-Italia. Since that year, {{she often}} <b>poses</b> <b>for</b> the {{lingerie}} brand Victoria's Secret and their younger line, PINK.|$|R
50|$|Christina Rossetti <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Mary but, as {{with her}} {{previous}} year's modelling, her brother altered her hair colour: {{in this instance}} making it auburn to continue the red palette. William Rossetti <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Gabriel.|$|R
5000|$|Roberta Ginevra {{started her}} {{modelling}} career at age of seventeen and she appeared on commercials for brands like American Apparel [...] and L'Oreal. In 2015 she <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> the magazine Maxim {{and in the}} same year she started to work in Rome and she has appeared in magazines such as Style and the Italian magazine VIP. In September 2016 she worked for the Italian TV channel Real Time and in December 2016 she <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> GQ Italia. She also <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> the magazine For Men at the beginning of 2017. After her apparition on Playboy Italia in May 2017, she <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Sports Illustrated.|$|R
5|$|The {{cover of}} the seventh issue of treats!, which was {{published}} in April 2014, featured Dylan Penn, daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright, nude, albeit with a $6,000-plus Fendi bag strategically placed in front of her groin, with similar placements used in her interior pictorial. Penn was photographed by Duran. According to an E! Online report on March 5, 2014, Penn had declined a $150,000 offer to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> the cover of Playboy.|$|E
5|$|Demi Moore had {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair exactly one year earlier in the August 1991 edition in Leibovitz's photograph, More Demi Moore. As a groundbreaking work, the photograph of her pregnant pose was an iconic one for Moore, Leibovitz and women in general who now view public representation of pregnancy as socially acceptable. It had a cultural impact by causing numerous celebrities to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> photographs in advanced pregnancy, which has made pregnancy photos fashionable and created a profitable business for photographers such as Jennifer Loomis. The American Society of Magazine Editors regards it {{as one of the best}} U.S. magazine covers ever, and it is one of Leibovitz' best-known works. Additionally, the photo served as a litmus test when Internet decency standards were first being legislated and adjudicated.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, when The Beatles had to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> the {{photograph}} for the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover, Lennon asked Mona {{if he could}} borrow the war medals {{her father had been}} given in India to wear for the photo session. Although still upset at the way her son was dismissed from The Beatles, Mona agreed, and the medals were then returned, along with a Cash Box trophy that is in the letter 'L' of THE BEATLES flower-sign on the cover. Mona never opened another club, or engaged in another business venture, although she did have paying guests at her house, which she shared with her bed-ridden mother and her sons after she and Best parted. Mona {{died of a heart attack}} on 9 October 1988, after a long illness.|$|E
50|$|Also {{while on}} the show she <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Stuff magazine. Additionally, Susie <b>posed</b> nude <b>for</b> the August 2008 edition of Playboy.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, Paay was {{the first}} glamour model in the Dutch edition of Playboy. In 2009, Paay <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> the December issue of the Dutch version of the {{magazine}} at age 60, making it the third time she had <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Playboy.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} depicted is the Café de la Gare, 30 Place Lamartine, run by Joseph-Michel Ginoux and {{his wife}} Marie, who in November 1888 <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> Van Gogh's and Gauguin's Arlésienne; a bit later, Joseph Ginoux evidently <b>posed</b> <b>for</b> both artists, too.|$|R
5|$|Like many bipedal dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex was {{historically}} {{depicted as}} a 'living tripod', with the body at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a kangaroo. This concept dates from Joseph Leidy's 1865 reconstruction of Hadrosaurus, the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture. In 1915, convinced that the creature stood upright, Henry Fairfield Osborn, {{former president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton arranged this way. It stood in an upright <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> 77 years, until it was dismantled in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights {{of one kind or}} another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> long periods in the studio.|$|E
5|$|Stowe's house, {{which was}} {{located on the}} bank of the St. Johns River, became a tourist attraction, as riverboats {{shuffling}} tourists from Jacksonville to Palatka or Green Cove Springs passed close by and slowed, so the captains could point out her home to their clients. Eventually a dock was built so that visitors could come ashore and peek into the windows of the home. One, who dared to pull down a tree branch covered with orange blossoms in full bloom over the Stowe's veranda, was chased off the property by Calvin. Local residents who held Stowe in less than high regard insinuated that she worked with the enterprising riverboat captains to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> tourists.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 23 {{years after}} first <b>posing</b> <b>for</b> the brand, supermodel Claudia Schiffer <b>posed</b> again <b>for</b> Guess' {{black-and-white}} ads marking the brand's 30th anniversary.|$|R

5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E
5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E

5|$|On April 6, Dumas {{suffered}} {{what appeared}} to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program Dark Angel. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by General Manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> Playboy.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us: Left Behind {{is similar}} to the basic {{gameplay}} of The Last of Us. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. Players control Ellie. An added feature in combat is the ability to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a tactical advantage. Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of interactivity, allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> a picture, while using the water guns prompts players to soak Riley.|$|E
5|$|Tom (Aziz Ansari) is {{tasked with}} taking the cover {{photo of the}} summer catalog, and convinces Ann (Rashida Jones) and Mark (Paul Schneider) to <b>pose</b> <b>for</b> photos at a {{community}} park. Tom is repeatedly frustrated with Ann, who has a difficult time appearing happy. When the photos are finished, Ann agrees that she looks miserable and asks that the pictures not be used. Mark appears concerned that Ann's unhappiness {{is a reflection of}} their relationship. She insists everything is fine, but he is unconvinced. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) appear to be growing closer. After helping Leslie set up her picnic, Andy asks whether April wants to get drinks after work, and she agrees. However, when they arrive at a bar, the bouncer (Mike Mauloff) easily notices April is underage, and her identification confirms she is 20. April tells Andy they can go to another bar, but Andy decides to go home instead, seemingly uncomfortable about their age difference. April is visibly disappointed, but does not convey it to Andy. Later, the summer catalogs arrive, with a photo on the cover of April and Andy appearing happy together at the picnic.|$|E
