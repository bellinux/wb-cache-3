40|$|Abstract: Historical {{records and}} local records {{were used to}} survey {{sightings}} of the giant otter, <b>Pteronura</b> <b>brasiliensis,</b> in northern Argentina. Forty years ago, most sightings were of family groups, whereas now fewer otters are seen, mostly as pairs or solitary animals. Argentina is the extreme southern edge of their range, and pressure from hunting, habitat destruction, disturbance and population fragmentation may be enough to severely affect the population. Reintroduction into Iguazi National Park may be possible. The giant otter <b>Pteronura</b> <b>brasiliensis</b> is {{regarded as one of}} the most endangered mammals in Argentina (Chehebar 1990). A literature search revealed eleven references to sightings of giant otters in Argentina between 1780 and 1991 : only four of which related to the present century. These records are indicated in Figure 1...|$|R

50|$|Neotropical otters have an {{interesting}} phylogenic relationship to other otter species. They are most similar to Lontra feline and Lontra provocax, which is not surprising considering these two species are found in South America. However, neotropical otters are relatively distantly related to <b>Pteronura</b> <b>brasiliensis,</b> which is surprising considering they have nearly identical ecological niches and home ranges.|$|R
50|$|The {{giant otter}} (<b>Pteronura</b> <b>brasiliensis)</b> inhabits South America, {{especially}} the Amazon river basin, but {{is becoming increasingly}} rare due to poaching, habitat loss, {{and the use of}} mercury and other toxins in illegal alluvial gold mining.
