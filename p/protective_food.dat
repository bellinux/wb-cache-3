These days farmers and farming communities affected by HIV/AIDS need to think not just about what their crops need but what the human body needs to cope with the stress of infection from serious diseases. Helen Khunga works with the Consortium for Agricultural and Nutrition, AIDS Reliance and Markets in Zambia. As she explained to Chris Kakunta, there is a lot that farmers can do to provide their families ? and their customers ? with {{a balanced}} diet. IN:	?When you talk of a? OUT:	?deterioration of the person. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 02 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Helen Khunga ending that report from Zambia. To prevent malnutrition, she recommends eating high energy foods such as pumpkins, body-building foods such as cowpeas and <b>protective</b> <b>foods</b> like spinach. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Khunga	When you talk of {{a balanced diet}} in the first place you should be mindful that you are looking at the three key elements in terms of the food crops. That is the energy-giving foods, the body-building <b>foods</b> and the <b>protective</b> <b>foods,</b> these are very key. We try and look at the combination of crops that we tell the farmers to grow that can be grown on smallscale and also large scale. Kakunta	Maybe we narrow down to those that are affected by HIV and AIDS, how can they ensure that they have a balanced diet? Khunga	We {{try to make sure that}} in the first place we will look at, do they have manpower in the household? If they have manpower we do try and help them by starting small and by starting small we mean can they afford to grow something in the backyard? If they are not able to even start small we start by giving them targeted food assistance and this is the package where we gave carbohydrate and protein to try and help them get at least the basic needs for the body. But for those that are completely incapacitated we try and see if they can be linked into other members of the community that can do food for work on behalf of those families that are completely incapacitated so that they can also afford to grow the crops that we recommend for people that are HIV positive or those that have HIV and AIDS. Kakunta	What about those that are ill but have the capacity, what type of foods do you recommend for them and maybe could you cite some examples so that as we go on we will be very clear as to what is required? Khunga	Ok for those that have the capacity normally we do recommend crops like cassava as energy-giving foods for example sorghum, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, they are easy to grow and normally they do not require fertilisers because we are looking at a group that might not have the resources to back up. And then also we would encourage them to grow body-building foods and in this category we are looking at groundnuts, soya beans and bambara nuts which they can grow easily again without the add on of artificial fertilisers. And among the <b>protective</b> <b>foods</b> we would encourage them to grow vegetables like spinach for example or any dark green vegetables that they have and also consumption of cassava leaves. Kakunta	And do you think this is a very balanced diet? Khunga	That is the energy-giving foods, the body-building <b>foods</b> and the <b>protective</b> <b>foods.</b> All the three critical food groups that are important for a balanced diet. Kakunta	Have you made some strides in as far as ensuring that your target audience have a balanced diet? Kunga	For example if I am going to give an example of a farmer who is incapacitated financially and they might not be able to have fertilisers I would recommend for example sorghum or pumpkins for their energy building foods which can easily grow without fertilisers. And for the body-building foods I would recommend them to grow cowpeas for example which is very easy to grow, the leaves can be used as <b>protective</b> <b>foods</b> while the peas can be used as body-building foods. So that combination even for a farmer that is incapacitated helps provide the family with a basic balanced diet that they need. Kakunta	How important is a balanced diet? Khunga	The balanced diet is very critical for somebody who is living with HIV and AIDS because one it will help them delay the onset of the disease. Kakunta	And without a balanced diet what will happen? Khunga	Definitely you are likely to go into micronutrient deficiency and eventually you might have malnutrition which causes a speedy deterioration of the person.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{foodborne}} pathogen Bacillus cereus {{can cause}} diarrhoeal food poisoning by production of enterotoxins {{in the small}} intestine. The prerequisite for diarrhoeal disease is thus survival during gastrointestinal passage. Methods Vegetative cells of 3 different B. cereus strains were cultivated in a real composite food matrix, lasagne verde, and their survival during subsequent simulation of gastrointestinal passage was assessed using in vitro experiments simulating transit through the human upper gastrointestinal tract (from mouth to small intestine). Results No survival of vegetative cells was observed, despite the high inoculum levels of 7. 0 to 8. 0 log CFU/g {{and the presence of}} various potentially <b>protective</b> <b>food</b> components. Significant fractions (approx. 10 % of the consumed inoculum) of B. cereus vegetative cells survived gastric passage, but they were subsequently inactivated by bile exposure in weakly acidic intestinal medium (pH 5. 0). In contrast, the low numbers of spores present (up to 4. 0 log spores/g) showed excellent survival and remained viable spores throughout the gastrointestinal passage simulation. Conclusion Vegetative cells are inactivated by gastric acid and bile during gastrointestinal passage, while spores are resistant and survive. Therefore, the physiological form (vegetative cells or spores) of the B. cereus consumed determines the subsequent gastrointestinal survival and thus the infective dose, which is expected to be much lower for spores than vegetative cells. No significant differences in gastrointestinal survival ability was found among the different strains. However, considerable strain variability was observed in sporulation tendency during growth in laboratory medium and food, which has important implications for the gastrointestinal survival potential of the different B. cereus strains. </p...|$|E

Secondarily to inform and protect G 6 PD deficient people from acute hemolytic crisis and neonatal jaundice by delivery of the updated <b>protective</b> <b>food</b> and drug list prepared in the light of the WHO- G 6 PD Working Committe reports. Methods: In this study, the incidence of severe G 6 PD deficiency were screened by Beutler ’s Fluorescence Spot test among 1604 people living in the contryside villages of central city of Manisa in Turkey. Results: Thirty five out of 1604 tested people were found to have severe G 6 PD deficiency. The incidence of severe G 6 PD deficiency were 2. 2 % in sampled population. There was a difference for the incidence between male (3. 2 %) and female (1. 14 %) as expected due to X-linked heritance. There was no significant differences in the prevalence of severe G 6 PD deficiency between the countryside villages connected to central city of Manisa.

This investigation focuses on differences of dietary practice between Caucasians and African Americans in a cohort of women presenting for breast cancer screening. METHODS: Over a one-year period, 675 women presenting to the Breast Health Center at Tulane University Medical Center for an initial visit were given a self-reported health behavior questionnaire. Included in this survey were questions concerning the frequency of raw vegetable consumption and fat/oil intake. MAIN FINDINGS: The overall proportion of women who presented for breast cancer screening that reported daily raw vegetable consumption in the study group was 40 %. There were statistically significant differences between proportions of Caucasian women's and African American women's consumption of daily raw vegetable (51 % versus 29 %, respectively; P < 0. 0001).

Cereals {{are the most important}} staple food crops in Nepal and rice number one from area and production followed by maize, wheat, millets and barley. The grain-legumes and potatoes are considered the <b>protective</b> <b>food</b> crops for the maintenance of balance human nutrition in Nepal. Out of 88 countries, Nepal ranked 57 th in Global Hunger Index (GHI) with GHI value of 19. 8 depicting alarming situation of hunger in different regions of the country. Since the III Five year plan (1975 - 80), the government of Nepal has given high priority in agriculture, focusing major approaches on promotion of integrated farming systems to address food and nutrition security. However, the food security situation is deteriorating. Adaptive measures on climate change, food distribution policy, crop and livestock insurance, subsidies on fertilizers and seeds, research and development activities on food-grain crops and bio-diversity conservation, inter agency coordination, food and seed buffer stock, and institutional capacity building would the viable options to maintain the food security in Nepal. From the rigorous study of various past research works, it can be concluded that the wider gap of several food grain crops can be reduced by system research, crop modelling, and up-scaling the use of agricultural machineries and tools.

40|$|Introduction: Brazil is {{experiencing}} a nutritional transition characterized by {{a reduction in the}} prevalence of nutritional deficits and an increase in overweight and obesity, not only in adults but also in children and adolescents. Objectives: This study was designed to evaluate the factors associated with overweight and obesity in Brazilian 5 -year-old preschoolers. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a cohort of 232 preschoolers born in Diamantina/Minas Gerais, Brazil, was undertaken. the data, including socioeconomic status, anthropometry, diet, previous history of the preschoolers and family history, were collected between July of 2009 and July of 2010. To identify the factors associated with overweight and obesity, a logistic regression and a hierarchical model were undertaken. Results: Overweight and obesity occurred in 17. 2 % of the preschoolers. After adjusting for mother's obesity, per capita income, <b>protective</b> <b>food</b> intake, weight gain at age 0 - 4 months and time spent playing, the factors associated with overweight and obesity that reached statistical significance were mother's obesity [OR = 3. 12 (95 % CI 1. 41 - 6. 91), P = 0. 01], weight gain of more than 0. 85 kg/month in the first four months of life [OR = 2. 16 (95 % CI 1. 01 - 4. 64), P = 0. 041 and lower per capita income [OR = 0. 32 (95 %CI 0. 13 - 0. 79), P = 0. 01]. Conclusion: the results show that more weight gain during the first four months of life and being born of mothers with obesity increased the odds of overweight/obesity in the preschoolers, while lower per capita income was a protective factor.

40|$|Currently {{phytosterols}} {{are added}} to processed foods, which increase their cost and therefore limits its use. This manuscript aims to identify foods that are a natural source of phytosterols, as well as analyze how the environment and production management modify its content, linking these aspects with health. Phytosterols are compounds found in plants with hypocholesterolemic properties, which may help prevent cardiovascular diseases. The estimated daily intake of phytosterols varies between 160 and 500 mg/day, but its beneficial effect is achieved with 1, 500 to 2, 400 mg daily consumption. Oil and cereal seeds are the largest natural sources of phytosterols. Amaranth is considered a pseudocereal and among the cereals has the highest concentration of phytosterols with 178 mg/ 100 g, value 5 times higher than wheat flour. Environment modifies phytosterol content in food, drought and high temperatures can double their content in seeds; nitrogen fertilization and planting date can cause changes, but more studies are needed. The selection of genotypes with higher phytosterol content and studying the genotype x environment interaction, allow the identification of those genotypes with local adaptation for this character. The production management will increase the supply of natural foods rich in phytosterols, contributing to a greater supply of health <b>protective</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|R

Dietary intake of foods rich in antioxidant properties is suggested to be cancer <b>protective.</b> <b>Foods</b> rich in antioxidant properties include grape (Vitis vinifera), {{one of the}} world’s largest fruit crops and most commonly consumed fruits in the world. The composition and cancer-protective effects of major phenolic antioxidants in grape skin and seed extracts are discussed in this review. Grape skin and seed extracts exert strong free radical scavenging and chelating activities and inhibit lipid oxidation in various food and cell models in vitro. The use of grape antioxidants are promising against {{a broad range of}} cancer cells by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream pathways, inhibiting over-expression of COX- 2 and prostaglandin E 2 receptors, or modifying estrogen receptor pathways, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, some of these activities were also demonstrated in animal models. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated inconsistent antioxidant efficacy. Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence from human clinical trials has demonstrated that consumption of grape, wine and grape juice exerts many health-promoting and possible anti-cancer effects. Thus, grape skin and seed extracts have great potential in cancer prevention and further investigation into this exciting field is warranted. 1...|$|R
