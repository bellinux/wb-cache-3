5000|$|In 2009, the IMF {{approved}} another {{standby arrangement}} totaling $800 USD valid for 15 months. The <b>precautionary</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{was intended to}} serve as a reserve to combat any shocks the country may experience as a result of elections and the recent global financial crisis. El Salvador switched from using the colón as official currency to the U.S. dollar in 2001, leaving the country even more financially susceptible during the crisis. Furthermore, {{due to the lack of}} any domestic monetary policy, IMF reforms heavily focused on fiscal policy and public finances.|$|E
40|$|This paper brings {{forward the}} {{insurance}} aspect of holding reserves {{by using the}} conceptual equivalence between insurance and financial options, and explores when reserves {{are likely to become}} the primary means of <b>precautionary</b> <b>arrangement,</b> in particular in emerging markets. The sharp rise in the amount of reserves held by many emerging markets since the mid- 1990 s {{can be traced to the}} rise in the "globalization hazard" that confronts emerging markets. A modest probability of globalization hazard (sudden stop) can induce emerging markets to self-insure fully by hoarding international reserves, rather than relying on nonreserve alternatives of taking precautions.

40|$|Countries {{can make}} a clean exit from {{financial}} assistance, or enter a new programme or a precautionary programme, depending on the sustainability of their public debt and their vulnerability to shocks. • Ireland made a clean exit in December 2013, supported by significant budgetary and current-account adjustment and signs of economic recovery. But Irish debt sustaina-bility is not guaranteed and prudence {{will be needed to}} avoid future difficulties. • A clean exit for Portugal is not recommended when its programme ends in May 2014, because compared to Ireland it faces higher interest rates, has poorer growth pros-pects and has probably less ability to generate a consistently high primary surplus. A <b>precautionary</b> <b>arrangement</b> would be advisable. In case debt sustainability proves dif-ficult to achieve later, some form of debt restructuring may prove necessary. • It is unlikely that Greece will be able to exit its programme in December 2014. A third programme should be put in place to take Greece out of the market until 2030, accom-panied by enhanced budgetary and structural reform commitments by Greece, a Euro-pean boost to economic growth in the euro-area periphery and willingness on the part of lenders to reduce loan charges below their borrowing costs, should public debt levels prove unsustainable despite Greece meeting the loan conditions. • Even assuming all goes well, the three countries will be subject to enhanced post-pro-gramme surveillance. Managing such decades-long relationships will be a key challenge...|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of the current global {{financial}} and economic crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has undertaken some major reforms of its lending facilities. The new Flexible Credit Line and the High Access <b>Precautionary</b> <b>Arrangements</b> differ from what has been in place so far, by allowing for ex ante conditionality. This paper summarizes preconditions for effective last resort lending and evaluates the newly introduced measures, concluding that the Flexible Credit Line comes very close to what has been called an International Lender of Last Resort. The main obstacles are the low demand and slow progress in complementary reforms. IMF Lending, Flexible Credit Line, Financial Stability, Emerging Markets...|$|R

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1937, anticipating {{the risk of}} war and aerial bombing, Franke began to make <b>precautionary</b> <b>arrangements.</b> He {{arranged}} for the most valuable contents of the archive to be moved to the cellars of the university's Augusteum building, which were believed (correctly as matters turned out) to be bomb-proof. In June 1939, {{a couple of months}} before the actual outbreak of war, Franke switched to working for the National Student Organisation ("Reichsstudentenwerk") which had replaced the equivalent individual university based support operations {{in the context of the}} government's centralisation strategy. Directly after war ended, in May 1945, he resigned from this post, thereby avoiding the dismissal which, as a former member of the Nazi party he would inevitably have faced either under US military occupation or else, after US troops withdrew in July 1945, when Leipzig became part of the Soviet occupation zone.|$|R
40|$|Following {{the current}} {{international}} financial and economic crisis the IMF reformed its lending facilities. Two new instruments {{are of particular}} importance: the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and the High Access <b>Precautionary</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (HAPA). The major innovation of the new facilities is that the traditional ex-post conditionality is replaced by an ex-ante qualification process. An ex-ante qualification process leads to a short-term availability of funds during the emergence of crises and avoids long negotiation processes during a crisis. Additionally, the FCL is high powered, amounting to 900 to 1000 % of the quota. It can therefore be expected that the programs have preventive effects. In difference to previous attempts to implement precautionary credit lines, the FCL and HAPA successfully created demand. First empirical observations show, that a stigmatization, {{which could have been}} expected from experience, did not take place. Countries who qualified for the FCL did rather well during the current crisis and did not face shrinking confidence due to expected crises. To be more efficient, the new lending facilities should be complemented be an international regulatory framework, which limits moral-hazard-induced higher risk taking. Additionally more members should be encouraged to demand the new instruments to increase its systemic importance. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to find out}} potential diseases and protection of health within travelling by using of services Czech republic travel bureaus. The target is to map the level and attitude of travel bureaus in relation to customers health hazards. The research question was: What is the position of travel bureaus to possible customers health hazards. The used method was a qualitative research with application of individual interviews and question-form, where the target themes was the destination, way of transportation, accommodations, customer interest about health hazards, gravid customer interest of travelling and interest to travelling of customer with children under three years. It was also investigate the level of travel bureaus employees knowledge about possible customers health hazards in foreign countries, mainly in subtropical and tropical countries. In this context was the focus at identification if the travel bureaus are able to give advice about customer health hazards, preventive vaccination and necessity to take necessary personal medicine, whether are exists some areas not suitable for cardiac patients and other chronic disordered patients, where can customers get information about travel health hazards and at last but not at least if the tours are offered health insurance inclusive. From the research results and content analysis were deduced these hypothesis: · Travel bureaus customer are interested in potential health hazards combined with travelling practically only at ways to destinations out of Europe · Travel bureaus employee are acquainted with potential health hazards and they are able to give advice about specific addresses or national (private) institutions, where customer can get more information about possible customers health hazards in foreign countries · Travel bureaus have cognisance of customer health hazards in foreign countries The hypothesis validity should be repeatedly verified in additional research. This work brings to traveller an overview about fundamentals life style in foreign countries and includes also an overview about health hazards sequent upon diverse climatic effects or lower hygienic level and there are also included <b>precautionary</b> <b>arrangements</b> to health protection in foreign countries. Likewise are interpreted views of travel bureaus to customers health hazards and level of own information related to this problem. Travel bureaus customer can mostly get information about health protection or he can get recommendations to trustfulness sources, where customer can take out the needed and correct information. Customer base should have been get the think on the brain and more be actively interested in regular vaccinations, hazards of sea bathing, overexposure to sunlight, hazardous sexual activities, observance of correct meal plan, insect prevention and medicine chest equipment. We would not have forget on possible damage as a result of clime incidence, psychic stress, form of transport or animal attack. The travellers are using very often the travel bureaus services and they suppose, that will become complex services. It means, that together with transport service, boarding and lodging and entertainment program they get advices and basic instructions about possible customers health hazards in foreign countries and information about <b>precautionary</b> <b>arrangements</b> to health protection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} factors that have {{influenced}} countries'' participation in IMF drawing programs. IMF drawing programs are defined as the period of a Stand-By Arrangement or an Extended Fund Facilities program during which a country borrows from the Fund. Since this definition excludes <b>precautionary</b> <b>arrangements</b> and periods during which the program went off-track, it provides a closer link to {{the factors that}} have influenced the evolution of IMF credit outstanding. The analysis uses quarterly data during the period 1982 - 2005 and focuses on developing, non-PRGF eligible countries. Country-specific variables-net international reserves and GDP growth-together with a global factor-world GDP growth-are found {{to be among the}} most significant determinants of countries'' participation in IMF drawing programs. The importance of the global factor is not uniform during the period reviewed. The influence of world GDP growth seems to have been significant during the 1980 s debt crises but not since the Mexican crisis in 1994. An out-of-sample forecast evaluation of the period 2004 - 5 reveals that the model has some predictive power.

Conservative and <b>precautionary</b> management <b>arrangements</b> were {{developed for the}} fishery after a thorough assessment of the area and one permit was granted in 2003. The fishery operates within a highly visited Queensland Marine Park and stringent harvest controls have been applied to the permit to maintain access to the area. The fishery is restricted to the collection of two species of sea cucumber— Holothuria scabra (sandfish) and Stichopus horrens (peanutfish) —with the majority of product being exported to China and other Asian nations for consumption and for use in traditional Chinese medicines...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to form a {{comprehensive}} list {{of the most common}} parasites to be found on the European fallow deer (Dama dama) in the game park Poodří, in the Moravian-Slezian region, former district of Nový Jíčín. The practical part of the work was focused on the collection of several samples of droppings and its examination with subsequent determination of the parasites. In the course of the diploma research there was a spectrum of species to be followed, their prevalence, seasonal dynamic throughout the year, the effects on the host animal and adherence to the prevention through the principles of animal hygiene. On the whole there were 150 samples of droppings examined by coprologistic methods and subsequently compared with the data collected by the owner of the game park. On the fallow deer the presence of the single-host coccidia, genus Eimeria, was found. There were also findings of the gastrointestinal nematodes, genus Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Chabertia, Nematodirus and Trichuris. From the pulmonary nematodes only the small pulmonary nematode Varestrongylus sagittatus was determined. The prevalence of parasites is in comparison to the prior studies of Prof. MVDr. K. Chroust, DrSc. from the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno still kept on a low level. The parasitic infection did not have any effect on the state of health of the deer monitored. The measures maintained in the game park are effective, owning {{to the fact that we}} are able to carry out all actions against the outbreak and dispersion of the disease effectively and in time. These measures can be carried out by decontaminating hunting alternatively by the catching and following examination of the game. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>arrangements</b> are executed by dosing of the medicated curatives on the grounds of the previous coprologistic testing with positive result...|$|R
40|$|In October 2006, {{an unusually}} old, red emperor snapper, Lutjanus sebae, was {{captured}} using fish traps off {{the north coast}} of Western Australia. Despite being very old the specimen was not exceptionally large, measuring 516 mm fork length. Of particular note was the fact the specimen was female, as female L. sebae do not attain the large sizes at age of male fish. Interpretation of the sectioned sagittal otolith was used to estimate an age of approximately 40 years. This is the oldest recorded age for an individual L. sebae and further contributes towards {{the knowledge of the}} demography of this species. The advanced age recorded for this specimen also confirms the low rates of natural mortality for L. sebae and therefore low population productivity and supports the <b>precautionary</b> management <b>arrangements</b> for this species in north-western Australia...|$|R

Multiple exploratory fishing research plans are currently in place by Australia (commenced 2015 / 16), France (commencing 2016 / 17), Japan (commencing 2016 / 17), Republic of Korea (commenced 2012 / 13) and Spain (commenced 2012 / 13). To facilitate progress towards stock assessment for Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2, WG-SAM- 16 welcomed plans for increased coordination between all proponents of research in these Divisions (WG-SAM- 16 para. 3. 12). Accordingly, a single consolidated research plan in being developed that outlines the collective research objectives and activities of Australia, France, Japan, Republic of Korea and Spain (hereafter referred to as the participating Members). This research plan has been submitted as a companion paper to WGFSA- 16. Separate reports on the progress of data collection and/or preliminary data analyses were presented by individual participating Members to WG-SAM- 16 (WG-SAM- 16 / 09; 16 / 01; 16 / 02; 16 / 04; 16 / 05; 16 / 17 and 16 / 10). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a summary of all exploratory fishing activities and the volume of data collected up to the 2015 / 16 season in Divisions 58. 4. 1 and 58. 4. 2, and evaluate the collective progress towards stock assessments. A total of 897 research lines were completed over 10 fishing expeditions between 3 November 2011 and 14 April 2016. Total catches of Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) were 894. 5 and 2. 3 tonnes, respectively. Macroscopic evaluation of maturity stage indicated that both immature and mature (gonad stage ≥ 3) D. mawsoni were present across all Research Blocks. The most commonly caught bycatch group was grenadiers (Macrourus spp.), followed by icefish (Channichthyidae), moray cods (Muraenolepis spp.) and violet cod (Antimora rostrata). Target and bycatch species were sampled for total length, whole weight, sex and gonad stage in accordance with Conservation Measure 41 - 01. A total of 4585 D. mawsoni and 49 D. eleginoides were tagged and released between 5 January 2008 and 20 March 2016, and 19 D. mawsoni were recaptured. The 2015 / 16 season also included the deployment of underwater video cameras by Australia, along with CTD recorders, to improve our understanding of toothfish habitat use along East Antarctica...|$|R
