5000|$|Henry Lawson {{was a man}} of {{remarkable}} insight in some things and of extraordinary simplicity in others. We were both looking for the same reef, if you get what I mean; but I had done my prospecting on horseback with my meals cooked for me, while Lawson has done his <b>prospecting</b> <b>on</b> <b>foot</b> and had had to cook for himself. Nobody realized this better than Lawson; and one day he suggested that we should write against each other, he putting the bush from his point of view, and I putting it from mine."We ought to do pretty well out of it," [...] he said. [...] "We {{ought to be able to}} get in three or four sets of verses before they stop us."This suited me all right, for we were working on space, and the pay was very small ... so we slam-banged away at each other for weeks and weeks; not until they stopped us, but until we ran out of material ...|$|E

5000|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} <b>on</b> <b>foot</b> or within {{vehicles}} known as [...] "Battle Rigs". The game requires the player to use both modes of play. When within their vehicle, the player may exit {{at any time}} to continue <b>on</b> <b>foot</b> (like their previous game battlewheels.) (except during the stage in which the player is locked into his vehicle, and must escape before it explodes). When <b>on</b> <b>foot,</b> the game is a first-person shooter (FPS) with gameplay typical of the genre, battling other enemies <b>on</b> <b>foot</b> or in vehicles with sci-fi weapons of unusual power. When in a Battle Rig, the game is more reminiscent of racing or driving games, with the exception that the player can run over their enemies.|$|R
