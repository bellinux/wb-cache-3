5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between <b>Patel</b> and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because <b>Patel</b> had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) <b>Patel</b> found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because <b>Patel</b> was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
