50|$|Diagnosis of lymphoid {{tumors in}} poultry is {{complicated}} due to multiple etiological agents capable of causing very similar tumors. It {{is not uncommon}} {{that more than one}} avian tumor virus can be present in a chicken, thus one must consider both the diagnosis of the disease/tumors (<b>pathological</b> <b>diagnosis)</b> and of the virus (etiological diagnosis). A step-wise process has been proposed for diagnosis of Marek’s disease which includes (1) history, epidemiology, clinical observations and gross necropsy, (2) characteristics of the tumor cell, and (3) virological characteristics The demonstration of peripheral nerve enlargement along with suggestive clinical signs in a bird that is around three to four months old (with or without visceral tumors) is highly suggestive of Marek's disease. Histological examination of nerves reveals infiltration of pleomorphic neoplastic and inflammatory lymphocytes. Peripheral neuropathy should also be considered as a principal rule-out in young chickens with paralysis and nerve enlargement without visceral tumors, especially in nerves with interneuritic edema and infiltration of plasma cells.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{report a}} case of {{mesenteric}} teratoma in a healthy 6 months old baby girl.

Results: Case of mesenteric teratoma occurred in an infant girl to be reported in the English-language literature.
