25|$|In 1960’s, {{a number}} of F. magna {{outbreaks}} in cervids were reported {{in some areas of}} former Czechoslovakia. The prevalence of infection varied from 70 to 80% in red deer and maximum <b>parasite</b> <b>burden</b> was 144 worms. In addition, sudden deaths were documented in free or game ranging deer. The highest mortality was reported in free ranging roe deer in Písek County in the South Bohemia of former Czechoslovakia. In the same region, moreover, the parasite was found in livers of slaughtered cattle. Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971) confirmed red deer, fallow deer and roe deer as main definitive hosts of F. magna in Europe. In 1960’s, F. magna was enzootic in former Czechoslovakia in following four major areas: (1) České Budějovice and Třeboň county, including Nové Hrady Mountains; (2) the area along the Vltava River on the Vltava-Týn hills near Hluboká and Bechyně; (3) Písek and Milevsko county; (4) the Brdy mountains and the Hřebeny mountains. In following years, F. magna was only reported from these areas. Recently, geographical distribution of F. magna in cervids was determined in the Czech Republic. The giant liver fluke was confirmed in the same areas as reported in 1960’s. However, seven new endemic areas of F. magna were discovered suggesting that the parasite is spreading in the Czech Republic. Moreover, the appearance of F. magna in the Šumava Mountains has epizootiological importance due to possibility of spread of the parasite into the German territory (Bavaria). During the last few years, a new European enzootic area has established in the Danube watershed in Central Europe. In 1988, F. magna was isolated from a 3-year old red deer female found dead near the Gabčíkovo water plant at the Danube River in Slovakia. The parasite has spread through whole Slovakian Danube watershed.|$|E

In vivo murine studies showed that there was interstrain variability in the infectivity of the different L. donovani strains, {{with two of the}} strains (20001 and 20003) giving low <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens.</b> In addition, interstrain variability in the antileishmanial efficacy of SSG in a single dose containing 300 mg of Sb(V) /kg of body weight was observed.

In SSG-responsive strains, the reduction in liver <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> by SSG-NIV treatment was similar to that caused by free SSG.

40|$|In a {{model of}} {{experimental}} cutaneous leishmaniasis, pre-exposure of Leishmania major-resistant mice to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, causes suppression of the protective anti-parasite T helper 1 response while paradoxically also reducing <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> in those animals. In this study, we examined if TCDD exposure could also reduce <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> in L. major-susceptible BALB/c mice. In the highest dose group (160 µg/Kg), TCDD treatment caused a significant reduction of <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> by 10 -fold after three weeks while also causing a significant lymphoid atrophy indicating suppression of the non-protective T helper 2 response. A dose-dependent delay of foot lesion progression was also observed such that lesion size in the highest dose group was {{less than half that}} of controls after 35 days of infection. Importantly, although TCDD exposure initially reduced disease severity and prolonged the course of disease by as much as three fold in some animals, this effect was transitory and TCDD did not induce resistance to L. major infection. Because TCDD exposure reduced L. major burdens in both resistant and susceptible mice, we hypothesized that TCDD reduces L. major burdens in mice by a mechanism that does not involve adaptive immunity. To test this, severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were used. In mice infected with a moderate number of L. major (10, 000), TCDD treatment caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease of <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> by nearly 100 -fold after six weeks in the highest dose group (200 µg/Kg). ...|$|R
40|$|Recently the {{phenomenon}} of predisposition to helminth infection {{has been reported in}} a number of studies: those individuals which are heavily infected before treatment with an anthelmintic tend also to acquire heavy <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> following a period of reinfection. This correlation between <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> in initial and reinfections is generated by differences between hosts in their exposure to infective stages and in their susceptibility to infection. Inter-host differences in these factors also generate the aggregated or over-dispersed parasite distributions that are usually observed. This paper uses probability theory to predict the correlation between initial and reinfection <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens</b> assuming that those inter-host differences which generate over-dispersion remain constant for a given individual between initial and reinfection periods. The predicted correlation is considerably greater than is observed in most published data sets. Over-dispersion is thus generated by variability between hosts which has components that remain constant between initial and reinfection and also components which vary between infection periods. The model is modified to account for those two sources of variability, and the result applied to published data to determine the contributions made by short and long-term factors to the observed distributions...|$|R

At the same time, Salomon (1932) diagnosed the fluke in one hunted red deer near Görlitz (Saxony) in Germany. Other isolated findings of the fluke were recorded in Italy and Poland. From 1948 till 1961, sporadic occurrence of the parasite in red deer (Cervus elaphus), fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) were reported by several authors in former Czechoslovakia. However, all reports were published {{on the basis of}} incident discoveries in hunted deer and no massive infections were documented.In 1960’s, a number of F. magna outbreaks in cervids were reported in some areas of former Czechoslovakia.

In following years, F. magna was only reported from these areas. Recently, geographical distribution of F. magna in cervids was determined in the Czech Republic. The giant liver fluke was confirmed in the same areas as reported in 1960’s.

Moreover, the appearance of F. magna in the Šumava Mountains has epizootiological importance due to possibility of spread of the parasite into the German territory (Bavaria). During the last few years, a new European enzootic area has established in the Danube watershed in Central Europe. In 1988, F. magna was isolated from a 3-year old red deer female found dead near the Gabčíkovo water plant at the Danube River in Slovakia. The parasite has spread through whole Slovakian Danube watershed.Soon after the Slovakian first report, F. magna was found in red deer in Hungarian parts of Danubian floodplain forests. The prevalence reported by the same authors was up to 90%. F. magna infection of cervids is a considerable problem in northern part of Hungary (Szigetköz) and the southern Danubian territory in the Gemenc area. Since the autumn of 2000, F. magna has been found in Austrian territory, east of Vienna. In years 2000-2001, the prevalence of the giant liver fluke in red deer in Austrian parts of Danube (east of Vienna) was 66.7%. [...] Appearance of American liver fluke was reported in Croatia in January 2000. The prevalence of fascioloidosis among red deer in Hungary was 21,1-60,7 % between 1998-2005. During the necropsy of 459 deer livers (using Egri's method) the number of flukes per host ranged from 1 to 138 in the same period. Regarding the origin of F. magna enzootic area in the Danube River watershed, it is essential to point out that cervids were not introduced into these localities, neither recently nor in the past. Origin of the F. magna population in Danubian floodplain forests in Central Europe remains therefore unclear.|$|E

While Th 1 immunity is required to control CL, protection during schistosomiasis requires Th 2 immunity.

Additionally, keratinocytes {{at the site of}} L. major infection in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, were postulated to be the source of the IL- 4.

Keratinocyte-specific IL- 4 Rα deficient (KRT 14 creIL- 4 Rα-/lox) BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice were generated by gene targeting and site-specific recombination (cre/loxP) under control of the KRT 14 locus. In the L. major footpad model, KRT 14 creIL- 4 Rα-/lox BALB/c mice developed increased swelling, high <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens,</b> and cytokine and antibody secretion similar to littermate controls. L. major-infected KRT 14 creIL- 4 Rα-/lox C 57 BL/ 6 mice had decreased footpad swelling, low <b>parasite</b> <b>burdens,</b> a dominant Th 1 cytokine response, and low type 1 and 2 antibody titres, similar to littermate control and resistant C 57 BL/ 6.
