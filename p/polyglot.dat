5|$|The Epistles of Clement of {{the codex}} were {{published}} in 1633 by Patrick Young, the Royal Librarian. A collation was made by Alexander Huish, Prebendary of Wells, for the London <b>Polyglot</b> Bible (1657). The text of the manuscript was cited as footnotes. Richard Bentley made a collation in 1675.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Mumbai call {{themselves}} Mumbaikar, Mumbaiite, Bombayite or Bombaiite. Mumbai {{has a large}} <b>polyglot</b> population like any other metropolitan city of India. Sixteen major languages of India are also spoken in Mumbai, with the most common being Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati and English. English is extensively spoken and is the principal language of the city's white collar workforce. A colloquial form of Hindi, known as Bambaiya – a blend of Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, Konkani, Urdu, Indian English and some invented words – is spoken on the streets.|$|E
5|$|When the Swedish invaded Zealand in August 1658, the Dutch Republic was not {{the only}} foreign power that took notice. A union between Brandenburg, Poland and Austria had already started to put {{together}} a relief army in December 1657, but preparations of the <b>polyglot</b> force took so long that the Treaty of Roskilde was signed before the army was ready to march. However, the preparations were not in vain—with the 1658 invasion the allies were in an excellent position to quickly put together a force and march towards Denmark.|$|E
50|$|Section 3 {{introduces}} {{more advanced}} techniques used by <b>polyglots.</b> While Section 2 was more practical, this section {{has more to}} do with the way <b>polyglots</b> think. For example, rather than follow the commonly held belief that “children are better at learning languages than adults”, Lonsdale explains how <b>polyglots</b> actively use their Adult Advantage.|$|R

5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain {{that it would be}} best to send me as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a <b>polyglot</b> intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian <b>Polyglot,</b> reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus replied {{that he had not}} found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are more reliable than Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus replied that he had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered that this was a case not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his third edition, Erasmus had seen the Complutensian <b>Polyglot,</b> and used its text for improvement of his own text. In the Book of Revelation he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of the}} Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had forgotten what places of the Apocalypse he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three parallel columns, they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the Vulgate.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the early}} interpreters of the United Nations were natural <b>polyglots</b> who were uprooted by wars and revolutions. For years, the only {{criterion}} used to select potential interpreters was the knowledge of two international languages the interpreters had to communicate in. <b>Polyglots</b> were found mainly in privileged social groups, government employees and professionals in colonial empires, in militarily and diplomatically powerful nations, in political or ideological exiles, in those who leave their countries temporarily for academic purposes, and in children of couples who speak different languages.|$|R

5|$|In November 1967, the LDS Church asked Hugh Nibley, a {{professor}} of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University (BYU), to study the fragments. Nibley was a <b>polyglot,</b> but not an Egyptologist, and subsequently studied under John A. Wilson {{in an attempt to}} learn enough about Egyptian hieroglyphics to translate them himself., he had begun to study Egyptian in Chicago with Dr. John A. Wilson". The LDS Church published sepia photographs of the papyri in its magazine Improvement Era in February 1968, although a translation was not provided at the time. The editors of an independent quarterly journal, , arranged for and published translations of the papyri courtesy of several Egyptologists and scholars, including: John A. Wilson (University of Chicago, Oriental Institute), Richard Anthony Parker (Director of the Department of Egyptology, Brown University), Klaus Baer (University of Chicago, Oriental Institute), and Jerald Tanner (independent scholar). Other translations and analyses have been performed at various times since 1968 by Mormon and non-Mormon scholars, including Michael D. Rhodes (BYU), John Gee (BYU), and Robert K. Ritner (University of Chicago).|$|E
5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a <b>polyglot,</b> speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano had a vast {{intellectual}} {{awareness of}} most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile <b>polyglot,</b> capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of the common good, which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of the common good, as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent <b>polyglots</b> are {{of little}} {{scholarly}} importance, the best recent texts having {{been confined to}} a single language; but at least into the early 20th century many biblical students still used Walton and, if it was available, Le Jay.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{invention}} of printing and the revival of philological studies, <b>polyglots</b> became a favourite means of advancing the knowledge of Middle Eastern languages, for which no good references were available, {{as well as for}} the study of Scripture.|$|R
50|$|Section 2 {{deals with}} the {{specific}} approaches used by <b>polyglots</b> in their approach to language learning. Lonsdale summarizes their approach to (for example) remember massive amounts of new information, and training themselves to sound {{more and more like}} a native speaker.|$|R

50|$|The {{multilingual}} {{character of}} Beninese society {{is characterized by}} the number of languages spoken, ethno-linguistic diversity, stratification of language use (whereby French is used officially and other languages used in other spheres of activity), and by the fact that many Beninese are <b>polyglots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|However, the {{political}} and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these <b>polyglots</b> conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing [...] "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the [...] "ethnic integrity" [...] of the region.|$|R

However, as different printed editions of the Samaritan Pentateuch are based upon different sets of manuscripts, the precise number varies significantly from one edition to another.|$|R
5000|$|Some exophonic authors may be bilingual or {{multilingual}} {{from their}} childhood years, even <b>polyglots,</b> while others may write in an acquired language.

50|$|In many societies, such as {{in those}} in Europe, {{languages}} are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This {{does not mean that}} most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often <b>polyglots,</b> and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.|$|R
