25|$|On July 2, 1937, midnight GMT, Earhart and Noonan {{took off}} from Lae Airfield in the heavily loaded Electra. Their {{intended}} destination was Howland Island, a flat sliver of land 6,500ft (2,000 m) long and 1,600ft (500 m) wide, 10ft (3 m) high and 2,556 miles (4,113km) away. Their last known <b>position</b> <b>report</b> was near the Nukumanu Islands, about 800 miles (1,300km) into the flight. The USCGC Itasca was on station at Howland, assigned to communicate with Earhart's Electra and guide them to the island once they arrived in the vicinity.|$|E
25|$|At 2123 Jellicoe {{was passed}} a <b>position</b> <b>report</b> from 2100 of the {{rearmost}} {{section of the}} German fleet, on course due south. The position was wrong due to German navigation errors, although the course had been correct at that time. The position was not credible as it placed the German ship south of his own position {{at the time he}} received the intercept, contrary to reports from his own ships of German positions, and the result was to increase his distrust in such intercepts. Jellicoe stated afterwards that he would always trust a report from one of his own ships rather than an intercept, although other analysis later demonstrated that these reports too contained errors or could be misleading.|$|E
500|$|LeMay {{used the}} Rexs noon <b>position</b> <b>report</b> of 11 May in {{conjunction}} with known routes and speeds of ocean liners bound for New York to calculate an intercept point for the next day, based on the ship's expected noon position for 12 May. An updated <b>position</b> <b>report</b> to refine his calculations was expected that evening but not received. Weather conditions deteriorated during the night, with a forecast that [...] "ceilings would be down to nothing" [...] {{in the vicinity of}} the anticipated interception.|$|E
5000|$|Traffic - When {{using an}} ADS-B In system, a pilot {{is able to}} view traffic {{information}} about surrounding aircraft if those aircraft are equipped with ADS-B out. This information includes altitude, heading, speed, and distance to aircraft. In addition to receiving <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> from ADS-B out participants, TIS-B USA-only can provide <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> on non ADS-B out-equipped aircraft if suitable ground equipment and ground radar exist. ADS-R re-transmits ADS-B <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> between UAT and 1090 MHz frequency bands.|$|R
50|$|On shortwave frequencies, <b>positions</b> are <b>reported</b> at square {{precision}}, and on VHF and UHF, subsquare precision is used. More precise <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> {{are very}} rarely used.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} {{by which}} an aircraft avoids obstacles or other aircraft is termed separation. The most important concept of IFR flying is that separation is maintained regardless of weather conditions. In controlled airspace, {{air traffic control}} (ATC) separates IFR aircraft from obstacles and other aircraft using a flight clearance based on route, time, distance, speed, and altitude. ATC monitors IFR flights on radar, or through aircraft <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> in areas where radar coverage is not available. Aircraft <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> are sent as voice radio transmissions. In the United States, a flight operating under IFR is required to provide <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> unless ATC advises a pilot that the plane is in radar contact. The pilot must resume <b>position</b> <b>reports</b> after ATC advises that radar contact has been lost, or that radar services are terminated.|$|R

500|$|At 08:30 on 12 May, {{the three}} B-17s {{had begun to}} taxi in a rain squall when a morning <b>position</b> <b>report</b> from Rex was relayed to LeMay. It {{indicated}} that the liner was then [...] from New York, farther east than his original computations had placed it. LeMay's original flight plan had incorporated an area search if necessary, but weather conditions and the ship's distance from Long Island precluded that possibility.|$|E
500|$|Eighty {{minutes after}} departure, at 14:22 GMT, the pilot radioed a routine message {{and gave his}} {{position}} as being [...] west of Guam at coordinates (...) [...] The aircraft was expected to reach [...] at 15:30. At that time, the Guam IFSS experienced temporary communication difficulties with heavy radio static. At 15:39 the Guam radio operator attempted to contact the flight for a <b>position</b> <b>report</b> {{but was unable to}} establish contact. The aircraft was not seen or heard from again.|$|E

500|$|Brig. Gen. Delos Emmons, {{commander}} of the GHQ Air Force's 1st Wing, dispatched bombers at 0900 on 13 August to search an area of [...] entirely covered by low clouds. Olds surmised that the Utah had feinted towards San Francisco, then reversed course to attack the industrial Los Angeles area. Accompanied by Maj. Gen. Frank Andrews (commanding the GHQ Air Force), he flew in the lead B-17 above the clouds, patrolling an area [...] offshore. A Navy patrol aircraft located the Utah at 11:00 steaming southeast [...] off the coast. The 2nd BG bombers responded to the <b>position</b> <b>report</b> and located the Utah shortly before the noon termination of the exercise. From an altitude of 400 feet they attacked the former battleship with Navy-supplied water bombs.|$|E

According to author Dwight Messimer, two British sources report that [...] sank U-69 at position [...] on 12 July. An observer in a kite balloon deployed by Patriot spotted a surfaced U-boat at 07:00. The U-boat submerged and Patriot hunted the submarine until noon, when it loosed two depth charges that brought thick brown oil to the surface. A postwar study by Germany cast doubt {{on whether or not}} the submarine attacked by Patriot was U-69. Officially, her fate remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|In May 1938 during Army maneuvers, bomber advocates {{wished to}} attempt an {{interception}} {{of a ship}} at sea, as far from land as the B-17's practical range would allow. The U.S. Navy refused to cooperate—instead, Reserve Lieutenant Harris Hull suggested intercepting an ocean liner. The War Department agreed, and arranged for coordination with the Italian ocean liner SS Rex which would be crossing the Atlantic. Lieutenant Colonel Ira C. Eaker, head of Air Corps public relations, contacted major news agencies for national publicity. Haynes flew {{one of the three}} B-17s specially prepared for the task. Aboard Haynes's aircraft were LeMay as navigator and the two theoretical war-maneuver adversaries: Major Vincent L. Meloy, another squadron commander acting as the attacking force's commander, and Olds as defending group commander. Positioned further back {{in the body of the}} bomber was one NBC radio announcer served by two broadcast engineers operating a powerful radio transmitter and a smaller transceiver tuned to the Rex. On May 12 through poor weather, the morning <b>position</b> <b>report</b> from the Rex placed the ship [...] at sea and the three B-17s took off in a driving rain.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the Amana set course for Adelaide, a Douglas DC-4 {{operated}} by Trans Australia Airlines became airborne at Perth, also heading for Adelaide. As the TAA aircraft set course for Adelaide, the captain, Douglas MacDonald, saw a vivid white flash on the horizon in precisely {{the direction in which}} he was heading. It lasted about six seconds, long enough for him to draw it {{to the attention of the}} two other crew members. Eight minutes later, the TAA aircraft passed over a band of fire on the ground. MacDonald estimated the fire was [...] east of Perth Airport. As MacDonald approached Cunderdin, he was aware the Amana, flying about ten minutes ahead of him, had not yet radioed its <b>position</b> <b>report</b> at Cunderdin. He became concerned that the vivid white flash and the ground fire might indicate some tragedy had befallen the Amana so he advised Air Traffic Control about his observations. Air Traffic Control was also concerned about the Amana's failure to report at Cunderdin so on hearing MacDonald's observations of the vivid white flash and the ground fire they activated emergency procedures. They asked MacDonald to fly back to the fire and determine its position. MacDonald did so and advised Air Traffic Control of bearings from the fire to York and Northam, the towns nearest the crash site.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} geographic position considered {{only in terms}} of measurement error, seems to be solved on a global scale. In view of the above, from the nineties, the operational characteristics of radio-navigation systems are equally important.

2500|$|In {{the period}} after [...] (Operation Beach Party), 52 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Fourth Balloon Wing, {{developed}} a III Wing practice of co-operation during artillery observation, by having balloon observers direct preliminary ranging, until shells were landing {{close to a}} target, then handing over to the aeroplane observer for the final corrections of aim. When the air observer had ranged the guns, the balloon observer took over again. The new method economised on aircrew and {{had the advantage of}} telephone communication between the ground and the balloon, since aircraft wireless could only transmit. Air co-operation with Royal Engineer sound ranging was also practised. A line of microphones were connected to a receiving station further back and activated by a forward observer. Air observers routinely sent [...] "NF" [...] by wireless and a <b>position</b> <b>report</b> when German batteries were seen to be firing and since German shelling often cut off the ground observer from contact with the rear, the sound-ranging station was equipped with a wireless receiver and used receipt of [...] "NF", to activate the sound ranging apparatus. The device could also be used to identify the position of German artillery, when the air observer was unable accurately to indicate the position of the guns; balloon observers also assisted the ranging section, by reporting gun flashes.|$|E
