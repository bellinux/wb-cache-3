40|$|Abstract. The current Internet {{implements}} hop-by-hop packet forwarding based {{entirely on}} globally-unique identiers specied in packet headers, and routing tables that identify destinations with globally unique identiers and specify the next hops to such destinations. This model is very robust; however, it supports {{only a single}} forwarding class per destination. As a result, the Internet must rely on mechanisms working on top of IP to support quality-of-service (QoS) or trafc engineering (TE). We present the rst <b>policy-based</b> connectionless <b>routing</b> architecture and algorithms to support QoS and TE {{as part of the}} basic network-level service of the Internet. We show that policy-aware connectionless routing can be accomplished with roughly the same computational efciency of the tra-ditional single-path shortest-path routing approach. ...|$|R

Although these policies {{are built on}} simple mechanisms provided by BGP, they give rise to very complex market structure. Extensive research efforts {{have been made to}} understand common practices of inter-domain policies. In early stages, hierarchical models were thought to be adequate to explain negotiation between the entities over improving routing and expressing routing preferences in general. Then, it has been realized that there are significant number of local policy exceptions and random decision making over hierarchical structure. In this work, we examine how effective these local policy exceptions are in providing better quality paths. Our analysis on traces captured from the Internet quantitatively shows that currently adopted local policies could not be as effective as multi-hop negotiations for the purpose of attaining better paths in terms of multiple path quality metrics.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel <b>policy-based</b> secure <b>routing</b> {{framework}} that extends the mandatory nature of network access-control policies and {{allows users to}} exercise discretionary control on what routes they choose in a given network. In contrast to existing research that focuses mainly on restricting network access based on user credentials, we present a model that allows users to specify discretionary constraints on path characteristics and discover routes based on situational trust attributes of routers in a network. In this context, we present three levels of trust-attribute certification based on inherent, consensus based, and inferred characteristics of routers. We also define a "confidence" measure that captures the "quality of protection" of a route with regard to various dynamic trust relationships that arise from this interaction between user preferences and network policy. Based on this measure, we show how to generate paths of highest confidence efficiently by using shortest path algorithms. We show how our model generalizes the notion of Quality of Protection (QoP) for secure routing and discuss {{how it can be}} applied to anonymous and privacy-aware routing, intrusion tolerant communication, and secure resource discovery for ubiquitous computing, high performance, and peer-to-peer environments. ...|$|R

For example, determining {{how hard it is to}} check that a BGP network is safe, i. e., it is guaranteed to converge, has been an elusive research goal up to now. In this paper, we address several problems related to BGP stability, stating the computational complexity of testing if a given configuration is safe, is robust, or is safe under filtering. Further, we determine the computational complexity of checking popular sufficient conditions for stability. We adopt a model that captures Local Transit policies, i. e., policies that are functions only of the ingress and the egress points. The focus on Local Transit policies is motivated by the fact that they represent a configuration paradigm commonly used by network operators. We also address the same BGP stability problems in the widely adopted SPP model. Unfortunately, we find that the most interesting problems are computationally hard even if policies are restricted to be as expressive as Local Transit policies. Our findings suggest that the computational intractability of BGP stability be an intrinsic property of <b>policy-based</b> path vector <b>routing</b> protocols that allow policies to be specified in complete autonomy...|$|R

40|$|Communication {{networks}} have reached amazing size and complexity nowadays. The Internet, which was born as an experimental network connecting {{a handful of}} volunteer research institutes, has grown to become a huge distributed system interconnecting almost 700 millions of hosts at present. As {{soon as it was}} clear that computer networks would have driven the information revolution, the Internet drew a lot of interest both from academia and from industry. Moreover, the demand for features that were not envisaged when the Internet was designed grew alongside with the size and complexity of the Internet itself. Routing, that is, ﬁnding a path in a network that interconnects a given source to a given destination, also needed to evolve accordingly: as soon as the Internet got into its commercial era, there was a strong demand for routing protocols that supported policies. Among the wide variety of routing protocols that can be found today in the Internet, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is responsible for connecting large administrative domains (called Autonomous Systems, or ASes), each administering its own network. BGP conﬁguration languages allow network administrators to deﬁne ﬁne-grained policies to inﬂuence the selection and the dissemination of routes over the network, and is therefore classiﬁed as a <b>policy-based</b> interdomain <b>routing</b> protocol. BGP policies allow each AS to autonomously conﬁgure its network in order, e. g., to minimize the cost of routing traﬃc, or to optimize delay. Ideally, BGP was designed to let each administrative domain choose the best route (where “best” obviously has local signiﬁcance) given the alternatives proposed by neighboring ASes. Unfortunately, as it is often the case in other branches of computer science, many agents that independently pursue a local optimum do not always converge into a global optimum. In particular, {{it has been shown that}} there exist sets of BGP policies that cannot be satisﬁed at the same time, and trap the protocol in inﬁnite oscillations in which a stable routing choice is never reached. This fact spurred lots of research eﬀorts towards techniques to characterize, discover, mitigate and eliminate BGP instabilities. This thesis presents novel research contributions as well as related work regarding the characterization and the detection of BGP instabilities under a common framework. We cover both the necessary theoretical background, as well as practical techniques and methodologies to analyze real BGP networks. First, we tackle the problem of ﬁnding a suitable model for studying BGP oscillations. This is indeed a nontrivial task, as many of the simplifying assumptions that have often been made to ease the analysis provably make the model unable to capture certain kinds of routing instabilities. Besides allowing us to pick the model that is best ﬁt to study oscillations, the insight provided by our study also makes us able to review related work with a deeper understanding of the interplay among many diﬀerent models for BGP. This thesis makes three main contributions. First, we show a suﬃcient and necessary condition for BGP safety under ﬁltering, that is, the property of a BGP network to have guaranteed convergence under arbitrary ﬁltering of BGP routes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst complete characterization of safety under ﬁltering. We exploit this ﬁnding to show a debugging technique that is able to spot the potential trouble points of a network by just analyzing two diﬀerent routing states. Second, we study the possibility of manipulating internal BGP (iBGP) attributes. While in general such a practice exacerbates the BGP stability problem, adherence to simple guidelines ensures BGP stability while still providing some beneﬁts in terms, e. g., of traﬃc engineering capabilities. Third, we devise and implement an algorithm which is able to tell whether a given BGP network is stable. This algorithm is provably free from false positives, and it is able to pinpoint the trouble points of a potentially unstable network. We show that this algorithm, together with techniques to perform some preprocessing on BGP networks, can be implemented eﬃciently enough to deal with Internet scale BGP topologies as well as very large iBGP networks. Finally, we propose a BGP monitoring system that is able to collect BGP data in such a way to enable the analysis of what-if scenarios...|$|R

Many peer-to-peer networks are in existence today and each has various methods for discovering new peers, searching for content, and overcoming connectivity problems. The addition of efficient <b>policy-based</b> <b>routing</b> enhances the ability of peers within overlay networks to make appropriate routing decisions. <b>Policy-based</b> <b>routing</b> provides a means for peers to define the types of network traffic {{they are willing to}} route and the conditions under which they will route it. The motivations for these policies are many and are described in upcoming sections. In order to express and enforce policies, a simple policy definition language was developed. This language is sufficient for owners of overlay nodes to choose to route traffic based on their own requirements and gives node owners a means to express these requirements, such that other nodes within the overlay network can learn them. A mechanism is presented that allows these policies to be stored either in a distributed hash table or on a set of directory servers. The effectiveness of <b>policy-based</b> <b>routing</b> was tested using a simulated network. The affect of these routing policies, in terms of both additional network traffic and requirements for client software, was also assessed.

Although inter-domain routing has been well supported in the Internet, there has been relatively little support to the Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) space. In MANETs, the inter-domain routing problem is challenged by: (1) dynamic network topology due to mobility, and (2) diverse intra-domain ad hoc routing protocols. In this paper, we discuss how to enable inter-domain routing among MANETs, and to handle the dynamic nature of MANETs.
