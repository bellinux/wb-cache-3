5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{assassination}} remain disputed, {{the involvement of the}} Portuguese government, particularly Aginter <b>Press</b> <b>or</b> PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} leading to the Constitutional Convention, Alex {{and the rest of}} the task force try to stop Roarke from getting the votes needed to allow the Convention to take place. After their initial plan fails, they resort to a final strategy. At the {{convention}} in Philadelphia, Alex publicly broadcasts Roarke's recordings with the Federal Security Service and emails the evidence to the ACLU and other rights organizations, before having Miranda fake her death by shooting her at the event. Roarke, not willing to face the <b>press</b> <b>or</b> the police, commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{weekend of the}} season Manchester United faced Leicester City at Old Trafford, and went a goal down within seven minutes; Muzzy Izzet’s cross was met by Emile Heskey to scuff {{the ball into the}} net before Tony Cottee– the scorer in the {{previous}} season’s corresponding fixture– added a second with fifteen minutes remaining. Teddy Sheringham’s intervention and a last gasp free kick by David Beckham helped the home side salvage a point, setting a precedent for things to come. The team's first away game at West Ham followed, but despite the debut of striker Dwight Yorke, United were held to a goalless draw. Beckham, who had become a national hate figure after his dismissal in the World Cup, received a torrid reception by the home supporters, with every touch of the ball made by him jeered at. Bottles and stones were directed at the team coach prior to kick-off. After the game Ferguson, his players, and the Manchester United staff refused to be interviewed by the <b>press</b> <b>or</b> television.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's win {{brought it}} to a final record of 111, while Clemson's loss lowered it to a final record of 93. Despite the Hokies' win, they did not advance in either the Associated <b>Press</b> <b>or</b> Coaches' polls. Tech ended the year ranked No. 6 in both polls and No. 5 in the BCS. Clemson also {{remained}} relatively stationary in the polls. The Tigers remained at No. 16 in the Associated Press poll and dropped from No. 13 to No. 14 in the Coaches' Poll. The victory {{was the first in}} three bowl trips for the Hokies. The loss was Clemson's fifth straight in a bowl game and fourth in eight trips to the Gator Bowl at that point.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accounts}} about Murrell's {{activities have}} been preserved, {{either because they}} were reported on by the regional <b>press</b> <b>or</b> because they were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent local women were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, {{the wife of the}} Reverend William Atkinson, the vicar of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the vicar intervened, with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife. The vicar himself died in March 1847.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{spent the}} winter in Boston, and {{returned}} to the composition of his work. He gradually changed the focus of the History, deciding that he was a better writer of history than biography and worked solidly for the next two years, alternating between Boston and Nahant. This period was interrupted only by the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth in early 1852. Her husband was James Alexander; they settled in a house near the family home in Pepperell. Prescott's mother fell ill on May 17 and died soon after, which caused Prescott to fall into a bout of depression that lasted until the winter. He returned to his work, and continued at the pace that he was able through the remainder of 1852 and 1853, which passed uneventfully. Prescott started to suffer seriously from rheumatism during the former year, and as a result he abandoned his residence at Nahant. He bought a house in the then rural town of Lynn, Massachusetts, where he was visited by Charles Lyell and his family in June 1853. On August 22, he finished the second volume of the History. The first two volumes were finished by May 1855, but not immediately published. Changes in British copyright law and a change of publishers caused Prescott to delay publication until November. Compared to his previous works, the History received little coverage in the <b>press</b> <b>or</b> in academic journals. It was suggested to him at this time that he should write a biography of Charles V, but he declined, as he regarded the work of William Robertson on the subject to be definitive. However, he wrote an appendix to Robertson's The History of the reign of Charles V in May 1855; it was published in December 1856. Previously uninterested in politics (although he had predicted the Whig victory in 1840,) Prescott supported and voted for the Republican John C. Frémont in the 1856 Presidential election. He continued to work on the third volume of the History until he suffered a stroke on 3 February 1858. Prescott recovered, but his health was permanently affected, and he decided to temporarily retire from writing. The third volume was therefore published in April, and its scope was more limited than Prescott had originally planned. He worked on the Spanish translation of the Conquest of Mexico, which had been prepared by José Fernando Ramírez and Lucas Alamán.|$|E

25|$|A slight {{problem with}} {{electrotyping}} of type {{is that the}} new form is slightly smaller than the original - according to Justin Howes, the calculation of the Stephenson Blake type foundry was that the shrinkage was on average 0.0038%. While obviously not very much, this deviance could accumulate if a letterform was repeatedly regenerated. Stephenson Blake's solution was to squash type slightly in a <b>press</b> <b>or</b> file it down to broaden it before putting it into the electrotype bath.|$|E

25|$|Homosexuality in the United Kingdom was decriminalised in 1967, {{leading to}} a more liberal public attitude.

25|$|The Whitechapel murders were {{featured}} {{heavily in}} the media, and {{attracted the attention of}} Victorian society at large.
