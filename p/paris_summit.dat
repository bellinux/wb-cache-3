25|$|As {{a result}} of the spy plane {{incident}} and the attempted cover-up, the Four Power <b>Paris</b> <b>Summit</b> was not completed. At the beginning of the talks on 16 May, there was still hope that the two sides could come together even after the events that took place earlier in May, but Eisenhower refused to apologize and Khrushchev left the summit one day after it had begun. Some people said that Khrushchev had overreacted to the event in an attempt to strengthen his own position, and for that, he was the one to blame for the collapse of the Four Power <b>Paris</b> <b>Summit.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with the Barcelona Process, {{one of the biggest}} innovations of the Union for the Mediterranean is its institutional architecture. It was decided at the <b>Paris</b> <b>Summit</b> to provide the Union with a whole set of institutions in order to up-grade the political level of its relations, promote a further co-ownership of the initiative among the EU and Mediterranean partner countries and improve the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership's visibility.|$|E

Turkey's desire to have a Deputy Secretary General and Cyprus' rejection of it, resulted in months of negotiation until Cyprus finally approved the creation of a sixth Deputy Secreaty General post assigned to a Turkish citizen.|$|E
25|$|Bissell {{and other}} project {{officials}} believed that surviving a U-2 accident from above 70,000feet was impossible, so {{they used the}} preexisting cover story. On 3 May, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA, the successor to NACA) announced {{that one of its}} aircraft, making a high-altitude research flight in Turkey, was missing; the government planned to say, if necessary, that the NASA aircraft had drifted with an incapacitated pilot across the Soviet border. By remaining silent, Khrushchev lured the Americans into reinforcing the cover story until he revealed on 7 May that Powers was alive and had confessed to spying on the Soviet Union. Eisenhower turned down Dulles' offer to resign and publicly took full responsibility for the incident on 11 May; by then all overflights were canceled. The <b>Paris</b> <b>Summit</b> collapsed after Khrushchev, as the first speaker, demanded an apology from the U.S., which Eisenhower refused.|$|E
25|$|With the Nivelle Offensive in {{its final}} stages, Lloyd George went to the <b>Paris</b> <b>Summit</b> {{authorised}} by the 1 May 1917 War Cabinet to “press the French to continue the offensive”. Lloyd George was keen to build bridges with the generals and told them at Paris (3 May 1917) that he would back their plans (“We must go on hitting and hitting with all our strength”) and stressed that they must choose {{the time and place}} of the next offensive. The next day Robertson stressed attrition with limited territorial objectives, whilst Hankey stressed the importance of Zeebrugge, where the Germans would suffer attrition if they stood and fought. Over dinner the Prime Minister reduced the company to “fits of laughter” with an impersonation of Robertson. Robertson thought Paris “about the best Conference we have had”. With Russian commitment to the war wavering, Smuts, Milner and Curzon agreed with Robertson that Britain must attack in the west lest France or Italy be tempted to make a separate peace.|$|E

2500|$|Still Eisenhower faced {{criticism}} in the press for not controlling his own administration, as Cannon's speech only said the mission was [...] "under the aegis of" [...] the president, not [...] "directed by." [...] Press reports were creating {{a belief in the}} public that Eisenhower had lost control, which Eisenhower would not let stand. Knowing that he was jeopardizing the <b>Paris</b> Peace <b>Summit,</b> Eisenhower decided to reveal the aerial espionage program and his direct role in it, an unprecedented move for a U.S. President. His speech on 11 May revolved around four main points: the need for intelligence gathering activities; the nature of intelligence gathering activities; how intelligence activities should be viewed (as distasteful, but vital); and finally that Americans should not be distracted from the real problems of the day. Eisenhower closed passionately by reacting to the Soviet claim that the US acted provocatively and said: [...] "They had better look at their own [...] record." [...] As he finished, he told reporters he was still going to the <b>Paris</b> Peace <b>Summit.</b>|$|R
40|$|The 2015 <b>Paris</b> Climate <b>summit</b> {{consolidated}} {{the transition}} of the climate regime from a “regulatory” to a “catalytic and facilitative” model.

[...] Finally, Operation Sandblast gathered extensive oceanographic, hydrographic, gravimetric, geophysical, and psychological data during Tritons circumnavigation.|$|E
500|$|A {{test ban}} seemed {{particularly}} close in 1960, with Britain and France {{in accord with}} the US (though France conducted its first nuclear test in February) and the Soviet Union having largely accepted the Macmillan-Eisenhower proposal. But US-Soviet relations soured after an American U-2 spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace in May 1960. The <b>Paris</b> <b>summit</b> was abruptly cancelled and the Soviet Union withdrew from the seismic research group, which subsequently dissolved. Meetings of the Geneva Conference continued until December, but little progress was made as Western-Soviet relations continued to grow more antagonistic through the summer, punctuated by the Congo Crisis in July and angry exchanges at the UN in September. Macmillan would later claim to President John F.

500|$|The {{possibility}} of a submerged circumnavigation of the world by a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine was initially discussed between Captain Evan P. Aurand, President Eisenhower's naval aide, and Commander William R. Anderson, commanding officer of the first nuclear submarine, Nautilus, before {{it was decided to}} attempt a submerged voyage under the North Pole. [...] Captain Aurand is credited with recommending that a successful submerged circumnavigation, timed to conclude just prior to the upcoming May 1960 Four Power <b>Paris</b> <b>Summit</b> between U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, would provide a much needed boost to American prestige, and consequently this voyage, code-named Operation Sandblast, reflected the highest priority within the Eisenhower administration. [...] Captain Aurand outlined this proposed submerged around the world voyage, Project Magellan, to Admiral Arleigh Burke, the Chief of Naval Operations, in a memorandum dated 6 January 1960. [...] Admiral Burke's classified response dated 18 January 1960 acknowledged the technical feasibility of Project Magellan while further noting that the [...] "Magellan route" [...] could be transited in [...] "56 days at [...] and 75 days at ," [...] with the latter option costing an additional $3.34 million USD in nuclear fuel consumed. [...] Aurand forwarded his Project Magellan proposal and Burke's assessment to Press Secretary James C. Hagerty in a memorandum dated 26 January 1960. [...] Project Magellan was subsequently approved by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and USS Triton was specifically recommended by Aurand to undertake Project Magellan.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt {{does not}} happen very often that a {{technical}} matter such as accounting makes it into the final declaration of a G 20 summit, agreed by the heads of government of the world’s leading nations.

After holding their initial meeting as a Group of Twenty in Washington to deliberate about the means to cure the most severe financial crisis since the interwar period, the leaders of the G 20 called on their finance ministers to formulate recommendations in areas such as “Mitigating against pro-cyclicality in regulatory policy” and “Reviewing and aligning global accounting standards, particularly for complex securities in times of stress” (G 20 2008). Ever since, measures to reform international accounting standards – namely, those produced by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) – have been on the working agenda of G 20 meetings, even if they have moved from front to backstage and are increasingly repeated in terms of the same phrases (see the Declarations of the London, Pittsburgh, Toronto, Seoul, and <b>Paris</b> <b>summits</b> (www. g 20. org/pub_communiques. aspx) ...|$|R
