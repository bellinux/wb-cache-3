50|$|Recent {{developments}} in semiconductor curve tracer systems now allow three core types of curve tracing: current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V), and ultra-fast transient or pulsed current-voltage (I-V). Modern curve tracer instrument designs {{tend to be}} modular, allowing system specifiers to configure them to match the applications for which they will be used. For example, new mainframe-based curve tracer systems, can be configured by specifying the number and power level of the Source Measure Units (SMUs) to be plugged into the slots in the back panel of the chassis. This modular design also provides the flexibility to incorporate other types of instrumentation to handle {{a wider range of}} applications. These mainframe-based systems typically include a self-contained PC to simplify test setup, data analysis, graphing and printing, and on-board results storage. Users of these types of systems include semiconductor researchers, device modeling engineers, reliability engineers, die sort <b>engineers,</b> and <b>process</b> <b>development</b> <b>engineers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On January 24, 2002, Agere Systems {{announced}} that it would be closing the [...] Reading Works in 12 to 18 months. The planned changes involved closing the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania plant in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, which was opened in 1988; selling the Orlando plant in Florida; and consolidating several locations in New Jersey. All operations were consolidated at the Allentown, Pennsylvania, headquarters location and the New Jersey locations. About 1,500 workers were transferred from Reading to Allentown where 3,200 workers were employed prior to the relocation. As Agere was leaving, Legerity, Inc., assumed some of the operations formerly done by the Muhlenberg plant in the old Building 10 on North 13th Street. In this facility Legerity assembled 40 former Agere circuit-design, physical-design, application-design and <b>process</b> <b>development</b> <b>engineers</b> to support the analog line card integrated circuit business it purchased from Agere. Legerity is a design facility that uses other companies foundries to manufacture its products. In May 2003, Agere Systems Inc. ended all manufacturing and began decommissioning its Muhlenberg Township plant. The last 346 manufacturing employees were laid off. About 50 employees — mostly maintenance — remained at the plant until a buyer was found.|$|R
40|$|International audienceMultiple {{perspectives}} need to {{be included}} in a product <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> <b>Engineers</b> from different departments usually have different views on a product design. It is hence necessary to define information structures that support multiple views. This paper provides an analysis and approach to develop a multi-view semantic model of three levels to describe product features. We base our analysis on a three-level conceptulization of engineering design features. The base level is substance, the intermediate level is view, and the top level is purpose. A multi-view semantic model will enhance semantic integrity of feature information throughout the product development for sharing information, such as design intent, manufacturing capability, and quality requirements...|$|R

The reuse of such non-ontological resources necessarily involves their re-engineering into ontologies. Non-ontological resources are highly heterogeneous in their data model and contents: they encode different types of knowledge, and they can be modeled and implemented in diﬀerent ways. In this paper we present (1) a typology for non-ontological resources, (2) a pattern based approach for re-engineering non-ontological resources into ontologies, and (3) a use case of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNowadays {{high speed}} {{machining}} (HSM) machine tool combines productivity and part quality. So mould and die maker invested in HSM. Die and mould features {{are more and}} more complex shaped. Thus, it is difficult to choose the best machining strategy according to part shape. Geometrical analysis of machining features is not sufficient to make an optimal choice. Some research show that security, technical, functional and economical constrains {{must be taken into account}} to elaborate a machining strategy. During complex shape machining, production system limits induce feed rate decreases, thus loss of productivity, in some part areas. In this paper we propose to analyse these areas by estimating tool path quality. First we perform experiments on our HSM machine tool to determine trajectory impact on machine tool behaviour. Then, we extract critical criteria and establish models of performance loss. Our work is focused on machine tool kinematical performance and numerical controller unit calculation capacity. We implement these models on Esprit CAM Software. During machining trajectory creation, critical part areas can be visualised and analysed. Parameters, such as, segment or arc lengths, nature of discontinuities encountered are used to analyse critical part areas. According to this visualisation, <b>process</b> <b>development</b> <b>engineer</b> should validate or modify the trajectory...|$|E
50|$|However, as the <b>development</b> <b>process</b> continued, <b>engineers</b> at BorgWarner {{discovered}} that, with clever software programming, {{they could}} control the variable electromagnetic multi-disc clutch {{to a point}} where it would allow the front and rear drive shafts to turn at different rotational speeds on its own, without the aid of a planetary or bevel geared center differential. In Auto mode the new software algorithms allowed the multi-disc clutch pack's friction and clutch discs to slip as needed, simulating a planetary or bevel geared center differential, making a geared differential redundant. Thus, the geared differential was abandoned and therefore never included on the final production version of the four-wheel drive system.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{software}} <b>development</b> <b>process,</b> software <b>engineers</b> produce numerous documents, ranging from initial specification documents to documents associated with implementation. Some of these documents are diagrammatic in nature, such as traditional design documents. Others are textual such as program source code. Textual software engineering documents, particularly source code, contain relational structures which are most naturally presented diagrammatically. This paper investigates the types of diagrams that are commonly used by software engineers throughout the life of software. To establish the requirements of such diagrams in a generic manner, a set of review criteria was created. Our goal is to establish display requirements for general-purpose tools that will provide software engineers with diagrammatic views of these documents...|$|R

Agile software development methods promote adaptive planning, system development, timely delivery and scalability. There is various agile software development methods are available such as scrum, XP, Feature Driven Development (FDD) etc, used to deliver quality functional requirements (FR). In software <b>development</b> <b>process</b> software <b>engineers</b> are mainly concentrating only on functional requirements under the pressure of deploying the software as early as possible. But NFR is also important element of the <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> NFR is responsible for success and failure of the system.

40|$|MBA - WBSThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to identify the factors, both the barriers and facilitators, influencing the development of management skills in South African civil engineers. There were 2 research propositions set up from the literature review. The research method adopted was quantitative factor analysis to test the two propositions. Data was collected through a survey conducted at a case site Grinaker-LTA. A 7 -point Likert scale was used as the measuring instrument. The research findings concluded that the factors which are barriers in the development of management skills in civil engineers included the lack of training, the lack of management skills in engineers and job dissatisfaction. The facilitating factors included the use of coaching, management related training, the use of employee feedback systems and the self <b>development</b> of the <b>engineer.</b> The second research proposition produced two new factors which were the learning organisation and the effects of cultural diversity on the management <b>development</b> <b>process</b> of <b>engineers.</b> The key recommendations include that human resource managers in construction firms should use the factors from the research in order to improve the processes within the organisation in order to assist in the <b>development</b> of <b>engineers</b> into manager...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{document}} {{is the latest}} revision of the SEMATECH Qualification Plan Guidelines for Engineering. The guidelines are designed to characterize process performance and equipment and improve reliability. It provides a method for experimentation and improvement. The plan is used to understand, quantify, and improve the functionality of a tool or process while reducing variability. It provides <b>process</b> <b>engineers,</b> hardware <b>development</b> <b>engineers,</b> and their managers {{a basic understanding of}} the various elements in a development methodology that emphasizes quality, completeness, and decision-making with statistically valid data. This revision differs from the previous version as follows: 1) A reliability improvement methodology based on Motorola’s IRONMAN procedure has been added. 2) The guidelines are no longer classified SEMATECH Confidential because references to particular suppliers or pieces of equipment have been deleted while still retaining useful illustrative examples. 3) An appendix has been added that outlines the additional steps a member company might add to the SEMATECH Qualification Plan to achieve a full “Production Use Readiness Qualification. ” The steps are useful because the plan focuses primarily on product or process characterization and/or improvement issues, and not on factor...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the use of}} robust design within product {{development}} has a large potential, its practical application in industry has been limited. Learning from an earlier less successful trial, the Volvo Group developed an initiative that was successful in making robust design part of development engineers’ regular work. This initiative was conducted in 2006 - 2009 as action-research collaboration with Chalmers University of Technology, involving researchers and 22 master students. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe and analyze this initiative. Data have been gathered through formal interviews, participation and observation in formal and informal meetings and through master theses. The initiative’s design included a broader robust design concept, emphasizing robust design principles, and the creation of local learning <b>processes</b> involving product <b>development</b> <b>engineers</b> and their supervisors. The company-university collaboration functioned as a ‘learning alliance’ on different levels. First, a learning relationship was created between individual engineers and master-students resulting in reflection-in-action and iterative mutual learning. Second, the learning alliance also included professors/researchers from Chalmers interacting with company representatives in an open learning environment, as well as reflection-in-supervision in the interaction with master-students. This interaction also supported the company in its process of creating structure and practices for organizational learning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{popularity}} of component-based models, languages, and tools, there is an absence of reusability assessment/analyses throughout the design and <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> Software <b>engineers</b> {{must be allowed to}} precisely measure the potential and actual reuse of software artifacts to achieve domainspecific reuse for an organization's current and future products. Towards this goal, our previous work provides a formal framework for reusability assessment of components and classes via metrics and refactoring guidelines/algorithms, at the development stage. This paper significantly extends that work by incorporating reuse definition, assessment, and analysis into UML at the design stage, prior to the existence of code. Specifically, we expand our reuse model/framework to include dependency tracking in use case and class diagrams in support of reusability analysis and refactoring for UML. We discuss the integration of these extensions into Together Control Center, for reusability measurement across UML to support reuse from design to development. ...|$|R

However, society is not uniform and some people will benefit or be adversely impacted more than others. Access to decision making is one important factor in determining the impact on different social groups.

40|$|Most {{packaged}} food products deteriorate in quality due to mass transfer phenomena such as moisture absorption, oxygen invasion, flavor loss, undesirable odor absorption and packaging material migration. An approach {{to increase the}} shelf life of the {{packaged food}}, while exploiting the advantages of flexible packaging, is to use flexible multi-layer polyethylene (PE) -based films including a barrier layer. This paper reviews different oxygen barrier layers used in Doy Pack flexible pouches for fruit puree and presents the impact of storage conditions on the organoleptic properties. In this study, the performances of five types of PE film pouched filled with fruit puree have been studied and compared. Regarding the organoleptic properties, this study focused on the 5 Hydroxy Methyl Furfural (HMF) increase, the L-Ascorbic Acid reduction, the brightness and the yellow color intensity decreases versus storage conditions. From those measurements, kinetic models of these organoleptic characteristics have been extracted and their relative behavior at longer shelf life have been calculated. Those results {{can be used as}} a reference by laminates <b>process</b> and <b>development</b> packaging <b>engineers</b> to support PE multi-layer film structure definition according to the targeted food application and shelf life conditions...|$|R
