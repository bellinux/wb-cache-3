5000|$|Prior to 1988, <b>poligeenan</b> was {{referred}} to as [...] "degraded carrageenan" [...] in the scientific literature. The terms [...] "poligeenan" [...] and [...] "degraded carrageenan" [...] were often used interchangeably in research articles and reports. [...] The use of the term [...] "degraded carageenan" [...] caused confusion, which resulted in the attribution of the negative observations associated the polymer being attributed to carrageenan. [...] <b>Poligeenan</b> and carrageenan are completely different products. Carrageenan is an approved food additive with an extensive toxicology data base that has been reviewed by regulatory bodies and provides scientific evidence for safe inclusion in foods. <b>Poligeenan</b> is not an approved food additive in the United States. The low molecular weight of <b>poligeenan</b> precludes it from exhibiting functionality in food. The International Agency for Research on Cancer assigned <b>poligeenan</b> to carcinogenic risk category 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans).|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} for <b>poligeenan</b> is for {{clinical}} diagnostic applications, and specifically {{the suspension of}} barium sulfate slurries used in X-ray studies of the mouth, throat, and esophagus during swallowing. For this application, <b>poligeenan</b> delivers three essential properties: First, its viscosity imparts lubricity to make the slurry easier to swallow. Second, this same viscosity is high enough to maintain full suspension of all barium sulfate particles during the complete X-ray procedure. Third, the high charge density of the <b>poligeenan</b> solution (ester sulfate units) prevents caking or aggregation of the barium sulfate particles during long-term storage of ready-to-use slurry products, these being easily reconstituted by shaking. The combination of these three application properties necessitates <b>poligeenan</b> to have molecular weights in the range 10-20 kDa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Poligeenan</b> is {{produced}} by the harsh acid degradation of carrageenan. Carrageenan in solution is processed at low pH (~1.0) and high temperature (90 C) {{for up to six}} hours until the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) has been reduced to the range 10,000 - 20,000 daltons (10-20 kDa). The resulting <b>poligeenan</b> solution is neutralized and spray dried to a fine powder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Poligeenan</b> (CAS No. 53973-98-1) {{is a low}} viscosity, low {{molecular}} weight, sulfated polygalactan polymer used exclusively in clinical diagnostic applications. The polymer {{is derived from the}} molecular backbone of carrageenan.|$|E
5000|$|Tight binding of {{carrageenan}} to ingested food proteins {{is considered}} less available than {{in drinking water}} for interaction with the absorptive cells of the gastrointestinal tract, although some studies have linked food-grade carrageenan to gastrointestinal disease in laboratory animals. [...] Studies {{have been based on}} the use of [...] "degraded carrageenan", a fraction of low-molecular weight segments of the carrageenan molecular backbone called [...] "poligeenan". The US Adopted Names Council assigned the name [...] "poligeenan" [...] to the fragments with molecular weight of 10,000 to 20,000 Da. Approximately 8% of the fragments of food-grade carrageenan are of molecular mass less than 50,000 Da, in excess of the recommended maximum of 5% set by the European Scientific Committee on Food to ensure that the presence of <b>poligeenan</b> is kept to a minimum. The proportion of this 8% that consists of <b>poligeenan</b> is unknown.|$|E
40|$|Female {{guinea pigs}} (12 /group) {{were given a}} single dose of [I 4 C]-olestra by gavage after {{consuming}} either 3 % <b>poligeenan</b> in tap water (Compromised group) or just tap water (Normal group) for 5 weeks. A Sentinel group (N = 2) was given 3 % <b>poligeenan</b> for 5 weeks. Ten sentinel animals were killed 1 day before and 10 1 day after the other animals were dosed with [uC]olestra and their gastrointestinal tracts were examined by histology. The Compro-mised and Normal animals were endoscoped just before dosing with [MC]olestra. Urine and feces were collected continuously and CO 2 was collected for 7 days after dosing. The samples were ana-lyzed for 14 C and urine was also analyzed for [MC]sucrose. Animals (3 /group) were killed 1, 3, 7, and 21 days after dosing, and tissues were collected and assayed for MC. Tissue lipids were extracted, fractionated by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and ana-lyzed for [uC]olestra by liquid scintillation. Animals fed poligee...|$|E
