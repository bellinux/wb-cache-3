5|$|Women with Lynch {{syndrome}} {{should begin}} to have annual biopsy screening {{at the age of}} 35. Some women with Lynch syndrome elect to have a <b>prophylactic</b> hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy to greatly reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.|$|E
5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, {{he was interested in}} the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal <b>prophylactic</b> against malaria, as they could be manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E
5|$|He is {{associated}} with the gourmand Apicius. Under Apicius' influence he disdained a certain vegetable of the cabbage family, earning a reprimand from Tiberius. Drusus is also recorded as using bitter almonds (five or six at a time) as a <b>prophylactic</b> against drunkenness.|$|E
50|$|Causal <b>prophylactics</b> target {{not only}} the blood stages of malaria, but the initial liver stage as well. This means that the user can stop taking the drug seven days after leaving the area of risk. Malarone and {{primaquine}} are the only causal <b>prophylactics</b> in current use.|$|R
50|$|Chloroquine, proguanil, mefloquine, and {{doxycycline}} are suppressive <b>prophylactics.</b> This {{means that}} they are only effective at killing the malaria parasite once it has entered the erythrocytic stage (blood stage) of its life cycle, and therefore have no effect until the liver stage is complete. That is why these <b>prophylactics</b> must continue to be taken for four weeks after leaving the area of risk.|$|R
40|$|A ZJER {{debate on}} whether {{cultural}} morals are alternative methods of curbing HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe. In {{view of the}} high prevalence of HIV and AIDS infection among Zimbabwean school children, liberals have been calling for the distribution of <b>prophylactics,</b> commonly known as condoms/sheath, to pupils. This, however, has sparked {{a great deal of}} controversy as the conservatives, guided by the religio-cultural and moral philosophy of unhu/ubuntu, strongly feel that while it is necessary to curb the spread of HIV and AIDS among pupils, distributing <b>prophylactics</b> to pupils is an anathema. Using data collected through focus group discussions, interviews and document analysis, this article explores the merits and demerits of issuing these <b>prophylactics</b> to school children in the religio-cultural context of Zimbabwe. In doing this, empirical evidence from countries such as Zambia, Uganda, United States of America and Britain, have been cited in an attempt to demonstrate the appropriateness or inappropriateness of distributing <b>prophylactics</b> to pupils. The study revealed that instead of <b>prophylactics,</b> a curriculum that promotes unhu/ubuntu moral philosophy has the potential to offer a more appropriate response to the problem ofHIV and AIDS among pupils. The philosophy requires us not only to reconsider, but also to radically transform the socialisation of the boy child and men...|$|R
5|$|<b>Prophylactic</b> cranial {{irradiation}} (PCI) {{is a type}} of radiotherapy to the brain, used {{to reduce}} the risk of metastasis. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.|$|E
5|$|The substem {{preceding}} {{the source of}} the antibody refers to the medicine's target.

5|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} {{infection}} in women prior to or during pregnancy {{does not appear}} to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether <b>prophylactic</b> treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).|$|E

5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and <b>prophylactic</b> antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|A <b>prophylactic</b> method {{introduced}} {{after the}} North Sea Flood of 1953 is {{the construction of}} dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge.

5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's <b>prophylactic</b> forceps {{approach}} found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E

5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and <b>prophylactic</b> measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a <b>prophylactic</b> {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. <b>Prophylactic</b> quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E

5|$|On 10 August 1917, Downes became Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS) of the Desert Mounted Corps, {{while still}} {{retaining}} {{the post of}} ADMS AIF Egypt. He was therefore answerable to three superiors—to Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{the commander of the}} Desert Mounted Corps and AIF Egypt; to Major General Neville Howse, the DMS AIF in London; and to the new British DMS EEF, Major General William Travers Swan. As the EEF advanced into Palestine, the major medical problem remained transportation. During the operations in the Es Salt area, Downes experimented with the delivery of drugs and medical supplies by air. In the Jordan valley in 1918, however, Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous preventative and <b>prophylactic</b> efforts were required in order to bring it under control.|$|E
5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with <b>prophylactic</b> medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive <b>prophylactic</b> therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a <b>prophylactic</b> and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
