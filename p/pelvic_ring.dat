Four kinds of implants were investigated, that is, the laparoscopic-assisted plate (LAP), the percutaneous anterior pelvic bridge (PAPB), the transramus intraosseous screw (TIS), and the open reduction (OR). The stability of the implants was investigated under three loading cases, showing that when the LAP was used, the stress at the fracture site was smaller than that at other parts, while for other implants, the high stress was always around the fracture site. In conclusion, the LAP demonstrated a good biomechanical performance in fixing the <b>pelvic</b> anterior <b>ring</b> fracture and is a promising technique in clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Non-compressible torso {{haemorrhage}} (NCTH) {{carries a}} high mortality in trauma as many patients exsanguinate prior to definitive haemorrhage control. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is an adjunct {{that has the}} potential to bridge patients to definitive haemostasis. However, the proportion of trauma patients in whom REBOA may be utilised is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a population based analysis of 2012 - 2013 Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) data. We identified the number of patients in whom REBOA may have been utilised, defined by an Abbreviated Injury Scale score ≥ 3 to abdominal solid organs, abdominal or pelvic vasculature, <b>pelvic</b> fracture with <b>ring</b> disruption or proximal traumatic lower limb amputation, together with a systolic blood pressure < 90  mm Hg. Patients with non-compressible haemorrhage in the mediastinum, axilla, face or neck were excluded. RESULTS: During 2012 - 2013, 72   677 adult trauma patients admitted to hospitals in England and Wales were identified. 397 patients had an indication(s) and no contraindications for REBOA with evidence of haemorrhagic shock: 69 % men, median age 43  years and median Injury Severity Score 32. Overall mortality was 32 %. Major trauma centres (MTCs) received the highest concentration of potential REBOA patients, and would be anticipated to receive a patient in whom REBOA may be utilised every 95  days, increasing to every 46  days in the 10 MTCs with the highest attendance of this injury type. CONCLUSIONS: This TARN database analysis has identified a small group of severely injured, resource intensive patients with a highly lethal injury that is theoretically amenable to REBOA. The highest density of these patients is seen at MTCs, and as such a planned evaluation of REBOA should be further considered in these hospitals...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Noncompressible torso {{hemorrhage}} (NCTH) is {{the leading}} cause of potentially survivable trauma in the battlefield and has re-cently been defined using anatomic and physiologic criteria. The objective of this study was to characterize the frequency and mortality in combat of NCTH using a contemporary definition. METHODS: Four categories of torso injury, each based on vascular disruption, were identified in US military casualties from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry (2002 Y 2010) : (1) thoracic, including lung; (2) solid organ (high-grade spleen, liver, and kidney); (3) named axial vessel; and (4) <b>pelvic</b> fracture with <b>ring</b> disruption. Injuries within these categories were evaluated in the context of physiologic indicator of shock and/or the need for operative hemorrhage control. RESULTS: Of 15, 209 battle injuries sustained during the study period, 12. 7 % (n = 1, 936) had sustained one or more categories of torso injury. Of these, 331 (17. 1 %) had evidence of shock or the need for urgent hemorrhage control, with a mean (SD) Injury Severity Score (ISS) and mortality rate of 30 (13) and 18. 7 %, respectively. Pulmonary injuries were most numerous (41. 7 %), followed by solid-organ (29. 3 %), vascular (25. 7 %), and pelvic (15. 1 %) injuries. Following multivariate analysis, the most mortal in-jury complexes were identified as major arterial injury (odds ratio, 3. 38; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 17 Y 9. 74) and pulmonary injury (odds ratio, 2. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 23 Y 4. 98). CONCLUSION: NCTH can be defined using anatomic parameters combined with physiologic and operative interventions suggestive of hemor-rhage. Major arterial and pulmonary injuries contribute most significantly to the mortality burden. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage {{following}} traumatic {{injury is}} {{a leading cause of}} military and civilian mortality. Noncompressible torso hem-orrhage (NCTH) has been identified as particularly lethal, especially in the prehospital setting. METHODS: All patients sustaining NCTH between August 2002 and July 2012 were identified from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. NCTH was defined as injury to a named torso axial vessel, pulmonary injury, solid-organ injury (Grade 4 or greater injury to the liver, kidney, or spleen) or <b>pelvic</b> fracture with <b>ring</b> disruption. Patients with ongoing hemorrhage were identified using either a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or the need for immediate surgical hemorrhage control. Data on injury pattern and location as well as cause of death were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: During 10 years, 296 patients were identified with NCTH, with a mortality of 85. 5 %. The majority of deaths occurred before hospital admission (n = 222, 75. 0 %). Of patients admitted to hospital, survivors (n = 43, 14. 5 %) had a higher median systolic blood pressure (108 [43] vs. 89 [46], p = 0. 123) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (14 [12] vs. 3 [0], p G 0. 001) compared with in-hospital deaths (n = 31, 10. 5 %). Hemorrhage was the more common cause of death (60. 1 %), followed by central nervous system disruption (30. 8 %), total body disruption (5. 1 %), and multiple-organ failure (4. 0 %). On multivariate analysis, major arterial and pulmonary hilar injury are most lethal with odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) of 16. 44 (5. 50 Y 49. 11) and 9. 61 (1. 06 Y 87. 00), respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND Fractures of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> {{including}} {{disruption of}} the posterior elements in high-energy trauma have both high morbidity and mortality rates. For some injury pattern part of the initial resuscitation includes either external fixation or plate fixation to close the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> and decrease blood loss. In certain situations [...] especially when associated with abdominal trauma {{and the need to}} perform laparotomies [...] both techniques may put the patient at risk of either pintract or deep plate infections. We describe an operative approach to percutaneously close and stabilize the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> using spinal implants as an internal fixator and report the results in a small series of patients treated with this technique during the resuscitation phase. FINDINGS Four patients were treated by subcutaneous placement of an internal fixator. Screw fixation was carried out by minimally invasive placement of two supra-acetabular iliac screws. Afterwards, a subcutaneous transfixation rod was inserted and attached to the screws after reduction of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring.</b> All patients were allowed to fully weight-bear. No losses of reduction or deep infections occurred. Fracture healing was uneventful in all cases. CONCLUSION Minimally invasive fixation is an alternative technique to stabilize the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring.</b> The clinical results illustrate that this technique is able to achieve good results in terms of maintenance of reduction the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring.</b> Also, abdominal surgeries no longer put the patient at risk of infected pins or plates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{number and}} variety of {{osteoporotic}} frac-tures of the pelvis are rapidly growing around the world. Such fractures {{are the result of}} low-impact trauma. The patients have no signs of hemodynamic instability and do not require urgent stabilization. The clinical picture is dominated by immobilizing pain in the pelvic region. Fractures may be located in both the ventral and the dorsal <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring.</b> The current well-established classification of <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> lesions in younger adults does not fully reflect the criteria for osteoporotic and insufficiency fractures of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring.</b> Most osteoporotic fractures are minimally displaced and do not require surgical therapy. However, in some patients, an insidious progress of bone damage leads to complex displacement and instability. Therefore, verti-cal sacral ala fractures, fracture dislocations of the sacro-iliac joint, and spinopelvic dissociations are best treated with operative stabilization. Angular stable bridge plating, the insertion of a transsacral positioning bar, and iliolumbar fixation are operative techniques that have been adapted to the low bone mineral density of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> and the high forces acting on it...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{incidence}} of pelvic fractures is relatively low {{compared with other}} fracture locations. The low incidence is in great contrast to the high morbidity and mortality. Particularly in the elderly, with apparently isolated fractures of the pubic rami, these observations {{are believed to be}} due to additional occult lesions of the posterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring.</b> In these cases diagnosis cannot be established by conventional imaging alone and SPECT/CT is considered as a diagnostic adjunct. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess concomitant bony or soft tissue lesions within the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> in a population of patients with fractures of the anterior elements. MATERIALS AND METHODS In all patients with no obvious lesions of the posterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> on X-rays and CT or with suspicious but inconclusive findings on CT an additional SPECT/CT was carried out in a non-acute setting within 3 days of the trauma. RESULTS In all cases additional lesions within the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> were found. Most lesions were vertical sacral fractures, followed by transverse fractures, one non-dislocated fracture of the acetabulum on the side of the pubic rami fracture, and one post-traumatic dilatation of the sacroiliac joint with increased tracer uptake. CONCLUSION According to our results after SPECT/CT all patients with pubic rami fracture suffered additional lesions, none detectable previously by X-ray or CT, within the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring.</b> In this context SPECT/CT has proved to be very helpful in the clinical routine to visualize occult fractures and instability within the sacroiliac joint...|$|E
30|$|Iliosacral screw {{fixation}} {{has become a}} common method for surgical stabilization of acute disruptions of the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> [1 – 4]. Iliosacral screw placement can be accomplished percutaneously in conjunction with closed reduction or after open reduction; providing stability, minimizing deformity, facilitating mobilization and improving outcomes in patients with posterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> injuries [2, 3, 5]. However, loss of fixation, loss of function, neurovascular injury and malunion have all been reported as serious complications following unstable posterior <b>pelvic</b> <b>ring</b> injuries treated using this method [1, 4 – 8]. Placement of iliosacral screws into the S 1 body is the preferred method of fixation, but size limitations and sacral dysmorphism may preclude S 1 fixation [4, 9]. In these clinical situations, fixation into the second sacral body (S 2) has been recommended [3, 10, 11].|$|E
