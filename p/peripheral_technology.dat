40|$|This thesis will {{investigate}} whether the rapid rate {{of technological change}} {{over the last two}} hundred years had increased or decreased the burden of the soldier. It will concentrate principally on the application of <b>peripheral</b> <b>technology</b> whose primary purpose is not that of killing. It will examine the first and second order effects of such technology, many of which will be proven to be counter-intuitive. This thesis is principally concerned with how the soldiers themselves viewed the application of this technology. It will therefore draw upon hundreds of narrative accounts of warfare written by combatants from many nations and a range of conflicts to establish what the soldiers themselves believed were the principal burdens they must bear on behalf of their nations. This thesis will determine that where technological advances have impacted upon the burden of the soldier, in a number of cases they have decreased one burden only to increase another. For example, recent advances in aeromedical capabilities and sophisticated treatment techniques mean that soldiers are now more likely to survive horrific injuries that even a generation earlier would most likely have been fatal. But those who survive often face a life of permanent disfigurement and disability, the possibility of which troubles many soldiers. In some aspects, a more definitive answer will be given as to whether technological advances have increased or decreased the burden of the soldier. The contemporary soldier knows that his body will likely be recovered from the battlefield and if recovered will almost certainly be identified, thereby avoiding the abiding concern of his predecessors that his body might be left on the battlefield, buried in an unmarked grave. However, in other aspects, technological advances have clearly increased the burden of the soldier. For example, the growth of the modern media, fuelled by satellite communications and the Internet, can potentially reveal operational information and increase the risk of mission failure. A ubiquitous media presence also poses a very real risk that a soldier's actions on the battlefield will be taken out of context and held up to be judged {{in the court of public}} opinion...|$|E
30|$|In {{discussing}} {{the development and}} diffusion of robotic technology to an aging society, the terms “human-friendly”, “eco-friendly” and “smart” are important. In particular, the term “smart” was translated from the original Japanese word “Kibi” (literally, “subtlety”) [7], though {{it is difficult to}} capture its nuance in English. The term conveys the sense of a nonliteral meaning that is subtle and has its origins in human emotions. Thus, the intended distinction is that “smart” refers not to “artificial intelligence” but rather to advanced capabilities as well as adaptability and applicability in tasks involving humans. This use of “smart” for robotic technology is new, and it could be misleading because the word can be interpreted differently. Therefore, we must promote the definition of “smart” as encompassing an intuitive interpretation. We also found that the spread of strategic terms is required. The survey for gauging social understanding of service robots and their <b>peripheral</b> <b>technologies</b> was crucial for the project.|$|R

40|$|A {{disconnection}} {{exists between}} {{our understanding of}} osteoporosis diagnosis/treatment and our ability to provide optimal bone healthcare in an organized fashion. This disconnection results, in part, from problems in inertia (moving forward with the attitude that osteoporosis is a disease worthy of management), direction (focusing on {{the ultimate goal of}} osteoporosis diagnosis and management, i. e. reduction in fracture), and flow (making it easy to do the right thing, i. e. taking the best available science, mixing it with expert opinion, and developing a program that allows all of the participants [physicians, allied healthcare providers, patients, insurers] to play a role). The Geisinger Osteoporosis Program, developed by the Geisinger Clinic of the Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania, USA, combines elements of healthcare provider education, patient empowerment, and access to bone density testing and outcomes assessment to achieve the outcomes of fracture reduction in a cost-effective fashion. The healthcare provider education component includes guidelines that are data driven yet easy to navigate in an electronic milieu, combined with numerous educational opportunities. The patient empowerment component includes a The bone density testing component combines <b>peripheral</b> <b>technology</b> (heel ultrasound) with central gold-standard technology (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA] of the hip and spine) to provide access to technology for rural patients. A mobile DXA unit provides central DXA scanning at the convenience of the primary care physician Outcome measures from this program show increases in osteoporosis diagnosis, bone density testing, and prescription medication usage. A significant decrease in hip fracture was demonstrated, along with a reduction in costs based on a cost predictive model over a 5 -year period. The Geisinger program has attempted to overcome some of the problems surrounding inertia, direction and flow in the management of osteoporosis by providing the following: clinical care pathways/guidelines that are simple, specific to patients and focus on care; consistent and integrative reports of bone density; getting primary care physicians engaged in the program; and making bone density testing as well as resources and expertise readily available.

40|$|International audiencePressure-driven {{membrane}} processes have strongly gained {{importance in}} industrial separations {{over the past}} three decades. Numerous improvements in the technology – for instance, development of highly selective and permeable membranes, improvement in <b>peripheral</b> <b>technology</b> – have led to widespread adaptation of this process in chemical, environmental, pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Membrane fouling and subsequent permeate flux decline are inevitably associated with the pressure-driven membrane processes. Despite the various studies on membrane fouling and related phenomena, the fundamental mechanisms and processes involved are still not fully understood. Typical observations of permeate flux over time reveal a rapid initial decline followed by a more gradual long-term decline. This indicates the increase of the membrane resistance with time. The resistance of membrane is modeled via different mechanisms (pore blockage, concentration polarization, and cake formation). These models depend on the experimental parameters and do not describe the fouling process completely. It {{should be noted that the}} characteristics of the system change with time because of the evolution of molecules (such as proteins) or their interactions with environment (a porous medium and a fluid). Furthermore the problem is multiphysics (hydrodynamics, mass transport, physical chemistry) and multiscale (molecule, membrane pores and membrane). The fouling of membrane during the filtration of complex media containing microorganisms is frequent (wastewater, cleaning solutions, microorganisms cultures etc). Microorganisms can attach, grow, multiply, and relocate on the membrane surfaces they can excrete extracellular polymer substances (EPS). EPS are primarily composed of polysaccharides and proteins. The fouling can be located on the surface and in the volume of the membrane. The fouling of membranes by proteins is also present in many post treatment of food products (extraction of proteins from milk, concentration of cooking juice for example). The objective of this work was to focus on the fouling of ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes by proteins. In contrast of small molecules that behave like rigid molecules, most proteins do not simply attach or detach from an interface with certain adsorption and desorption probabilities. Instead, the complex composition and structure of proteins causes more complex phenomena such as structural re-arrangements, changing surface affinities during adsorption, positive cooperative effects, overshooting adsorption kinetic or surface aggregation. Firstly we were interested in better understanding the interactions between the membranes and proteins and the mechanisms of fouling. Secondly the modeling of the membrane process was developed in order to describe and predict the performance of the filtration system. The proposed model could then be validated by new filtration experiments. BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) solutions in Milli-Q water was used as a model of proteins in the project. The commercial PES UF/MF membranes were used. The membrane nominal cut-offs obtained from manufacturer were 0. 1 and 0. 01 µm. Ultrafiltration experiments performed on a plate module (Ray flow X 100, Orelis-Novasep) allowing the use of 100 cm² flat membrane. Fouling with 2 L of the BSa solution was performed over night at ambient temperature at constant TMP of 1. 5 bar. Adsorption isotherms in batch mode were carried out to characterize the interactions. The mechanisms (pore blocking, cake formation, concentration polarization) occurring in the fouling membranes were identified with filtration experiments. The membrane properties (permeability, porosity, pore diameter, thickness of the different parts of the membrane) were analyzed by means of experiments (filtration, SEM, AFM etc). The method of volume averaging is used for the modeling approach. It is one of the techniques for modeling of the porous media. It provides a rigorous foundation for the analysis of a porous system. The development is based on classical continuum physics, and it provides both the spatially smoothed equations and a method to predict the effective transport coefficients that appear in those equations. In this project, local equations in the porous medium (membrane) were identified and described at the local scale thanks to experimental results of measurements of interactions and identification of mechanisms. The model of membrane fouling is based on diffusion of species and adsorption at the fluid-solid interface. The method of volume averaging was then applied for upscaling the local equations and obtaining the macroscopic equations with effective coefficients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 				Considerable {{technical}} developments {{over the}} past half century have enabled widespread application of electronic tags to the study of animals in the wild, including in freshwater environments. We review the constraints associated with freshwater telemetry and biologging and the technical developments relevant to their use. Technical constraints for tracking animals are often influenced by the characteristics of the animals being studied and the environment they inhabit. Collectively, they influence which and how technologies can be used and their relative effectiveness. Although radio telemetry has historically been the most commonly used technology in freshwater, passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology, acoustic telemetry and biologgers are becoming more popular. Most telemetry studies have focused on fish, although an increasing number have focused on other taxa, such as turtles, crustaceans and molluscs. Key technical developments for freshwater systems include: miniaturization of tags for tracking small-size life stages and species, fixed stations and coded tags for tracking large samples of animals over long distances and large temporal scales, inexpensive PIT systems that enable mass tagging to yield population- and community-level relevant sample sizes, incorporation of sensors into electronic tags, validation of tag attachment procedures with a focus on maintaining animal welfare, incorporation of different techniques (for example, genetics, stable isotopes) and <b>peripheral</b> <b>technologies</b> (for example, geographic information systems, hydroacoustics), development of novel analytical techniques, and extensive international collaboration. Innovations are still needed in tag miniaturization, data analysis and visualization, and in tracking animals over larger spatial scales (for example, pelagic areas of lakes) and in challenging environments (for example, large dynamic floodplain systems, under ice). There seems to be a particular need for adapting various global positioning system and satellite tagging approaches to freshwater. Electronic tagging provides a mechanism to collect detailed information from imperilled animals and species that have no direct economic value. Current and future advances will continue to improve our knowledge of the natural history of aquatic animals and ecological processes in freshwater ecosystems while facilitating evidence-based resource management and conservation...|$|R
