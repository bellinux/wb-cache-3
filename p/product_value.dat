Put differently, an increasing share of total generic profit income consists of net interest, net taxes, net capital gains, fees & royalties, and rents. This can happen {{because a lot of}} non-productive assets have been accumulated that are available for trade; second-hand physical assets, financial assets and properties are being traded; all sorts of things are traded internationally, taking advantage of currency and cost differentials; assets are being held via all kinds of special financial constructions to extract profit, etc. And, an increasing amount of interest payments, rents and capital gains have been excluded from operating surplus because, by statistical definition, they are not classified as production expenditure at all (i.e. they are not counted as value-added). Post-Keynesian researchers such as Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie therefore tried to devise more adequate measures of the real financial profitability of companies. If a lot of capital is borrowed at a cost which is lower than the income obtained from reinvesting it in assets that appreciate in value, then a lot of profit income is earnt which has nothing directly to do with creating new <b>product</b> <b>value,</b> and therefore is not counted as value-added. Instead, existing wealth is transferred from one set of owners to another.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Swedish {{furniture}} {{companies have}} been quite successful {{in many parts of}} the world recently, with IKEA being a famous example of that. Meanwhile, Vietnam has one of the fastest-growing economies in South East Asia. However, there has not been any Swedish furniture company established on the Vietnamese market so far. Therefore, it would be useful to see if the Vietnamese furniture consumers would appreciate Swedish furniture, in order to analyze whether Swedish furniture companies could have success in Vietnam as well. Purpose: To study (1) How Vietnamese furniture consumers perceive the typical <b>product</b> <b>values</b> of Swedish furniture and (2) Analyze the potential for establishing Swedish furniture companies on the Vietnamese market. Methodology: Interviews, survey and secondary data. Findings and Analysis: The findings show that Vietnamese furniture consumers would generally appreciate Swedish furniture <b>product</b> <b>values.</b> Although the consumers do not recognize Sweden or Scandinavia as a furniture country or region, their preferences shown in furniture characteristics imply a increasingly positive attitude towards typical Swedish furniture <b>product</b> <b>values.</b> Conclusion and Recommendations: Due to the appreciation of Swedish typical <b>product</b> <b>values,</b> the potential for establishing Swedish furniture companies could be regarded as considerable in terms of <b>product</b> <b>values.</b> It is thus recommended that Swedish furniture companies carry on with creating typical Swedish <b>product</b> <b>values</b> when they enter the Vietnamese market.

2500|$|Beginning in the 1890s, {{farmers in}} Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy {{production}} {{in order to}} make more sustainable and profitable use of their land. Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by Stephen Babcock at the University of Wisconsin, helped the state build a reputation as [...] "America's Dairyland." [...] Meanwhile, conservationists including Aldo Leopold helped reestablish the state's forests during the early 20th century, paving the way for a more renewable lumber and paper milling industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands. Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe.
