The charge differences may impact both PK and PD. To investigate whether mAb charge variants possess different PK and PD properties, Khawli et al. isolated basic, neutral, and acidic variants from a mAb product and characterized them in PK and PD assays. Their {{results showed that}} all variants had similar potency in PD assays and rat FcRn binding relative to the starting material. Following iv or sc administration in rats, no difference in serum PK was observed, indicating that pI differences among charge variants were not sufficient to result in PK changes. However, {{it is worth noting}} that the pI difference between the acidic variant and the basic variants were less than 0.5 (8.7 vs. 9.1) (Khawli et al., 2010). Based on the above evidence, it can be concluded that shifts in isoelectric point of approximately one <b>pI</b> <b>unit</b> or more are likely to produce measurable changes in PK and tissue distribution; differences of less than one <b>pI</b> <b>unit</b> are mostly inconsequential to PK.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an electrical}} drives control architecture combining a fractional-order controller and a setpoint pre-filter. The former {{is based on}} a fractional-order proportional-integral <b>PI</b> <b>unit,</b> with a non-integer order integral action, while the latter can be of integer or non-integer type. To satisfy robustness and dynamic performance specifications, the feedback controller is designed by a loop-shaping technique in the frequency domain. In particular, optimality of the feedback system is pursued to achieve input-output tracking. The setpoint pre-filter is designed by a dynamic inversion technique minimizing the difference between the ideal synthesized command signal i. e., a smooth monotonic response and the prefilter step response. Experimental tests validate the methodology and compare the performance of the proposed architecture with well-established control schemes that employ the classical PIbased symmetrical optimum method with a smoothing pre-filter...|$|E

40|$|Current {{algorithms}} for {{the calculation}} of peptide or protein pI, {{based solely on the}} charge associated with individual amino acids, can calculate pI values to within ± 0. 2 <b>pI</b> <b>units.</b> Here we present a new pI calculation algorithm that takes into account the effect of adjacent amino acids on the pI value. The algorithm takes into account the effect of adjacent amino acids ± 3 residues away from a charged aspartic or glutamic acid, as well as effects on the C-terminus, and applies a correction factor to the pK values of the charged amino acids. Large pK shifts are observed for the short-range interactions of aspartic and glutamic acid with the N-terminus and with internal histidine, lysine, or arginine residues. Conversely, interactions of aspartic and glutamic acid with hydrophobic, slightly polar, or other aspartic and glutamic acid residues are negligible. This results in a much narrower distribution of peptides across individual IPG-IEF fractions. The correction factors are derived from a 5000 -peptide training set using a genetic optimization approach. The unique advantage of the genetic algorithms is that the pK optimization problem is independent of the evaluation function employed. This in turn allows the optimization function to determine the next set of solutions that can then be re-evaluated. This cycle continues until a set convergence criterion is reached. The accuracy of the new pI values obtained with this method approaches the error associated with the manufacture of the IPG strip (± 0. 05 <b>pI</b> <b>units).</b> The approach is demonstrated for cytosolic cell extracts derived from the breast cancer cell line DU 4475, and from membrane preparations from human lung tissue samples...|$|R

First a typical switched-capacitor (SC) architecture will be examined, followed by a lower power yet area inefficient version, finally arriving at a passive struc-ture with the lowest power dissipation. Next, design issues {{that must be addressed}} for cor-rect operation by a passive correlator will be covered. At the end of the chapter non-ideal issues that accompany SC designs will be considered. 4. 1 Minimum Power Architecture Active chip-rate correlator Before looking at SC correlators, a choice between a matched filter or sliding corre-lator architecture (see Fig. 4 - 1) needs to be made. Because of its much lower power con-sumption, 1 the sliding correlator is preferred despite its slower acquisition performance. 2 1. The matched filter is roughly N- 1 times higher power since it require N- 1 times more stages (opamps). 2.

40|$|Methods are {{described}} {{for the removal}} of the sporophytic pollen grain coating of Brassica oleracea and for the isolation of coat polypeptides. The coat contains a small number of proteins ranging from 6 to 45 kDa. Many of the larger proteins are glycosylated, while all carry high positive charges resulting in pI values from 8. 5 to 11. Polypeptides with pI values of 9. 5, 9. 0, and 8. 5 possess strong esterase activity. No major differences could be detected in either pI values or molecular masses of pollen-coating polypeptides from grains carrying different sporophytically expressed S (self-incompatibility) alleles. Mixing pollen coat proteins with stigmatic extracts results in a conspicuous binding interaction involving female S-locus-specific and perhaps S-locus-related glycoproteins.

Several hundred unique protein molecular weights were observed in a pI range from 4. 8 to 8. 5 and a mass range from 5 to 85   14 kDa. Proteins were positively identified by analysis of the pI (± 0. 5 <b>pI</b> <b>units),</b> an intact protein molecular weight (± 150   14 ppm), and peptide mass mapping results. Using the molecular weight (MW) and peptide mapping results of identified proteins it was possible to characterize their posttranslational (PTMs) and/or sequence modifications. PTMs were detected on both forms of cytosolic actin, heat shock 90 Β, HINT and Α-enolase. Sequence modifications or conflicts were observed for Β-and Γ-actin, ATP Β-synthase and heat shock 90 Β. IEF-NPS-RP-HPLC/ESI-TOFMS was used to determine experimental pI, MW and relative hydrophobicity values for each protein detected. This data was used to generate a 2 -D pI-MS protein map, where proteins are displayed according to their pI and molecular weight. Protein molecular weight peaks are represented as bands in the 2 -D pI-MS image where the gray scale of each band is proportional to the intensity of the protein molecular weight peak.

Evaluation of the autovalidated results from the E. coli data showed that • 74 % of specific peptides were found in just one fraction and 90 % of the peptides were found {{in one or two}} fractions (Fig. I) • Furthermore, peptides showed a good distribution across the fractions in line with results of an in silicio tryptic digest of the whole E. coli proteome (Ref. 3 & Fig. II a) The sample fractionation steps taken prior to a mass detection step are critical for the identification of target proteins in complex proteomics samples. OFFGEL electrophoresis 1 is a recent advance in separation technology that fractionates proteins or peptides according to their isoelectric point (pI). It is based on the high resolving power of immobilized pH gradient gels. However, the fractionated sample is delivered in liquid phase. Since isoelectric points can be calculated for proteins and peptides, experimentally observed pI’s can be compared to predicted values. This comparison is a means of ascertaining internal consistency for each experiment 2.

40|$|Positioning {{of mobile}} users in indoor environments with Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) {{has become very}} popular whereby {{location}} fingerprinting and trilateration are the most commonly employed methods. In both the received signal strength (RSS) of the surrounding access points (APs) are scanned and used to estimate the user’s position. Within {{the scope of this}} study the advantageous qualities of both methods are identified and selected to benefit their combination. By a fusion of these technologies a higher performance for Wi-Fi positioning is achievable. For that purpose, a novel approach based on the well-known Differential GPS (DGPS) principle of operation is developed and applied. This approach for user localization and tracking is termed Differential Wi-Fi (DWi-Fi) by analogy with DGPS. From reference stations deployed in the area of interest differential measurement corrections are derived and applied at the mobile user side. Hence, range or coordinate corrections can be estimated from a network of reference station observations as it is done in common CORS GNSS networks. A low-cost realization with Raspberry <b>Pi</b> <b>units</b> is employed for these reference stations. These units serve {{at the same time as}} APs broadcasting Wi-Fi signals as well as reference stations scanning the receivable Wi-Fi signals of the surrounding APs. As the RSS measurements are carried out continuously at the reference stations dynamically changing maps of RSS distributions, so-called radio maps, are derived. Similar as in location fingerprinting this radio maps represent the RSS fingerprints at certain locations. From the areal modelling of the correction parameters in combination with the dynamically updated radio maps the location of the user can be estimated in real-time. The novel approach is presented and its performance demonstrated in this paper...|$|R

These consisted of five 48 kDa proteins (pI 5. 70, 5. 80, 5. 90, 6. 10 and 6. 25) and five 45 kDa proteins (pI 5. 90, 6. 05, 6. 25, 6. 30 and 6. 70), presumably corresponding to low- and high-molecular mass {{forms of the}} Gs-protein, as well as three 40 / 41 kDa proteins (pI 5. 50, 5. 70 and 6. 00) and two 39 kDa proteins (pI 5. 50 and 6. 00). All of these proteins except for the more acidic 39 kDa protein were ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin (CT). In addition, the three 40 / 41 kDa proteins and the more alkaline 39 kDa protein were also ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin (PT). CT- and PT-induced ADP-ribosylation changed the pI values of G-protein alpha-subunits by 0. 2 <b>pI</b> <b>units</b> to more acidic values. Preincubation of isolated pancreatic membranes with cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP), which stimulates phospholipase C in acinar cells, decreased CT-induced as well as PT-induced ADP-ribosylation of the three 40 / 41 kDa proteins, whereas CT-induced ADP-ribosylation of one 45 kDa (pI 5. 80) and all 48 kDa proteins was enhanced {{in the presence of}} CCK. Carbachol, another stimulant of phospholipase C, had no effect. The three 40 / 41 kDa proteins and one 48 kDa protein could be labelled with the GTP analogue [alpha- 32 P]GTP-gamma-azidoanilide. CCK, but not carbachol, stimulated incorporation of the GTP analogue into all of these four proteins. Using different anti-peptide antisera specific for alpha-subunits of G-proteins we identified the three 40 / 41 kDa Gi-proteins as Gi 1 (pI 6. 00), Gi 2 (pI 5. 50) and Gi 3 (pI 5. 70). The Gi 3 -protein was found to be the major Gi-protein of pancreatic plasma membranes. One of the 39 kDa proteins (pI 6. 0) was identified as Go. These results indicate that CCK receptors functionally interact with six Gs-proteins and with Gi 1, Gi 2 and Gi 3 -proteins. Since evidence suggests that a 40 / 41 kDa CT substrate is involved in the stimulation of phospholipase C in pancreatic acinar cells, it is likely that one, two or all three 40 / 41 kDa Gi-proteins are involved in the coupling of CCK receptors with phospholipase C...|$|R

The caged dynamics precede by decades of time the JG relaxation and, from general physical principles, are also expected to be a property of all glass-forming materials. Collectively, the caged dynamics and JG relaxation serve as precursors to structural relaxation (i. e., the glass transition) and thus are of central importance to understanding vitrification. The present data show that the dynamics of caged <b>PI</b> repeat <b>units</b> are manifested as a nearly constant loss (NCL). This NCL has been found in other glass-formers, both molecular and polymeric, and its temperature dependence in PI is similar to that for other materials. The experimental results are consistent with the predictions from the coupling model...|$|R
40|$|The title {{compound}} [H 2 NNHC(NH 2) 2] 2 [C 6 HO 2 (NO 2) 3] (2) {{was prepared}} in 85 % yield by treatment of sodium styphnate with 2 equivalents of aminoguanidinium nitrate, followed by crystallization from aqueous solution. Compound 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group <b>Pī</b> with <b>unit</b> cell dimensions a = 6. 7224 (3) Å, b = 10. 7473 (4) Å, c = 11. 9604 (5) Å, α = 113. 212 (4) °, β = 90. 579 (3) °, γ = 99. 815 (3) °, V = 779. 68 (6) Å 3, Z = 2. In the solid state structure of 2, no {{water of crystallization}} is present. Bond angles within the aromatic ring of the styphnate anion indicate a significant distortion with larger angles (122. 04 (18) – 125. 96 (18) Å) at the carbons bearing the nitro groups, and smaller ones (113. 30 (17) and 114. 07 (17) Å) at the C-O− carbon atoms. The crystal structure of 2 consists of layers formed by an extensive network of N-H [...] . O hydrogen bonds between NH 2 groups of the aminoguanidinium cation and the negatively charged oxygens of the styphnate anion. The layers are again interconnected by N-H [...] . N hydrogen bonds between neighboring aminoguanidinium cations...|$|R

40|$|Resource {{management}} is traditionally addressed by policies implemented inside the resource provider. Here we study {{the problem with}} an attitude that is specular but complementary, which consists in designing a distributed client-side access regulation algorithm that improves the utilization of an elastic resource. The introduction of elastic resources — {{a feature of the}} cloud computing paradigm — complicates their management since, when the workload applied on the resource varies (for instance with the number of users) the resource automatically follows such variations with its capacity. But the presence of an extra computational cost related with capacity variations motivates a non linear, lazy response, that penalizes dynamic environments. Hence the interest for an algorithm that shapes the production of service requests on the client side. To make our investigation more adherent to a practical environment, we introduce a real time requirement: each client must have access to the service at least every <b>pi</b> time <b>units.</b> Examples of this requirement, that features a bounded degree of asynchrony, are found, for instance, in network streaming applications: stream chunks must feed the input buffer at the destination. The algorithm we investigate is based on the random walk of a token. To eval-uate the range of applicability of the algorithm, we define an analytic model of its stochastic behavior — described by a non-Markov process — and then we compare its performance with a benchmark algorithm, representative of an effective solution that is often used in practice...|$|R
40|$|In this project, we are {{primarily}} concerned with efficient path planning in a grid like environment often seen in commercial games under typical system constraints. We will be extending Koenig's work on incremental heuristic search (Lifelong Planning A * or LPA*) to the more complicated pathing environment found in typical computer games. A typical path finding request in a game would begin something like this: 1) the user selects a unit in the grid world 2) the user selects the desired location of the unit 3) the computer calculates a path <b>Pi</b> from the <b>unit's</b> initial position to the desired position. But the problem does not end once the optimal path Pi is found, this is because most games exist in a dynamic environment. For example, a previously open door along Pi may close, or another unit may have moved and is now obstructing Pi or new information about the terrain may be learned (fog of war effect). Most games simply re-compute a new optima...|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} organic {{compounds}} from building products {{may influence the}} perceived air quality in the indoor environment. Consequently, building products are assessed for chemical emissions and for the acceptability of emitted odors. A procedure for odor evaluations in test chambers is described by the standard ISO 16000 - 28. A panel of eight or more trained subjects directly determines the perceived intensity Π (<b>unit</b> <b>pi)</b> of an air sample via diffusers. For the training of the panelists, a comparative Π-scale is applied. The panelists can use acetone/air mixtures in a concentration range between 20 mg/m 3 (0 pi) and 320 mg/m 3 (15 pi) as reference. However, the training and calibration procedure itself can substantially contribute to the method uncertainty. This concerns the assumed odor threshold of acetone, the variability of panelist responses, and the analytical determination of acetone concentrations in air with online methods {{as well as the}} influence of the diffuser geometry and the airflow profile...|$|R
