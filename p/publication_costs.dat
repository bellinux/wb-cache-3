500|$|The {{book was}} a {{complete}} financial and critical failure. Allen's publisher had forced him to pay the <b>publication</b> <b>costs</b> up front, and only 200 of the 1,500 volumes printed were sold. (The rest were eventually destroyed by a fire at the publisher's house.) The theologically conservative future president of Yale, Timothy Dwight, opined that [...] "the style was crude and vulgar, and the sentiments were coarser than the style. [...] The arguments were flimsy and unmeaning, and the conclusions were fastened upon the premises by mere force." [...] Allen took the financial loss and the criticism in stride, observing {{that most of the}} critics were clergymen, whose livelihood he was attacking.|$|E

In March 1976, an administrative committee decided {{that the purpose of the}} endowment would be to promote the study of Andrić's work, as well as art and literature in general. The Ivo Andrić Endowment has since organized a number of international conferences, made grants to foreign scholars studying the writer's works and offered financial aid to cover the <b>publication</b> <b>costs</b> of books covering Andrić's life and art. An annual yearbook, titled Sveske Zadužbine Ive Andrića (The Journals of the Ivo Andrić Endowment), is published by the organization. Andrić's will and testament stipulated that an award be given annually to the author of each subsequent year's best collection of short stories.|$|E

[...] A review of the book in The Green Bag concluded, [...] "Overall, Godwin seems to be preaching to the choir, rather than making legal arguments to win over converts. Lower <b>publication</b> <b>costs</b> do increase the possibility of publication, but, standing alone, may not justify replacing the legal regimes developed over time to regulate expression – legal regimes which, for the most part, have endured through previous revolutions in the technology of disseminating information. Theology, which calls on faith, and economics, which calls on reason and empiricism, may not be compatible. But the Internet is about {{a shift in the}} economics of expression, not a theological revolution in how the First Amendment affects society, and when the project is getting the legal prescriptions right, all of the implications must be taken seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|Until {{her death}} in 1939, Sadler's wife Lena was a regular forum participant. One member {{subsequently}} objected to Sadler's leadership, alleging that he became hungry for power after his wife's death. In the early 1950s, the Urantia Foundation was established to publish The Urantia Book. [...] Hubert Wilkins, a friend of Sadler who had {{a keen interest in}} the book, contributed the initial funding for <b>publication</b> <b>costs.</b> Rather than create an organized religion, the foundation's leadership opted for what they called [...] "slow growth"; early adherents sought to educate people about the book's teachings rather than found a church-like organization. Sadler also disavowed proselytizing and publicity, although he wrote several works about the content of The Urantia Book. In 1958, Sadler published a defense of the book, citing his experience exposing frauds and maintaining that the book was free of contradictions. Since his death, several reading groups, seminars, and churches have been established to study the book and to spread its message.|$|E
500|$|The Kingdom of This World {{is a work}} of {{historical}} fiction. While the setting and the majority of the characters are based on fact, many of the events that occur during the novel are Carpentier's rendition of the actual events that took place {{during the course of the}} Haitian revolution. In the Prologue to the novel, Carpentier defines the phenomenon of lo real maravilloso, which has been considered one of the starting points for the genre of magic realism. Carpentier and Miguel Ángel Asturias are considered [...] "pioneers of the contemporary Spanish-American novel" [...] because of their mythologizing of the Latin American experience. Their work in between the late 1940s and early 1960s led to the Latin American Boom, one of whose main features was the use of magic realism. This being one of the first books in the genre, Carpentier had no guarantee of finding an audience and even covered <b>publication</b> <b>costs</b> himself.|$|E
500|$|On Saturday, 9 July 1720, London v Kent at White Conduit Fields was won by London. In this match, two London fielders {{were badly}} injured by {{a clash of}} heads. H. T. Waghorn noted a lull in the {{advertising}} and reporting of cricket after this game {{and he wondered if}} that was due to a perception that the sport was dangerous. If there was a lapse in cricket at this time, the more likely causes would be either: (a) the South Sea Bubble which ruined many investors and so could have reduced cricket patronage; or (b), as Waghorn himself mentions, [...] "the (news)papers were small, and space limited, the advertising and reporting (of) matches ceased". The South Sea Bubble may have had an economic impact on investment and gambling as, when the South Sea Company was found to be insolvent, its crash in 1720 caused massive repercussions throughout the economy and many formerly prosperous investors were ruined. This could have included cricket patrons, while a potential impact on reporting was the application of stamp duty to newspapers as this increased their <b>publication</b> <b>costs</b> and probably caused publishers to reduce paper size with less room for sports coverage.|$|E

[...] For the next four years, Thurman's pay was attached in order to pay the debt. [...] Hurston solicited subscriptions on a folklore-collecting trip to the South in 1927, in order to help, and both she and Hughes submitted essays to World Tomorrow, which had loaned money to FIRE!, to repay that loan.|$|E
