25|$|Other major {{problems}} concern {{the labor force}} and the pricing system. There is large-scale underemployment in both urban and rural areas, {{and the fear of}} the disruptive effects of major, explicit unemployment is strong. The prices of certain key commodities, especially of industrial raw materials and major industrial products, are determined by the state. In most cases, basic price ratios were set in the 1950s and are often irrational in terms of current production capabilities and demands. Over the years, large subsidies were built into the <b>price</b> <b>structure</b> and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1990s, these subsidies began to be eliminated, in large part due to China's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which carried with it requirements for further economic liberalization and deregulation.|$|E

Consumers come in different types where each type requires a different service or treatment. We show that for a large class of <b>price</b> <b>structures</b> some group of customers is refused the service. Equilibria with selection are welfare inferior to equilibria without selection. We also characterize the class of <b>price</b> <b>structures</b> for which selection does not arise. As the number of customers increases or agents become more patient the class of selection-free <b>price</b> <b>structures</b> shrinks and in the limit it is unique. Moreover, all other <b>price</b> <b>structures</b> induce selection. The general model {{can be applied to}} a variety of markets, including health care and taxi markets. ...|$|R

2500|$|Before the Ecopass {{came into}} force there were around 98 {{thousand}} vehicles entering the restricted zone every day, but now {{traffic in the}} ZTL is approaching 87,000 daily vehicles (91,7 thousand in November 2008) and it seems traffic jams are slowly {{coming back to the}} pre-Ecopass levels. In the same regard, another criticism is the slow erosion of the system benefits, as the Ecopass <b>price</b> <b>structure</b> has been an incentive for car owners to buy new vehicles, and now more than 7,000 vehicles per day have free access. Despite the fact that these vehicles having less polluting engines, the free access helps less with the congestion problem. [...] This trend is contributing to a return to previous traffic levels {{and at the same time}} reducing revenue collected. [...] This threatens the ability to keep the system in operation. Also it was criticized the decision to maintain the exemption for Euro IV diesel vehicles when authorities decided to extend the Ecopass until December 2009, because this decision is also contributing to the fading of the initial benefits.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by a {{real world}} supply chain {{planning}} problem, this paper examines {{the impacts of}} exchange rate volatility and different shipping <b>pricing</b> <b>structures</b> on the overall performance for a multinational enterprise (MNEs). A unified optimisation model is developed that minimises the major costs incurred in an MNE, incorporating important factors such as manufacturing localisation, exchange rates, and quantity-based shipping <b>pricing</b> <b>structures</b> offered by transport vendors. Numerical results from the model implementation show that (a) shipping <b>pricing</b> <b>structures</b> can have pronounced impacts on manufacturing/assembly and distribution decisions both in the parent and host countries, (b) different shipping <b>pricing</b> <b>structures</b> might not be equally profitable as the cost benefits may only offset the losses from a discriminatory tariff or substantial storage expenses, and (c) increased manufacturing in the host country can be decelerated {{to a large extent}} by the localisation policy in the parent country and tight transport and storage limitations.

50|$|Violent {{changes in}} the volume of money affect not only the general price level, but also the {{relationship}} of prices to each other within the <b>price</b> <b>structure.</b> Conversely, a constant volume of money tends ultimately to stabilize not only the general price level, but the relations within the <b>price</b> <b>structure.</b> The retail prices involved in the cost-of-living index, being relatively “sticky”, do not afford all the information necessary for regulating the volume of money. The Monetary Authority might therefore find it desirable to include in its standard some commodities having “sensitive” prices, {{in order to make}} its actions respond more quickly to the direction in which things are moving.|$|E

50|$|In 1987 the <b>price</b> <b>structure</b> in China was chaotic. Some {{prices were}} {{determined}} {{in the market}} through the forces of supply and demand, others were set by government agencies, and still others were produced by procedures that were not clearly defined. In many cases, {{there was more than}} one price for the same commodity, depending on how it was exchanged, the kind of unit that produced it, or who the buyer was. While the government was not pleased with this situation, it was committed to continued price reform. It was reluctant, however, to release the remaining fixed prices because of potential political and economic disruption. Sudden unpredictable price changes would leave consumers unable to continue buying some goods; some previously profitable enterprises under the old <b>price</b> <b>structure</b> would begin to take losses, and others would abruptly become very wealthy.|$|E
