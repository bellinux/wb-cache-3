5000|$|... ^Although not {{recognized}} {{on the official}} <b>pay</b> <b>sheet,</b> Griffin was fined $8,500, or 25% of his base pay for missing weight for the fight, and contracts were reworked with those amounts. That money was issued to Palaszewski, an NSAC official confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} months of its existence, the newly formed CID kept its {{activities}} low-key. Gathering intelligence, making contacts and performing bodyguard duties were the day-to-day duties of the members. One file shows the whole complement of Oriel House divided into three groups. Each group had Lieutenants, Sergeants and Corporals in charge. Possibly there were three shifts operating at the time. Fifty-two revolvers, (Colts, Webleys and Smith & Wessons) with 1000 rounds of [...]45 ammunition, six Lee-Enfield rifles with 200 rounds of [...]303 ammunition, and one Lewis Light Machine Gun with 14 pans of ammunition, were issued to the CID. At one stage there were over one hundred and twenty men on the CID <b>pay</b> <b>sheets,</b> so not everyone would have been armed all of the time.|$|R
30|$|The {{cloud storage}} {{preserves}} data {{as if it}} is stacked in a locker, where the cloud storage acts the role of an access control to this locker. In reality, the data are encrypted, but usually the cloud server has the decryption key which manages the rights for each user to access the data. This is a critical problem in the case of private sensitive data such as administrative documents (e.g., bills, <b>pay</b> <b>sheets</b> or identity cards,) or, more generally, personal data. This is quite tricky in the case of confidential documents possessed by a business enterprise, i.e., shared between the collaborators or with trading partners. In fact, this problem can be effortlessly solved by merely encrypting the data before sending it to the cloud/safe. Different architectures were proposed to resolve this problem which work over two policies Trust-evaluation and predicate encryption, explained as follows.|$|R
60|$|About eight o'clock, {{the third}} night, I {{was in the}} cabin, when the men on deck sung out that the chain had gone. At this time the ship had been {{pitching}} her spritsail-yard under water, and it blew a little hurricane. We were on deck in a moment, all hands <b>paying</b> out <b>sheet.</b> We brought the ship up with this cable, but not until she got it nearly to the better end. Unfortunately, we had got into shoal water, or what became shoal water by {{the depth of the}} troughs. It was said, afterwards, we were in five fathoms water at this time, but for this I will not vouch. It seems too much water for what happened. Our anchor, however, did actually lie in sixteen fathoms.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role and}} place of slaves and free black Southerners in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War 1861 - 1865. Much has been written {{on the use of}} slaves and free blacks as a conscript labour force for the Confederacy during the war, but there has been little serious examination of their role within the South's military infrastructure. I argue that black Southerners participated for varied reasons and situations throughout the war as an earlier version of twentieth century military support staff Their role in the regiments of the Confederacy provided them with the title of soldier. It was this role which was defined in Confederate legislative policy, supported through military regulations and verified in company muster and <b>pay</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the post war period these same sources of documentation were utilised by Southern legislators, white veterans, and eventually black 'army veterans,' within the former Confederate states, to establish, Confederate veterans pension benefit. Although there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that, depending upon the circumstance, some blacks Southerners actually fought for the Confederacy, overall these occurrences were rare. I argue that up until March 1865, instances of black Southerners in combat situations {{had more to do with}} the confusion and 'fog of battle,' then a concerted effort by the military high command to place blacks in the ranks as actual combatants. This idea is further supported in the stories written by white veterans, who, in publications like the Confederate Veteran, spoke of such "occurrences" with pride, while at the same time tempered them with concern for the safety of their property. Overall the research addresses the issues surrounding the role and place of black Southerners within the Confederate Army, and the reasoning behind their involvement in the war effort...|$|R
5000|$|Do {{you know}} that Grub Street is dead and gone last week? No more ghosts or murders now for love or money. I plied it pretty close the last {{fortnight}} and published at least seven penny papers of my own, besides some of other people's; but now every single half <b>sheet</b> <b>pays</b> a half penny to the queen. The Observator is fallen; the Medlays we jumbled together with the Flying Post, the Examiner is deadly sick; the Spectator keeps up and doubles its price; I know not {{how long it will}} hold. Have you seen the red stamp the papers are marked with? Methinks the stamping it is worth a half penny. Jonathan Swift (1712) ...|$|R
500|$|In November 1963, Redding, {{accompanied}} by his brother Rodgers and an associate, former boxer Sylvester Huckaby (a childhood friend of Redding's), traveled to New York to perform at the Apollo Theater for the recording of a live album for Atlantic Records. Redding and his band were paid $400 per week, but had to <b>pay</b> $450 for <b>sheet</b> music for the house band, led by King Curtis, which left them in financial difficulty. The trio asked Walden for money. Huckaby's description of their circumstances living in the [...] "big old raggedy" [...] Hotel Theresa is quoted by Peter Guralnick in his book Sweet Soul Music. He noted meeting Muhammad Ali and other celebrities. Ben E. King, who was the headliner at the Apollo when Redding performed there, gave him $100 when he learned about Redding's financial situation. The resulting album featured King, the Coasters, Doris Troy, Rufus Thomas, the Falcons and Redding. Around this time Walden and Rodgers were drafted by the army; Walden's younger brother Alan joined Redding on tour, while Earl [...] "Speedo" [...] Simms replaced Rodgers as Redding's road manager.|$|R
40|$|Poetry of Unknown Words is a {{collaborative}} project with Dr. Katharine Meynell. Taking Iliazd’s La Poésie de Mots Inconnus (1947) as a format and making new works re-examining issues of material processes and their shifting meanings. An {{interest in the}} artefact itself, rather than the signifying text/image alone, giving {{us an opportunity to}} understand historical context through material means. We reference Iliazd’s illustrated anthology of (mostly men’s) concrete and experimental typography and sound poetry in folio form. Our use of title, simply translated, contains a sense of an ‘unknown’ which plays on feminist concepts of ‘hidden from history’. Our folios transcribe works by women artists, writers and thinkers. These printed <b>sheets</b> <b>pay</b> attention to a particular individuals’ relationship to their contemporary technologies and consequent artistic applications. Poetry of Unknown Words explores an expanded notion of the book and the archive - socially, culturally and politically. This project is being developed in sections, initially exhibited in public venues appropriate to that section; for example, this ‘Literary’ section was exhibited at the Poetry Library, London, as part of the South Bank Centre season of ‘Women of the World’ in March 2012...|$|R
40|$|Overview Social {{impact bond}} {{projects}} {{are the latest}} new ‘buy-now, <b>pay</b> later’, off-balance <b>sheet</b> schemes to increase private finance of public services and the welfare state, driven by austerity policies and neoliberal ideology. They are a complex venture capitalist model applied to the provision of social services, health, education and other public services. Private investors provide working capital to social impact bond projects with the expectation of {{an annual rate of}} return or profit of 15 % - 30 % or more, dependent on the achievement of specified outcomes. Early intervention/development and prevention are only part of a strategy to tackle the root causes of poverty and inequality. However, social impact bonds and pay-for-success are designed to deliver selective social outcomes. The social impact bond project lobby embrace neoliberalism and a ‘government failure’ model to justify their approach, but they are in denial of market failure and the cause of the global financial crisis. The social impact bond project lobby is, however, happy to accept public money in the form of tax breaks, grants, subsidies and guarantees to extend corporate welfare. Nearly £ 520 m of UK public money has been given to social enterprises and social impact bond projects in recent years in the form of grants and financial support. International bodies have advanced the case for social impact bonds projects - the G 8 group of countries established a Social Impact Investment Taskforce, the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) and World Economic Forum (2013) extolling their virtues. Global banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Co. and Morgan Stanley, have {{played a key role in}} promoting and funding social impact bond projects in anticipation of attracting wider private investor interest and a new ‘asset class’. There are currently 54 operational social impact bond projects in 13 countries with at least a further 23 at the planning or procurement stage. The UK is the global leader with 32 operational projects with outcome payments valued at £ 91 m, followed by the US with 9 projects...|$|R
