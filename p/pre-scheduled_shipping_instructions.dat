In practice, however, disputes between the sides to a contract often arise. It is only a relatively small group of causes that contains an elenent of forco majeure in it, that is to say their occurrence does not depend on man's will to any extent whatsoever, while all the others result generally from negligence, recklessness, or human fallibility. This group of causes was submitted to a more detailed analysis. Thus, for example, at the stage of preparing and negotiating a contract it may happen that an incomplete offer has been submitted, the quality of goods has not been negotiated precisely, or an error has been made in the content of a contract or {{in the form of an}} arbitration clause contained in it.
