The company produces door panels, instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of door panels, defects such as <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> and scratches emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> and scratches and also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on door panels. Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> and scratches on door panels were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> and scratches. <b>Pressure</b> <b>marks</b> and scratches emerge at several places on the door panels during the production. To reduce the amount of <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> and scratches both short-term and long-term measures were suggested. Some of the measures are:  Use vacuum cleaners at some stations  Add padding on unpadded areas and edges  Make new instructions that emphasize to keep production stations clean and to avoid rough handling  Introduce workshops to engage operator...|$|R

40|$|Selections {{and actions}} in GUI’s are often {{separated}} – i. e. an action or command typically follows a selection. This sequence imposes a lower bound on the interaction {{time that is}} {{equal to or greater}} {{than the sum of its}} parts. In this paper, we introduce <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> – pen strokes where the variations in pressure make it possible to indicate both a selection and an action simultaneously. We propose a series of design guidelines from which we develop a set of four basic types of <b>pressure</b> <b>marks.</b> We first assess the viability of this set through an exploratory study that looks at the way users draw straight and lasso <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> of different sizes and orientations. We then present the results of a quantitative experiment that shows that users perform faster selection-action interactions with <b>pressure</b> <b>marks</b> than with a combination of lassos and pigtails.

40|$|Due to many advantages, {{swash plate}} pumps are wide spread in {{hydraulic}} systems. The main advantages are the through drive capability, the adjustability {{and most of}} all, the high power density. Their application range is limited, historically, to 450 bar including medium and higher volume sizes. In higher pressure range, constant pumps such as wobbling disks or radial piston pumps are normally used. This is because the higher stressed parts can be dimensioned much bigger. Pumps with lower power such as constant displacement gear pumps are generally used in low price applications. In order to enlarge the application range of swash plate pumps, their advantages have to be further improved and strengthened. This paper shows by example how {{the pressure of the}} basic series A 4 VSO was increased up to a nominal pressure of 630 bar and the historical <b>pressure</b> <b>mark</b> of 450 bar could be exceeded. This increase in pressure level enables for example steel treatment manufacturers to reduce their component sizes without the need of a pressure transducer. Furthermore the power density of the redesigned HA 4 VSO was increased by 36 %, compared to the standard A 4 VSO, by significantly increasing the self-priming speed. On {{the other side of the}} application range, in lower power mobile applications such as small tractors, forklift and skid steer loader, there is an increasing demand for less exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The energy saving potential by changing from a hydraulic system with constant hydraulic pumps to variable hydraulic pumps is already proven on high power applications. By developing the variable axial piston pump A 1 VO to the requirements of lower horse power application, it is now also possible to realize such savings in lower horse power applications. Furthermore efficiency of the pump itself can be improved. An example of this is shown by way of the new A 4 series 33...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAt the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, medical {{examinations}} {{have been conducted}} biennially since 1958 on a fixed population of approximately 20, 000 individuals. Blood pressure measurements and electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings are available for 6, 569 individuals who were monitored for at least 11 of the 13 2 year intervals between 1958 and 1984. Data from 601 individuals who had satisfied the Foundation's ECG diagnostic criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy (“Kagan-Yano code”) {{on at least one}} occasion were reviewed. Both the development and the regression of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy were ascertained in 61 subjects (17 men and 44 women). During the course of development of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension (including borderline cases) was noted in 83. 3 % of the subjects. The most common pattern of ECG left ventricular hypertrophy development was high voltage, followed by ST-T changes. In about half of these cases, the condition of hypertrophy regression was associated with lowering of blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>marked</b> by the disappearance of high voltage ECG readings...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} the occurrence {{and severity of}} <b>pressure</b> ulcers, indentation <b>marks</b> and pain from the extrication collar combined with headblocks. Furthermore, the influence of time, injury severity and patient characteristics {{on the development of}} <b>pressure</b> ulcers, indentation <b>marks</b> and pain was explored. Design: Observational Study Setting: Level one trauma center in the Netherlands Participants: Adult trauma patients admitted to the Emergency Department in an extrication collar combined with headblocks. Methods: Between January and December 2013, 342 patients were included. Study outcomes were incidence and severity of <b>pressure</b> ulcers, indentation <b>marks</b> and pain. The following dependent variables were collected: time in the cervical collar and headblocks, Glasgow Coma Scale, Mean Arterial Pressure, hemoglobin, Injury Severity Score, gender, age, and Body Mass Index. Results: 75. 4 % of the patients developed a category 1 and 2. 9 % a category 2 <b>pressure</b> ulcer. Indentation <b>marks</b> were observed in 221 (64. 6 %) patients; 96 (28. 1 %) had severe indentation <b>marks.</b> <b>Pressure</b> ulcers and indentation marks were observed most frequently at the back, shoulders and chest. 63. 2 % experienced pain, of which, 38. 5 % experienced severe pain. Pain was mainly located at the occiput. Female patients experienced significantly more pain (NRS > 3) compared to male patients (OR= 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 21 - 3. 80). None of the investigated variables significantly increased the probability of developing PUs or indentation marks. Conclusions: The high incidence of category 1 pressure ulcers and severe indentation marks indicate an increased risk for pressure ulcer development and may well lead to more severe PU lesions. Pain due to the application of the extrication collar and headblocks may lead to undesirable movement (in order to relieve the pressure) or to bias clinical examination of the cervical spine. It is necessary to revise the current practice of cervical spine immobilization. <br/...|$|R

In two separate samples of ethnically diverse college students comprised largely of East and Southeast Asian American, followed by Caucasians, Latinos, and other groups (total N = 839, age range 18 - 25 years), we examined the personality, parenting, and motivational correlates of AE.

40|$|Summary. — One of Pakistan’s rare {{examples}} of consistent export {{success has been}} the Sialkot stainless steel surgical instrument cluster. This cluster, consisting mainly of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), has as its main markets the United States and Western Europe. In recent years, access to these markets has become contingent on meeting international quality assurance standards. The hypothesis explored in this paper is that meeting such standards requires greater local cooperation, both among producers {{as well as between}} producers and their suppliers and subcontractors. The study draws on quantitative and qualitative data to examine how inter-firm ties, both vertical and horizontal, have changed. The evidence suggests that joint action has increased, but that there remain significant areas of collective failure. Thus, the quality assurance <b>pressures</b> <b>mark</b> a possible turning point for the cluster, raising questions as to whether local sources of competitiveness, captured in the collective eciency concept, can continue to provide the basis for export success. It also leads directly to an evaluation of the cluster’...|$|R
