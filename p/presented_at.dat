50|$|These {{additional}} {{copies of}} the mating type information do {{not interfere with the}} function of whatever allele is <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the MAT locus because they are not expressed, so a haploid cell with the MATa allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the active MAT locus is still an a cell, despite also having a (silenced) copy of the MATα allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> HML. Only the allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> the active MAT locus is transcribed, and thus only the allele <b>present</b> <b>at</b> MAT will influence cell behaviour. Hidden mating type loci are epigenetically silenced by SIR proteins, which form a heterochromatin scaffold that prevents transcription from the silent mating cassettes.|$|R
