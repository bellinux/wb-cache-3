25|$|The {{contemporary}} Shia scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei {{provides a}} counter argument to this belief.

Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Messenger of God was commanded to convey to the Muslim community.|$|E

From the 1810s until the 1840s, modern-day Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana, along with most of British Columbia, were <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> United States called the Oregon Country and Britain called the Columbia District. This region was jointly claimed by the United States and Great Britain after the Treaty of 1818, which {{established a}} co-dominion of {{interests in the region}} in lieu of a settlement. In 1840 American Charles Wilkes explored in the area. John McLoughlin, Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, headquartered at Fort Vancouver, was the de facto local political authority for most of this time.|$|E

500|$|Deke Slayton called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, {{and asked}} whether he would be {{interested}} in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> press dubbed [...] "the New Nine"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had been circulating since earlier that year that he would be selected as the [...] "first civilian astronaut." [...] Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for the second group; the other was Elliot See, also a former naval aviator. See was scheduled to command Gemini 9, but died in a T-38 crash in 1966 that also took the life of crewmate Charles Bassett. Armstrong was the first American civilian in space, but the first civilian was Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union, nearly three years earlier. A textile worker and amateur parachutist, she was aboard Vostok 6 when it launched on June 16, 1963.|$|E
500|$|The Court further {{stated that}} {{although}} congress allowed the resale and gifting {{of a gun}} by an individual, without requiring form or background checks, that is not proof that congress did not care about straw buyers. [...] "Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched.... And yes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress does) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are {{not a part of}} the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer’s sale." [...] The Court also rejected Abramski's claim that since Alvarez was able to buy the gun legally on his own the misrepresentation is not material, stating: [...] "Abramski’s false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on absentee purchases." [...] The court held that Abramski's case is analogous to a situation where a person that can buy a gun legally buys a gun under an alias. Such misrepresentation is material regardless of the fact that the buyer may purchase a gun legally, and the theory of [...] "no harm, no foul" [...] should not apply. Finally, the Court rejected Abramski's claim that the misrepresentation is not in violation of §924, because it is not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> dealer is statutorily required to maintain on his record. The Court held that §924 requires the dealer to maintain information [...] "required by this chapter", and that ATF Form 4473 is required by this chapter.|$|E

2500|$|Along {{his many}} other students, {{including}} Herman Dooyeweerd, Woltjer had a formidable influence on future professor of philosophy, D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, who used his training in Greek and Latin to make {{first of all}} a minutely detailed study of the Fragments of the Presocratics. Woltjers subscribed {{to the idea that}} Greek learning was an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> New Testament refers to when it speaks of [...] "the fulness of times." [...] The Greek learned constituted a preparatory education (paideia, cf Werner Jaeger) for the coming of Christ. To some extent, Woltjer's student Vollenhoven seems to have resisted this latter conception, as V came to view the major problem of developing a Christian philosophy to be the heavy tendency of all subsequent Christian thought in Western culture to fall back on a synthesis with Greek-originated presuppositions.|$|E

2500|$|Cohen {{departs from}} {{previous}} Marxists {{by arguing that}} capitalism is a system characterised by unjust exploitation not because the labour of workers is [...] "stolen" [...] by employers, {{but because it is}} a system wherein [...] "" [...] is infringed and which results in a distribution of benefits and burdens that is unfair. In the traditional Marxist account, exploitation and injustice occur because non-workers appropriate the value produced by the labour of workers. This would be overcome in a socialist society where no class would own the means of production and {{be in a position to}} appropriate the value produced by labourers. Cohen argues that underpinning this account is the assumption that workers have [...] "rights of self-ownership" [...] over themselves and thus, should [...] "own" [...] what is produced by their labour. Because the worker is paid a wage less than the value he or she creates through work, the capitalist is said to extract a surplus-value from the worker's labour, and thus to steal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> worker produces, the time of the worker and the worker's powers.|$|E
2500|$|Then Chichimeca {{and other}} nomadic groups entered the area. These nomadic {{indigenous}} groups are generically {{referred to as}} Chichimeca, but in reality they were a variety of ethnicities such as the Guachichiles, Pames and Zacatecos. These groups were warlike, semi nomadic and did not practice significant agriculture, nor did they construct cities. Part of the state was also inhabited by the Otomi but they were mostly displaced or dominated by the Purépecha in the southwest and the Chichimeca in other parts. By the 16th century, most of Mesoamerica was dominated by either the Aztec Empire or Purépecha Empire, but Guanajuato was {{under the control of}} neither. It was on the northern border of the Purépecha Empire with southern Guanajuato showing significant cultural influence in the southern valleys, and Aztecs had ventured into the area looking for minerals. However, most of the state was dominated by various Chichimeca tribes as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Spanish would call the [...] "Gran Chichimeca." [...] These Chichimeca were mostly nomadic with some scattered agricultural communities, mostly in the north.|$|E
2500|$|The 1945 general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} landslide victory for the Labour Party, giving it a large enough majority to allow {{the implementation of the}} party's manifesto commitments and to introduce a programme of far-reaching social reforms that were collectively dubbed the [...] "Welfare State" [...] (see [...] ). These reforms were achieved in the face of great financial difficulty following the war. The new Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Aneurin Bevan as Minister of Health, with a remit that also covered Housing. Thus, the responsibility for instituting a new and comprehensive National Health Service, as well as tackling the country's severe post-war housing shortage, fell to the youngest member of Attlee's Cabinet in his first ministerial position. The free National Health Service was paid for directly through public money. Government income was increased for the welfare state expenditure by a severe increase in marginal tax rates for wealthy business owners in particular, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Labour government largely saw as the redistribution of the wealth created by the working-class from the owners of large-scale industry to the workers.|$|E

One agreement was to publish CD-ROM-based catalogs for Redwall Retail Stores, and use the Pippin as an interactive kiosk that would be set up in stores running the CD-ROMs. Katz Media also attempted to push the KMP 2000 into Canada – a country where, in May 1997, only 20 percent of its citizens {{had access to the}} Internet. The idea was to use the country's existing cable network to bring in Internet access, and the KMP 2000 was {{to be used as a}}n Internet appliance that would be issued to subscribers. A hotel chain in Europe signed a deal with Katz Media to use the KMP 2000 in hotel rooms, so that guests could access the Internet. Katz Media then signed with a hospital in France, using the KMP 2000 as an online system so that, as a team, physicians could pull up and review case studies, and collaborate on diagnoses and treatments. On June 16, 1997, the Netface Consortium in the Netherlands selected the KMP 2000 as the device to be used as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> company called [...] "the world's first Internet shopping mall."
