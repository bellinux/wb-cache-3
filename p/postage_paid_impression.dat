50|$|The Jewish letter-carrier of Breslau, as he neither took any oath {{of office}} nor {{received}} any salary, was not really a government official. His whole income consisted merely of the <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> by the recipients of the letters. As, however, there were no fixed postal rates, the amount received was so small that the letter-carrier had to pursue in addition some other occupation. That the postal authorities tolerated {{this state of affairs}} is shown by the fact that when the letter-carrier was absent on other business, his wife was allowed to take his place.|$|R

5000|$|The stamp was {{originally}} for use {{only within the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as such was, in effect, a local stamp. For this reason {{the name of the}} country was not included within the design, a situation which continued by agreement with foreign post offices, provided the sovereign's effigy appeared on the stamp. Envelopes sold with <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> did not include this, so were marked with the country's name. In 1951, the special commemorative issue for the Festival of Britain included the name [...] "Britain" [...] incidentally. It could therefore be said that the name of the country then appeared {{for the first time on}} a stamp of the UK, although the word [...] "British" [...] had appeared on British Empire Exhibition commemorative stamps of 1924.|$|R

25|$|The MPS also {{supports}} mail delivery for U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas and to deployed personnel in combat zones worldwide. Most USPS extra services, such as Certified Mail, registered mail, delivery confirmation, insured mail, certificate of mailing, return receipt, restricted delivery and return receipt for merchandise {{are available to}} the MPS. Mail sent from one military post office (MPO) to another MPO can be sent for free as inner/intra-theater delivery service (IDS) {{as long as it}} does not transit the United States. Military postage rates are equivalent to U.S. domestic postage rates because the Services pay the second destination transportation (SDT) costs to, from, and between MPOs. The <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> on mail to/from MPOs only covers the cost of transporting the mail within the U.S. All military mail between the U.S. and overseas locations is subject to customs inspection in the country of destination, and customs declarations must normally be attached to packages and larger mail pieces.|$|R
40|$|Balancing {{the needs}} of {{information}} distributors and their audiences has grown harder {{in the age of}} the Internet. While the demand for attention continues to increase rapidly with the volume of information and communication, the supply of human attention is relatively fixed. Markets are a social institution for efficiently balancing supply and demand of scarce resources. Charging a price for sending messages may help discipline senders from demanding more attention than they are willing to pay for. Price may also help recipients estimate the value of a message before reading it. We report the results of two laboratory experiments to explore the consequences of a pricing system for electronic mail. Charging postage for email causes senders to be more selective and send fewer messages. However, recipients did not use the <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> by senders as a signal of importance. These studies suggest markets for attention have potential, but their design needs more work.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine rela-tionships between health-related stigma, mood (anxiety and depression) and daytime func-tioning in young adults with narcolepsy compared to those without narcolepsy. Young adults (age 18 – 35) with narcolepsy (N = 122) and without narcolepsy (N = 93) were mailed a packet that included questionnaires and a self-addressed <b>postage</b> <b>paid</b> envelope.
