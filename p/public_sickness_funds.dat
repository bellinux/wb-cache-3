40|$|AbstractThe article {{describes}} a recent Swiss popular initiative, aiming {{to replace the}} current system of statutory health insurance run by 61 competing private insurers with a new system run by a single public insurer. Despite the rejection of the initiative by 62 % of voters in late September 2014, the campaign and ballot results are interesting because they show the importance of (effective) public communication in shaping the outcome of a popular ballot. The relevance of the Swiss case goes beyond the peculiarities of its federalism and direct democracy and might be useful for other countries debating {{the pros and cons of}} national unitary health insurance systems versus models using multiple insurers. After this electoral ballot, the project to establish a <b>public</b> <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> in Switzerland seems definitely stopped, at least for the next decade. Insurers, who opposed the initiative, have effectively fed the “fear of change” of the population and have stressed the good outcomes of the Swiss healthcare system. However, the political pressure favoured by the popular initiative opened a “windows of opportunity” and led the federal Parliament to pass a stricter regulation of health insurers, improving in this way the current system...|$|R
50|$|Germany has the world's oldest {{national}} social {{health insurance}} system, with origins {{dating back to}} Otto von Bismarck's social legislation, which included the Health Insurance Bill of 1883, Accident Insurance Bill of 1884, and Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill of 1889. Bismarck {{stressed the importance of}} three key principles; solidarity, the government is responsible for ensuring access by those who need it, subsidiarity, policies are implemented with smallest no political and administrative influence, and corporatism, the government representative bodies in health care professions set out procedures they deem feasible. Mandatory health insurance originally applied only to low-income workers and certain government employees, but has gradually expanded to cover the great majority of the population. The system is decentralized with private practice physicians providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population are covered by a 'Statutory Health Insurance' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1,100 <b>public</b> or private <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level. Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of 'private' insurance. The latter's premiums are not linked to income level but instead to health status. Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations between regional physicians' associations and <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|R
40|$|Physicians, medical {{relief and}} <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> in Belgium {{in the nineteenth}} century. In the nineteenth century {{a large part of}} the {{population}} was dependent on medical relief as well as on <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> for access to medical care. In both cases medical doctors were confronted with similar problems as far as organisation and payment were concerned. However, the major grievance of the medical organizations and the medical press centred on their relation with the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> Physicians felt that <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> posed a serious threat to their market situation, first because the number of funds was growing rapidly and they could count on political support Second, the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> threatened to reduce the number of private clients in those towns and regions were there was already an oversupply of physicians. Last but not least, doctors felt the working conditions offered by the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> were poorer and their autonomy less than in medical relief. Only strong medical unions could counter the growing power of <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> This article begins with a general overview of the extent of poverty and the organisation of poor relief in Belgium in the nineteenth century. Secondly, attention is focused on the development of the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> The position of medical doctors within both sectors is outlined briefly. The article concludes with a comparison between attitudes of doctors towards medical relief and <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> at the turn of the century...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the competition of nonprofit <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> {{in the market}} for supplementary health insurance. We investigate product quality strategies when quality is costly and the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> are competing for customers. As long as the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> choose the qualities for simultaneously, any equilibrium will be nondifferentiated. Only if total demand is increasing in quality, both <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> provide the maximum quality. For decreasing total demand the existence of an equilibrium depends on the consumers' sensitivity. If there is no equilibrium in the simultaneous competition, sequential quality competition leads to a differentiated equilibrium with a first mover advantage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sickness</b> <b>funds</b> {{became the}} focal point of health {{insurance}} reforms in the 1990 s. Policy makers expected funds to become more consumer-oriented and more active in managing the provision of health care. This is especially true for two countries in the heart of Europe that, on first view, have many similar institutional characteristics. Both Germany and The Netherlands have introduced competition between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> in the last decade. We present extensive quantitative, as well qualitative, data with regard to the behaviour of consumers after the introduction of free choice between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> National data was used with regard to contribution rates and member flows and survey data was used to investigate personal motives for actual change and perception of differences between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> In Germany, contribution rates between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> differ significantly. Accordingly, these differences are the main reason for consumers to switch funds, which occurs on a considerable scale. However, survey data show that other reasons may be important too. In The Netherlands, premium differences are much lower. The same is true for the degree of change. Survey data show that consumers perceive very small differences between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> and do not see much reason for change. Our findings support the claim that the degree of actual changing depends strongly on economic incentives, especially with regard to the extent of financial risk <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> have to bear and to the extent premiums or contribution rates can differ. However, the higher the financial risk of individual <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> actually is, the higher the incentives for risk selection. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
50|$|After World War II Italy (re-)established {{its social}} {{security}} system including a social health insurance administered by <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> In the 1970s the social health insurance faced several equity problems as coverage differed between the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> and around 7% of the population remained uninsured. Moreover, <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> went practically bankrupt by the mid-1970s. Due to growing public dissatisfaction with the existing healthcare system, Italian policymakers fostered a structural reform. In 1978, the government established the SSN (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) — the Italian version of a National Health Service — including universal coverage and tax funding.|$|R

30|$|The Health Fund is an {{important}} departure from previous practice because all contributions to the statutory <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> are now paid into a common fund. A uniform contribution rate also applies across <b>sickness</b> <b>funds,</b> and state financing has increased. The fund distributes monies to the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> based on a risk-adjusted capitation payment for each person insured by a particular fund. Funds that can provide health insurance benefits for less than this capitation rate may reimburse their members; or, in case of deficit, they may levy an income-related additional contribution. These administrative changes are intended to promote cost savings and efficiency because <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> now face stronger incentives to compete for members—including chronically-ill or other high-risk patients—and to provide cost-effective services. To this end, the scope for individualized coverage and preferred provider agreements has been increased, while {{the role of the}} associations of <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> and insurance doctors has decreased. At the same time, the reform also introduced capitation fees for medical providers, which will decrease the relative incomes of ambulatory specialists by comparison to GPs, and has further reduced the role of the corporatist associations previously charged with negotiation physician payments on a collective basis (Jochem 2008; Immergut 2009). The legislation passed easily given concurrent majorities in the Bundestag and Bundesrat.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of Colombian social health insurance reform was to increase competition among for-profit insurers.

Data from a 1997 Colombian household survey are analyzed with a bivariate probit model with partial observability using instrumental variables.

40|$|From the mid- 1990 s {{citizens}} in Belgium, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland have a guaranteed periodic choice among risk-bearing <b>sickness</b> <b>funds,</b> {{who are responsible}} for purchasing their care or providing them with medical care. The rationale of this arrangement is to stimulate the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> to improve efficiency in health care production and to respond to consumers' preferences. To achieve solidarity, all five countries have implemented a system of risk-adjusted premium subsidies (or risk equalization across risk groups), along with strict regulation of the consumers' direct premium contribution to their <b>sickness</b> <b>fund.</b> In this article we present a conceptual framework for understanding risk adjustment and comparing the systems in the five countries. We conclude {{that in the case of}} imperfect risk adjustment-as is the case in all five countries in the year 2001 -the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> have financial incentives for risk selection, which may threaten solidarity, efficiency, quality of care and consumer satisfaction. We expect that without substantial improvements in the risk adjustment formulae, risk selection will increase in all five countries. The issue is particularly serious in Germany and Switzerland. We strongly recommend therefore that policy makers in the five countries give top priority to the improvement of the system of risk adjustment. That would enhance solidarity, cost-control, efficiency and client satisfaction in a system of competing, risk-bearing <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|According to Hirschmann's {{concept of}} exit and voice, people have two options {{to make sure}} that firms or organisations realise what they (their {{consumers}} or members) are interested in (Hirschmann 1970). In the Dutch public health insurance system voice existed for a long time, but exit was only introduced in the 1990 s. In this paper the authors examine the introduciton of exit in the Dutch health insurance system and discuss the combination of exit and voice. Until the early 1990 -s consumers in Dutch compulsory social health insurance did not have the exit option. There was no consumer choice between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> However, <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> were the focal point of Dutch health system reforms in the early 1990 s. Giving the insured free choice between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> was supposed to bring about competition that would at the same time favour quality through selective contracting by <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> and curb costs through incentives for efficiency (Gress 2002). The possibility to use voice - for example, through the 'Council of Insured" or by filing a complaint - remained unchanged throughout the reforms. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
5000|$|Germany has a {{universal}} multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: [...] "Law-enforced health insurance" [...] (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) known as <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> [...] "Krankenkasse" [...] and [...] "Private" [...] (Privat Krankenversicherung). Compulsory insurance applies to those below a set income level and is provided through private non-profit [...] "sickness funds" [...] at similar rates for all members, and {{is paid for}} with joint employer-employee contributions. Provider compensation rates are negotiated in complex corporatist social bargaining among specified autonomously organized interest groups (e.g. physicians' associations) {{at the level of}} federal states (Länder). The <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> are mandated to provide a wide range of coverage and cannot refuse membership or otherwise discriminate on an actuarial basis. Small numbers of persons are covered by tax-funded government employee insurance or social welfare insurance.

40|$|Background: In {{a number}} of European {{countries}} managed competition has been introduced to increase efficiency and the delivery of patient centred care. In social insurance countries, this has also {{led to the creation}} of insurance with free choice <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> for publicly insured. The <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> should act as strategic purchasers who contract care that fits the needs of the populations they serve. The ageing populations of European health systems need an integrated package of prevention, cure, care and social services. For metropolitan areas this is especially relevant, as numerous problems concentrate in districts where the health status of citizens is significantly below average. However, it is unclear who can and is willing to act as the conductor of such a system. By default, in systems with an insurance market multiple <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> operate within the same regional or local setting and they are responsible for contracting cure and care only. Prevention and social services are the domain of other public agencies (municipalities, in the Netherlands). Aim: Taking the city of Amsterdam as a case study, this paper explores how the <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> with the largest market share in Amsterdam (> 70 %) and the municipality of Amsterdam perceive their roles and responsibilities in orchestrating the local health system. Methods: Results of this case study are largely based on qualitative data, gathered in 15 semi-structured interviews with key-players in the <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> and in four consecutive meetings with representatives of the city of Amsterdam. Additional data have been collected through a questionnaire and document analysis. Results: The <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> is not willing to take up a conductor role. There is no business case for doing so. First, the <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> represents only a proportion of the Amsterdam population and thus cannot protect public interests. Second, the current context of health care fosters price competition and risk selection instead of strategic purchasing. Third, the national health policy leaves insufficient room to take up a conductor role. Last, a public health orientation is not in the interest of the <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> as profits are uncertain and not clear. With the <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> unwilling to take up the conductor role, the municipality of Amsterdam feels forced to formulate health care policies as public interests are challenged. A policy document, including plans towards the organisation of health care, will be released in the course of 2003. The municipality takes up problems in the field of general practice (shortages), primary care and mother and childcare in inner city areas. However, the municipality has too limited means, responsibilities and power to organise the local health system. Conclusions: This leads to the paradox that the <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> is most capable of taking the lead, but unwilling, whereas the municipality is willing but is restricted in its possibilities to do so. This demonstrates the limitations of managed competition when it comes to ensuring community health. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|In Switzerland {{the new law}} {{on health}} insurance, {{effective}} since 1996, introduced pro competitive changes in the market of <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> The legislator expected high mobility between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> of both healthy and sick insured as open enrolment was introduced with the new law.

The risk adjustment scheme is based on a regression model to explain medical expenditures for different social groups.

40|$|Germany {{is known}} for its {{comprehensive}} health care coverage by <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> and private health insurers and its successful cost containment policy. The stabilization of health care expenditures as a percentage of GNP was enforced by five cost containment laws since 1977. The last one became effective in 1993 and the next ones are planned for 1996 and 2000. The 1993 law has initiated drastic changes of the system. Office based physicians will be paid by a mixture of capitation, fee-for-service and fees for combined service packages. The hospital financing will be transformed from the current per diem remuneration to a payment system where per diems are combined with payments based on diagnostic related groups and patient management categories. Up till now many restrictions exist for insurees to switch <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> These limitations were removed by the 1993 law. To allow unbiased competition between <b>sickness</b> <b>funds,</b> a risk compensation pool, some kind of statutory reinsurance, will transfer financial resources from <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> with good risk structure to those with many bad risks.

40|$|The German {{health care}} reform {{implemented}} in 2009 led to a considerable increase in price transparency within the statutory health insurance (SHI) (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung, GKV) system and also made it more consumer-friendly which, in turn, has encouraged policy holders to react to price hikes by switching to a different health insurance fund ("sickness fund"). In 2009, the government established a central "health care fund" (Gesundheitsfond) which standardized contribution rates. Price differences between the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> are now listed separately on the policy holder's bill as add-on or reimbursed premiums. It is above all these add-on premiums that gave policy holders a clear price signal. According to SOEP representative survey data, in 2010 this resulted in one in ten individuals affected by add-on premiums switching health plans. Aggregated <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> level data show that the add-on premiums introduced by the DAK and KKH-Allianz resulted in a 7. 5 percent average annual loss of members. However, {{at the beginning of}} 2011, a generous increase in the uniform contribution rate for all <b>sickness</b> <b>funds</b> and the extravagant filling of the health care fund with the additional reserves means that in 2012, it is likely that no <b>sickness</b> <b>fund</b> will have to charge add-on premiums thus thwarting any price transparency previously achieved by the add-on premiums. As of 2013 the situation could change again as a result of increasing health care spending and a downturn in the economy. However, the government should not count on this happening, and instead should introduce new incentives to strengthen price competition, for example by capping the health care fund's payments to the <b>sickness</b> <b>funds.</b> Health insurance, price framing, health plan switching, SOEP...|$|R
