5|$|The age for officer {{candidates}} {{was between}} 20 and 50; {{they had to}} have a college degree, or two years of college and two years of <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> business experience. The enlisted age requirements were between 20 and 36; candidates had to have completed at least two years of high school. For the most part, SPARS were white, but five African-Americans did eventually serve. The agreement between the U.S. Navy and the USCG required that officer candidates receive their indoctrination training at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. But in June 1943, the USCG withdrew from the agreement, and the indoctrination of SPAR officer candidates was transferred to the USCG Academy at New London, Connecticut. Most SPAR officers were general duty officers, but some officers received specialized training.|$|E
5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a <b>professional</b> <b>or</b> {{managerial}} position (in education or government) before entering the service.

The likelihood was that she came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons for becoming a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss of a loved one in the war.|$|E
