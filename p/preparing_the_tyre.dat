40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} a {{finite element model}} used to investigate the quasi-static behaviour of a stationary automobile tyre vertically loaded against a stiff horizontal surface. The model includes a representation of <b>the</b> <b>tyre,</b> a steel wheel and a surface. <b>The</b> <b>tyre</b> is represented in detail {{by a number of}} <b>tyre</b> components, <b>the</b> wheel and surface are coarsely modelled. LS-DYNA 3 D is used to simulate the inflation of <b>the</b> <b>tyre,</b> <b>the</b> fit between <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and <b>the</b> wheel and the vertical loading of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> against <b>the</b> surface. Simulation results, such as the load-deflection characteristics and the load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are compared with mixed success to those obtained experimentally. The stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> components and <b>the</b> inflation pressure are varied independently and the simulation is repeated. The resulting load-tyre/ground contact patch dimensions are discussed in context with the development of a rolling tyre model.

40|$|For vehicle at normal driving {{conditions}} and speeds above 30 - 40 km/h the dominating external noise source {{is the sound}} generated by <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> and road interaction. Previous measurements have shown {{that there is a}} strong correlation between the radiated sound pressure and the vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> structure for frequency below approximately 1 kHz. <b>The</b> <b>tyre</b> vibration is also the main source of noise inside many vehicles in this frequency range. It is thus important to develop simple tools that predict <b>the</b> <b>tyres</b> behaviour in this frequency range. <b>The</b> <b>tyre</b> is modelled as an elemental system, which permits the analysis of <b>the</b> low frequency <b>tyre</b> response when excited by distributed stochastic forces in the contact patch. Although the contact mechanism is generally non-linear, it is assumed here that <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> is compliant enough for the whole of the contact patch to remain of the same width and to be always in touch with the road. A linear model can then be used to calculate the contact forces from the road roughness and thus calculate the resulting radial velocity of <b>the</b> <b>tyre.</b> A spectral density matrix, derived from a road roughness model, describes the velocities and is used to calculate the expectation of <b>the</b> <b>tyre’s</b> kinetic energy and its sound power radiation. In the first instance a simple two-dimensional model will be used with a Winkler bedding model of the contact patch to predict the power spectral density of <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> vibration at different road speeds. This model {{can also be used to}} provide an initial estimate of the potential effect of various active control strategies for reducing <b>the</b> <b>tyre</b> vibrations. In particular an optimised feed-forward control formulation can be used to calculate the potential effect of various types of actuators, by calculating the optimal performance with different distributions of secondary force...|$|R
