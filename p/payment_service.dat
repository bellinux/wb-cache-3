But, when firms differ exogenously in the cost of intermediation services, the tax on savings intermediation should be zero.

40|$|The {{amount of}} fee income earned by the banking sector {{suggests}} that the significance of <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> has been understated or overlooked. This paper attempts to develop {{a clearer picture of}} the importance of <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> to the industry by delineating the payments area broadly and by analyzing data disclosed in bank holding company annual reports on sources of noninterest income. We find that <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> bring in from one-third to two-fifths of the combined operating revenue of the twenty-five largest bank holding companies. This contribution to revenue is considerably larger than commonly appreciated and indicates that the production and distribution of <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> is one of the core activities of commercial banks.

To reach our objective interviews were conducted asking about consumers experience with current payment methods and how consumers perceive mobile <b>payment</b> <b>services.</b> Questions from the interviews are derived from theories about technology adoption mainly from Diffusion of Innovations and Technology Acceptance Model. In addition questions about how consumers perceive mobile <b>payment</b> <b>services</b> are based on existing and concept based features.
