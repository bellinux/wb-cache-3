50|$|The first {{courthouse}} was a 20' x 24' building {{constructed by}} James M. Gaston from logs. It was two stories tall. The courtroom occupied the entire first floor. The second story held two rooms and a hallway, used during court <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> <b>grant</b> or petit purposes. The courthouse was finished August 15, 1858 {{at a cost}} of $5,500.00. About 8 months after completion of the new building, a group began scheming to have the courthouse, and hence the County Seat, moved out of Raleigh. The subject of taking the County Seat away from Raleigh was a very heated, hostile event. Arguments held that Harrisburg was a more central location. Petitions were passed around that put the issue on the ballot; a margin of 15 votes decided the fate of Raleigh. Raleigh filed suit but they never got their day in court because each time a date was set the hearing was postponed with no action every being taken and the suit was finally thrown out of court. It is rumored, and is included in the records in the Inventory of the County Archives of Illinois that some Harrisburg residents bribed the court. Accusations have been made that a group of people actually sneaked into Raleigh one night, broke into the Courthouse, stole the county records, and took them to Harrisburg. Only two families were living in Harrisburg at the time Harrisburg became the County Seat. The last County Court held in Raleigh was in June 1858.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{the ways in which}} clients of social {{services}} in Milevsko and its surrounding areas use care allowances. The opening theoretical part briefly mentions the legislation and manners in which both financial and physical assistance was provided to physically handicapped persons before the Social Services Act came into effect. The second part of the thesis describes matters relating to the provision of care allowances, namely the filing of requests, the course of <b>proceedings</b> <b>for</b> the <b>granting</b> of care allowances, the right to the payment of care allowances, degrees of dependency, and the purposes for which care allowances are intended. The third part introduces the individual registered providers in Milevsko, namely what services they have registered, to whom these services are meant to be provided, and what scope of services the registered providers provide. The practical part traces the particular manners in which care allowances are utilized by their recipients in social services. The aim of the thesis is to find out whether care allowances are sufficient, whether recipients utilize them to buy these services and whether recipients only buy services from registered providers or whether they avail themselves of the care of family members or other natural persons as well...|$|R
