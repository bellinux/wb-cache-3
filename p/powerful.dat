5|$|Although {{it was not}} {{immediately}} obvious to the men on Bellone, the new arrival was Plampin's <b>Powerful,</b> which had arrived in Indian waters on 13 June 1806. Finding no trace of Willaumez, who had elected {{to remain in the}} Atlantic, Plampin briefly anchored at Madras and subsequently cruised off Ceylon. There, following intelligence sent by Pellew, he captured the 20-gun French privateer Henriette near Trincomalee after an 11-hour chase. From information possibly supplied by prisoners removed from Henriette or possibly from a merchant ship sailing from Colombo, Plampin learned of Perroud's operations and had arranged to meet Rattlesnake off the Little Basses Reef. In the hope of luring the privateer into a confrontation, he disguised his large warship to look like an East Indiaman. Perroud rapidly saw through the disguise, and also noticed that while the wind remained strong off the coast, <b>Powerful</b> was further out to sea and appeared becalmed. Realising that his only option was to sail between <b>Powerful</b> and the shore, Perroud turned eastwards, but the wind gradually strengthened for <b>Powerful</b> and by 17:00 the ship of the line was within range of Bellone with her bow chasers.|$|E
