5|$|Whatever Coke's meaning, {{after an}} initial period during which his {{decision}} enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void, Bonham's Case was thrown aside, in favour of the growing doctrine of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> In {{one of the most}} prominent early treatises supporting the doctrine, William Blackstone wrote that Parliament is the sovereign lawmaker, preventing the common law courts from throwing aside or reviewing statutes in the fashion that Coke had suggested. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is now the accepted judicial doctrine in the legal system of England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between sections 3 and 4 and <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> has been commented on most extensively. The most common criticism {{has been of}} the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related {{to the rule of}} law, although the advancement of human rights is seen as a positive feature also associated with the rule of law. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged.|$|E
5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} be overturned by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a redefinition of Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E
5000|$|The {{constitution}} envisages a <b>parliamentary</b> democracy. <b>Sovereignty</b> is {{vested in}} the people comprising the citizens of Northern Cyprus and is exercised by authorized organs {{in the name of}} the people. No organ or authority can exercise any State authority which does not emanate from the constitution. Article 7 provides for the supremacy of the constitution.|$|R
50|$|The Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE) brings {{together}} parties committed to individual liberty, national <b>sovereignty,</b> <b>parliamentary</b> democracy, {{the rule of}} law, private property, low taxes, sound money, free trade, open competition, and the devolution of power.|$|R
50|$|The Constitution {{is divided}} into 18 parts which {{sanction}} a <b>parliamentary</b> democracy, people’s <b>sovereignty</b> and fundamental rights of the citizens {{as well as other}} important points. The Constitution is said to have fulfilled all the requirements for a modern European constitution.|$|R
5|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate {{contrary}} to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} the paradox {{can also be seen}} in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when {{accessing}} legislative or <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.|$|E
25|$|The 1949 Act {{could be}} {{considered}} to be secondary legislation, since it depended for its validity on another Act, the 1911 Act; and the principle that courts will respect an Act of Parliament without enquiring into its origins (an emanation of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty)</b> would not apply.|$|E
50|$|A new {{constitution}} was adopted, on 4 November 1994, which declared Abkhaz <b>sovereignty.</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> elections were held on 23 November 1996, {{but these were}} not recognised by the Georgian government or the international community, as the elections were held after ethnic cleansing when majority of pre-war population had fled Abkhazia. The CIS imposed economic sanctions in January 1996 and the region is formally blockaded by both Georgia and Russia.|$|R
5000|$|The terms [...] "parliamentary sovereignty" [...] and [...] "parliamentary supremacy" [...] {{are often}} used interchangeably. The term [...] "sovereignty" [...] implies a {{similarity}} {{to the question of}} national sovereignty. While writer John Austin and others have looked to combine <b>parliamentary</b> and national <b>sovereignty,</b> this view is not universally held. Whichever term is used, it relates to the existence or non-existence of limits on Parliament's power in its legislative role. Although the House of Commons' dominance within the Houses of Parliament is well attested, [...] "parliamentary sovereignty" [...] refers to their joint power. Almost all legislation is passed {{with the support of the}} House of Lords.|$|R
25|$|Although Article 4 of the Singapore Constitution {{expressly}} {{declares that}} it is the supreme law of the land and the Constitution appears to satisfy Dicey's criteria, the view has been taken that it may not be supreme in practice and that Singapore's legal system is de facto characterized by <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Article 4 of the Constitution {{expressly}} {{declares that}} it is the supreme law of the land. The Constitution also appears to satisfy Albert Venn Dicey's three criteria for supremacy: codification, rigidity, and the existence of judicial review by the courts. However, the view has been taken that it may not be supreme in practice and that Singapore's legal system is de facto characterized by <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of late, the Supreme Court has {{observed}} that the PIL has tended to become a means to gain publicity or obtain relief contrary to constitutionally valid legislation and policy. Observers point out that many High Courts and certain Supreme Court judges are reluctant to entertain PILs, even those filed by well-known Non-governmental organizations (NGO) and activists, citing concerns of Separation of powers and the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{resistance}} to an entrenched {{bill of rights}} in New Zealand is partly because the country is currently governed by <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> Giving the courts the power to strike down Parliament’s legislation would be contrary to the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. There is also resistance because the protection of human rights is not regarded as the courts’ responsibility, but instead seen as requiring involvement by all branches of government.|$|E
25|$|A {{judiciary}} is theoretically {{bound by}} the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only interpret the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the doctrine of precedent. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.|$|E
25|$|The National Party did {{not have}} enough seats in Parliament to pass the bill with the two-thirds {{majority}} in joint sitting that would be required if the entrenchment of sections 36 and 152 was still valid. Based on the ruling in Ndlwana's case (see above) and the principle of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> Malan's government decided to enact it by following the normal parliamentary procedure of a simple majority in each house separately. The Governor-General gave his assent on 15 June 1951 and the act was promulgated on 18 June.|$|E
25|$|In November 1994 Lord Lester {{introduced}} {{a bill in the}} Lords which was based on the New Zealand Bill of Rights which would give the Convention a similar status in UK law as that accorded to European Community law by allowing courts to disapply future and existing Acts of Parliament which were incompatible with it, imposing a duty on public authorities to comply and making provision for effective remedies including damages for breaches. Introduced during a period of concern over the impact of European Community law on the <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> the bill did not receive support from the Conservative government and failed in the Commons due to lack of time.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand has a {{legislature}} {{called the}} New Zealand Parliament, {{consisting of the}} Queen-in-Parliament and the House of Representatives. According to the doctrine of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> Parliament may pass any legislation that it wishes. Since 1996, New Zealand has used the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system, which is essentially proportional representation with single member seats (that can affect the proportionality of the House, but only to a limited degree). Seven seats are currently reserved for members elected on a separate Māori roll. However, Māori may choose to vote in and {{to run for the}} non-reserved seats, and several have entered Parliament in this way.|$|E
25|$|Israel has {{a common}} law legal system. Its basic {{principles}} are {{inherited from the}} law of the British Mandate of Palestine and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the supreme court in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the Israeli constitution remains unwritten is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the Knesset (which, following the doctrine of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> holds near-unlimited power).|$|E
25|$|The UK {{does not}} have a codified {{constitution}} and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Under the doctrine of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. Indeed, in 1972, the UK Parliament unilaterally prorogued the Parliament of Northern Ireland, setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions. In practice, it would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions. The political constraints placed upon the UK Parliament's power to interfere with devolution in Northern Ireland are even greater than in relation to Scotland and Wales, given that devolution in Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the Government of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, {{a belief}} arose that some extra {{protection}} of human rights above and beyond parliamentary scrutiny was necessary. Doubts grew about the capacity of parliamentary controls, partly because of scepticism about Parliament's will to control the growing executive and the control by political parties of their MPs which allowed weak governments to avoid effective challenges. This scepticism went {{hand in hand with}} criticisms of the United Kingdom's political system and whether it is sufficiently representative of the range of opinion in the country. The doubts intensified with the experiences with terrorism in the 1970s and accession to the European Community in 1973 where Britain was exposed to other legal systems which did not share the same concept of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and which gave stronger protection to human rights. In particular, European entry led to the notion that the Parliament of the United Kingdom could be subject to the decisions of a higher legal order {{in the form of the}} European Court of Justice. This was highlighted in the Factortame litigation where the House of Lords was required to 'disapply' provisions of an Act of Parliament which were contrary to European Community law, effectively ruling them invalid. In addition, increasingly influenced by international human rights law, comparative constitutional law and European law, English courts became more sympathetic towards the concept of popular sovereignty and fundamental rights and liberties.|$|E
25|$|Isolated {{strands of}} liberal thought had existed in Western {{philosophy}} since the Ancient Greeks and in Eastern philosophy since the Song and Ming period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized {{as a distinct}} ideology, by the English philosopher John Locke, generally regarded {{as the father of}} modern liberalism. The first major signs of liberal politics emerged in modern times. These ideas began to coalesce {{at the time of the}} English Civil Wars. The Levellers, a radical political movement, during the war called for freedom of religion, frequent convening of Parliament, and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the 17th century in England, culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and the right of revolution and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state. The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several European monarchies throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its American colonies grew after 1765 and the Seven Years' War over the issue of taxation without representation, culminating in the Declaration of Independence of a new republic, and the resulting American Revolutionary War to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The Articles of Confederation, written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The Confederation Congress called a Constitutional Convention in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new Constitution of the United States establishing a federal government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document. It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Before the Human Rights Act {{was brought}} before parliament, the government's whitepaper {{considered}} {{that it was}} necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty).</b> However, the effect on <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E
500|$|Richard Ekins criticises as [...] "historically false [...] jurisprudentially absurd" [...] {{the claim}} made by Lord Steyn and Lord Hope that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> was solely a {{judicial}} creation. He {{argues that the}} doctrine is fundamental to the UK constitution {{because it has been}} accepted by all three branches of government; [...] "while the judges also accept the rule, they did not create it and may not (lawfully) change it". However, Stuart Lakin responds that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> does, in practice and in theory, depend on its recognition by the courts.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{prompted}} {{debate about}} the legitimacy of limiting <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and the theoretical justifications for the ruling. Alison Young suggests that the opinions {{could be explained by}} the Parliament Act 1911 modifying the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents or by the Act redefining Parliament in a manner that binds the courts. Christopher Forsyth argues that the Parliament Acts redefined Parliament to be a bicameral body for all legislation which also has a method of unicamerally legislating (except to extend Parliament beyond five years). Jowell proposes that there are two reasons for limiting <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> – if the democratic legitimacy of the legislature were undermined by its acts or if the body attempted to remove fundamental rights in a democratic society – [...] and cites support for these arguments from the judgment. The case was also criticised for claims made by Lord Steyn and Lord Hope that the doctrine of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> was solely a judicial creation.|$|E
500|$|Whatever Coke's meaning, {{after an}} initial period of application, Bonham's Case was thrown aside in favour of the growing {{doctrine}} of <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> Initially written down by William Blackstone, this theory makes Parliament the sovereign law-maker, preventing the common law courts from not only throwing aside but also reviewing statutes in the fashion Coke suggested. <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is now the universally-accepted judicial doctrine in England and Wales. Bonham's Case met a mixed reaction at the time, with the King and Lord Ellesmere both deeply unhappy with it. Nineteenth and twentieth-century academics are scarcely more favourable, calling it [...] "a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially", and an [...] "abortion".|$|E
500|$|R (Jackson) v Attorney General [...] is a House of Lords case {{noted for}} {{containing}} obiter comments by the Judiciary acting in their official capacity {{suggesting that there}} may be limits to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> the orthodox position being that it is unlimited in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{doctrine}} of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> Coke's theory gradually died out; William Blackstone, in the first edition of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, wrote that [...] "if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is now upheld by the English judiciary as a [...] "central principle of British constitutionalism" [...] despite with some issues by membership in the European Union. The case's modern irrelevance is such that Philip Hamburger wrote in 2008, [...] "Bonham's Case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty, except for reasons that are now largely forgotten".|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the name}} he had made for himself in attacking the writs, Otis {{was elected to the}} Massachusetts colonial {{legislature}} and helped pass legislation requiring that special writs of assistance be [...] "granted by any judge or justice of the peace upon information under oath by any officer of the customs" [...] and barring all other writs. The governor overturned the legislation, finding it contrary to English law and <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lord Hope {{also argued}} that Parliament should {{not be able to}} pass {{legislation}} that [...] "is so absurd or so unacceptable that the populace at large refuses to recognise it as law". [...] Jeffrey Jowell suggests that these comments were influenced by Lord Hope's position as a Law Lord from Scotland, where it is unclear whether <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is recognised following MacCormick v Lord Advocate, in which the doctrine was seen as [...] "a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law".|$|E
500|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is {{no longer}}, {{if it ever}} was, {{absolute}} ... It is no longer {{right to say that}} its freedom to legislate admits of no qualification whatever. Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament ... is being qualified ... The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. The fact that your Lordships have been willing to hear this appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament's legislative sovereignty.|$|E
500|$|Common law constitutionalism, a {{view that}} there are {{fundamental}} constitutional values that are protected even from interference by Parliament, had become increasingly popular {{at the time of}} Jackson. Four recent cases had found that [...] "in the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts [...] presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual". There had also been extrajudicial comments by serving judges that <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> may not be absolute: Lord Woolf had written that [...] "if Parliament did the unthinkable, then I would say that courts would also be required to act in a manner which was without precedent" [...] while John Laws had argued that [...] "ultimate sovereignty rests ... not with those who wield governmental power, but in the conditions under which they are permitted to do so. The constitution, not the Parliament, is in this sense sovereign". However, Jackson contained the first express support from judges acting in their official capacity for the proposition that courts might have the authority to strike down an Act of Parliament if it violated fundamental constitutional principles (albeit obiter). This was a significant challenge to the orthodox view of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> expressed by Albert Venn Dicey, that Parliament can make and unmake law on any topic and that no body can make a higher form of law than Parliament or set aside primary legislation.|$|E
500|$|The case, {{brought by}} Jackson {{and two other}} members of the Countryside Alliance, {{challenged}} the use of the Parliament Acts to enact the Hunting Act 2004. The appellants claimed that the Parliament Act 1911 could not be used to pass the Parliament Act 1949 which amended the 1911 Act; the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the modified as opposed to the original requirements of the Parliament Acts procedure, was therefore invalid. The Divisional Court and Court of Appeal both rejected this claim, although the Court of Appeal held that Parliament Acts procedure could not be used to effect [...] "fundamental constitutional changes". The case was appealed again to the House of Lords. In relation to preliminary issues, the court held that it had jurisdiction to examine the validity of the Hunting Act as a question of statutory interpretation (whether the 1911 Act could be used to enact the 1949 Act); standing was not challenged. On the substantive issue, the court ruled there were no limits to the type of legislation that could be passed using the Parliament Acts except for the express limitations contained in the legislation. The Parliament Act 1949 had therefore been validly passed using the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act was consequently also held to be an Act of Parliament. In obiter comments made in the judgment, Lord Steyn, Lord Hope and Baroness Hale suggested that there might be limits to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> (although Lord Bingham and Lord Carswell impliedly supported the orthodox view that there are no limits to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty).</b>|$|E
500|$|To cap all this, the {{amendment}} of articles touching on the [...] "sensitive issues" [...] mentioned, {{as well as the}} clause governing this rule on amendments, was forbidden without the consent of the Conference of Rulers. Effectively entrenching the [...] "sensitive" [...] Articles, this was heavily criticised by opposition MPs. It was claimed that if Parliament could be prevented from discussing particular issue, <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>sovereignty</b> was undermined. It was also unclear if the ban from speaking on [...] "sensitive issues" [...] applied to the ban itself. Nevertheless, the provisions were passed. The Internal Security Act (ISA), which effectively allows the government to detain anyone it deems a threat to national security for an indefinite period without judicial review, was also amended in 1971 to stress the [...] "preservation of intercommunal harmony".|$|E
