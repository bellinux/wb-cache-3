The Act allowed the government to identify land that it may be interested in expropriating at some point in the future and to indefinitely prohibit any development on that land that could conflict with the government's purposes. Despite vigorous opposition from landowners and the opposition parties, the bill passed the legislature in late April.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We used an {{electrical}} cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technique to measure {{changes in the}} <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of individual cells. The <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of the cell {{plays a significant role}} in cellular behavior, including cell spreading, cell growth, cell death and cell adhesion. We built a custom impedance sensing setup; we recorded real time impedance spectra of individual adherent cells; and we used two parameters extracted from each impedance spectrum to measure the changes in the <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of the cell. The <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of the cell determines how much electrical current was measured using ECIS; therefore, it directly governed the values of two extracted impedance parameters...|$|R

40|$|There are {{instances}} {{in which it is}} desirable to determine relationships among fruit physical attributes. For example, fruits are often graded on the basis of size and <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> but it may be more economical to develop a machine which would grade by mass or volume. Therefore, the relationships between mass/volume (either mass or volume) and other physical attributes of fruit are needed. In this study three Iranian varieties of tangerine were selected and the various models for predicting mass/volume of tangerine from its dimensions, <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> and volume/mass were established. The models were divided into three classifications: 1 &# 8211; single and multiple variable regressions of tangerine dimensions, 2 &# 8211; single and multiple variable regressions of <b>projected</b> <b>areas,</b> 3 &# 8211; estimating tangerine mass/volume based on its volume/mass. The results revealed that mass and volume modelling on the basis of intermediate diameter, on any <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> and the measured volume are the best models. Based on the results, mass and volume modelling, respectively {{on the basis of the}} actual volume and one <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> were identified as the best models. The highest determination coefficient in all the models was obtained for volume modelling based on <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> as R 2 = 0. 97. Finally, volume modelling from economical stand-point was recommended as the most reliable modelling...|$|R

40|$|Vegetation {{along the}} toe of a {{streambank}} can slow down water and deflect flow away from banks, altering the forces applied to the bank surface and protecting banks against erosion. Five flume experiments were used to explore how changes in vegetation planform density (number of plants/horizontal <b>area)</b> and <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> (number of leaves/vertical area) influence channel velocity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on a 30 ° vegetated bank toe at three discharge rates.

Higher <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> increased turbulence, especially along the bank toe-channel margin interface where turbulence increased five-fold.

40|$|The {{determination}} of mathematical models for predicting {{the mass of}} kiwi fruits from their dimensions and <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> was done. The research was conducted on 200 observations of two Iranian varieties of kiwi fruit (Abbott and Hayward). The physical characteristics measured included mass, volume, dimensions and <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> perpendicular to major diameters. Maximum, mean, minimum values, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, bulk density (BD), geometric mean diameter (GM), and percent sphericity (SPH) {{of all of the}} parameters were determined.

Among single variable models, 1 st classification, second diameter model of kiwi fruit had maximum coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0. 78 for all observations. Among the second classification, mass models of <b>projected</b> <b>areas</b> had a nonlinear relationship with R 2 = 0. 97.

25|$|In another {{empirical}} study, Chaudhry (2009) investigated {{factors affecting}} rural poverty in Southern Punjab (Pakistan), and {{he concluded that}} alleviation of poverty is possible by lowering the household size and dependency ratio, improving education, increasing female labor participation. He employed Logit regression models and used primary source of data from the <b>project</b> <b>area</b> of Asian Development Bank for estimation. Results indicate that as dependency level and household size increase the probability of being poor increases too. Education has the significant inverse relationship with poverty because it provides employment opportunities and rejects poverty. The inclusion of trained and education women workforce will not only ensure women's welfare, it will also increase the overall productivity of the workforce due to more competitiveness. Hence, the developmental and feminist economists {{argue that it is}} desirable for the government to allocate more resources towards women's education, as it is going to benefit the whole society.|$|E
25|$|The SLA {{issued an}} {{ultimatum}} to the Hearst family: {{that they would}} release Patty {{in exchange for the}} freedom of Remiro and Little. When such an arrangement proved impossible, the SLA demanded a ransom, {{in the form of a}} food distribution program. The value of food to be distributed fluctuated: on February 23 the demand was for $4 million; it peaked at $400 million. Although free food was distributed, the operation was halted when violence erupted at one of the four distribution points. This happened because the crowds were much greater than expected, and people were injured as panicked workers threw boxes of food off moving trucks into the crowd. After the SLA demanded that a community coalition called the Western Addition <b>Project</b> <b>Area</b> Committee be put in charge of the food distribution, 100,000 bags of groceries were handed out at 16 locations across four counties between February 26 and the end of March.|$|E
25|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the major}} food and cash crop after banana, in the {{highland}} region. Next in order of priority are maize, beans and wheat. In order to increase the growth of these crops in the highland region, inter cropping of bean, potato, pea and wheat was tested on an experimental basis with Seasbani sesban (Sesbania); lime and manure were added as supplements for the growth. Species of shrubs such as Sasbania, Leucaena, Calliandra and Markamia showed better growth than in the Central Plateau Region where similar studies were conducted. Studies have been conducted since 1987 by the National Agricultural Research Institute (ISAR) who maintains a substation in Rwerere, Western Province within the highlands. In order to increase agricultural production with use new commercial crops have been adopted in the <b>project</b> <b>area.</b> The crops adopted are maracuja (passion fruit), an export item, and potatoes. In addition, modern livestock breeding techniques have also been adopted.

25|$|Planning for the {{connection}} to the IND Queens Boulevard Line began in December 1990, with the final design contract awarded in December 1992. Construction began on September 22, 1994. The remaining section from 21st Street to the Queens Boulevard Line cost $645 million. In December 2000, the 63rd Street Connector was opened for construction reroutes. The Connector came into regular use on December 16, 2001, with the rerouting of F service at all times to 63rd Street. The construction project also extended the lower level LIRR tunnel and involved {{a number of other}} elements, including the integration of ventilation plants, lowering a sewer siphon 50 feet, rehabilitation of elements of the existing line, mitigating ground water, diverting trains which continued to run through the <b>project</b> <b>area</b> and widening of the entry point to the Queens Boulevard Line to six tracks. This connection created a new path between Manhattan and the heavily traveled Queens Boulevard Line, increasing the amount of train service that could be run between Manhattan and Queens. With the F rerouted via 63rd Street, service through the 53rd Street Tunnel was replaced by the V train, a new local service that ran along the Sixth Avenue and Queens Boulevard lines; this service has since been discontinued and replaced with an extension of the M train.|$|E
