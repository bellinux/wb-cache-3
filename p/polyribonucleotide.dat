40|$|A {{discrete}} set of polypeptides copurify {{with and}} appear to be specifically attached to mRNA from polysomes of eukaryotic cells. This report describes the effect of homopolyribonucleotides on mRNA-protein complexes separated from ribosome subunits by oligo(dT) -cellulose chromatography. It is shown that poly (U) and poly (A) can release mRNA-protein complexes adsorbed to oligo(dT) -cellulose, whereas poly (C) and poly(I) are much less effective in this process. Analysis of <b>polyribonucleotide</b> released material showed that poly(U) effectively dissociated the mRNA-protein complexes while poly(A) caused no or only partial derangement of these particles.

Since it is generally accepted that RNA molecules preceded double-stranded DNA molecules as genetic material, the encapsulation of <b>polyribonucleotides</b> within liposomes (made from dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine) was studied. Quantitative determinations show that approximately 50 percent of the available lipids form liposomes, and that up to 5 percent of the <b>polyribonucleotides</b> can be entrapped by them.

Treatment of the macrophages with the synthetic double-stranded <b>polyribonucleotides</b> poly(I). poly(C) and poly(A). poly(U) resulted in enhanced release of the factor into the culture medium. The effect was maximal after treatment with <b>polyribonucleotides</b> for 1 h, and the optimal dose of poly(I). poly(C) was 50 microgram/ml. The single-stranded <b>polyribonucleotides</b> poly(I) and poly(C) at the same concentration were far less effective. The differentiation-stimulating factor was detected {{not only in the}} cultured medium but also in the cell lysate. Exposure of macrophages to poly(I). poly(C) enhanced the total activity of the factor in both the culture medium and the cell lysate. The effect of this compound was blocked by the presence of cycloheximide.

40|$|<b>Polyribonucleotides</b> {{will act}} as {{efficient}} templates for the DNA polymerases found in the virions of avian myeloblastosis virus and mouse leukemia virus if a short complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide primer is added. Synthesis of the complementary polydeoxyribonucleotide continues until an amount of polymer equal {{to the amount of}} initial template has been produced. The two viruses show slightly different specificities toward the four homoribopolymers. Polydeoxyribonucleotides are generally much poorer templates than the homologous <b>polyribonucleotides,</b> in most cases yielding no detectable synthesis.

Both polyriboinosinic-cytidylic acid [poly (rI. rC) ] and pyran increased the immune response to sheep erythrocytes in the Jerne hemolytic plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay, but their modes of immunoadjuvant action differed. On peak day, poly (rI. rC) -treated mice demonstrated 5. 1 × 104 PFC/spleen (557 PFC/ 106 nucleated cells) and pyran-treated mice exhibited 4. 5 × 104 PFC/spleen (299 PFC/ 106 nucleated cells), as compared with 2. 7 × 104 PFC/spleen (261 PFC/ 106 nucleated cells) in controls. The compounds also differed in phagocytic alteration; <b>polyribonucleotides</b> did not affect phagocytosis whereas pyran produced a biphasic response.

40|$|A tritium {{derivative}} {{method for}} sequence analysis of <b>polyribonucleotides</b> is detailed, {{which is based}} on borotritide reduction of oligonucleotide dialdehydes generated by treatment of <b>polyribonucleotides</b> with alkaline phosphatase and excess periodate at pH 8 (borate buffer; no primary amine present in the reaction mixture). While neither phosphatase nor periodate possess any intrinsic exonuclease activity their combination mimics an RNA-specific exonuclease (“pseudo-exonuclease”). Procedures are described for separation and characterization of tritiumlabeled oligonucleotide derivatives. The sequence is deduced by identification of labeled 3 ′-termini following separation of the reduced nucleotide intermediates according to chain length.

40|$|Imidazole {{catalysis}} of phenylalanyl {{transfer from}} phenylalanine adenylate to hydroxyl groups of homopolyribonucleotides is studied {{as a possible}} chemical model of biochemical aminoacylation of transfer RNA (tRNA). The effect of pH on imidazole-catalyzed transfer of phenylalanyl residues to poly(U) and poly(A) double helix strands, the number of peptide linkages and their lability to base and neutral hydroxylamine, {{and the nature of}} adenylate condensation products are investigated. The chemical model entertained exhibits a constraint by not acylating the hydroxyl groups of <b>polyribonucleotides</b> in a double helix. The constraint is consistent with selective biochemical aminoacylation at the tRNA terminus.

40|$|An enzyme, {{purified}} 300 -fold from Escherichia coli {{infected with}} bacteriophage T 4, catalyzes {{the conversion of}} 5 ′-termini of <b>polyribonucleotides</b> to internal phosphodiester bonds. The reaction requires ATP and Mg++. For every 5 ′- 32 P terminus rendered resistant to alkaline phosphatase, {{an equal amount of}} AMP and PPi are formed. Various <b>polyribonucleotides</b> are substrates in the reaction; to date, the best substrate is [5 ′- 32 P]polyriboadenylate. With the latter substrate, no evidence of intermolecular reaction was obtained. However, the 5 ′- 32 P termini of poly(A) rendered resistant to alkaline phosphatase are also resistant to attack by RNase II, polynucleotide phosphorylase, and low concentrations of venom phosphodiesterase. Since the product formed with poly(A) lacks 3 ′-hydroxyl ends, as measured with these exonucleases, the enzyme appears to convert linear molecules of polyriboadenylate to a circular form by the intramolecular covalent linkage of the 5 ′-phosphate end to the 3 ′-hydroxyl terminus...|$|R
40|$|Micro-injection {{into the}} oocytes and eggs of Xenopus laevis {{was used to}} {{ascertain}} the effects of synthetic <b>polyribonucleotides</b> on protein synthesis in living cells. Poly(U) and poly(A) were not translated detectably, nor did they change the rate of endogenous protein synthesis. The same was true of poly(G,U), poly(A,G,U), poly(A,C,G,U), G-U-G-(U) n, A-(U) n and AUG. In contrast, A-U-G-(U) n was a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in the cell. This might be because it is initiated normally but lacks a termination codon, or because it inhibits the translation of other molecules in some way not dependent on its normal initiation. Poly(G,U), poly(A,G,U) and poly(A,C,G,U) inhibited haemoglobin synthesis when they were injected into the oocyte with haemoglobin mRNA. The synthetic <b>polyribonucleotides</b> did not inhibit the translation of the natural mRNA when the two sorts of molecules were injected at different times.

40|$|<b>Polyribonucleotide</b> probes (ca. 200 to 300 {{nucleotides}} in length) carrying multiple reporter molecules {{were produced}} by {{in vitro transcription}} with labeled UTP derivatives (fluorescein- 12 -UTP, 7 -amino- 4 -methyl-coumarin- 3 -acetyl- 6 -UTP, tetramethylrhodamine- 6 -UTP, or digoxigenin- 11 -UTP). Despite their length, these molecules penetrated into whole fixed gram-negative cells and hybridized specifically to their target sites on the 23 S rRNA. Fluorescence intensities were quantified for target and nontarget cells by {{the combination of a}} charge-coupled device videocamera and an image-processing system. <b>Polyribonucleotide</b> probes confer up to 26 times more fluorescence to target cells than oligonucleotide probes do. Probe sensitivity and specificity were strongly influenced by the stringency of hybridization. The use of differently labeled probes allowed the simultaneous detection of three populations.

40|$|Ten inbred {{strains of}} mice were immunized with the double {{stranded}} <b>polyribonucleotide</b> complex polyguanylic. polycytidylic acid [poly(G). poly(C) ]. While some immunogenic properties of this duplex were {{comparable to those}} of other nucleic acids antigens, differences were also noted. High (SJL/J, BALB/c), low (DBA/ 2, AKR) and intermediate responders were observed; these differences were not abolished by adsorption of the duplex to MBSA. This pattern of immune response is distinct both from that observed with two other synthetic <b>polyribonucleotide</b> double helices [poly(A). poly(U) and poly(I). poly(C) ] and with single stranded DNA. The anti-poly(G). poly(C) activity was localized in the 7 S region, whether the sera came from high or low responders, from mice immunized with or without a carrier, after one or several injections. In contrast with anti-poly(A). poly(U) sera which do not react with poly(G). poly(C), anti-poly(G). poly(C) exhibited poly(A). poly(U) binding activity; no clear relationship between the two activities, however, could be demonstrated. Thus a series of immunological properties differentiates poly(G). poly(C) not only from the natural polydeoxyribonucleotide single stranded DNA, but also, and more unexpectedly, from two other double stranded <b>polyribonucleotide</b> complexes. These observations suggest that the mechanism controlling the antibody response to poly(G). poly(C) differs from that regulating poly(A). poly(U) and/or poly(I). poly(C), and are to be connected {{with the fact that the}} anti-poly(G). poly(C) antibodies occurring in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus did not correlate with the antibody activities directed toward the other duplexes...|$|E

This is the first report {{on the use of the}} DeVoe theory to calculate VCD, oriented VCD, IR absorption, and IR linear dichroism (LD) spectra of double- and triple-stranded polyribonucleotides. Results are reported for DeVoe theory calculations—within the base-stretching 1750 – 1550 cm− 1 spectral region—on several proposed multistranded <b>polyribonucleotide</b> geometries. The calculated spectra obtained from these proposed geometries are compared with previously reported measured and calculated VCD and IR spectral results. Base-base hydrogen-bonding effects on the frequencies and magnitudes of the base carbonyl stretching modes are explicitly considered. The good agreements found between calculated and measured spectra are proposed to be further evidence of the usefulness of the DeVoe theory in drawing three-dimensional structural conclusions from measured <b>polyribonucleotide</b> VCD and IR spectra...|$|E

Mice were neonatally thymectomized or neonatally thymectomized and subsequently irradiated to suppress's their immune reactivity. In such animals PIC retained its ability to inhibit the growth of B 16 melanoma, in the face of profound leukopenia and lymphopenia, suggesting that its antimelanoma effect is probably not mediated by augmentation of the host's immune antitumor response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTreatment of rat thymus cell {{suspensions}} with dexamethasone {{resulted in}} inhibition of engaged RNA polymerase A, without {{significant change in}} free pool activity. Studies with the re-initiation inhibitor, rifamycin AF/ 0 – 13, and measurements of numbers of RNA polymerase A molecules and of elongation rates showed that the inhibition of pre-rRNA synthesis resulted from a decrease in elongation rate. This effect was selectively abolished by mild proteolysis of nuclei. It is concluded that glucocorticoid treatment of rat thymus cells suppresses 45 S rRNA synthesis primarily by decreasing the <b>polyribonucleotide</b> elongation rate, rather than by effecting a change in enzyme redistribution or concentration...|$|E

40|$|The {{backscattered}} vibrational Raman {{optical activity}} (ROA) spectra of three single-stranded <b>polyribonucleotides,</b> poly(rA), poly(rC), and poly(rU), together with two double-stranded <b>polyribonucleotides,</b> poly(rA) · poly(rU) and poly(rG) ·poly(rC), which both adopt A-type double helices, {{are reported in}} buffered H 2 O and D 2 O solutions between ∼ 650 and 1750 cm- 1. The ROA spectra are subdivided into three distinct regions that contain information on different stereochemical elements of nucleic acid structure. Between ∼ 1550 and 1750 cm- 1, ROA is generated through coupling of the vibrational coordinates on adjacent stacked bases that are chirally disposed. Large differences are observed between the spectra recorded in H 2 O and D 2 O in this region. Between ∼ 1200 and 1550 cm- 1, vibrational coordinates in the sugar and base rings couple in the normal modes to produce ROA signals that reflect the mutual orientation of these two rings and also the conformation of the sugar ring itself. Between ∼ 950 and 1150 cm- 1, a base-independent ROA triplet is observed that is characteristic of the particular sugar ring and sugar−phosphate backbone conformation present in A-type helices.

40|$|Fluorescent in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) using rRNA-specific oligonucleotide probes {{has emerged}} as a popular technique for identifying individual microbial cells. In natural samples, however, the signal derived from fluor-labeled oligonucleotide probes often is undetectable above background fluorescence in many cells. To circumvent this difficulty, we applied fluorochrome-labeled <b>polyribonucleotide</b> probes to identify and enumerate marine planktonic archaea and bacteria. The approach greatly enhanced the sensitivity and applicability of FISH with seawater samples, allowing confident identification and enumeration of planktonic cells to ocean depths of 3, 400 m. Quantitative whole-cell hybridization experiments using these probes accounted for 90 to 100 % of the total 4 �, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) -stained cells in most samples. As predicted in a previous study (R. Massana, A. E. Murray, C. M. Preston, and E. F. DeLong, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63 : 50 – 56, 1997), group I and II marine archaea predominate in different zones in the water column, with maximal cell densities of 10 5 /ml. The high cell densities of archaea, extending from surface waters to abyssal depths, suggest that they represent a large and significant fraction of the total picoplankton biomass in coastal ocean waters. The data also show {{that the vast majority of}} planktonic prokaryotes contain significant numbers of ribosomes, rendering them easily detectable with <b>polyribonucleotide</b> probes.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported on the}} structure-activity relationships of polyribonucleo-tides as inhibitors of murine leukemia virus replication in cultured cells. These studies raised {{the possibility that the}} active form of otherwise single-stranded polyribonucleo-tides may be a multistranded structure. We have now compared the inhibitory potencies of double- and triple-stranded complexes of poly(adenylic acid) and poly(uridylic acid) with those of single-stranded poly(ademylic acid) and poly(uridylic acid). We find that poly(adenylic acid). poly(uridylic acid) and poly(adenylic acid). 2 poly(uridylic acid) are considerably less potent than uncomplexed poly(adenylic acid) and poly(uridylic acid). These results suggest that the inhibitory potential of polyribomucleotides does not reside in a multistranded structure but in a single-stranded molecule. These observations are consistent with the motion that the inhibition of RNA tumor virus replication by single-stranded polyribomucleotides {{is more likely to be}} due to their effect on reverse tramscrip-tion than on interferon induction. We {{have previously}} reported the inhibi-tion of murime leukemia virus synthesis in cultured cells by several polyribonucleo-tides (1 - 3). The results of these studies suggested that (a) purime polyribonucleo-tides may in general be more potent than pyrimidine <b>polyribonucleotides</b> and (b) <b>polyribonucleotides</b> containing a ketoa-mimo function may be more potent than polyribomucleotides lacking this function.
