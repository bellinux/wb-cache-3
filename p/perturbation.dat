5|$|Dirac's second-order <b>perturbation</b> {{theory can}} involve virtual photons, {{transient}} intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order <b>perturbation</b> calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E

40|$|We study cosmological <b>perturbations</b> in a brane-world {{scenario}} {{where the}} matter fields {{live on a}} four-dimensional brane and gravity propagates in the five-dimensional bulk. We present the equations of motion in an arbitrary gauge for metric <b>perturbations</b> in the bulk and matter <b>perturbations</b> on the brane. Gauge-invariant <b>perturbations</b> are then constructed corresponding to <b>perturbations</b> in longitudinal and Gaussian normal gauges. Longitudinal gauge metric <b>perturbations</b> may be directly derived from three master variables (separately describing scalar, vector and tensor metric <b>perturbations)</b> which obey five-dimensional wave-equations.

40|$|Curvature <b>perturbations</b> {{generated}} {{after the}} end of inflation are estimated for a generic multi-field inflationary potential. The curvature <b>perturbations</b> are generated by conversion of inflationary isocurvature <b>perturbations,</b> similar to curvaton and inhomogeneous reheating scenarios. During inflation, the trajectory along which the fields are rolling down will fluctuate. When inflation ends, the fields enter the oscillatory phase along different directions {{in different parts of the}} universe. Different oscillatory trajectories can have different effective equations of state and reheating rates, so that different parts of the universe will evolve differently. This translates the isocurvature <b>perturbations</b> into the curvature <b>perturbations.</b> If all light fields make similar contributions to the potential energy, the postinflationary curvature <b>perturbations</b> are much smaller than the standard inflationary curvature <b>perturbations.</b> But if different light fields make very different contributions to the potential energy, the postinflationary curvature <b>perturbations</b> can exceed the inflationary <b>perturbations.</b> The characteristic feature of postinflationary <b>perturbations</b> is non-Gaussianity ∼± 1.

We find that the sound speed of the tensor <b>perturbations</b> is directly related not to the auto-bispectrum of the tensor <b>perturbations</b> but to the cross-bispectrum of the primordial <b>perturbations,</b> especially, the scalar-tensor-tensor bispectrum. This result is in sharp contrast with the case of the scalar (curvature) <b>perturbations,</b> where their reduced sound speed enhances their auto-bispectrum.

40|$|We {{give new}} {{constraints}} on small-scale non-Gaussianity of primordial curvature <b>perturbations</b> {{by the use}} of anisotropies in acoustic reheating. Mixing of local thermal or local kinetic equilibrium systems with different temperatures yields a locally averaged temperature rise, which is proportional to the square of temperature <b>perturbations</b> damping in the photon diffusion scale. Such secondary temperature <b>perturbations</b> are indistinguishable from the standard temperature <b>perturbations</b> linearly coming from primordial curvature <b>perturbations</b> and hence should be subdominant compared to the standard ones. We show that small-scale higher order correlation functions (connected non-Gaussian and disconnected Gaussian parts) of primordial curvature <b>perturbations</b> can be probed by investigating auto power spectrum of the generated secondary <b>perturbations</b> and the cross power spectrum with the standard <b>perturbations.</b> This is simply because these power spectra come from higher order correlation functions of primordial curvature <b>perturbations</b> with non-linear parameters such as f_ NL and τ_ NL since secondary temperature <b>perturbations</b> are second order effects. Thus, the observational results l(l+ 1) C^TT_l≃ 6 × 10 ^- 10 at large scales give a robust and universal upper bound on small-scale non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature <b>perturbations.</b> Comment: 17 pages, 3 figures, prepared for submission to JCA...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{processes}} of quantum squeezing and decoherence of density <b>perturbations</b> produced during a slowly contracting ekpyrotic phase in which entropic <b>perturbations</b> are converted to curvature <b>perturbations</b> before the bounce to an expanding phase. During the generation phase, the entropic fluctuations evolve into a highly squeezed quantum state, analogous {{to the evolution of}} inflationary <b>perturbations.</b> Subsequently, during the conversion phase, quantum coherence is lost very efficiently due to the interactions of entropy and adiabatic modes. Moreover, while decoherence occurs, the adiabatic curvature <b>perturbations</b> inherit their semi-classicality from the entropic <b>perturbations.</b> Our results confirm that, just as for inflation, an ekpyrotic phase can generate nearly scale-invariant curvature <b>perturbations</b> which may be treated as a statistical ensemble of classical density <b>perturbations,</b> in agreement with observations of the cosmic background radiation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of scalar curvature <b>perturbations</b> in a brane-world inflation model in a 5 D Anti-de Sitter spacetime. The inflaton <b>perturbations</b> are confined to a 4 D brane but they are coupled to the 5 D bulk metric <b>perturbations.</b> We numerically solve full coupled equations for the inflaton <b>perturbations</b> and the 5 D metric <b>perturbations</b> using Hawkins-Lidsey inflationary model. At an initial time, {{we assume that the}} bulk is unperturbed. We find that the inflaton <b>perturbations</b> at high energies are strongly coupled to the bulk metric <b>perturbations</b> even on subhorizon scales, leading to the suppression of the amplitude of the comoving curvature <b>perturbations</b> at a horizon crossing. This indicates that the linear <b>perturbations</b> of the inflaton field does not obey the usual 4 D Klein-Gordon equation due to the coupling to 5 D gravitational field on small scales and it is required to quantise the coupled brane-bulk system in a consistent way in order to calculate the spectrum of the scalar <b>perturbations</b> in a brane-world inflation.

40|$|We study {{dynamics}} of entropy <b>perturbations</b> in the two-field assisted dark energy model. Based on the scenario of assisted dark energy, {{in which one}} scalar field is subdominant compared with {{the other in the}} early epoch, we show that the entropy <b>perturbations</b> in this two-field system tend to be constant on large scales in the early epoch and hence survive until the present era for a generic evolution of both fields during the radiation and matter eras. This behaviour of the entropy <b>perturbations</b> is preserved even when the fields are coupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the subdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy <b>perturbations</b> can significantly influence the {{dynamics of}} density <b>perturbations</b> in the universe. Assuming correlations between the entropy and curvature <b>perturbations,</b> the entropy <b>perturbations</b> can enhance the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect if the signs of the contributions from entropy <b>perturbations</b> and curvature <b>perturbations</b> are opposite after the matter era, otherwise the ISW contribution is suppressed. For canonical scalar field the effect of entropy <b>perturbations</b> on ISW effect is small because the initial value of the entropy <b>perturbations</b> estimated during inflation cannot be sufficiently large. However, in the case of k-essence, the initial value of the entropy <b>perturbations</b> can be large enough to affect the ISW effect to leave a significant imprint on the CMB power spectrum.
