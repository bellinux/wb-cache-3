5|$|Joan Elizabeth Curran (26 February 1916 â€“ 10 February 1999) was a Welsh {{scientist}} who played {{important roles in}} the development of radar and the atomic bomb during the Second World War. She invented chaff, a radar countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked {{on the development of the}} <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> and the electromagnetic isotope separation process for the atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{had felt}} {{relatively}} safe from timed artillery fire {{because they thought}} that the bad weather prevented the Allies from observing their movements accurately. When the Americans employed the POZIT <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> their artillery fire was far more devastating, decimating German troops caught in the open, causing up to 20% losses. The effectiveness of the new fused shells exploding in mid-air stirred some German soldiers to refuse orders {{to move out of}} their bunkers during an artillery attack. U.S. General George S. Patton said that the introduction of the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> required a full revision of the tactics of land warfare.|$|E

25|$|Guidance was {{provided}} during midcourse flight by radio command, with an operator in the launching aircraft transmitting corrections to the missile. Terminal guidance used active radar homing, {{with a small}} radar set fitted in {{the nose of the}} missile, with the missile's warhead being detonated by a <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> a backup impact fuze also being fitted.|$|E
25|$|Submerged Signal Ejector {{cartridges}} (SSE), limpet mines, short-range anti-submarine rockets (with HE {{and practice}} warheads), the Indian Sea Mine {{which can be}} deployed against both ships and submarines. The DRDO also designed short- and medium-range ECM rockets which deploy chaff to decoy away anti-ship homing missiles. In a similar vein, they also developed a 3 in (76.2mm) PFHE shell, pre-fragmented and with a <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> for use against anti-ship missiles and other targets, by the Navy. All these items are in production.|$|E
25|$|Rosenberg {{provided}} {{thousands of}} classified reports from Emerson Radio, including a complete <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> an upgraded model {{of which was}} used to shoot down Gary Powers' U-2 in 1960. Under Feklisov's administration, Rosenberg recruited sympathetic individuals into NKVD service, including Joel Barr, Alfred Sarant, William Perl and Morton Sobell. Perl supplied Feklisov, under Rosenberg's direction, with thousands of documents from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, including {{a complete set of}} design and production drawings for Lockheed's P-80 Shooting Star, the first U.S. jet plane. Feklisov learned through Rosenberg that Ethel's brother David Greenglass was working on the top-secret Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory; he directed Julius to recruit Greenglass.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes called Kinetic Kill technology, the THAAD missile destroys {{missiles}} by {{colliding with}} them, using hit-to-kill technology, like the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3 (although the PAC-3 {{also contains a}} small explosive warhead). This is unlike the Patriot PAC-2 which carried only an explosive warhead detonated using a <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> Although the actual figures are classified, THAAD missiles have an estimated range of 125 miles (200km), and can reach an altitude of 93 miles (150km). A THAAD battery consists of at least six launcher vehicles, each equipped with eight missiles, with two mobile tactical operations centers (TOCs) and the AN/TPY-2 ground-based radar (GBR); the U.S. Army plans to field at least six THAAD batteries, at a purchase cost of $800 million per battery. By September 2018 MDA plans to deliver 52 more interceptors to the Army.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The V-2 {{lacked a}} <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> {{so it could}} not be set for air burst; it buried itself in the target area before or just as the warhead detonated. This reduced its effectiveness. Furthermore, its early {{guidance}} systems were too primitive to hit specific targets and its costs were approximately equivalent to four-engined bombers, which were more accurate (though only in a relative sense), had longer ranges, carried many more warheads, and were reusable. In comparison, in one 24-hour period during Operation Hurricane, the RAF dropped over 10,000 long tons of bombs on Brunswick and Duisburg, roughly equivalent to the amount of explosives that could be delivered by 10,000 V-2 rockets. Moreover, it diverted resources from other, more effective programs. That said, the limiting factor for German aviation after 1941 was always the availability of high test aviation gas, not planes or pilots, so criticisms of the V-1 and V-2 programs that compare their cost to hypothetical increases in fighter or bomber production are misguided. Nevertheless, the weapon had a considerable psychological effect because, unlike bombing planes or the V-1 Flying Bomb (which made a characteristic buzzing sound), the V-2 travelled faster than the speed of sound and gave no warning before impact. There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot and crew casualties.|$|E

25|$|According to the Israeli military, 38 shells were fired, {{two-thirds of}} them {{equipped}} with <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses,</b> an anti-personnel mechanism that causes the weapon to explode above the ground. The firing on the UN compound lasted 17 minutes.|$|R

He led a team that built a prototype Height and Range ...|$|E
500|$|In 1941, {{after the}} start of World War II, Brode went to work at Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, where he helped develop the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> In 1943, he joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where was {{appointed}} the leader of the E-3 Fusing Group. This group consisted of 14 civilians, 12 military officers and 37 enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment. Its task was to develop a fuse that would detonate an atomic bomb at a specified height above the ground.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of the California Institute of Technology, where he earned his doctorate in 1924, Brode attended Oxford University on [...] a Rhodes Scholarship and the University of GÃ¶ttingen on a National Research Council Fellowship. During World War II, Brode worked at Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, where he helped develop the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> {{and then as a}} group leader at the Los Alamos Laboratory. In 1950 he was one of a dozen prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, Dr. Izenour {{worked on}} antisubmarine warfare and {{countermeasures}} for <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses</b> at a government lab in Long Island, New York. His son Steven Izenour, a world-renowned architect and artist, {{was born in}} New Haven in July 1940.|$|R
50|$|Van Allen {{joined the}} Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of Johns Hopkins University in Silver Spring, Maryland, at its founding, to {{continue}} his work on <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses.</b> He worked on improving the ruggedness of vacuum tubes subject to the forces from a gun battery.|$|R
50|$|Both testimonies {{state that}} part of the {{problems}} stem from its original design as an anti-aircraft system. Patriot was designed with <b>proximity</b> <b>fused</b> warheads, which are designed to explode immediately prior to hitting a target spraying shrapnel out in a fan in front of the missile, either destroying or disabling the target. These missiles were fired at the target's center of mass. With aircraft this was fine, but considering the much higher speeds of TBMs, as well as the location of the warhead (usually in the nose), Patriot would most often hit closer to the tail of the Scud due to the delay present in the <b>proximity</b> <b>fused</b> warhead, thus not destroying the TBM's warhead and allowing it to fall to earth.|$|R
500|$|As a {{military}} {{and public policy}} advisor, Oppenheimer was a technocratic leader in {{a shift in the}} interactions between science and the military and the emergence of [...] "Big Science". During World WarII, scientists became involved in military research to an unprecedented degree. Because of the threat fascism posed to Western civilization, they volunteered in great numbers both for technological and organizational assistance to the Allied effort, resulting in such powerful tools as radar, the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> and operations research. As a cultured, intellectual, theoretical physicist who became a disciplined military organizer, Oppenheimer represented the shift away from the idea that scientists had their [...] "head in the clouds" [...] and that knowledge on such previously esoteric subjects as the composition of the atomic nucleus had no [...] "real-world" [...] applications.|$|E
500|$|Instead of {{returning}} to the Cavendish, the team moved to Exeter, where Dee and three others worked on developing rockets as anti-aircraft weapons, while Strothers and Curran joined a group under John Coles working {{on the development of}} the <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse.</b> Strothers was based at Leeson House and Durnford School. She and Curran developed a workable fuse, which was codenamed VT, an acronym of [...] "Variable Time fuze". The system was a small, short-range, Doppler radar that used a clever circuit. However, Britain lacked the capacity to mass-produce the fuze, so the design was shown to the United States by the Tizard Mission in late 1940. The Americans perfected and mass-produced the fuse. In due course, these proximity fuses arrived in the United Kingdom, where they played an important part in the defence of the kingdom against the V-1 flying bomb.|$|E
500|$|In August 1940, Cockcroft {{travelled}} to the United States {{as part of}} the Tizard Mission. Because Britain {{had developed}} many new technologies but lacked the industrial capacity to fully exploit them, it was decided to share them with the United States, although that nation was not yet at war. [...] The information provided by the Tizard Mission contained some of the greatest scientific advances made during the war. The shared technology included radar technologies, in particular the greatly improved cavity magnetron designed by Oliphant's group at Birmingham, which the American historian James Phinney Baxter III described as [...] "the most valuable cargo ever brought to our shores", the design for the <b>Proximity</b> <b>fuse,</b> details of Frank Whittle's jet engine and the Frisch-Peierls memorandum describing the feasibility of an atomic bomb. Though these may be considered the most significant, many other items were also transported, including designs for rockets, superchargers, gunsights and submarine detection devices. He returned to Britain in December 1940.|$|E

50|$|Hitler was technologically {{oriented}} {{and promoted}} {{a series of}} new secret weapons, such as the jet plane, the jet-powered missile (V-1), the rocket-powered missile (V-2), and vastly improved submarines. However he failed to support development of nuclear weapons or <b>proximity</b> <b>fuses,</b> and trailed the Allies in radar. He failed {{to take advantage of}} the German lead in jet planes.|$|R
500|$|Like other U.S. States, Minnesota {{made its}} {{contributions}} to the effort of World War II in wartime manufacturing and other areas. The United States Navy contracted with Cargill to build ships after seeing their success in building ships and barges used to haul grain. Cargill built facilities in Savage, Minnesota on the south bank of the Minnesota River and turned out 18 refueling ships and four towboats in four years. [...] After the war, the Cargill facilities became a major grain shipping terminal. Honeywell built airplane control systems and periscope sights for submarines, and also developed a <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> for anti-aircraft shells. [...] The United States government built the Twin Cities Ordnance Plant to produce munitions. [...] The plant employed 8,500 workers in 1941, and since there was a shortage of male workers during the war, {{more than half of}} the workers at the munitions plant were women. [...] The plant also employed nearly 1000 African American workers, as President Roosevelt had issued an executive order forbidding racial discrimination in defense industries. [...] Native American workers also found opportunities due to workforce shortages in wartime.|$|E
500|$|The Second World War sparked new {{developments}} in cannon technology. Among them were sabot rounds, hollow-charge projectiles, and proximity fuses, all of which increased the effectiveness of cannon against specific target. The <b>proximity</b> <b>fuse</b> emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944. Used to great effect in anti-aircraft projectiles, proximity fuses were fielded in both the European and Pacific Theatres of Operations; they were particularly useful against V-1 flying bombs and kamikaze planes. Although widely used in naval warfare, and in anti-air guns, both the British and Americans feared unexploded proximity fuses would be reverse engineered leading to them limiting its use in continental battles. During the Battle of the Bulge, however, the fuses {{became known as the}} American artillery's [...] "Christmas present" [...] for the German army because of their effectiveness against German personnel in the open, when they frequently dispersed attacks. Anti-tank guns were also tremendously improved during the war: in 1939, the British used primarily 2 pounder and 6 pounder guns. By the end of the war, 17 pounders had proven much more effective against German tanks, and 32 pounders had entered development. Meanwhile, German tanks were continuously upgraded with better main guns, in addition to other improvements. For example, the Panzer III was originally designed with a 37mm gun, but was mass-produced with a 50mm cannon. To counter the threat of the Russian T-34s, another, more powerful 50mm gun was introduced, only to give way to a larger 75mm cannon, which was in a fixed mount as the StuG III, the most-produced German World War II armoured fighting vehicle of any type. Despite the improved guns, production of the Panzer III was ended in 1943, as the tank still could not match the T-34, and was replaced by the Panzer IV and Panther tanks. In 1944, the 8.8cm KwK 43 and many variations, entered service with the Wehrmacht, and was used as both a tank main gun, and as the PaK 43 anti-tank gun. One of the most powerful guns to see service in World War II, it was capable of destroying any Allied tank at very long ranges.|$|E
500|$|The Second World War sparked new {{developments}} in cannon technology. Among them were sabot rounds, hollow-charge projectiles, and proximity fuses, {{all of which were}} marginally significant. The World War II-era [...] "legend" [...] of the dreaded German 88 mm gun was launched during the Battle of Arras on May 21, 1940 when Generalmajor Erwin Rommel first ordered their use against Allied armor, devastating British Matilda II tanks, a well-armored design.

Following the 88 mm FlaK 36's initial anti-tank success in 1940 and through the German forces' battles in North Africa and the Soviet Union, in 1944, its improved tank-mounted version, the 8.8cm KwK 43,â€”and its multiple variationsâ€”entered service, used by the Wehrmacht, and was adapted to be both a tank's main gun, and the PaK 43 anti-tank gun. One of the most powerful guns to see service in World War II, it was capable of destroying any Allied tank at very long ranges.|$|E
