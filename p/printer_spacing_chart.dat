40|$|Abstract. We study Lipschitz differentiability spaces, a {{class of}} metric measure spaces {{introduced}} by Cheeger in [8]. We show that if an Ahlfors regular Lipschitz differentiability <b>space</b> has <b>charts</b> of maximal dimension, then, at almost every point, all its tangents are uniformly rectifiable. In particular, at almost every point, such a space admits a tangent that is isometric to a finite-dimensional Banach space. In contrast, we also show that if an Ahlfors regular Lipschitz differentiability <b>space</b> has <b>charts</b> of non-maximal dimension, then these charts are strongly unrectifiable {{in the sense of}} Ambrosio-Kirchheim. 1...|$|R
40|$|Extending the Proca Lagrangian of {{a massive}} {{complex-valued}} vector field by self-interaction potential, we construct a large class of spherically symmetric solutions in flat Minkowski background {{as well as in}} the self-gravitating case.

A special emphasis is set to the domain of existence of the solutions in relation with the coupling constants of the potential and to the critical phenomena limiting this domain.

40|$|We {{study the}} Hamiltonian {{dynamics}} {{for a system}} of two colliding point particles coupled to (2 + 1) -dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant by anchoring {{the dynamics of the}} system to its spatial infinity. We reduce the Chern-Simons formulation of the gravitational action, finding the reduced Hamiltonian for three special cases of the particle masses, in a phase <b>space</b> <b>chart</b> coordinatised by the geodesic distance between the two particles and its conjugate momentum. The dimension of the reduced phase space is two. At the threshold of black hole formation, the black hole mass depends linearly on the momentum, in agreement with previous analysis in a holonomy-based phase <b>space</b> <b>chart.</b> We use the reduced action to compute the semiclassical probability amplitude of two particles to tunnel out of the black hole, finding that the imaginary part of the action is equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the hole. We also study the form that conformal field theory (CFT) correlation functions take in coset spaces of (2, C). We realise the (2, C) twistor space T in two distinct but equivalent ways, deriving some important facts about this space, and we also give one representation of another coset space B. We examine the form of CFT correlation functions in T, B and two other related spaces using techniques from representation theory and make a number of comments on the twistor transform for T...|$|R

5000|$|MacPublisher {{builds a}} page {{differently}} than PageMaker and ReadySetGo do; instead {{of creating an}} actual image of the page with all the text and graphics, MacPublisher created a page mockup that contains only rectangles that represent the location and size of text and graphic elements, and stored the elements as special text and picture files that you edit separately from the page layout. MacPublisher rebuilds a page whenever it changes. The company says it took this approach to allow creation of master pages, repeating elements, and predefined [...] "canned" [...] page layouts; to help prevent data loss on machines with limited memory (MacPublisher can run with as little as 128K RAM); and to facilitate the programming for the automatic table of contents and automatic page jump ("continued on page x") features. Since the page layout is independent {{of the text and}} graphic content, you can easily create publication formats you can reuse as you need them. This reusable formats feature can be especially useful for creating catalogs or other publications in which you want the format to remain the same but in which you need to update or replace information on a regular basis. MacPublisher features either automatic or manual kerning to correct <b>printer</b> <b>spacing</b> idiosyncrasies.|$|R
