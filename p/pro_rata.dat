5|$|On 26 March 2012, the Public Service Division of the Prime Minister's Office {{announced}} that the fixed component of the salary of a political appointment holder would be 13 months {{of his or her}} monthly salary. For 2011, the annual variable component of the salary would be 1.25 months plus $250, while the national bonus would be 2.625 months though appointment holders would receive a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> amount of 1.618 months' pay as the new salaries took effect from 21 May 2011 when the Cabinet was appointed following the general election. The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2–3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income growth for the lowest 20th percentile of citizens, 3–5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens. Each appointment holder's performance bonus would be determined by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Though uninvolved {{in foreign}} affairs, and {{therefore}} obliged to follow Britain's lead, the colony enthusiastically supported the mother country during the Second World War, symbolically affirming the British {{declaration of war}} before {{any other part of}} the Empire. During the ensuing conflict over 26,100 Southern Rhodesians of all races served in the armed forces, <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> to white population a higher contribution of manpower than any other British colony or dominion, and more than the UK itself. George VI knighted Huggins in 1941, and, with the war still ongoing, Britain made overtures towards dominion status. Huggins dismissed this, saying it was imperative to win the war first. The idea of dominionship was raised again in 1952, but Salisbury once more did not pursue it, instead following the results of a referendum held early the next April to enter an initially semi-independent Federation with the directly administered British colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.|$|E

25|$|Securitizations {{are often}} {{structured}} as a sequential pay bond, {{paid off in}} a sequential manner based on maturity. This means that the first tranche, which may have a one-year average life, will receive all principal payments until it is retired; then the second tranche begins to receive principal, and so forth. <b>Pro</b> <b>rata</b> bond structures pay each tranche a proportionate share of principal throughout {{the life of the}} security.|$|E
25|$|Quebec has {{the highest}} {{proportion}} of children going to private schools in North America. The phenomenon is not restricted to the well-to-do. Many middle class, lower middle class and even working class families scrimp and save {{to send their children}} to private schools. The government of Quebec gives a <b>Pro</b> <b>rata</b> subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2015 {{survey by}} Sporting Intelligence and ESPN The Magazine, the average IPL salary when pro-rated is 4.33 million per year, {{the second highest}} among all sport leagues in the world.

25|$|Hudspeth County {{was created}} by the Legislature in 1917 from {{adjacent}} El Paso County. The legislation appointed a temporary county Commissioners Court charged with organizing the county government including the performance of the tedious and time-consuming requirements to do so such as performing a census estimate, defining election precinct and district boundaries for office holders, conducting elections for county offices, reconciling tax rolls with El Paso County, and settling the new county's <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> share of debt previously incurred by El Paso County.|$|E

The program administrator maintains a REC account for program participants to track the production, sale, transfer, purchase, and retirement of RECs. Credits can be banked for three years, and all renewable additions have a minimum of 10 years of credits to recover over-market costs. An administrative penalty of $50 per MWh has been established for providers that do not meet the RPS requirements.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{established}} a Nuclear Waste Fund composed of fees levied against electric utilities {{to pay for}} the costs of constructing and operating a permanent repository, and set the fee at one mill per kilowatt-hour of nuclear electricity generated. Utilities were charged a one-time fee for storage of spent fuel created before enactment of the law. Nuclear waste from defense activities was exempted from most provisions of the Act, which required that if military waste were put into a civilian repository, the government would pay its <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> share of the cost of development, construction and operation of the repository. The Act authorized impact assistance payments to states or Indian tribes to offset any costs resulting from location of a waste facility within their borders.|$|E
25|$|Pass-through {{securities}} {{are issued}} by a trust and allocate the cash {{flows from the}} underlying pool to the securities holders on a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> basis. A trust that issues pass-through certificates is taxed under the grantor trust rules of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these rules, the holder of a pass-through certificate is taxed as a direct owner of {{the portion of the}} trust allocatable to the certificate. In order for the issuer to be recognized as a trust for tax purposes, there can be no significant power under the trust agreement to change the composition of the asset pool or otherwise to reinvest payments received, and the trust must have, with limited exceptions, only a single class of ownership interests.|$|E
25|$|Order {{method of}} cost-finding : When the order is the {{tangible}} basis {{upon which the}} elements of cost are charged, compiled, and determined, the order method of cost-finding is generally used. In other words, under such conditions the material costs, labor costs, and a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> share of the factory overhead are all charged to definite factory orders, and the elements of material, labor, and overhead costs are compiled so that the total factory cost of each individual order may be determined. If a number of units are manufactured under the definite factory order, the unit article cost may be determined by dividing the total factory cost by the total quantity manufactured or produced. Definite factory orders may be issued for the manufacture {{of a number of}} units, for a single unit, or for the manufacture of certain parts of a unit.|$|E
25|$|Fund {{governance}} {{refers to}} a system of checks and balances and work performed by the governing body (board) of an investment fund to ensure that the fund is operated {{in the best interests of}} the fund and its investors. The objective of fund governance is to uphold the regulatory principles commonly known as the four pillars of investor protection that are typically promulgated through the investment fund regulation applicable in the jurisdiction of the fund. These principles vary by jurisdiction and in the US, the 1940 Act generally ensure that: (i) The investment fund will be managed in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives, (ii) The assets of the investment fund will be kept safe, (iii) When investors redeem they will get their <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> share of the investment fund’s assets, (iv) The investment fund will be managed for the benefit of the fund’s shareholders and not its service providers.|$|E
25|$|Events {{moved so}} quickly that {{additional}} capital was needed, and Rockefeller felt that the Cleveland banks could not {{be counted on to}} keep his loan requests confidential. On January 2, 1872, Standard Oil issued 4,000 new shares of stock {{in the form of a}} dividend. Stock was issued on a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> basis, which gave Stone another 200 shares. Later that same day, another issue of stock was made. This constituted 11,000 shares, of which 3,000 were given to John D. Rockefeller, 1,400 to Henry Flagler, 4,000 to the owners of Clark, Payne and Company (one of the largest oil refineries in Cleveland), 700 to refiner Jabez A. Bostwick, 200 to refiner Joseph Stanley, and 500 to Peter Watson (who by now was the president of the SIC). Another 1,200 shares were given to John D. Rockefeller to retain as a reserve. On January 2, 1872, a third new issue of 10,000 shares occurred, and was given to Rockefeller to hold in reserve. Although these new issues had diluted Stone's investment to just 2 percent of Standard Oil's stock, it was enough to give him a strong financial interest in the company and to allow John D. Rockefeller to tighten his influence over railroads Stone directed.|$|E
25|$|The Legislature dutifully {{complied}} with the court's recommendation and carved Presidio County into several new ones including Jeff Davis in 1887. The newly created counties, however, were immediately saddled with their <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> share of their parent county's debt. Furthermore, Presidio County insisted that the new counties were responsible for paying for {{their share of the}} debt on its new Presidio County Courthouse. To add insult to injury, the new Jeff Davis County found the Fort Davis courthouse, which had sat dormant for two years since the removal of the previous county seat to Marfa, to be a shell of its former self with the building's fixtures and furniture also carried off along with its former official records. The courthouse retained its iron jail cells, but remained as inadequately small and in need of reparation as it had before. By 1910, the need for a new courthouse had become eminent. Numerous repairs, including repeated patching of the roof, had been regularly necessary. Two windows, heavily barred, had been added to the west wall of the upper cell housing women and less threatening prisoners for light and ventilation. Eventually jail facilities became so intolerable that all prisoners required transport to the Presidio County jail for detention, and the building as a whole was seen as being beyond further repair. After completion of construction on the replacement courthouse and the new separate jail building in 1911, the steel cell from the original courthouse was salvaged for use in the new jail, while dirt from the demolition of the old adobe courthouse was used for leveling the grounds of the new courthouse and jail yard.|$|E

500|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Mark R. Freeman, Assistant to the Solicitor General. [...] Freeman argued that Congress had placed a cap on IDEAA contract funds beginning in 1994, and the BIA {{did not have the}} authority to spend more than the capped amount on all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] Due to the lack of sufficient funding, the Secretary of the Interior has distributed the available funds on a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> basis among all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] The United States also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits payments unless those payments have been appropriated or authorized by Congress. [...] Freeman argued that the government's liability does not extend past {{the amount of money that}} Congress has appropriated for all of the contracts. [...] The government also stated that the contract did not create a binding promise to pay the tribes the full amount of the contract.|$|E

2500|$|The word/acronym CEGEP {{can only}} legally {{be used to}} {{describe}} the state-run post-secondary (post-grade 11) schools, where tuition is free, but in fact very little attention is paid to this. The 26 private institutions which offer a post-secondary program recognized by the Quebec Ministry of Education receive a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> subsidy for each of their 15,000 students, and grant the same diplomas as the public colleges. [...] Unlike the state-run colleges, the private post-secondary schools do not have to combine pre-university and vocational programs in one institution.

2500|$|Pay to play is a {{provision}} in a corporation's charter documents (usually inserted {{as part of a}} preferred stock financing) that requires stockholders to participate in subsequent stock offerings in order to benefit from certain antidilution protections. If the stockholder does not purchase his or her <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> share in the subsequent offering, then the stockholder loses the benefit(s) of the antidilution provisions. In extreme cases, investors who do not participate in subsequent rounds must convert to common stock, thereby losing the protective provisions of the preferred stock. This approach minimizes the fears of major investors that small or minority investors will benefit by having the major investors continue providing needed equity, particularly in troubled economic circumstances for the company. It is considered a [...] "harsh" [...] provision that is usually only inserted when one party has a strong bargaining position.|$|E
2500|$|A {{side pocket}} is a {{mechanism}} whereby a fund compartmentalizes assets that are relatively illiquid or difficult to value reliably. When an investment is side-pocketed, its value is calculated {{separately from the}} value of the fund’s main portfolio. Because side pockets are used to hold illiquid investments, investors do not have the standard redemption rights with respect to the side pocket investment that they do with respect to the fund’s main portfolio. Profits or losses from the investment are allocated on a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> basis only to those who are investors at the time the investment is placed into the side pocket and are not shared with new investors. Funds typically carry side pocket assets [...] "at cost" [...] for purposes of calculating management fees and reporting net asset values. This allows fund managers to avoid attempting a valuation of the underlying investments, which may not always have a readily available market value.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{changes made}} {{to the terms of}} the 1863 treaty in the {{supplemental}} treaty of 1864 have provoked ongoing controversy among Ojibwe and white historians alike. [...] The $100,000 indemnity fund was reallocated, to provide that $25,000 would be immediately distributed to the chiefs of said bands [...] "through their agent". [...] The balance of the funds were specifically earmarked for the satisfaction of specific claims for [...] "depredations committed by said Indians" [...] on Euro-American traders' goods at the Red Lake River and for [...] "exactions forcibly levied by [...] " [...] on the steamship operations on the Red River, and the remainder was to be allocated <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> in satisfaction of other claims. [...] The provision for collaborative review and settlement of these claims by an appointed commission in consultation with the chiefs of the Ojibwe bands was eliminated, with the determination of claims left entirely to the [...] "agent for said bands". [...] In effect, the revisions transferred control of the indemnity fund to the white Indian agent and assured that none of the funds would be allocated to the Indians themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the Equality Act 2010 three EU Directives, and UK Regulations, require minimum {{levels of}} equal {{treatment}} {{for people with}} part-time, fixed-term or agency work contracts, compared to people with more permanent or full-time jobs. Many people choose atypical work patterns to balance family or social commitments, but many are also in precarious work, where they lack the bargaining power to get better terms. However, the requirements for equal treatment are not uniform, and are often limited. The Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 state that a part-time worker cannot be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time worker. However (like for age) an employer may objectively justify less favourable treatment for both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover, (similar to equal pay rules) under regulation 2(4) a worker can only compare themselves to real full-time workers who work under the [...] "same type of contract" [...] doing [...] "broadly similar work", and {{are in the same}} establishment, or under a common collective agreement. In Matthews v Kent and Medway Fire Authority, the House of Lords held that even though part-time firefighters did not do administrative work, their contracts were still broadly similar to the full-time firefighters. In O'Brien v Ministry of Justice the Supreme Court also rejected that giving part-time judges no pension <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> was unlawful, and had no objective justification. Although the Ministry argued that it was legitimate to save money, and to recruit quality full-time judges with a pension, Lord Hope and Lady Hale emphasised that budgetary considerations are not relevant, and it was necessary to recruit good part-time staff also. But although rights are strong in law to counteract people being treated differently in the same workplace, part-time workers across the UK economy remain underpaid compared to full-time workers as a whole. Workplaces tend to be structurally segregated, so many jobs, often where women are working, are all part-time while better paying jobs tend to be full-time.|$|E
2500|$|Legal capital must be {{maintained}} (not distributed to shareholders, or distributed [...] "in disguise") unless a company formally reduces its legal capital. Then it can make distributions, which might be desirable if a company wishes to shrink. A private company must have a 75 per cent vote of the shareholders, and the directors must then warrant that the company will remain solvent and {{will be able to}} pay its debts. If this {{turns out to be a}} negligent statement, the director can be sued. But this means it is hard to claw back any profits from shareholders if a company does indeed go insolvent, if the director's statement appeared good at the time. If not all the directors are prepared to make a solvency statement, the company may apply to court for a decision. In public companies, a special resolution must also be passed, and a court order is necessary. The court can make a number of orders, for example that creditors should be protected with security interest. There is a general principle that shareholders must be treated equally in making capital reductions, however this does not mean that unequally situated shareholders must be treated the same. In particular, while no ordinary shareholder should lose shares disproportionately, it has been held legitimate to cancel preferential shares before others, particularly if those shares are entitled to preferential payment as a way of considering [...] "the position of the company itself as an economic entity". Economically, companies buying their own shares back from shareholders would achieve the same effect as a reduction of capital. Originally it was prohibited by the common law, but now although the general rule remains in section 658 there are two exceptions. First, a company may issue shares on terms that they may be redeemed, though only if there is express authority in the constitution of a public company, and the re-purchase can only be made from distributable profits. Second, since 1980 shares can simply be bought back from shareholders if, again this is done out of distributable profits. Crucially, the directors must also state that the company will be able to pay all its debts and continue for the next year, and shareholders must approve this by special resolution. Under the Listing Rules for public companies, shareholders must generally be given the same buy back offer, and get shares bought back <b>pro</b> <b>rata.</b> How many shares are retained by the company as treasury shares or cancelled must be reported to Companies House. From the company's perspective the legal capital is being reduced, hence the same regulation applies. From the shareholder's perspective, the company buying back some of its shares is much the same as simply paying a dividend, except for one main difference. Taxation of dividends and share buy backs tends to be different, meaning that often buy backs are popular just because they [...] "dodge" [...] the Exchequer.|$|E
