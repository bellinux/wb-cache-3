40|$|Health and {{wellness}} of users as facilitated by built environments is {{the field of}} study of USO-Built’s International Research and Design Unit 3 (IRU 3). Built-in Quality of Life includes comfort technologies, {{as well as more}} general health and vitality preserving and stimulating strategies. Technical and natural sciences join forces to design and maintain intelligent built environments that increase vital and productive years in the human life-span. Modelling of health and comfort aspects of built environments is leading towards smart concepts of mixed automated and manual environmental control. Research methodologies are mainly taken from the natural and engineering sciences. Users are viewed as individuals. Ranges in needs, aspirations and capabilities are assessed and taken into account. Effective Universal Design through implemented ambient intelligence is the ultimate goal. Sub themes include: (i) Pro-active engagement to prevent potential personal capacity losses (Safe 2 ̆ 6 amp; Secure), (ii) Enhancement 2 ̆ 6 amp; Optimization of human options leading to increased comfort and productivity (Comfort Technology), and (iii) Compensation 2 ̆ 6 amp; Assistance for declining human capacities in general designs (Needs 2 ̆ 6 amp; Capabilities).

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the widest possible range of potential risks of low-probability hydrological events is critical for sustainable adaptation to climate change. In this context, palaeohydrology and palaeoflood hydrology have demonstrated effective means to estimate the magnitude and frequency of past extremes under climate variability, as well as deterministic and probabilistic methodologies to analyse geophysical hazards. These past hydrological events may not give direct analogues for global change impacts, but many useful indicators and considerable benefits can be gained from combining research results from time periods greater than instrumented records. Three phases of palaeohydrology are proposed and a fourth phase could see significant developments using multidisciplinary research. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> for palaeohydrology demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, suggests the benefits of geomorphological research, and leads to challenges for further application of research results to management problems benefitting from a holistic approach. The nine papers in this volume, demonstrating how a range of approaches is required, are ascribed to four timescales. Although advances made have been produced in relation to particular timescales they have implications for others, and collectively they progress our understanding of hydrological extreme events research, showing that bridging timescales gives a major opportunity for palaeohydrology to contribute further to understanding global change.

40|$|Purpose of the study: To explore strengths, weaknesses, {{opportunities}} and threats affecting the {{services provided by}} inpatient geriatric consultation teams (IGCTs) in Belgian hospitals. Methods: A three-stage strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT) analysis was performed. Phase 1 : semi-structured interviews (n= 12) with IGCT members, professional caregivers of non-geriatric units and hospital managers were performed. Phase 2 : four focus groups were held to develop a <b>preliminary</b> <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis.</b> A purposive sample of stakeholders (n= 40) was recruited, balanced for hospital type, gender and language region. Phase 3 : Two additional focus groups were performed to consolidate, further interpret, link and prioritize the SWOT items. Results: Consensus on the following key strengths of IGCTs emerged, namely impact on patients/family/informal caregivers; on care processes/quality; on discharge/readmission; dissemination of geriatric culture/expertise & an interdisciplinary/holistic approach. Essential weaknesses are the shortage of resources (financial/staff/time); the solely advisory IGCT role & resistance of non-geriatric units. Opportunities include knowledge-transfer and awareness-raising; cooperation with primary/transmural care; digitalization; improved matching of patients’ needs and services; IGCT sustainability/stability and demonstrating IGCTs added value. Perceived threats include lack of recognition, and support and demotivation. The shortage of a geriatric-trained workforce and population ageing are both a weakness and threat. Conclusion: This study provided comprehensive insights into leverages and barriers for IGCT functioning and resulted in policy-, hospital- and IGCT-oriented recommendations to improve IGCTs’ effectiveness in the Belgian context. For example, establishing knowledge sharing platforms to diffuse innovations and good practices for inpatient geriatric care is essential.

40|$|Strength, weakness, opportunity, {{and threat}} (<b>SWOT)</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has been in}} use since the 1960 s {{as a tool to}} assist {{strategic}} planning in various types of enterprises including those in the construction industry. While still widely used, the approach has called for improvements to make it more helpful in strategic management. The project described in this paper aimed to study whether the process to convert a <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> into a strategic plan could be assisted with some simple rationally quantitative model, as an augmented <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis.</b> By using the mathematical approaches including the quantifying techniques, the "maximum subarray" method, and fuzzy mathematics, one or more heuristic rules (HRs) are derived from a <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis.</b> These HRs bring into focus the most influential factors concerning a strategic planning situation, and thus inform strategic analysts where particular consideration should be given. A case study conducted in collaboration with a Chinese international construction company showed that the new SWOT approach is more helpful to strategic planners.

40|$|Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (<b>SWOT)</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tools for strategic planning. The traditional method of conducting <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> does not prioritize and is likely to hold subjective views that may result in an improper strategic action. Accordingly, this research exploits Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), a technique for measuring customers’ satisfaction based on survey data, to systematically generate prioritized SWOT factors based on customers’ perspectives which in turn produces more accurate information for strategic planning. This proposed approach is called IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> and its development issues discussed in this report are: (1) selecting a technique for measuring importance which {{is one of the}} two main aspects of IPA since currently there are no well-established approaches for measuring importance; and (2) identifying opportunities and threats since only strengths and weaknesses can be inferred from the IPA result. The first issue is addressed by conducting an empirical comparison to analyse the performance of various techniques for measuring importance. Specifically, this thesis considers two data mining techniques namely Naïve Bayes and Bayesian Networks for measuring importance and compares their performance with other techniques namely Multiple Linear Regressions, Ordinal Logistic Regression and Back Propagation Neural Networks that have been used to derive the importance from the survey data. The comparison result measured against the evaluation metrics suggests that Multiple Linear Regressions is the most suitable technique for measuring importance. Regarding the second issue, opportunities and threats were identified by comparing the IPA result of the target organisation with that of its competitor. Through the use of IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis,</b> it is expected that an organisation can efficiently formulate strategic planning as the SWOT factors that should be maintained or improved can be clearly identified based on customers’ viewpoints. The application of the IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> was illustrated and evaluated through a case study of Higher Education Institutions in Thailand. The evaluation results showed that <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> of the case study has a high face validity and its quality is considered acceptable, thereby demonstrating the validity of this study. Although the application of IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> was illustrated in the specific field, it can be argued that IPA based <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> can be used widely in the other business areas where <b>SWOT</b> <b>analysis</b> has been seen to be applicable and the customer satisfaction surveys are generally conducted. <br/...|$|R
