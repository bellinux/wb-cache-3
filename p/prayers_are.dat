On Sunday mornings, congregants {{meet at the}} temple for Sunday School, which begins with prayers and hymns. After that, the preacherusually a ministerpresides over a talk during which he reads from the Bible and presents the material to be covered throughout the week.

5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|The tale of Nandanar is retold {{numerous}} times in folk tales, folk music, plays, films and literature in Tamil society. While Nandanar {{is included in}} Nayanar list since the 8th century CE, the 12th century CE Periya Puranam gives a full hagiographical account of his life. The tale focuses on two miracles attributed to him. In Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur; his <b>prayers</b> <b>are</b> said to have moved a giant stone bull, which still appears in the moved position in the temple. Nandanar {{is said to have}} ritually purified himself by fire at Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. Nandar's tale features in temple lore and religious literature related to both these temples. Gopalakrishna Bharati's 19th century retelling of the saint's life remains the basis of many later retellings. It expands the original narrative adding elements of oppression of the Dalit saint by higher castes. While higher caste retellings of the tale focus on the saint's observance of caste norms, Dalits emphasize his exploitation and superior religiosity.|$|E
50|$|Individual <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these <b>is</b> when <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.|$|R

[...] <b>Prayer</b> <b>is</b> mental when the thoughts and affections of the soul are not expressed in a previously determined formula. The function of mental <b>prayer</b> <b>is</b> to transform the mind and thereby effect a change in dispositions and in the heart. Such transformation is a lifelong process. Adolphe Tanquerey distinguishes between vocal <b>prayer,</b> which <b>is</b> expressed by words or gestures, and mental prayer [...] "which takes place wholly within the soul." [...] Mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. Mental <b>prayer</b> can <b>be</b> divided into meditation, more active in reflections, and contemplation, more quiet and gazeful.|$|R
