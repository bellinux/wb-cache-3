40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an overview {{to a series of}} reforms undertaken at RAI (Radiotelevisione Italiana), the Italian public service broadcasting company between June 1993 and April 1996. The reform process began {{as a direct result of}} the collapse of the Christian Democrats and its coalition partners after 45 years of continuous government and was initiated by the centre-left 'Technocrat' government led by the former governor of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (April 1993 to May 1994); it was also continued by the centre-right Berlusconi government (May 1994 to December 1994) and by the centre-left Dini technocrat government (January 1995 to April 1996). The research aims to focus on two related topics in order to fully explain the broad social, economic and political context within which the reforms took place. Firstly, especial interest wil be given to an historical analysis of public service provision in Italy in the light of the twin pressures coming from the state and market. Historically, these twin pressures have had a detrimental effect on public service broadcasting in Italy. Secondly, the research also focuses on the impact of the reform process on the functioning of public service broadcasting in Italy. It identifies four areas of RAJ's operations which merit special attention: the system of political occupation, the so-called lottizzazione; the internal network system; the devolution of Raitre; and RAI and Fininvest-Mediaset duopoly.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} by social {{scientists in the}} questions posed by reusing qualitative data has been prompted by two related events. The first is {{the establishment of the}} Qualitative Data Archival Resource Centre (QUALIDATA, and, since 2003, ESDS Qualidata) at the University of Essex in 1994. The second is the publication of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Datasets Policy (1996) which asks that those in receipt of ESRC grants offer copies of their data for deposit to QUALIDATA. This perceived injunction to archive data has been met with resistance by recalcitrant researchers who are wary of the implications of depositing data, and the possibilities of reusing data. The debate risks becoming polarised between those advocating the archiving and reuse of qualitative data, and those more sceptical of these possibilities. This paper aims to open up this debate and to seek a more fruitful path between these positions. I begin by calling into question the supposed ńewnessóf reusing qualitative data, through turning to examine some of the assumptions embedded in the key terms and premises of the debate thus far, including the reliance on distinctions between primary and secondary data and <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analysis.</b> I examine some common tropes in accounts of reusing data: comparisons with secondary analysis of quantitative data; efforts to distinguish between reusing qualitative data in a sociological context and other disciplinary and methodological traditions; and reliance on particular interpretations of key principles of qualitative research, context and reflexivity, in establishing the challenges of the reusing of qualitative data. I suggest that reuse may be more productively understood as a process of recontextualising data, and that attending to the reflexive production of data in the contemporary research project may offer more hopeful possibilities for reuse. I conclude by offering some reflections on why discussions of reusing qualitative data appear to have become so fraught.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to investigate the efficacy of elaborative interrogation for the types of tasks university students confront. The utility of the technique was evaluated for university students studying a university-level text on Canadian physiography in preparation for matching and multiple-choice (MC) tests. Three types of processing were contrasted (elaborative interrogation versus imagery versus self-study). Text information was presented in one of two formats (individually-presented facts or text) (i. e., a 3 x 2 factorial design). Hypotheses concerning the pattern of findings were based on consideration of both the processing used by the students and the processing prompted by the passage. It was expected that for both format conditions, elaborative-interrogation and imagery students would outperform the corresponding self-study controls on the matching and factual MC questions. Overall poor performance on the higher-level MC questions was expected for all groups regardless of format. Contrary to expectation, matching performance did not differ for the processing groups for either format condition. A secondary analysis was conducted including only those elaborative-interrogation and imagery students who ranked in the top half of their respective groups in generation of adequate responses. All self-study students were retained. For this supplementary analysis, the pattern of results changed. Students using elaborative interrogation achieved significantly higher matching scores than their corresponding self-study controls, for both format conditions. For this secondary analysis, it was only for the text-format condition that the imagery students outperformed their self-study controls. Think-aloud data indicated that students in the self-study groups were primarily relying on rote-learning techniques. There was no facilitation of factual MC performance for the elaborative-interrogation or imagery groups relative to the self study controls. For the higher-level MC questions only the elaborative-interrogation text-format students significantly outperformed their self-study controls (for <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analysis).</b> Findings were discussed in terms of the types of generative processing prompted by elaborative-interrogation and imagery in contrast to the processing used by the self-study students.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety of olopatadine HCl 0. 77 % from a larger dataset by pooling data from the two individual CAC studies. Methods: Data were pooled from two phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, active- and vehicle-controlled CAC studies. The primary comparison was on ocular itching scores between olopatadine HCl 0. 77 % versus vehicle (at onset and 24 hours) and olopatadine HCl 0. 77 % versus olopatadine 0. 2 % (at 24 hours). Additional end points included conjunctival redness, total redness, and proportion of itching responders at onset and 24 -hour duration of CAC. For both <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analysis,</b> mixed model repeated measures analysis was used, except for proportion of ocular itching responders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using a two-sample t-test. Results: This analysis included 448 patients. Olopatadine HCl 0. 77 % was superior to vehicle (P< 0. 0001) at onset and 24 -hour duration of action (difference in means: - 1. 14 to - 1. 52) and to olopatadine 0. 2 % (P= 0. 0009) at 24 -hour duration of action in relieving ocular itch. Additionally, olopatadine HCl 0. 77 % substantially reduced conjunctival redness and total redness over vehicle and olopatadine 0. 2 % at onset and 24 -hour duration of action. At 24 hours CAC, there were a higher proportion of itching responders with olopatadine HCl 0. 77 % compared to vehicle or olopatadine 0. 2 % (difference in proportion of responders: 43. 17 %, P< 0. 0001, and 17. 25 %, P= 0. 0012, respectively). No safety concerns were identified. Conclusion: This analysis confirms the findings from the individual studies. The rapid onset and prolonged duration of action (for 24 hours) of olopatadine HCl 0. 77 % supports once-daily dosing in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

Background: In South Africa, as in {{many other}} {{developing}} countries, iron deficiency (the most common micronutrient deficiency) still remains unresolved; while obesity has emerged as a public health challenge causing increases in the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Research has shown that certain iron indices are associated with both anthropometric and biological markers of CVDs. Adiposity is thought to modulate the pathway linking iron status to CVDs. Objective: To examine the associations between iron indices, anthropometric and biological markers of CVDs in an African population undergoing transition. Methods: This thesis was based on secondary analysis of data generated during the Transition and Health during Urbanisation of South Africans (THUSA) study; and <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analysis</b> of the baseline Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study. Both studies were cross–sectional in design and were conducted between 1996 – 1998 and in 2005 respectively in the North West Province of South Africa. The 1854 men and women participants in the THUSA study (> 15 years) and 1262 women participants in the PURE study (> 35 years) were included in the analysis. The relationship between iron and anthropometric indicators of CVD risk was examined in the THUSA study while that of iron status, anthropometric and biological markers of CVD risk was examined in the PURE study. Results: In the THUSA study, ferritin was positively associated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR), body fat and subscapular skinfold (r= 0. 141, 0. 359, 0. 396, 0. 308, 0. 141 respectively for men and 0. 126, 0. 232, 0. 319, 0. 126, 0. 105 respectively for women; p< 0. 01). Only the women showed decreased serum iron concentration with increasing BMI (p< 0. 05). WC and WHR increased with increasing serum ferritin concentration for both genders (p< 0. 05). As for the PURE study, associations between iron status parameters and CVD risk factors were generally weak (r< 0. 3, p< 0. 01) and were not retained after adjusting for valid confounders. WC and WHR increased with increasing ferritin concentration (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Although these results do not indicate any significant association between iron indices and biological markers of CVD, its association with anthropometric indices gives an indication of the possible contribution of iron in the aetiology of CVDs. Thus, {{it may be necessary to}} exercise caution on the emphasis placed on iron as a nutrient and iron intervention programmes because of the suggestive role of iron in CVD development.

40|$|While {{conventional}} LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride measurements reflect aggregate {{properties of}} plasma lipoprotein fractions, NMR-based measurements more accurately reflect lipoprotein particle concentrations according to class (LDL, HDL, and VLDL) and particle size (small, medium, and large). The concentrations of these lipoprotein sub-fractions {{may be related}} to risk of cardiovascular disease and related metabolic disorders. We performed a genome-wide association study of 17 lipoprotein measures determined by NMR together with LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, ApoA 1, and ApoB in 17, 296 women from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS). Among 36 loci with genome-wide significance (P< 5 × 10 − 8) in <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analysis,</b> ten (PCCB/STAG 1 (3 q 22. 3), GMPR/MYLIP (6 p 22. 3), BTNL 2 (6 p 21. 32), KLF 14 (7 q 32. 2), 8 p 23. 1, JMJD 1 C (10 q 21. 3), SBF 2 (11 p 15. 4), 12 q 23. 2, CCDC 92 /DNAH 10 /ZNF 664 (12 q 24. 31. B), and WIPI 1 (17 q 24. 2)) have not been reported in prior genome-wide association studies for plasma lipid concentration. Associations with mean lipoprotein particle size but not cholesterol content were found for LDL at four loci (7 q 11. 23, LPL (8 p 21. 3), 12 q 24. 31. B, and LIPG (18 q 21. 1)) and for HDL at one locus (GCKR (2 p 23. 3)). In addition, genetic determinants of total IDL and total VLDL concentration were found at many loci, most strongly at LIPC (15 q 22. 1) and APOC-APOE complex (19 q 13. 32), respectively. Associations at seven more loci previously known for effects on conventional plasma lipid measures reveal additional genetic influences on lipoprotein profiles and bring the total number of loci to 43. Thus, genome-wide associations identified novel loci involved with lipoprotein metabolism—including loci that affect the NMR-based measures of concentration or size of LDL, HDL, and VLDL particles—all characteristics of lipoprotein profiles that may impact disease risk but are not available by conventional assay. Author Summary Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma lipoprotein fractions hold great promise for understanding lipid metabolism and its central role in cardiovascular disease and related disorders. Conventional assays for lipoprotein status determine total cholesterol content of low- or high-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-C or HDL-C, respectively) or total plasma triglyceride content (as an estimate of very-low density lipoprotein particle concentration [VLDL]). All three measures have been targets for recent GWAS. However, a more precise target for GWAS of lipoprotein metabolism would be the concentration of the individual lipoprotein particles according to class (LDL, HDL, VLDL) and size (small, medium, and large), all of which can be measured by NMR-based methods. In a population of 17, 296 women of European ancestry from the Women's Genome Health Study, we have performed a GWAS for 22 lipoprotein measures derived from NMR-based and conventional assays. We find 43 genetic loci involved in lipoprotein metabolism, including 10 novel loci. The results offer a clearer picture of common genetic influences on lipoprotein metabolism than available previously, including genetic effects on the distribution of LDL, HDL, and VLDL particle size, as well as on IDL and VLDL particle concentration, neither of which can be assessed by conventional measures.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. [Background] Research {{in adults}} and older {{children}} has shown {{an association between}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis and helminth infection, with those infected with helminths {{at greater risk of}} tuberculosis. This association is believed to be on the basis that chronic helminth infection can result in a functional impairment of the immune response that is necessary to clear or control infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Elias et al. 2001; Rook et al. 2006; Fincham 2001). It is thus possible that the introduction of regular deworming programmes in a vulnerable population of {{children under the age of}} five years could assist their immune systems to ward off tuberculosis infection and reduce the risk of tuberculosis disease in such a population. A randomised controlled trial to compare two methods of administering bacille Camlette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination to newborns from a high tuberculosis risk population provided an opportunity to test this hypothesis in a sub-study. [Objective] The objective of this study is to determine if young children in a high-risk tuberculosis population who have been vaccinated with BCG at birth and have been treated for helminth infection are at lower risk of tuberculosis disease than children who have been vaccinated with BCG at birth but not treated for helminth infection. [Method] A case control study nested within a cohort recruited for a separate randomised control trial to compare two methods of administering BCG vaccination was carried out. Children who presented to their local clinic or hospital with symptoms of tuberculosis or a history of exposure to tuberculosis were admitted to a case verification (CV) ward for investigation of tuberculosis. Investigation of tuberculosis included a detailed history, including past helminth treatment, physical examination, tuberculin skin test, chest radiograph, gastric washing and induced sputum for culture of tuberculosis and clinical examination. A diagnostic algorithm was developed by specialist physicians and biostatisticians to classify the children into one of five tuberculosis categories. A total of 510 children (median age 18. 13 months) were included in the primary analysis of this case control study. Those defined as cases were the 328 classified as "definite or probable TB" and 182, classified as "not TB", comprised the control group. Those classified as "possible TB" or "unlikely TB" were excluded. A secondary analysis was performed that included the 337 children who had been classified as "unlikely TB" with the controls resulting in a total of 847 children (median age 18. 37 months). The 328 children classified as "definite or probable TB" were defined as cases and the 519 classified as "unlikely or not TB" comprised the control group. Univariate analysis was used to explore a possible relationship between tuberculosis and helminth treatment using all the variables in the sub-study (n= 510 primary analysis; n= 847 secondary analysis). For both the <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>analysis</b> a multivariate logistic regression model was built using a reduced sample that had a complete set of data for all the variables: primary analysis (n= 435); secondary analysis (n= 724). This final model was then fitted on a more complete sample as the final variables selected had fewer missing data for the observations: primary analysis (n= 493); secondary analysis (n= 822). [Result] A total of 35. 69 % of the study sample in the primary analysis had been treated for helminth infection. The proportion of children who had been treated for helminth infection was similar in the cases and controls (35. 98 % and 35. 16 % respectively). Univariate logistic regression showed no association between tuberculosis and treatment for helminth infection: [odds ratio (OR) 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 71 - 1. 51]. Multivariate analysis adjusted for the effect of nutritional status, recorded as height for age z score (haz), number of occupants sharing the same dwelling as the child, gender and birth site showed a similar result: (OR 1. 03; 95 % CI 0. 69 " 1. 53). The OR is very close to 1 with a 95 % CI that includes 1, which indicates that there is not a statistically significant association between tuberculosis and helminth treatment. In the secondary analysis, a total of 38. 61 % of the study sample had been treated for helminth infection. In this analysis the proportion of children who had been treated for helminth infection showed a difference between the cases and controls (35. 98 % and 40. 27 % respectively). Univariate logistic regression showed a 17 % relative reduction in tuberculosis odds but this was not a statistically significant result: (OR 0. 83; 95 % CI 0. 63 " 1. 11). Multivariate analysis adjusted for the effect of haz, number of children sharing the same dwelling as the child and gender, showed a similar result: (OR 0. 85; 95 % CI 0. 63 " 1. 15). [Conclusion] The primary analysis of this observational study does not support the hypothesis that helminth treatment reduces the risk of tuberculosis disease in young children in a high-risk tuberculosis population. Although the secondary analysis showed a 15 % relative reduction in tuberculosis odds after adjusting for the effect of haz, number of occupants sharing the same dwelling as the child and gender, this was not a statistically significant result. [Final Conclusion] This study does not support the hypothesis that helminth treatment reduces the risk of tuberculosis disease in young children in a high-risk tuberculosis population...|$|E
