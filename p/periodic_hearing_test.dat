40|$|Background: Neonatal preauricular pit/sinus is {{a benign}} embryologic {{remnant of the}} first or second branchial arches. The {{estimated}} incidence in the US is 1 to 9 / 1000 newborns, higher in East Asian babies. Most remain asymptomatic throughout life. Inflammatory complications include discharge of squamous debris, cellulitis, or frank abscess. The {{purpose of this study was}} to survey pediatric otolaryngologists in the United States and Canada about management strategies for asymptomatic and symptomatic preauricular pits/sinuses. Study Design: A 15 -item structured questionnaire covering questions on demographics, professional experience, and medical and surgical management of congenital preauricular pits/sinuses were sent by e-mail and selectively by regular mail to 273 members of the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology. Results: 175 of 273 responses (64 %) were evaluable. 85 % of respondents would simply observe cases of asymptomatic preauricular pit/sinus. Regarding further evaluation, 122 respondents (70 %) would not recommend anything other than routine neonatal hearing screen, without need for repeat <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> in the first two years of life; 34 (19 %) would also get BAER <b>hearing</b> <b>test</b> and a renal ultrasound. If a sinus drains sebaceous material intermittently, 65 % of the surveyed pediatric otolaryngologists would recommend excision. Ninety nine percent of pediatric ENT respondents would excise a recurrently infected preauricular sinus. Conclusion: Watchful waiting, without requirement of <b>periodic</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> in the first 24 months of life is certainly acceptable for management of neonatal asymptomatic preauricular pit/sinus. There is universal agreement that recurrently infected preauricular sinuses should be referred to a pediatric otolaryngologist for surgical excision of the fistulous tract...|$|R
50|$|Workers {{in general}} {{industry}} who {{are exposed to}} noise levels above 85 dBA are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{to be in a}} hearing conservation program (HCP), which includes noise measurement, noise control, <b>periodic</b> audiometric <b>testing,</b> <b>hearing</b> protection, worker education, and record keeping. Twenty-four states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have OSHA-approved state plans and have adopted their own standards and enforcement policies. Most of these state standards are identical to those of federal OSHA. However, some states have adopted different standards or may have different enforcement policies. Most health and safety regulations are designed to keep damage risk within “acceptable limits” — that is, some people are likely to incur a hearing loss even when exposed to less than the maximum daily amount of noise specified in a regulation. Hearing conservation programs in other arenas (schools, military) have become more common, and it has been established that unsafe listening behaviors, such as listening to loud noise for extended periods of time without protection, persist despite knowledge of potential hearing loss effects.|$|R

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the feasibility of an Apple iOS-based automated <b>hearing</b> <b>testing</b> application and to compare its accuracy with conventional audiometry. Study Design. Prospective diagnostic study. Setting. Academic medical center. Subjects and Methods. An iOS-based software application was developed to perform automated pure-tone <b>hearing</b> <b>testing</b> on the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. To assess for device variations and compatibility, preliminary work was performed to compare the standardized sound output (dB) of various Apple device and headset combinations. Forty-two subjects underwent automated iOS-based <b>hearing</b> <b>testing</b> in a sound booth, automated iOS-based <b>hearing</b> <b>testing</b> in a quiet room, and conventional manual audiometry. Results. The maximum difference in sound intensity between various Apple device and headset combinations was 4 dB. On average, 96 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 91 %- 100 %) of the threshold values obtained using the automated test in a sound booth were within 10 dB of the corresponding threshold values obtained using conventional audiometry. When the automated test was performed in a quiet room, 94 % (95 % CI, 87 %- 100 %) of the threshold values were within 10 dB of the threshold values obtained using conventional audiometry. Under standardized testing conditions, 90 % of the subjects preferred iOS-based audiometry as opposed to conventional audiometry. Conclusion. Apple iOS-based devices provide a platform for automated air conduction audiometry without requiring extra equipment and yield <b>hearing</b> <b>test</b> results that approach those of conventional audiometry. © American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2013...|$|R

50|$|Otoacoustic {{emissions}} are clinically {{important because they}} are the basis of a simple, non-invasive <b>test</b> for <b>hearing</b> defects in newborn babies and in children who are too young to cooperate in conventional <b>hearing</b> <b>tests.</b> Many western countries now have national programmes for the universal hearing screening of newborn babies. <b>Periodic</b> early childhood <b>hearing</b> screenings program are also utilizing OAE technology. One excellent example has been demonstrated by the Early Childhood Hearing Outreach Initiative at the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management (NCHAM) at Utah State University, which has helped hundreds of Early Head Start programs across the United States implement OAE screening and follow-up practices in those early childhood educational settings. The primary screening tool is a test for the presence of a click-evoked OAE. Otoacoustic emissions also assist in differential diagnosis of cochlear and higher level hearing losses (e.g., auditory neuropathy).|$|R
40|$|SummaryHearing loss is a {{multifaceted}} condition with many etiologies, among which genetic mutation is. Therefore, {{it is important}} to connect audiological investigation to etiological diagnosis. Aimthis study aims to establish the audiological and genetic profiles of three non-syndromic children with sensorineural hearing loss. Materials and methodthree brothers aged 3, 5 and 16 were enrolled in this study. They were submitted to behavioral and electrophysiological <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> and molecular studies. Resultsthe <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> showed moderate to moderately severe bilateral symmetric sensorineural hearing loss and an accentuated descending slope. Transient and Distortion Product Otoacoustic emissions were absent in the two younger children. ABR showed a bilateral moderately severe to severe sensorineural hearing loss. P 300 showed bilateral normal latencies in the older brother. Molecular tests showed that the two younger children were heterozygote for mutation 35 delG on gene GJB 2. ConclusionThe combination of speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>tests</b> and genetic analysis allows for the etiologic diagnosis of seemingly similar hearing loss cases, which however display different genetic backgrounds. Molecular studies must be comprehensive enough to avoid precipitated diagnosis which may impair genetic counseling...|$|R

50|$|An {{audiogram}} is {{the result}} of a <b>hearing</b> <b>test.</b> The most common type of <b>hearing</b> <b>test</b> is pure tone audiometry (PTA). It charts the thresholds of hearing sensitivity at a selection of standard frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. There is also high frequency pure tone audiometry which tests frequencies from 8000-20,000 Hz. PTA can be used to differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss. A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or 'cookie-bite', peaked or flat.|$|R
