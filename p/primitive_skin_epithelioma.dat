40|$|The hamster {{papovavirus}} {{isolated from}} <b>skin</b> <b>epithelioma</b> can induce lymphomas and leukemias after subcutaneous inoculation into newborn hamsters. The lymphoma cells are virus free but contain {{large amounts of}} extrachromosomal hamster papovavirus DNA. We have cloned and partly sequenced some of these DNA molecules from independent tumors. These genomes displayed overlapping deletions consistently sharing a common end within the noncoding regulatory sequences; the other end was variable but always extended into the sequence coding for the N-terminal part of the viral capsid VP 2. This unique in vivo interaction between a polyomavirus and its cellular host, the genesis of these variant molecules, and {{their role in the}} lymphoma formation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{isolated}} from <b>skin</b> <b>epitheliomas</b> containing papovavirus induced lymphomas within {{four to eight}} weeks in 40 to 50 per cent of newborn Syrian hamsters injected. This DNA effect was eliminated by DNase but not by RNase and was not induced by DNA preparations of transplanted epitheliomas or the induced lymphomas. Lymphomas were similarly induced by cellfree filtrates from certain human tumors such as gastric carcinomas and ovarian tumors. Little or no lymphoma effects were observed following injections with filtrates derived from normal human or animal tissues or human blood. The lymphomas induced by DNA and human tumors were transmissible by cell-free filtrates to newborn Syrian hamsters; however, successful serial passage, like the primary lymphomas induced by the DNA preparations, depended upon {{the use of a}} newborn hamster from a special breeding colony of hamsters...|$|R
40|$|The hamster {{papovavirus}} (HapV) {{is associated}} with multiple <b>skin</b> <b>epitheliomas</b> of the Syrian hamster. We have sequenced its genome. It is a double-stranded circular DNA of 5366 bp. The hypothetical genomic organization deduced from this nucleotide sequence is clearly of the polyoma type with the two strands coding in the opposite directions from a noncoding region that shows some {{of the features of}} a replication origin and a transcription control region. The amino acid sequences predicted from the open reading frames show an average of 50 % homology with polyoma-coded polypeptides. The HapV is, after polyoma, the second example of a papovavirus coding for a middle T antigen. The cloned DNA can immortalize primary rat embryo cells and transform an established rat cell line. The viral DNA is stably integrated into the host genome...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse incidence and mortality cancer trends in the Italian Network of Cancer Registries (about 8, 000, 000 inhabitants) during the period 1986 - 1997. Included were 525, 645 newly diagnosed cancers and 269, 902 cancer deaths (subjects > 14 years). Joinpoints (points in time where trend significantly changes from linearity) were found and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) used to summarize tendencies. Overall cancer incidence increased in both sexes and cancer mortality significantly decreased (since 1991 among men). Lung cancer showed significantly decreasing incidence (EAPC = - 1. 4 %) and mortality (EAPC = - 1. 6 %) among men and increasing trends among women. In women, breast cancer incidence significantly increased (EAPC= + 1. 7 %) and mortality decreased since 1989 (EAPC= - 2. 0 %). Stomach cancer incidence and mortality decreased in both sexes. Prostate incidence sharply increased since 1991 and mortality decreased. Colon cancer incidence increased and rectum mortality decreased significantly in both sexes. Significant increases in incidence were also found for kidney (up to 1991 among men), urinary bladder, <b>skin</b> <b>epithelioma,</b> melanoma, liver (up to 1993 among men), pancreas, mesothelioma, Kaposi's sarcoma (up to 1995 among men), testis, thyroid, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Mortality significantly decreased for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, liver (women), larynx (men), bone, cervix (since 1990), central nervous system, urinary bladder, thyroid, Hodgkin's lymphomas and leukaemias (men). Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality increased in both sexes. In conclusion, most of the changes seen can be explained as the effect of changes in smoking habits and of the extension of secondary prevention activities. The Italian health care system will also have to cope with growing cancer diagnostic and therapeutic needs due to population ageing...|$|R

40|$|Non-melanoma {{skin cancer}} (NMSC) {{is the most}} {{frequently}} diagnosed cancer in humans. Several different non-melanoma skin cancers {{have been reported in}} the literature, with several histologic variants that frequently cause important differential diagnoses with other cutaneous tumors basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant skin tumor, with different histologic variants that are associated with a greater or less aggressive behavior and that usually may be confused with other <b>primitive</b> <b>skin</b> tumors. Actinic keratosis, Bowen’s disease, keratoacanthoma, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) correspond to the other line of NMSC, that may have only local tumoral behavior, easy to treat and with local management (as in the case of actinic keratosis (AK), Bowen’s disease, and keratoacanthoma) or a more aggressive behavior with a potential metastatic spread, as in case of invasive SCC. Therefore, histopathology serves as the gold standard during daily clinical practice, in order to improve the therapeutical approaches to patients with NMSC and to understand the distinct histopathological features of NMSC. Here, we reported the main pathological features of different non-melanoma skin cancers...|$|R
40|$|Implicit {{surfaces}} {{defined by}} density functions are often chosen to model {{different kind of}} objects with property of soft blending. In spite of their qualities, {{the use of such}} primitives is not really intuitive. That is why we present in this paper a new description of implicit <b>primitives</b> to <b>skin</b> a set of skeletons made of different kind of basic elements. The user defines the set of skeletons and the way he want to skin them, so the implicit objects are created automatically...|$|R
40|$|Muir-Torre {{syndrome}} (MTS) {{is a rare}} cancer-predisposing syndrome that is autosomal dominantly inherited and {{characterized by}} the development of sebaceous <b>skin</b> lesions (adenomas, <b>epitheliomas,</b> basaliomas and carcinomas). These lesions are typically associated with tumors that belong to the spectrum of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) (i. e., tumors of the colorectum, endometrium, stomach or ovary). Biliary malignancy in association with MTS has only rarely been reported. We report a case of Muir-Torre syndrome associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a location not previously described, and associated with a novel missense mutation of the MSH 2 gene (c. 2026 T &gt; C), predicted to disrupt the function of the gene...|$|R
60|$|Kowsoter {{received}} it in a truly Christian spirit, {{and after a}} speech, in which he expressed his high gratification at the honor done him, invited the whole company to a feast on the following day. His invitation was gladly accepted. A Christmas dinner in the wigwam of an Indian chief! There was novelty in the idea. Not one failed to be present. The banquet was served up in <b>primitive</b> style: <b>skins</b> of various kinds, nicely dressed for the occasion, were spread upon the ground; upon these were heaped up abundance of venison, elk meat, and mountain mutton, with various bitter roots which the Indians use as condiments.|$|R
25|$|Feathers and {{scales are}} made up of two {{distinct}} forms of keratin, and it was long thought that each type of keratin was exclusive to each skin structure (feathers and scales). However, a study published in 2006 confirmed the presence of feather keratin {{in the early stages of}} development of American alligator scales. This type of keratin, previously thought to be specific to feathers, is suppressed during embryological development of the alligator and so is not present in the scales of mature alligators. The presence of this homologous keratin in both birds and crocodilians indicates that it was inherited from a common ancestor. This may suggest that crocodilian scales, bird and dinosaur feathers, and pterosaur pycnofibres are all developmental expressions of the same <b>primitive</b> archosaur <b>skin</b> structures; suggesting that feathers and pycnofibers could be homologous.|$|R
40|$|The inner {{root sheath}} (IRS) allows the exit of hairs through the {{epidermal}} surface. The fine structure of monotreme and marsupial IRS and trichohyalin is not known. Using electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, the localization of trichohyalin and transglutaminase {{have been studied}} in monotreme and marsupial hairs, and compared with trichohyalin localization in placental hairs. Trichohyalin in all mammalian species studied here is recognized by a polyclonal antibody against sheep trichohyalin. This generalized immunoreactivity suggests that common epitopes are present in trichohyalin across mammals. In differentiating IRS cells, trichohyalin granules of variable dimensions are composed of an immunolabelled amorphous matrix associated with a network of 10 – 12 -nm-thick keratin filaments. Transglutaminase labelling is present among keratin bundles and trichohyalin granules, and in condensed nuclei of terminally differentiating cells of the inner root sheath. The IRS in monotreme hairs is multistratified but lacks a distinguishable Henle layer. Cornification of IRS determines the sculpturing of the fibre cuticle and later shedding from the follicle for the exit of the hair fibre on the epidermal surface. It is hypothesized that the stratification of IRS in Henle, Huxley and IRS cuticle layers is derived from a simpler organization, like that present in the IRS of monotremes. The IRS {{is regarded as a}} localized shedding/sloughing layer needed for the exit of hairs without injury to the epidermis. The formation of the IRS during the evolution of mammalian epidermis allowed the physiological exit of hairs produced inside the skin. The peculiar morphogenesis of hairs in possible <b>primitive</b> <b>skins,</b> such as those of the monotremes (mammals with some reptilian characteristics) or the tails of some rodents (a scaled skin), may elucidate the evolution of hairs. In monotreme and rodent tail skin, the dermal papilla remains localized on the proximal side of the hair peg and forms a hair placode with bilateral symmetry. The papilla is progressively surrounded by the down-growing hair peg until a dermal papilla with radial symmetry is formed. It is speculated that the progressive reduction of the extended dermal papilla of reptilian scales into small and deep papillae of therapsid reptiles produced hairs in mammals...|$|R
40|$|In {{this survey}} we review, {{classify}} and compare existing approaches for real-time crowd rendering. We first overview character animation techniques, {{as they are}} highly tied to crowd rendering performance, and then we analyze {{the state of the}} art in crowd rendering. We discuss different representations for level-of-detail (LoD) rendering of animated characters, including polygon-based, point-based, and image-based techniques, and review different criteria for runtime LoD selection. Besides LoD approaches, we review classic acceleration schemes, such as frustum culling and occlusion culling, and describe how they can be adapted to handle crowds of animated characters. We also discuss specific acceleration techniques for crowd rendering, such as <b>primitive</b> pseudo-instancing, palette <b>skinning,</b> and dynamic key-pose caching, which benefit from current graphics hardware. We also address other factors affecting performance and realism of crowds such as lighting, shadowing, clothing and variability. Finally we provide an exhaustive comparison of the most relevant approaches in the field. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|Post-traumatic {{inflammation}} {{is formed}} by molecular and cellular complex mechanisms whose final goal {{seems to be}} injured tissue regeneration. In the skin -an exterior organ of the body- mechanical or thermal injury induces the expression of different inflammatory phenotypes that resemble similar phenotypes expressed during embryo development. Particularly, molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in gastrulation return. This is a developmental phase that delineates the three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. Consequently, in the post-natal wounded <b>skin,</b> <b>primitive</b> functions related with the embryonic mesoderm, i. e. amniotic and yolk sac-derived, are expressed. Neurogenesis and hematogenesis stand out among the primitive function mechanisms involved. Interestingly, in these phases of the inflammatory response, whose molecular and cellular mechanisms are considered as traces of the early phases of the embryonic development, the mast cell, a cell that is supposedly inflammatory, plays a key role. The correlation that can be established between the embryonic and the inflammatory events suggests that the results obtained from the research regarding both great fields of knowledge must be interchangeable to obtain the maximum advantage...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} generative, high {{resolution}} face representation which extends the well- known active appearance model (AAM) [5], [6], [7] with two additional layers. (i) One layer refines the global AAM (PCA) model with a dictionary of learned face components {{to account for the}} shape and intensity variabilities of eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth. (ii) The other layer divides the face skin into 9 zones with a learned dictionary of sketch <b>primitives</b> to represent <b>skin</b> marks and wrinkles. This model is no longer of fixed dimensions and is flexible for it can select the diverse representations in the dictionaries of face components and skin features depending on the complexity of the face. The selection is modulated by the grammatical rules through hidden ”switch” variables. Our comparison experiments demonstrate that this model can achieve nearly lossless coding of face at high resolution (256 × 256 pixels) with low bits. We also show that the generative model can easily generate cartoon sketches by changing the rendering dictionary. Our face model is aimed at a number of applications including cartoon sketch in non-photorealistic rendering, super-resolution in image processing, and low bit face communication in wireless platforms...|$|R
