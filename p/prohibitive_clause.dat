40|$|In this talk, I take a {{fresh look}} at {{prohibitive}} clauses in some Indo-European languages. Drawing on data from Hittite, Vedic, Homeric Greek and Latin, I explore whether the prohibitive constructions found in these languages derive from one single construction type or not. From a formal perspective, prohibitive clauses are a subtype of directive clauses and in many respects represent a negative counterpart to imperative clauses. This analysis captures the intuition that prohibitives are negated imperatives and, accordingly, some scholars, like Palmer (2001 : 20) prefer the term ‘negative imperative ’ and do not spend much space discussing prohibitive constructions. However, an approach along these lines seemingly downplays some important properties of prohibitive constructions and their relationship to positive directive clauses. First, many languages make a formal distinction between prohibitive clauses that encourage the addressee to abstain from performing a given situation after the time of the utterance and prohibitive clauses that encourage the addressee to discontinue an ongoing situation. Drawing on Ammann (1927) and Hoffmann (1967) I will refer to the former type of <b>prohibitive</b> <b>clause</b> as preventive and the second type as inhibitive...|$|E

Negated {{declarative}} clauses typically occur with either perfective ne or imperfective no, with other options only marginally represented in collected data.|$|R
