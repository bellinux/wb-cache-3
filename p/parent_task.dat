The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how to do <b>parenting</b> role's <b>tasks</b> in <b>parents</b> of children with disability (physical- mental) younger than 7 years in the city of Arak in 2016. Materials and Methods: In this study, the <b>parenting</b> role's <b>tasks</b> questionnaire for 120 parents of children with disability was completed. The effect of demographic characteristics on how to perform the role of parents was studied. Results: Based on data collected and analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient for the relationship between the parents and other factors, we have found no significant relationship between role of parents with the child's age. In disabled children, between parent's role and maternal age was significant difference which its correlation coefficient was - 0. 18, represented the inverse association between maternal age and the parent's role with disabled children. In comparison of parent's role based on child's gender, significant difference was not seen in any of cases. The impact of the seizure on performance of <b>parenting</b> role's <b>tasks</b> implied no relationship between history of seizure and performance of <b>parenting</b> role's <b>tasks.</b> Economic situation as well as on how to do tasks was ineffective.

40|$|International audienceScientific {{applications}} are usually described as directed acyclic graphs, where nodes represent tasks and edges represent dependencies between tasks. For some applications, {{such as the}} multifrontal method of sparse matrix factorization, this graph is a tree: each task produces a single output data, used by a single task (its parent in the tree). We focus on the case when the data manipulated by tasks have a large size, which is especially {{the case in the}} multifrontal method. To process a task, both its inputs and its output must fit in the main memory. Moreover, output results of tasks have to be stored between their production and their use by the <b>parent</b> <b>task.</b> It may therefore happen, during an execution, that not all data fit together in memory. In particular, this is the case if the total available memory is smaller than the minimum memory required to process the whole tree. In such a case, some data have to be temporarily written to disk and read afterwards. These Input/Output (I/O) operations are very expensive; hence, the need to minimize them. We revisit this open problem in this paper. Specifically, our goal is to minimize the total volume of I/O while processing a given task tree. We first formalize and generalize known results, then prove that existing solutions can be arbitrarily worse than optimal. Finally, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm, based on the optimal tree traversal for memory minimization. We demonstrate good performance of this new heuristic through simulations on both synthetic trees and realistic trees built from actual sparse matrices...|$|E

Services are deployed in data centers and the pool of data centers is collectively referred to as “Cloud”. Data centers make use of scheduling techniques to optimally allocate resources to various jobs. Different scenarios require different scheduling algorithms. The selection of a particular scheduling algorithm depends upon various factors like the parameter to be optimized (cost or time), quality of service to be provided and information available regarding various aspects of job. Workflow applications are the applications which require various sub-tasks to be executed in a particular fashion in order to complete the whole task. These tasks have parent child relationship. The <b>parent</b> <b>task</b> needs to be executed before its child task. Workflow scheduling algorithms are supposed to preserve dependency constraints implied by their nature and structure. Resources are allocated to various sub-tasks of the original task by keeping into account these constraints. In this paper, various workflow scheduling algorithms have been surveyed.

Note that the execution phase that a constituent task belongs to is specified by the user when the job is submitted to the system. In the sample job shown in Fig. 2, the first phase of execution comprises three tasks: t 1, t 2, and t 3, and the function of these three tasks is to read and parse the input data. These three tasks do not have any direct preceding tasks (referred to as parent tasks) that need to be completed before they start executing. This implies that these tasks can start executing at the job’s earliest start time specified by the user. The tasks t 4 and t 5, which analyze and perform computation on the parsed data, are part of the second phase of execution. Each of these tasks has a <b>parent</b> <b>task</b> t 0, as well as indirect preceding tasks t 1, t 2, and t 3. The tasks t 4 and t 5 cannot start executing until task t 0 finishes, which in turn cannot start executing until tasks t 1, t 2, and t 3 finish executing. Note that some workflows are modelled using a DAG with special tasks, referred to as dummy tasks, whose only purpose is to enforce precedence relationships between tasks in the DAG, and thus, dummy tasks have an execution time equal to 0. For example, in Fig. 2, task t 0 is a dummy task that ensures tasks in the second phase of execution start to execute only after all the tasks in the first phase have completed.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{addition}} of task parallelism to the OpenMP shared memory API allows programmers to express concurrency {{at a high}} level of abstraction and places the burden of scheduling parallel execution on the OpenMP run-time system. Effi-cient scheduling of tasks on modern multi-socket multicore shared memory systems requires careful consideration of an increasingly complex memory hierarchy, including shared caches and non-uniform memory access (NUMA) characteris-tics. In order to evaluate scheduling strategies, we extended the open source Qthreads threading library to implement different scheduler designs, accepting OpenMP programs through the ROSE compiler. Our comprehensive performance study of diverse OpenMP task-parallel benchmarks compares seven different task-parallel run-time scheduler implemen-tations on an Intel Nehalemmulti-socket multicore system: our proposed hierarchical work-stealing scheduler, a per-core work-stealing scheduler, a centralized scheduler, and LIFO and FIFO versions of the Qthreads round-robin scheduler. In addition, we compare our results against the Intel and GNU OpenMP implementations. Our hierarchical scheduling strategy leverages different scheduling methods at different levels of the hierarchy. By allowing one thread to steal work on behalf of all of the threads within a single chip that share a cache, the scheduler limits the number of costly remote steals. For cores on the same chip, a shared LIFO queue allows exploitation of cache locality between sibling tasks as well as between a <b>parent</b> <b>task</b> and its newly created child tasks. In the performance evaluation, our Qthreads hierarchical scheduler is competitive on all benchmarks tested. On five of the seven benchmarks, it demonstrates speedup and absolute performance superior to both the Intel and GNU OpenMP run-time systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) {{is a new}} {{parenting}} intervention {{designed specifically}} for {{parents of children with}} disabilities to help them develop effective management strategies for dealing with childhood behaviour problems and developmental issues. Aims: This present study aimed to investigate the acceptability of SSTP by parents of children with cerebral palsy (CP) and health professionals working with children with CP, to explore parents’ experience in parenting their child with CP, and to assess parental chronic sorrow and types of coping strategies employed by this population. Furthermore, this study also aimed to delineate the types of daily <b>parenting</b> <b>tasks</b> that <b>parents</b> of children with CP perform in comparison to parents of typically developing children so as to develop an outcome measure of <b>parenting</b> <b>tasks</b> for this population. Method: Design: Qualitative study via focus groups (Study I) and quantitative study via online survey (Study II). Participants: For Study I, participants were eight parents of children with CP and five health professionals. For Study II, participants were 61 parents of children with CP and 32 parents of typically developing children serving as a comparison group. Measures: Questionnaires for Study I include the Family Background Questionnaire, Expert Focus Group Demographic Sheet, and Parenting Strategies Questionnaire. Questionnaires for Study II include the Family Background Questionnaire, Adapted Burke Questionnaire, Coping Health Inventory for Parents, Cerebral Palsy Daily <b>Parenting</b> <b>Tasks</b> Checklist, Parents’ Acceptability of Stepping Stones Triple P Questionnaire, and Parenting Experience Questionnaire. Procedures: For Study I, two parent focus groups and one health professional focus group were conducted in which participants viewed video footages of parenting strategies from SSTP. Parents rated the parenting strategies on a 10 -point Likert Scale for acceptability, usability and intention to use the strategies. Focus group discussions were subsequently conducted to draw detailed information from both parent and professionals in accordance with the study aims. For Study II, parents completed questionnaires via an online survey website regarding their parenting experiences and the acceptability of SSTP. Data arising from Study I was analysed thematically and data from Study II was analysed statistically using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: Overall, participants’ responses to SSTP were positive and they rated each of the SSTP parenting strategy highly in terms of acceptability, usability, and behavioural intention (ratings between 78 th and 89 th percentile for Study I), {{as well as on the}} program as a whole (at the 65 th percentile for Study II). Parents of children with CP were found to have a moderate level of chronic sorrow in Study II (M= 9. 23, SD= 5. 58; maximum intensity score possible = 24). Key themes of the parenting experiences arising from Study I within this population included chronic grief for lost opportunities, sadness, helplessness, and frustration. Nevertheless, strong themes of resiliency and positive attitude were also found, with parents reporting that whilst parenting a child with CP was demanding and stressful, it was also fulfilling. Key coping strategies used by this population included obtaining support from their partner, family, and friends; positive thinking; talking with other parents of children with disabilities; eating comfort food, and reading encouraging quotations.

Background: Commonly, successful parenting training programmes are underpinned by social learning principles and aim to strengthen parental self-efficacy. However, research examining programme effectiveness rarely discusses how self-efficacy outcomes are achieved. Design: A descriptive survey was completed as {{the first part of}} a realistic evaluation study examining how a UK parenting support programme worked. Method: The first part of the realistic evaluation involved validating outcome measures (the Parenting Self-Agency Measure and Self-Efficacy for <b>Parenting</b> <b>Tasks</b> Index subscales) and administering a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was completed by adults accessing a parenting support programme during a 10 -month period (n = 168). Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results. Women were the main users of the programme, which included informal drop-in groups as well as more formalised health visiting services and parenting training courses. The Parenting Self-Agency Measure results indicated good general parental self-efficacy; however, the task-specific Self-Efficacy for <b>Parenting</b> <b>Tasks</b> Indexes scales suggested that parents were less self-efficacious in disciplining children. Lower self-efficacy scores correlated with high ratings for ‘feeling tired’, ‘receiving negative comments’ and ‘giving-in to a child’s demands’. Conclusions: Study results indicate that the domain general and task-specific measures provide different, but helpful, insights into parental self-efficacy experiences. By identifying factors associated with the levels of general and task-specific parental self-efficacy, health visitors can gain a fuller appreciation of support needs. Relevance to practice: To maximise potential through parenting support, attention should be given to addressing factors associated with poorer self-efficacy experiences, including parental tiredness. Equally, practice should be directed at developing community environments that offer exposure to positive praise and the opportunity to practice new skills without facing criticism...|$|R
