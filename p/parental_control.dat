5|$|Princess Charlotte was a {{difficult}} child and indifferent student, with a nervous disposition. Her relationship with her demanding mother was strained. As she grew older, Charlotte developed a penchant for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from <b>parental</b> <b>control,</b> at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality {{had little effect on}} her. Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, in the care of family members. Charlotte and Feodora, in turn, also had {{a difficult}} relationship.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and <b>parental</b> <b>control.</b> These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E

40|$|AbstractParental {{controlling}} {{is a way}} {{to educate}} adolescents to behave and to generate self-discipline {{but at the same time}} this might induce negative emotion in adolescents. This research aims to investigate the effects of <b>parental</b> <b>controlling</b> on negative emotion and self-discipline of at-risk adolescents. Quantitative research was carried out at the area of People Housing Project (PHP), Pantai Dalam, Kuala Lumpur. Eighty four adolescents between the ages of 13 to 18 were recruited. The correlation result of Pearson showed that <b>parental</b> <b>controlling</b> has significant relation with negative emotion and self-discipline of adolescents. Meanwhile, the t-test showed that the level of <b>parental</b> <b>controlling</b> has a significant difference with negative emotion and self- discipline among the adolescents. Meanwhile, MANOVA test result suggests that <b>parental</b> <b>controlling</b> might generate more negative emotion than build up self-discipline in at-risk adolescents. Thus, <b>parental</b> <b>controlling</b> might not seen as caring and family communication seems best in ensuring adolescents to behave and build up self-discipline...|$|R

500|$|The {{traditional}} Chinese marriage system benefitted men {{more than}} women. This effect {{could be seen}} in monogamy, concubinage, divorce, and the heritage of lineage and property through males. After the Spring and Autumn Period, elite men could take primary and secondary wives, concubines, and maids. Ancient Chinese women were denied the right to choose their marriages. Generally, traditional Chinese marriage was organized by the parents of the groom and bride in order to obtain alliances between the two families to ensure the continuance of the family line. The prime mission of a married woman, regardless of her social status, was to bear at least one son in order to carry on the family name. Therefore, women were only valued for their reproduction functions. Three types of marriage dominated in Ancient China. The first traditional Chinese marriage type, which originated in the primitive society, was called a [...] "capture marriage," [...] in which the groom would go to his prospective bride's house at dusk to [...] "kidnap" [...] her. The second type was called a [...] "purchase marriage," [...] in which women were paid for by their husbands. Once women were purchased, they became their husband's possession and could be traded or sold. The third type was the [...] "arranged marriage," [...] which could {{be traced back to the}} Warring States, emphasized the necessity of <b>parental</b> <b>control</b> and matchmaking institutions. Matchmakers acted as go-betweens for both families. If there was not a matchmaker, the marriage could be deemed unacceptable and could be dissolved. Once two people were married, the wife would leave her family, live with the husband's family, and be obedient to her in-laws as if they were her own parents.|$|E
500|$|Treatments of this pseudoscientific {{disorder}} {{are called}} [...] "Attachment therapy". In general, these therapies {{are aimed at}} adopted or fostered children {{with a view to}} creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and <b>parental</b> <b>control.</b> There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream. There is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from non-coercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma. Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm, are potentially abusive, and are [...] to attachment theory. The APSAC Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. Children may be described as [...] "RADs", [...] "Radkids" [...] or [...] "Radishes" [...] and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy. The Mayo Clinic, a well known U.S. non-profit medical practice and medical research group, cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques; to date, this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals.|$|E

This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A <b>parental</b> <b>controls</b> profile can be set up for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator.
