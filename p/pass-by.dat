50|$|EPNdB, or Effective Perceived Noise {{level in}} decibels, {{is a measure}} of the {{relative}} loudness of an individual aircraft <b>pass-by</b> event. Separate ratings are stated for takeoff, overflight and landing phases, and represent the integrated sum of loudness over the period within which the noise from the aircraft is within 10 dB of the maximum noise (usually at the point of closest approach.) It is defined in Annex 16 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation and in Part 36 of the US Federal Aviation Regulations. The scaling is such that the EPNdB rating represents the integrated loudness over a ten-second period; EPNdB of 100 dB means that the event has the same integrated loudness as a 100 dB sound lasting ten seconds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Developing {{applications}} with <b>pass-by</b> communica-tion {{is usually}} complex and expensive, since the applications heav-ily {{depend on the}} hardware to detect rendezvous (i. e., proximity) of mobile entities. In {{order to reduce the}} complexity and cost of the application development, we propose a device-independent formalization of the <b>pass-by</b> rendezvous of mobile entities in this paper. Specifically, we first define a <b>pass-by</b> rendezvous as a phenomenon, where two mobile entities are closed enough at a certain time. We then derive four properties from the definition to be satisfied within any <b>pass-by</b> systems. The properties allow indirect <b>pass-by</b> rendezvous between mobile entities with different devices. Finally, we apply the proposed method to two different practical systems (Bluetooth Low Energy and GPS). In the case study, we see how the <b>pass-by</b> rendezvous can be implemented in each system, and see how the indirect rendezvous across the two systems can be inferred using the proposed properties.

Environmental noise exposure represents a burden to people and can result in cardiovascular disease, sleep disturbance or annoyance.

Vehicle <b>pass-by</b> noise tests are conducted according to the international standard ISO 362, which is suppose to reflect the noise emission of a vehicle in an urban traffic environment.

To achieve compliance with the <b>pass-by</b> noise test it is important that vehicle engineers have access to predictive tools at the design stage. In this paper the initial development of a <b>pass-by</b> noise predictive tool is reported. To begin with, the vehicle <b>pass-by</b> noise test according to standard ISO 362 is summarized.

Current European legislation aims to limit vehicle noise emissions since many people are exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. Vehicle <b>pass-by</b> noise is measured {{according to the international}} standard ISO 362 in Europe. More recent investigations of urban traffic have led to the proposal of a revised ISO 362 which includes a constant-speed test in addition to the traditional accelerated test {{in order to determine the}} <b>pass-by</b> noise value. In order to meet the legal <b>pass-by</b> noise requirements, vehicle manufacturers and suppliers must analyse and quantify vehicle noise source characteristics during the development phase of the vehicle. In addition, predictive tools need to be available for the estimation of the final <b>pass-by</b> noise value. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of vehicle <b>pass-by</b> noise and of the characteristics of the vehicle noise sources contributing to <b>pass-by</b> noise. This is supported through an extensive literature review in which current <b>pass-by</b> noise prediction methods are reviewed as well. Furthermore, three vehicle noise sources are replicated experimentally under laboratory conditions. This involves an orifice noise source, represented by a specially designed loudspeaker on a moving trolley, shell noise, represented by a metal cylinder structure, and tyre cavity and sidewall noise, represented by an annular membrane mounted on a tyre-like structure. The experimentally determined directivity characteristics of the acoustically excited noise sources are utilised in the <b>pass-by</b> noise prediction method.

Nevertheless, standards do not account for the increase in the noise level caused by rain falling onto road surfaces. Therefore, the aim of this work is to study the effects of water on <b>pass-by</b> noise since the weather is rainy about 25 per cent of the year in Portugal. Thus, it addresses two currently used pavement surfaces, porous asphalt and dense asphalt, constructed in a motorway. A version of the Statistical <b>Pass-By</b> Method was used to assess noise levels with dry and wet surfaces, using a selected set of heavy and light vehicles. The results include analysis of the statistical <b>pass-by</b> index, pressure noise levels and noise spectrum.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to separate the}} track noise contribution is proposed based on identifying and extracting the track signature from the <b>pass-by</b> noise information measured with a microphone array relatively close to the track. Separation of {{the contributions of the}} vehicle and the track in the <b>pass-by</b> noise spectra is a challenging task, which is currently addressed by a combination of direct and indirect measurements and model predictions. Due to the uncertainties in the separation of the track contribution, whether a vehicle will comply with regulations during certification tests is still very much track dependent. Therefore, accurate means to identify the track contribution to the <b>pass-by</b> noise are needed. In this paper we propose {{to make use of the}} fact that in a wide frequency range the track is a distributed source that radiates plane waves at a given angle with respect to the track. By measuring the sound field close to the track with a microphone array, the wavenumber spectrum of the radiated sound can be determined. For the track contribution this wavenumber spectrum is tonal and therefore sparse.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{counteract}} the problem of railway noise and its environmental impact, passing trains in Europe must be tested in accordance to a noise legislation that demands the quantification of the noise generated by the vehicle alone. However, for frequencies between about 500  Hz and 1600  Hz, {{it has been found}} that {{a significant part of the}} measured noise is generated by the rail, which behaves like a distributed source and radiates plane waves as a result of the contact with the train's wheels. Thus the need arises for separating the rail contribution to the <b>pass-by</b> noise in that particular frequency range. To this end, the present paper introduces a wavenumber–domain filtering technique, referred to as wave signature extraction, which requires a line microphone array parallel to the rail, and two accelerometers on the rail in the vertical and lateral direction. The novel contributions of this research are: (i) the introduction and application of wavenumber (or plane–wave) filters to <b>pass-by</b> data measured with a microphone array located in the near-field of the rail, and (ii) the design of such filters without prior information of the structural properties of the rail. The latter is achieved by recording the array pressure, as well as the rail vibrations with the accelerometers, before and after the train <b>pass-by.</b> The performance of the proposed method is investigated with a set of <b>pass-by</b> measurements performed in Germany. The results seem to be promising when compared to reference data from TWINS, and the largest discrepancies occur above 1600  Hz and are attributed to plane waves radiated by the rail that so far have not been accounted for in the design of the filters.
