40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In summary, we identified over 200 organizations that market financial and estate planning services to help <b>pension</b> <b>claimants</b> with excess assets qualify for pension benefits. These organizations consist primarily of financial planners and attorneys who offer products such as annuities and trusts. All 19 organizations our investigative staff contacted said a claimant can qualify for pension benefits by transferring assets before applying, which is permitted under the program. Two organization representatives said they helped <b>pension</b> <b>claimants</b> with substantial assets, including millionaires, obtain VAs approval for benefits. Some products and services provided, such as deferred annuities, may not be suitable for the elderly because {{they may not have}} access to their funds within their expected lifetime without facing high withdrawal fees. Also, such asset transfers may result in ineligibility for Medicaid coverage for long-term care for a period of time. The majority of the 19 organizations contacted charged fees, ranging from a few hundred dollars for benefits counseling to $ 10, 000 for establishment of a trust. In our report we asked Congress to consider establishing a look-back and penalty period for <b>pension</b> <b>claimants</b> who transfer assets prior to applying for pension benefits, similar to other federally supported means-tested programs, such as Medicaid. We also recommended that VA obtain timely information on asset transfers, strengthen income and asset verification processes, and provide clearer guidance to claims processors. VA concurred with our recommendations and agreed that a look back and penalty period for asset transfers was needed. ...|$|E
40|$|Detroit {{recently}} confirmed {{its plan}} of debt adjustment {{under which the}} city has endeavored to adjust its pension obligations. The court 2 ̆ 7 s confirmation order and oral opinion on the record present what {{is perhaps the most}} significant decision regarding a key question facing any city attempting to adjust pensions in bankruptcy: can a city propose to pay its <b>pension</b> <b>claimants</b> significantly more than its other unsecured creditors? This question involves interpreting the Bankruptcy Code 2 ̆ 7 s unfair discrimination rule. The Detroit bankruptcy court applied a novel interpretation of unfair discrimination, eschewing the relatively thin body of case law interpreting this rule, and suggesting that the rule should have a municipal bankruptcy-specific meaning. This article contends that {{there is no need for}} such a specialized interpretation of unfair discrimination. Many of the factors that motivated the court 2 ̆ 7 s departure from the case law can actually be addressed more effectively under the case law developed for corporate reorganization. Adhering to the corporate reorganization statute has statutory and historical support. Further, such a rule would provide a more workable structure for determining when discrimination is unfair...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pension program design and management do not adequately ensure that only veterans with financial need receive pension benefits. While the pension program is means tested, there is no prohibition on transferring assets prior to applying for benefits. Other means-tested programs, such as Medicaid, conduct a look-back review to determine if an individual has transferred assets at less than fair market value, and if so, may deny benefits {{for a period of}} time, known as the penalty period. This control helps ensure that only those in financial need receive benefits. In contrast, VA <b>pension</b> <b>claimants</b> can transfer assets for less than fair market value immediately prior to applying and be approved for benefits. For example, GAO identified a case where a claimant transferred over a million dollars less than 3 months prior to applying and was granted benefits. Also, VAs process for assessing initial eligibility is inadequate in several key respects. The application form does not ask for some sources of income and assets such as private retirement income, annuities, and trusts. As a result, VA lacks complete information on a claimants financial situation. Also, the form does not ask about asset transfersinformation VA needs to determine whether these assets should be included when assessing eligibility. In addition, VA does not verify all the information it does request on the form. For example, VA does not routinely request supporting documents, such as bank statements or tax records, unless questions are raised. VAs fiduciary program, which appoints individuals to manage the financial affairs of beneficiaries who are unable to do so themselves, collects financial information that may affect some pension recipients eligibility, but VA pension claims processors {{do not have access to}} all this information. Further, guidance on when assets should be included as part of a claimants net worth is unclear; and VA claims processors must use their own discretion when assessing eligibility for benefits, which can lead to inconsistent decisions. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{events in}} several {{countries}} have underscored the importance of good governance in private occupational pension plans. The present Paper uses contract theory to analyse the interplay of residual claims and control rights in private <b>pensions.</b> The residual <b>claimant</b> is the plan sponsor in a defined benefit (DB) plan and the pool of beneficiaries in a defined contribution (DC) plan. The main control rights we examine relate to decisions on funding, asset allocation, and asset management. Under complete contracting, governance can {{be shown to be}} neutral: DC and DB plans differ only on risk allocation. If instead contracts are incomplete, a DB (DC) plan should: (1) Assign more vigilance responsibility to the sponsor (beneficiaries); (2) Rely less (more) on trustees; (3) Tend to employ trustees that are professional experts (caring insiders); (4) Assign asset allocation rights to the sponsor (beneficiaries); (5) have strict funding requirements. governance; pension fund; private pension...|$|R
