40|$|Numerous surveys at the {{national}} and regional level have demonstrated that large inequalities in infant health status exist in Southern Africa. Few studies have assessed infant mortality at the intra-urban scale of geographic analysis. Comparisons between infant mortality rates from different areas are made even more meaningful if the data are divided into two primary categories based on period-of-death; these being the neonatal and post-neonatal components. This study {{presents the results of}} a survey undertaken in Metropolitan Cape Town (population 1. 6 million) during 1982. The aim was to determine the spatial variation of neonatal and post-neonatal mortality at the suburb (or community) level within the city. Overall, a total of 36, 789 live births and 928 infant deaths were recorded; 53. 4 % in the neonatal period and 46. 6 % in the post-neonatal period. The mean infant mortality rate was 25. 2 per 1000 live births; the neonatal mortality rate and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> being 13. 5 / 1000 and 11. 7 / 1000, respectively. A marked range in death rates was evident for both components. For the neonatal category it was 0. 0 - 49. 9 / 1000 and 0. 0 - 40. 0 / 1000 for the post-neonatal period. The generally low <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> among the 69 suburbs studied has made the neonatal component the dominant contributor to the infant mortality rate. However, in the lowest socio-economic areas the <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> was responsible for over 60 % of infant deaths. The results from this study clearly support the assumption of an inverse relationship between socio-economic status and infant death rates, particularly for the most socially deprived areas where the post-neonatal mortality rates were four to five times higher than compared with higher socio-economic suburbs. Spatial analysis found that variations in infant mortality rates were significantly correlated with variations in the distribution of socio-economic status. neonatal mortality post-neonatal mortality infant mortality spatial epidemiology socio-economic status intra-urban variation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Data from {{municipal}} databases {{can be used}} to plan interventions {{aimed at}} reducing inequities in health care. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the distribution of infant mortality according to an urban geoeconomic classification using routinely collected municipal data. METHODS: All live births (total of 42, 381) and infant deaths (total of 731) that occurred between 1994 and 1998 in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, were considered. Four different geoeconomic areas were defined according to the family head's income in each administrative urban zone. RESULTS: The trends for infant mortality rate and its different components, neonatal mortality rate and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate,</b> decreased in Ribeirão Preto from 1994 to 1998 (chi-square for trend, p< 0. 05). These rates were inversely correlated with the distribution of lower salaries in the geoeconomic areas (less than 5 minimum wages per family head), in particular the <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> (chi-square for trend, p< 0. 05). Finally, the poor area showed a steady increase in excess infant mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that infant mortality rates are associated with social inequality and can be monitored using municipal databases. The findings also suggest an increase in the impact of social inequality on infant health in Ribeirão Preto, especially in the poor area. The monitoring of health inequalities using municipal databases may be an increasingly more useful tool given the continuous decentralization of health management at the municipal level in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on birth outcomes and infant survival in rural Mozambique. Pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic were recruited. These women and their infants were followed-up for one year. Birth outcomes were assessed at delivery and infant HIV status was deter-mined at 1 and 12 months of age. Women positive for HIV {{were more likely to}} have anemia at delivery than women negative for HIV (51. 3 % versus 35. 4 %; P < 0. 001). Infants born to HIV-positive mothers had a significantly higher <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> than infants born to HIV-negative mothers (7. 8 % versus 1. 9 %; P < 0. 001). The rate of transmis-sion of HIV by breastfeeding during the first year of life was 15. 1 % (95 % confidence interval = CI 7. 6 – 22. 4).

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the changes in}} infant mortality and morbidity in four regions in the United States has revealed high levels of health problems among the infants of two groups of mothers: those {{less than or equal to}} 17 years and 18 - 19 year-old multiparas, many of whom began their childbearing under age 18. Despite decreases over the period of observation, neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> remain over one and a half times as high for infants of these mothers as for other mothers, largely due to the relatively high proportion of low birthweight (LBW) infants born to these mothers. <b>Post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> also remain high, and may be increasing; this change cannot be explained solely by differences in proportion of LBW infants between these and older mothers. Both the high <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and the type of morbidity experienced by surviving infants is consistent with the socioeconomic disadvantage of young mothers. The data further indicate the limited resources available to these mothers to cope with their children's health needs, and their potential vulnerability to decreases in public programs supporting child health care...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of prenatal sex-detection technologies in India {{has led to}} a phenomenal increase in abortion of female fetuses. We investigate their impact on son-biased fertility stopping behavior, parental investments in girls relative to boys, and the relative chances of girls surviving after birth.

For every five aborted girls, we estimate that roughly one additional girl survives to age five. The results are not driven by endogenous compositional shifts, being robust to the inclusion of mother fixed effects.

The study utilized a pooled cross-sectional ecological analysis using panel data from Brazilian microregions, and controlled for measures of physicians and hospital beds per 1000 population, Hepatitis B coverage, the proportion of women without prenatal care and with no formal education, low birth weight births, population size, and poverty rates. The data covered all the 557 Brazilian microregions over a 6 -year period (1999 - 2004). Results show that IMR declined about 13 percent from 1999 to 2004, while Family Health Program coverage increased {{from an average of}} about 14 to nearly 60 percent.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} if the Apgar score remains pertinent {{in contemporary}} practice {{after more than}} 50 years of wide use, and to assess {{the value of the}} Apgar score in predicting infant survival, expanding from the neonatal to the post-neonatal period. Methods: The U. S. linked live birth and infant death dataset was used, which included 25, 168, 052 singleton births and 768, 305 twin births. The outcome of interest was infant death within 1 year after birth. Cox proportional hazard-model was used to estimate risk ratio of infant mortality with different Apgar scores. Results: Among births with a very low Apgar score at five minutes (1 – 3), the neonatal and post-neonatal mortality rates remained high until term ($ 37 weeks). On the other hand, among births with a high Apgar score ($ 7), neonatal and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> decreased progressively with gestational age. Non-Hispanic White had a consistently higher neonatal mortality than non-Hispanic Black in both preterm and term births. However, for post-neonatal mortality, Black had significantly higher rate than White. The pattern of changes in neonatal and post-neonatal mortality by Apgar score in twin births is essentially the same as that in singleton births. Conclusions: The Apgar score system has continuing value for predicting neonatal and post-neonatal adverse outcomes in term as well as preterm infants, and is applicable to twins and in various race/ethnic groups...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To obtain {{population}} {{estimates and}} profile {{risk factors for}} infant mortality in two birth cohorts and compare them among cities of different regions in Brazil. METHODS: In Ribeirão Preto, southeast Brazil, infant mortality was determined in a third of hospital live births (2, 846 singleton deliveries) in 1994. In São Luís, northeast Brazil, data were obtained using systematic sampling of births stratified by maternity unit (2, 443 singleton deliveries) in 1997 - 1998. Mothers answered standardized questionnaires shortly after delivery and information on infant deaths was retrieved from hospitals, registries and the States Health Secretarys' Office. The relative risk (RR) was estimated by Poisson regression. RESULTS: In São Luís, the infant mortality rate was 26. 6 / 1, 000 live births, the neonatal mortality rate was 18. 4 / 1, 000 and the <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> was 8. 2 / 1, 000, all higher than those observed in Ribeirão Preto (16. 9, 10. 9 and 6. 0 per 1, 000, respectively). Adjusted analysis revealed that previous stillbirths (RR= 3. 67 vs 4. 13) and maternal age < 18 years (RR= 2. 62 vs 2. 59) were risk factors for infant mortality in the two cities. Inadequate prenatal care (RR= 2. 00) and male sex (RR= 1. 79) were risk factors in São Luís only, and a dwelling with 5 or more residents was a protective factor (RR= 0. 53). In Ribeirão Preto, maternal smoking was associated with infant mortality (RR= 2. 64).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the trends of infant mortality from 1995 to 1999 {{according to a}} geographic area-based measure of maternal education in Porto Alegre, Brazil. METHODS: A registry-based study was carried out and a municipal database created in 1994 was used. All live births (n= 119, 170) and infant deaths (n= 1, 934) were considered. Five different geographic areas were defined according to quintiles {{of the percentage of}} low maternal educational level (< 6 years of schooling) : high, medium high, medium, medium low, and low. The chi-square test for trend was used to compare rates between years. Incidence rate ratio was calculated using Poisson regression to identify excess infant mortality in poorer areas compared to higher schooling areas. RESULTS: The infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> (IMR) decreased steadily from 18. 38 deaths per 1, 000 live births in 1995 to 12. 21 in 1999 (chi-square for trend p< 0. 001). Both neonatal and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> decreased although the drop seemed to be steeper for the post-neonatal component. The higher decline was seen in poorer areas. CONCLUSION: Inequalities in IMR seem to have decreased due to a steeper reduction in both neonatal and post-neonatal components of infant mortality in lower maternal schooling area...|$|R
40|$|One {{literature}} documents a significant, black-white gap {{in average}} test scores, while another finds a substantial narrowing {{of the gap}} during the 1980 's, and stagnation in convergence after. We use two data sources - the Long Term Trends NAEP and AFQT scores for the universe of applicants to the U. S. military between 1976 and 1991 - to show: 1) the 1980 's convergence is due to relative improvements across successive cohorts of blacks born between 1963 and the early 1970 's and not a secular narrowing in the gap over time; and 2) the across-cohort gains were concentrated among blacks in the South. We then demonstrate that the timing and variation across states in the AFQT convergence closely tracks racial convergence in measures of health and hospital access {{in the years immediately}} following birth. We show that the AFQT convergence is highly correlated with <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> and not with neonatal mortality and low birth weight rates, and that this result cannot be explained by schooling desegregation and changes in family background. We conclude that investments in health through increased access at very early ages have large, long-term effects on achievement, and that the integration of hospitals during the 1960 's affected the test performance of black teenagers in the 1980 's...|$|R
40|$|Background: Variation in birth {{registration}} criteria may compromise international {{comparisons of}} fetal and infant mortality. We examined {{the effect of}} birth registration practices on fetal and infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> to determine whether observed differences in perinatal and infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were artifacts of birth registration or reflected true differences in health status. Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort study was done using data from Canada, United States, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from 1995 – 2005. Main outcome measures included live births by gestational age and birth weight; gestational age—and birth weight-specific stillbirth rates; neonatal, post-neonatal, and cause-specific infant mortality. Results: Proportion of live births < 22 weeks varied substantially: Sweden (not reported), Iceland (0. 00 %), Finland (0. 001 %), Denmark (0. 01 %), Norway (0. 02 %), Canada (0. 07 %) and United States (0. 08 %). At 22 – 23 weeks, neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were highest in Canada (892. 2 per 1000 live births), Denmark (879. 3) and Iceland (1000. 0), moderately high in the United States (724. 1), Finland (794. 3) and Norway (739. 0) and low in Sweden (561. 2). Stillbirth:live birth ratios at 22 – 23 weeks were significantly lower in the United States (79. 2 stillbirths per 100 live births) and Finland (90. 8) than in Canada (112. 1), Iceland (176. 2) and Norway (173. 9). Crude neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were 83 % higher in Canada and 96 % higher in the United States than Finland. Neonatal <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> among live births ≥ 28 weeks were lower in Canada and United States compared with Finland. <b>Post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were higher in Canada and United States than in Nordic countries. Conclusions: Live birth frequencies and stillbirth and neonatal mortality patterns at the borderline of viability are likely {{due to differences in}} birth registration practices, although true differences in maternal, fetal and infant health cannot be ruled out. This study emphasises the need for further standardisations, in order to enhance the relevance of international comparisons of infant mortality. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} to investigate {{the hypothesis that the}} residential concentration of poverty affects health status more deeply than when poverty is randomly scattered in a given geographical area. To characterize the geographic pattern of poverty in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, an index that measures the heterogeneity of poverty concentration among sub-areas was proposed. We used census data and defined poverty by means of the household head monthly income. The 153 neighborhoods that compose the city were used as the geographic units, and the census tracts as the sub-areas. The proposed index measures differences of poverty concentration across census tracts within a neighborhood. The effects of geographic poverty clustering on infant mortality related variables (early neonatal mortality rate; post-neonatal mortality rate; proportion of adolescent mothers; and fertility rate among adolescents) were estimated by partial correlation coefficients, controlling for the neighborhood poverty rate. Our study revealed that intra-city variations of the <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> are associated with geographic patterns of poverty, and that pregnancy in adolescence is strongly and contextually correlated with intra-neighborhood poverty clustering, even after adjustment for the poverty rate. The evidence of relevant health differences associated with the spatial concentration of poverty supports the hypothesis that properties of the environment of residence contextually influence health. Our findings suggest that prevention of some infant mortality related problems has to be focused directly on features of communities, considering their physical, cultural and psychosocial characteristics, being of particular concern the health of communities segregated from the society at large by extreme poverty.

To isolate the effect of Gavi funding in our primary model, we controlled for known and likely predictors of child mortality.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} quality of records for live births and infant deaths and to {{estimate}} the infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> for skin color or race, in order to explore possible racial inequalities in health. METHODS Descriptive study that analyzed {{the quality of}} records of the Live Births Information System and Mortality Information System in Rondônia, Brazilian Amazonian, between 2006 - 2009. The infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated for skin color or race with the direct method and corrected by: (1) proportional distribution of deaths with missing data related to skin color or race; and (2) application of correction factors. We also calculated proportional mortality by causes and age groups. RESULTS The capture of live births and deaths improved in relation to 2006 - 2007, which required lower correction factors to estimate infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate.</b> The risk of death of indigenous infant (31. 3 / 1, 000 live births) was higher than that noted for the other skin color or race groups, exceeding by 60 % the infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> in Rondônia (19. 9 / 1, 000 live births). Black children had the highest neonatal infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate,</b> while the indigenous had the highest <b>post-neonatal</b> infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate.</b> Among the indigenous deaths, 15. 2 % were due to ill-defined causes, while the other groups did not exceed 5. 4 %. The proportional infant mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases was higher among indigenous children (12. 1 %), while among black children it occurred due to external causes (8. 7 %). CONCLUSIONS Expressive inequalities in infant mortality were noted between skin color or race categories, more unfavorable for indigenous infants. Correction factors proposed in the literature lack to consider differences in underreporting of deaths for skin color or race.

40|$|Abstract Background The Programme for the Awareness and Elimination of Diarrhoea (PAED) was a pilot {{comprehensive}} diarrhoea {{prevention and}} control programme aimed to reduce post-neonatal, all-cause under-five mortality by 15  % in Lusaka Province. Interventions included {{introduction of the}} rotavirus vaccine, improved clinical case management of diarrhoea, and a comprehensive community prevention and advocacy campaign on hand washing with soap, exclusive breastfeeding up to 6  months of age, {{and the use of}} ORS and Zinc. This study aimed {{to assess the impact of}} PAED on under- 5 mortality. Methods The study was a pre-post evaluation design. The Demographic and Health Survey style population-based two-stage approach was used to collect data at the beginning of the intervention and 3  years following the start of intervention implementation in Lusaka province. The primary outcome of interest was an all-cause, post-neonatal under-five mortality rate defined as the probability of dying after the 28 th day and before the fifth birthday among children aged 1 – 59 months. The Kaplan-Meier time to event analysis was used to estimate the probability of death; multiplying this probability by 1000 to yield the <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rate.</b> Survival-time inverse probability weighting model was used to estimate Average Treatment Effect (ATE). Results The percentage of children under age 5 who had diarrhoea in the last 2  weeks preceding the survey declined from 15. 8  % (95  % CI: 15. 2  %, 16. 4  %) in 2012 to 12. 7  % (95  % CI: 12. 3  %, 13. 2  %) in 2015. Over the same period, mortality in post-neonatal children under 5  years of age declined by 34  %, from an estimated rate of 29 deaths per 1000 live births (95 % CI: (26, 32) death per 1000 live births) to 19 deaths per 1000 live births (95 % CI: (16, 21) death per 1000 live births). When every child in the population of children aged 1 – 59 months is exposed to the intervention, the average time-to-death was estimated to be about 8  months more than when no child is exposed (ATE[*]=[*] 7. 9; 95 % CI: 4. 4, 11. 5; P[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Young {{maternal}} age {{has long}} been associated with higher infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates,</b> but the role of socioeconomic factors in this association has been controversial. We sought to investigate the relationships between infant mortality (distinguishing neonatal from post-neonatal deaths), socioeconomic status and maternal age in a large, retrospective cohort study. Methods We conducted a population-based cohort study using linked birth-death certificate data for Missouri residents during 1997 – 1999. Infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> for all singleton births to adolescent women (12 – 17 years, n = 10, 131; 18 – 19 years, n = 18, 954) were compared to those for older women (20 – 35 years, n = 28, 899). Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for all potential associations. Results The risk of infant (OR 1. 95, CI 1. 54 – 2. 48), neonatal (1. 69, 1. 24 – 2. 31) and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> (2. 47, 1. 70 – 3. 59) were significantly higher for younger adolescent (12 – 17 years) than older (20 – 34 years) mothers. After adjusting for race, marital status, age-appropriate education level, parity, smoking status, prenatal care utilization, and poverty status (indicated by participation in WIC, food stamps or Medicaid), the risk of <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> (1. 73, 1. 14 – 2. 64) but not neonatal mortality (1. 43, 0. 98 – 2. 08) remained significant for younger adolescent mothers. There were no differences in neonatal or <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> risks for older adolescent (18 – 19 years) mothers.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} family leave policy on eight child health outcomes - five age specific child <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> (infant, perinatal, neonatal, <b>post-neonatal,</b> and child <b>mortality</b> <b>rates),</b> low birth weight, and immunization rates for measles and DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) across 19 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1969 to 2010. In addition, this dissertation investigates {{the extent to which}} the effects of leave policy vary by period and across welfare regimes. This research contributes to the existing literature (Ruhm, 2000; Tanaka, 2005) by including one additional country, South Korea, a highly developed but considerably understudied country, and by incorporating data from 2001 to 2010. I use data on family leave policy from Ruhm (2000) and Tanaka (2005) and extend it using data from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Health Organization (WHO), International Labour Organization (ILO), and World Bank. Additional data sources include the United States Social Security Administration (SSA), International Social Security Association (ISSA), and various government sources. I estimate the effects of family leave policy (specially, number of weeks provided) - considering both job protected paid leave and other leave (unpaid or non-job protected leave) - on child health using ordinary least squares (OLS) models. I control for other relevant variables including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, health expenditures, healthcare coverage, dialysis patients, and fertility and female employment rates. I also include: (1) country fixed effects; (2) year fixed effects; and (3) country-time trend interactions. Missing values are imputed 20 times using the predictive mean matching method. The results suggest job protected paid leave significantly reduces infant mortality (deaths less than 1 year of age) and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> (deaths between 1 month and 1 year of age). In particular, the largest effects of job protected paid leave are found in reducing post-neonatal mortality; the effects are robust throughout all model specifications. Comparing the effects of other leave (unpaid or non-job protected) and job protected paid leave, other leave has no significant effects on any of the outcome indicators. This suggests that parents do not respond to leave provided without adequate payment benefits or job protection, and mothers may return to work early. As a result, other leave does not have any significant effects on infant health. When investigating the effects of family leave policy by period with models estimated separately by two time periods, somewhat larger effects of job protected paid leave on <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> are found in the earlier period (1969 - 1989) compared to the later period (1990 - 2010); however, the difference in the policy effects between the two periods is not statistically significant. This difference may be explained by the fact that it was during the earlier period when most OECD countries provided leave for the first critical weeks and months after birth. In addition, when examining the effects of leave policy by welfare regime type with models estimated separately by regime type, larger effects of job protected paid leave on <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> are found in the Social Democratic and Conservative regimes than in the other regime types; however, the difference in the policy effects across regime types is not statistically significant. This difference may be explained partly by the fact that overall Social Democratic and Conservative welfare state countries provide more generous payment benefits for parents on leave. The concluding section discusses how these findings compare to previous research and explores future research and policy implications...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} some factors {{affecting}} the spatial and diachronic variability {{of the infant}} mortality in Italy are discussed together with the age structure and the seasonal pattern of infant deaths in Sardinia.

Sardinia {{seems to have been}} in better conditions since his infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> appears to be lower compared to all the other Italian regions. This advantage depends crucially on the very low risk for new-borns to die in the first month.

40|$|Background: A high {{twinning}} {{rate and}} {{an increased risk of}} mortality among twins contribute to the high burden of infant mortality in Africa. This study examined the contribution of twins to neonatal and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> in The Gambia, and evaluated factors that contribute to the excess mortality among twins. Methods: We analysed data from the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System (BHDSS) collected from January 2009 to December 2013. Demographic and epidemiological variables were assessed for their association with mortality in different age groups. Results: We included 32, 436 singletons and 1083 twins in the analysis (twining rate 16. 7 / 1000 deliveries). Twins represented 11. 8 % of all neonatal deaths and 7. 8 % of <b>post-neonatal</b> deaths. <b>Mortality</b> among twins was higher than in singletons [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4. 33 (95 % CI: 3. 09, 6. 06) in the neonatal period and 2. 61 (95 % CI: 1. 85, 3. 68) in the <b>post-neonatal</b> period]. <b>Post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> among twins increased in girls (P for interaction = 0. 064), being born during the dry season (P for interaction = 0. 030) and lacking access to clean water (P for interaction = 0. 042). Conclusion: Mortality among twins makes a significant contribution to the high burden of neonatal and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> in The Gambia and preventive interventions targeting twins should be prioritized...|$|R

The main {{focus was on}} avoidable causes of neonatal and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality.</b> METHODS: Sources of data were the Sistema de Informações em Mortalidade do Ministério da Saúde (SIM-MS) [Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health] and Fundação Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) [Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics Foundation] (official live birth and death records) for the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, in the State of Minas Gerais. A simple linear regression model {{was used to evaluate}} time-trends of <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> Statistical significance of the inclination of the regression curves was considered for the p< 0. 05 level. RESULTS: During the 15 year period in question, the infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> declined from 48. 5 to 22. 1 / 1, 000 live births. However, the most accentuated decrease was observed during the last four years of the study period. The post-neonatal group was greatly responsible for this decline both in the capital and in the other districts within the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte. CONCLUSIONS: Although a significant decrease in the infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> has been observed, particularly in the <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality,</b> it is still larger than the rates found in developed countries. Deaths due to perinatal morbidities as well as the group of causes represented by diarrhea-pneumonia-malnutrition still present an important potential for reduction.

40|$|Rates {{of infant}} death {{are one of}} the most common {{indicators}} of a population’s overall health status. Infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> (IMRs) are used to make broad inferences about the quality of health care, effects of health policies and even environmental quality. The purpose of our study was threefold: i) to examine the characteristics of births in the area in relation to gestational age and birthweight; ii) to estimate infant mortality using variable gestational age and/or birthweight criteria for live birth, and iii) to calculate proportional mortality ratios for each cause of death using variable gestational age and/or birthweight criteria for live birth. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all Shelby County resident-linked birth and infant death certificates during the years 1999 to 2004. Descriptive test statistics were used to examine infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in relation to specific maternal and infant risk factors. Through careful examination of 1999 - 2004 resident-linked birth and infant death data sets, we observed a disproportionate number of non-viable live births (≤ 20 weeks gestation or ≤ 350 grams) in Shelby County. Issuance of birth certificates to these non-viable neonates is a factor that contributes to an inflated IMR. Our study demonstrates the complexity and the appropriateness of comparing infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> in smaller geographic units, given the unique characteristics of live births in Shelby County. The disproportionate number of pre-viable infants born in Shelby County greatly obfuscates neonatal mortality and de-emphasizes the importance of <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality...</b>|$|R
40|$|Este artigo refere-se à pesquisa acerca do padrão espacial dos componentes {{neonatal}} e pós-neonatal da mortalidade infantil em Goiânia, no Estado de Goiás, Brasil. A população do estudo foi a coorte de 101 mil nascidos vivos, residentes em Goiânia, de 1992 a 1996. As probabilidades de morte infantil foram estimadas mediante o cotejo dos arquivos de óbitos e de nascidos vivos. Para minimizar as flutuações aleatórias das taxas, empregou-se o método Bayesiano empírico. A unidade de análise do padrão espacial foi constituída pelos 65 distritos urbanos de planejamento. Para análise de autocorrelação espacial foram utilizados: Moran "global", Moran local e estatística Gi* local. Os componentes neonatal e pós-neonatal da mortalidade infantil evidenciaram autocorrelação espacial estatisticamente significativa. No período pós-neonatal, os distritos de risco concentram-se nas regiões periféricas do município. No período neonatal, o padrão de ocorrência é heterogêneo, havendo distritos de alto risco distribuídos em todas as regiões, inclusive na região Central de Goiânia. The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate the spatial pattern of neonatal and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> in the city of Goiânia, Central Brazil.

An ecological time-series study was conducted using the Information Systems on Live Births and Mortality, produced by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> (IMR) decreased by 45. 2 % from 1990 to 2000, from 26. 3 per 1000 live births to 14. 4, or a mean annual reduction of 5. 34 % (R² = 0. 9397; p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Those {{interested}} in child survival frequently cite {{and follow the}} under-five <b>mortality</b> <b>rate.</b> While a useful measure, the under-five <b>mortality</b> <b>rate</b> lumps together neonatal and <b>post-neonatal</b> <b>mortality</b> with deaths in the 1 – 4 year period. Unfortunately, this hampers public health decision making about the most appropriate child survival strategies as children survive beyond {{their first year of}} life. The first year of life is unquestionably a risky one {{in many parts of the}} world, with the neonatal period being particularly fraught with danger. An assessment of under-five deaths in 187 countries published in 2010 estimated over 40 % of the 7. 7 million under-five deaths in 2010 occurred during the first 27 days, with another 30 % occurring from the 28 th to 364 th day of life [1]. Analyses show the main drivers of neonatal deaths are sepsis, birth asphyxia, congenital abnormalities and preterm complications, whereas deaths occurring in the post-neonatal period most frequently arise from infectious conditions such as pneumonia and diarrhoea [2]. This special issue on child injury prevention highlights a range of issues and injury mechanisms which progressively account for a greater proportion of child mortality following infancy.
