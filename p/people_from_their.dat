5|$|Prior to its arrival, {{flooding}} {{across the}} central United States killed six people, forced thousands of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> homes, and left at least $76million in damage (1986USD). Additional flooding from Paine exacerbated the situation; the flooding affected 52 of the 77 counties in Oklahoma, {{which resulted in}} a total of $350 million in damage, half of which from agriculture. The remnants of Paine brought {{about the end of the}} extended period of rainfall, which overall had forced 55,000 <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> homes, including 1,200 in East Saint Louis, Illinois where a floodgate broke. It was described as one of the worst floods in Oklahoma history.|$|E
5|$|At noon on Wednesday, June 2, J. Donald Cameron banged his gavel to {{commence}} {{the beginning of}} the seventh Republican National Convention. As instructed, Cameron placed the nomination for Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman. The nomination was passed unanimously. Later, delegates John H. Roberts of Illinois and Christopher L. Magee of Pennsylvania were made temporary convention secretaries. Senator Eugene Hale of Maine submitted a resolution for a roll call, in which the chairman of each delegation would announce the <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> delegation serving on the convention's three committees. The committees were formed, and the convention was adjourned at five minutes past three in the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} caused {{flooding in}} the state of Veracruz. Thousands of people were forced from their homes as rivers rose, including upwards of 30,000fleeing for shelter after the Tuxpan River exceeded its bank. About 8,000residents of the city of Álamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept away, while debris such as tree branches and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, and rocks blocked numerous roads in the area. In combination with Hurricane Kristy in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 50,000people were left homeless in Mexico. At least 20fatalities were attributed to Debby.|$|E

25|$|The {{intensity}} {{of contact with}} European settlers resulted in the gradual displacement of Delaware <b>peoples</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> aboriginal homeland, {{in a series of}} complex population movements involving displacement and consolidation of small local groups, extending over a period of more than two hundred years. The currently used names were gradually applied to the larger groups resulting from this process. The ultimate result was the displacement of virtually all Delaware-speaking <b>peoples</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> homeland to Oklahoma, Kansas, Wisconsin, upstate New York, and Canada.|$|R

5|$|In Mexico, Paine {{produced}} rainfall along {{much of the}} coastline, with maxima in inland Oaxaca, Jalisco, and Sonora {{where it}} moved ashore. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the remnants of Paine in the United States, there was an extended period of heavy rainfall, which caused at least 10deaths, forced thousands of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> homes, and resulted in heavy flooding damage. The moisture from Paine produced the highest daily rainfall for any station in Oklahoma. Severe river flooding occurred along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The overall flooding event caused $350 million in damage, of which half came from crop losses.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Wars were {{a series}} of {{conflicts}} {{that took place in}} New Zealand between 1845 and 1872. The two conflicts where soldiers were awarded the Victoria Cross were the First Taranaki War of 18601861 and the Waikato-Hauhau Māori War of 18631866. The First Taranaki War was fought over land rights on New Zealand's North Island. The local Colonial Governor had set up a policy whereby the British Government could buy local land, and anyone refusing to sell their land would be committing treason against the Crown. When the Te Atiawa refused to sell their land, the British Army attacked on 17 March 1860, starting the First Taranaki War. After {{a series of}} sieges by the British, a truce was signed with the Māori people in March 1861; the disputed land became British-owned territory but it remained in possession of the Māori people. The First Taranaki War ended in a stalemate over the one area of disputed land. By 1863 the influx of settlers and consequent demand for land led to further conflict. In July 1863, the British Army and the Auckland Militia launched the Invasion of Waikato against the forces of Tāwhiao and the Māori King Movement. The British expelled the Māori <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> lands, swiftly moving south, culminating in the defeat and flight of Tāwhiao at Ōrākau in March 1864. The British pursued him across the country as far as the fourth Waikato defensive line, which later became the border of King Country.|$|E
