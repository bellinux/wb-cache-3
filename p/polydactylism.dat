60|$|In {{the above}} work (vol. ii. p. 12), I also attributed, though with much hesitation, the {{frequent}} cases of <b>polydactylism</b> {{in men and}} various animals to reversion. I was partly led to this through Prof. Owen's statement, {{that some of the}} Ichthyopterygia possess more than five digits, and therefore, as I supposed, had retained a primordial condition; but Prof. Gegenbaur ('Jenaischen Zeitschrift,' B. v. Heft 3, s. 341), disputes Owen's conclusion. On the other hand, according to the opinion lately advanced by Dr. Gunther, on the paddle of Ceratodus, which is provided with articulated bony rays on both sides of a central chain of bones, there seems no great difficulty in admitting that six or more digits on one side, or on both sides, might reappear through reversion. I am informed by Dr. Zouteveen that there is a case on record of a man having twenty-four fingers and twenty-four toes! I was chiefly led {{to the conclusion that the}} presence of supernumerary digits might be due to reversion from the fact that such digits, not only are strongly inherited, but, as I then believed, had the power of regrowth after amputation, like the normal digits of the lower vertebrata. But I have explained in the second edition of my Variation under Domestication why I now place little reliance on the recorded cases of such regrowth. Nevertheless it deserves notice, inasmuch as arrested development and reversion are intimately related processes; that various structures in an embryonic or arrested condition, such as a cleft palate, bifid uterus, etc., are frequently accompanied by <b>polydactylism.</b> This has been strongly insisted on by Meckel and Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire. But at present it is the safest course to give up altogether the idea that there is any relation between the development of supernumerary digits and reversion to some lowly organised progenitor of man.) There are other cases which come more strictly under our present head of reversion. Certain structures, regularly occurring in the lower members of the group to which man belongs, occasionally make their appearance in him, though not found in the normal human embryo; or, if normally present in the human embryo, they become abnormally developed, although in a manner which is normal in the lower members of the group. These remarks will be rendered clearer by the following illustrations.|$|E

60|$|Supernumerary {{fingers and}} toes are eminently liable, as various authors have insisted, to be inherited. <b>Polydactylism</b> {{graduates}} (12/27. Vrolik has discussed this point at full length in a work published in Dutch, from which Sir J. Paget has kindly translated for me passages. See, also, Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' 1832 tome 1 page 684.) by multifarious steps from a mere cutaneous appendage, not including any bone, to a double hand. But an additional digit, supported on a metacarpal bone, and furnished with all the proper muscles, nerves, and vessels, is sometimes so perfect, that it escapes detection, unless the fingers are actually counted. Occasionally there are several supernumerary digits; but usually only one, making the total number six. This one may {{be attached to the}} inner or outer margin of the hand, representing either a thumb or little finger, the latter being the more frequent. Generally, through the law of correlation, both hands and both feet are similarly affected. Dr. Burt Wilder has tabulated (12/28. 'Massachusetts Medical Society' volume 2 No. 3; and 'Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist.' volume 14 1871 page 154.) a large number of cases, and finds that supernumerary digits are more common on the hands than on the feet, and that men are affected oftener than women. Both these facts can be explained on two principles which seem generally to hold good; firstly, that of two parts, the more specialised one is the more variable, and the arm is more highly specialised than the leg; and secondly that male animals are more variable than females.|$|E
6000|$|Additional digits {{have been}} {{observed}} in negroes {{as well as in}} other races of man, and in several of the lower animals, and have been inherited. Six toes have been described on the hind feet of the newt (Salamandra cristata), and are said to have occurred with the frog. It deserves notice, that the six-toed newt, though adult, preserved some of its larval characters; for part of the hyoidal apparatus, which is properly absorbed during the act of metamorphosis, was retained. It is also remarkable {{that in the case of}} man various structures in an embryonic or arrested state of development, such as a cleft-palate, bifid uterus, etc., are often accompanied by <b>polydactylism.</b> (12/31. Meckel and Isid G. St. Hilaire insist on this fact. See also M. A. Roujou 'Sur quelques Analogies du Type Humain' page 61 published, I believe, in the 'Journal of the Anthropolog. Soc. of Paris' January 1872.) Six toes on the hinder feet are known to have been inherited for three generations of cats. In several breeds of the fowl the hinder toe is double, and is generally transmitted truly, as is well shown when Dorkings are crossed with common four-toed breeds (12/32. 'The Poultry Chronicle' 1854 page 559.) With animals which have properly less than five digits, the number is sometimes increased to five, especially on the front legs, though rarely carried beyond that number; but this is due to the development of a digit already existing in a more or less rudimentary state. Thus, the dog has properly four toes behind, but in the larger breeds a fifth toe is commonly, though not perfectly, developed. Horses, which properly have one toe alone fully developed with rudiments of the others, have been described with each foot bearing two or three small separate hoofs: analogous facts have been noticed with cows, sheep, goats, and pigs. (12/33. The statements in this paragraph are taken from Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. des Anomalies' tome 1 pages 688-693. Mr. Goodman gives, 'Phil. Soc. of Cambridge' November 25, 1872 the case of a cow with three well developed toes on each hind limb, besides the ordinary rudiments; and her calf by an ordinary bull had extra digits. This calf also bore two calves having extra digits.) ...|$|E

Based on comparison of in vitro differentiation potential into keratinocytes in four types of sweat gland cells, K 1 b+ luminal cells in duct only take three days to differentiate into K 14 +K 5 + keratinocytes and may responsible for restoring epidermal injure. Our data suggested that stem cells exist in duct part of sweat gland. We also designed a novel in vitro 3 D culture system for regeneration of secretory gland tissue. K 8 + secretory gland cells exhibited an excellent ability for building gland structure. Whether stem cells in duct is also contributed to reinforce secretory gland cell when dermal sweat gland injure occurs, it is still unclear.

40|$|A {{condition}} of <b>polydactylism</b> consisting {{of one or}} more medial super-numery digits on all four legs is described in indigenous pig of Papua New-Guinea.

The fore limb is not affected in the heterozygotes animals. The limbs were coloured by the alizarin sulfonic acid, according to Dawson's method, and examined in pure glycerin. A study of the articulation of the instep on microscopic slides after Masson's trichromic coloration was made on animals affected by partial or total hemimelia. The greater part of the skeletal lesions may be classified into 2 groups: anomalies by excess (hyperphalangism or preaxial <b>polydactylism)</b> and anomalies by defect (total or partial hemimelia of the zeugopode). These 2 malformations are not associated in the same limb although they can be found associated in both limbs of the same embryo.

In chickens, basic characteristics and rough dominant genes have been explored in past decades; however, the elaborate pattern of inheritance and the determinant gene remain obscure. In this study, different types of <b>polydactylism</b> were classified by the numbers and the shapes of toes, including the newly defined subtypes of B' and G, for the Beijing fatty chicken, a native breed of chicken from China. Through experiments on hybridization, we demonstrated a complete dominant inheritance of polydactyly instead of an incomplete penetrance or genetic modification of the previous conjecture. In particular, by using the F 2 population of the five-digit purebred line of Beijing fatty chicken backcrossed to Shiqiza chicken and by using restriction-site associated DNA based markers, we performed a genome-wide association study on the trait of polydactyly. Furthermore, whole genome resequencing strategy was applied to sweep SNPs across the whole genome.

40|$|ALTHOUGH non-parasitic cystic {{disease of}} the liver is a {{comparatively}} rare pathologic entity, it is encountered with sufficient frequency that the internist should certainly be aware of its manifestations. From {{a review of the}} literature it would appear that this condition can make itself evident at any period of life. Witzel * and Sanger and Klopp x in 1880 reported cases of large solitary cysts of the liver found in fetuses which, in both instances, were of such a size as to complicate delivery of the child. Bagot 3 in 1892 reported a similar case of a liver cyst containing 2 % gallons of fluid and complicating delivery. At the other extreme of life we find the oldest case in the literature reported in a patient of 82 by McCaughan and Rassieur. 4 These last authors analyzed 80 cases and found the average age at diagnosis to be 33 years. Beattie and Robertson 5 reviewed 62 cases and found that the diagnosis was made most commonly between the fourth and sixth decades. The female sex appears to have some predisposition to this condition. Various authors quote the incidence as varying between 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 of females over males. Heredity seems to play some part in certain instances. In a case of con-genital polycystic {{disease of the}} kidney and liver reported by Campbell, 6 two siblings of the patient were definitely known to have had cystic kidneys. Other congenital malformations, such as spina bifida, meningocele, <b>polydactylism,</b> vesical anomalies and hypospadias, have been found in association with cases of cystic liver disease.

40|$|The {{cause or}} causes of monstrosities have {{intrigued}} observers for many years. Many attempts {{to explain the}} origin of these beings {{have given rise to}} the wildest speculation. The curse of the gods, sexual congress with lower animals, or lunar influences, as is indicated by the very word "monster", meaning "moon-calf " were for a long time universally accepted causes. The most tenacious, and apparently well-supported notion of causality, specified the factor of maternal impression. The typical example, recurring with endless variations, is that of the pregnant mother being frightened by a frog hopping out from under a bush, and subsequently giving birth to a fetus resembling, more or less closely, a frog. That the appearance of monsters is not just an occasional happening but a very frequent event is emphasized by Mall 7, who states that seven out of every hundred pregnancies among human beings result in pathological embryos, many of which are aborted. This author, from experiments upon a variety of vertebrates, {{as well as from the}} study of pathological human ova, is of the opinion that the power to become a monster is present in every ovum. In recent years the problems of teratology have been attacked by the experimental method. This method, together with certain embryological and clinical facts, has disdosed two chief factors operative in maldevelopment as in normal development, namely, germinal and environmental. The evidence permits of no escape from the fact that many variations, anomalies, and malformations are hereditary. Harelip, albinism, and <b>polydactylism</b> are examples of this class. On the other hand, there is abundant evidence to indicate that untoward environmental conditions, including nutritive wants and vitamin deficiencies, are highly productive of monstrosities and the whole range of anomalous developmental results.
