40|$|The current {{agricultural}} {{paradigm in}} the U. S. is heavily biased towards {{the production and}} marketing of crops as commodities. This paradigm is kept in place by grain handling and marketing infrastructure, as well as government farm programs, designed for crops as commodities. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) and maize (Zea mays L.) grown for grain certainly fit into this current paradigm. A new approach to agricultural production and marketing, identity <b>preserved</b> <b>products,</b> is gaining in importance. This is made possible through new technologies and markets demanding products designed specifically for their needs. Examples of investment in identity <b>preserved</b> <b>products</b> include Pioneer Hi-Bred 2 ̆ 7 s new research facility for grain quality (Johnson 1995), DuPont 2 ̆ 7 s current emphasis on value-added maize (Freiberg 1994), and Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s value-added grain marketing program (Wrage 1995). However, marketing strategies for such new grain products must be outside the current norm of sale to a local elevator and resale of a bulk commodity to grain consumers. Sorghum and maize grown for forage are already outside of the current marketing structure for grain crops. They are typically grown, stored, and fed on the same farm. Management decisions including choice of hybrids can be based on end use. As such, {{it could be argued}} that the current paradigm for production and utilization of forages in the United States, especially annual forages, is very favorable for the development and marketing of identity preserved hybrids and varieties designed for specific end users...|$|E

40|$|The {{dispensing}} closure used for containers {{plays an important}} role in protecting cosmetics from in-use microbial contamination. This hypothesis was tested by aseptically packing unpreserved shampoo and skin lotion into containers with three different closure types which provided various degrees of protection against consumer and environmental microbial insults. Shampoo was packed in containers with slit-cap (n = 25), flip-cap (n = 25), or screw-cap (n = 28) closures. Skin lotion was packed in containers with pump-top (n = 21), flip-cap (n = 18), or screw-cap (n = 21) closures. The products were then used by volunteers under actual in-use conditions for 3 (shampoo) or 2 (skin lotion) weeks. After use, the products were evaluated for microbial contamination by using standard methods for enumeration and identification. The standard screw-cap closure provided only minimal protection against microbial contamination of both the shampoo (29 % contamination incidence) and the skin lotion (71 %). The slit-cap closure on the shampoo container and the flip-cap closure on the skin lotion container provided slightly enhanced degrees of protection (21 and 39 % contamination incidence, respectively). The greatest amount of protection (i. e., lowest contamination incidence) was provided by the flip-cap closure for the shampoo container (0 %) and the pump-top closure for the skin lotion container (10 %). As a result, closure type {{plays an important role}} in protecting poorly <b>preserved</b> <b>products</b> from in-use microbial contamination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fermented {{foods are}} those {{which have been}} {{subjected}} to the action of microorganism or enzyme so that the desirable biochemical changes cause significant modification to food. Many fermented milk products which are eaten as they are, contains living microorganisms. By tradition, Lactic acid bacteria are the most commonly used microorganism for preservation of food. Food additives are specifically added to prevent the deterioration of food which may be caused by microorganisms, by food enzymes or by purely chemical reactions. Food and Industrial microbiology have been a growing field of interest {{in the last couple of}} years. Researchers have concentrated their activities on studying the microbes linked with public health. Many of the fermented foods are <b>preserved</b> <b>products</b> in that their shelf life is extended considerably over that of the raw materials from which they are made. Microbial growth was thought necessary to either produce a sufficient number of cells or enough toxin to cause food borne illness. Since then researchers have done various studies and learned that several pathogens can grow at refrigeration temperature. Different samples of fermented dairy products were taken to check the effect of storage condition such as temperature and preservative on the microbial quality of these foods. Total bacterial count was determined in the sample. In the present study, it was observed that microorganisms were not prevalent at 0 °C,few at 4 °C and normal range at 37 °C and room temperature.

The aim of the project is to improve food transformation processes in developing countries through the production of small solar drying devices. Their goal is to reduce food waste and foster local economies through the marketing of correctly <b>preserved</b> <b>products.</b> The “light solar dryer” may also be used in self-production circuits, urban vegetable gardens and in short production chains. Dehydration {{is one of the oldest}} techniques for food preservation, it is still practiced in many areas around the world. It is established on an industrial level in developed countries, using hot air facilities envisaging high levels of energy consumption. It is also practiced with more sophisticated techniques that have been refined over the years. Whereas in Third World countries (but even in certain areas in southern Italy) dehydration is often practiced by subjecting foodstuff directly to the sunlight, which determines low sanitary qualities and restricted production capability. The concept of a “light solar dryer” regards an open system, that may be modified depending on the different contexts in which it will be applied, conceived as a product that can be self-built using easy techniques and available material – compatible with the places in which the device is to be used. The project is the result of cooperation between two university research groups: the DATA Department (Design and Architectural, Territorial, Environmental Technologies) - “La Sapienza” University of Rome (Italy) and the Department of Food Science - University of Foggia (Italy).

40|$|Citation: Washington, Rebecca Rees. Food adulterations [...] Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: The {{question}} of food adulterations is of very great importance {{at the present}} time, since the greater amount of our food supply consists of canned and <b>preserved</b> <b>products.</b> Not many years ago, canned food products were considered luxuries, and only people of means could afford them, but as times have grovel better, {{there is a growing}} demand, by all classes of people, for the manufactured goods, and it id the producer trying to meet the popular demand that has, in c great measure, facilitated the manufacture of goods which must necessarily be inferior. The average individual wants the greatest quantity for the least money, regardless of the purity of the article purchased. Manufacturers cannot give high grade food for low prices. Hence the pure product is imitated by using cheap, undesirable, and often poisonous, substances, to give the desired flavor and color. This brings to mind an instance under my own observation. A woman was purchasing baking powder. The clerk showed her several of the better brands and gave prices. She remarked that she wanted something cheaper and when shown the ten cent can, she took it. The law of the state of New York defines adulterations of food as follows: The term food shall include every article of food and drink used and adulterations are (1) If any substance or substances has or have been mixed with it so as to reduce or lower, or injuriously affect, its quality or strength. (2) If any inferior or cheaper substance or substances have been substituted, wholly or in part, for the article. (3) If any valuable material has been wholly or in part abstracted...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{relationships}} between coevally active fluvial and aeolian systems {{give rise to}} a range of styles of sedimentary interaction that are documented from both modern arid-climate systems and analogous ancient preserved outcrop and subsurface successions. Mixed fluvial and aeolian successions are known to form several major reservoirs for hydrocarbons, including the Permian Unayzah Formation of Saudi Arabia, the Permian Rotliegend Group of the North Sea, and the Jurassic Norphlet Sandstone of the Gulf of Mexico and typically give rise to stratigraphic heterogeneity at a number of scales. Quantitative stratigraphic prediction of the three-dimensional form of heterogeneities arising from fluvial and aeolian interaction is notoriously difficult: (i) the <b>preserved</b> <b>products</b> of system interactions observed in one-dimensional core and well-log data typically do not yield information regarding the likely lateral extent of sand bodies; (ii) stratigraphic heterogeneities typically occur on a scale below seismic resolution and cannot be imaged using such techniques. A database recording the temporal and spatial scales over which aeolian and fluvial events operate and interact in a range of present-day and ancient desert-margin settings has been collated using high-resolution satellite imagery, aerial photography and field observation. Together, these data have been used to develop a series of dynamic facies models to predict the arrangement of architectural elements that define gross-scale system architecture. Case-study examples have enabled the construction of a series of depositional models to account for the diversity of styles of fluvial and aeolian system interactions. Several styles of aeolian-fluvial interaction have been documented and the preserved deposits can now be predicted through quantitative geological models that account for spatial and temporal changes in system dominance. For example, the preserved architectural elements of fluvially flooded interdunes tend to expand laterally as successive flood deposits develop in front of advancing aeolian dunes. In non-climbing aeolian systems, such behavior favors the development of sheet-like bypass surpersurfaces. In aeolian systems that climb at low angles and for which fluvial incursions are episodic, thin and laterally impersistent fluvial elements tend to accumulate. The scale and connectivity of fluvial flood deposits tends to diminish with increasing distance toward the aeolian dune-field center...|$|E
