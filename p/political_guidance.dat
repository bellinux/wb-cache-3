5|$|During the Long March Zhu and Zhou Enlai {{organized}} certain {{battles in}} tandem. There were few positive effects since {{the real power}} was {{in the hands of}} Bo Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong’s criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan'an, Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> of Mao.|$|E
5|$|Comprehensive <b>Political</b> <b>Guidance</b> (CPG), {{a policy}} {{document}} {{that had been}} agreed by Defence Ministers in June 2006 and an addition to the 1999 Strategic Concept document, was formally endorsed during the summit. The CPG intends to provide a framework and political direction for NATO's continuing transformation in the coming 10 to 15 years. More specifically, the document expresses {{the belief that the}} principal threats to the Alliance in the coming decades are terrorism, proliferation, failing states, regional crises, misuse of new technologies, and disruption of the flow of vital resources. According to this document, the Alliance should adapt to these new threats and sets out the Alliance vis-a-vis capability issues, planning disciplines and intelligence for the next 10 to 15 years, including among others the need for joint expeditionary forces and the capability to deploy and sustain them over long periods of time. The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, criticisms {{have been}} made {{on the way the}} {{operation}} was led. According to Michael Kometer and Stephen Wright, the outcome of the Libyan intervention was reached by default rather than by design. It appears that there was an important lack of consistent <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> caused particularly by the vagueness of the UN mandate and the ambiguous consensus among the NATO-led coalition. This lack of clear <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> was translated into an incoherent military planning on the operational level. Such a gap may impact the future NATO's operations that will probably face trust issues.|$|E

25|$|Few of {{the reforms}} planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm {{civilian}} <b>political</b> <b>guidance,</b> with President Yeltsin primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his predecessor, Hawke's {{authority}} {{within the}} Labor Party was absolute. This {{enabled him to}} persuade his MPs to support a substantial set of policy changes. Individual accounts from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not usually {{the driving force behind}} individual reforms, he took on the role of achieving consensus and providing <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, tasks at which he proved highly successful. Hawke took on a very public role as Prime Minister, proving to be incredibly popular with the Australian electorate; to this date he still holds the highest ever AC Nielsen approval rating.|$|E
500|$|McClellan was {{reunited with}} his army at Harrison's Landing on the James. Debates were held {{as to whether the}} army should be {{evacuated}} or attempt to resume an offensive toward Richmond. McClellan maintained his estrangement from Abraham Lincoln with his repeated call for reinforcements and by writing a lengthy letter in which he proposed strategic and <b>political</b> <b>guidance</b> for the war, continuing his opposition to abolition or seizure of slaves as a tactic. He concluded by implying he should be restored as general-in-chief, but Lincoln [...] responded by naming Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck to the post without consulting, or even informing, McClellan. Lincoln and Stanton also offered command of the Army of the Potomac to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who refused the appointment.|$|E

50|$|Established in 1984, and {{published}} monthly by Mondiale Publishing Ltd, NIGHT magazine covered operational, technical and design developments within bars, clubs, student unions, casinos and live venues across the UK. Through its partnership with nightclub association Noctis and research arm CGA {{the magazine was}} able to provide legal, <b>political</b> and operational <b>guidance</b> alongside information from installers, manufacturers and service providers working within the nightclub industry.

40|$|The {{very first}} {{words of the}} very first {{amendment}} to the United States Constitution continue to frustrate the quest for constitutional clarity. The Bill of Right’s Establishment Clause commands in plain terms that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” but the legal interpretation and political implications of the Clause remain contested today as ever before. What may government require of religion? What may religion demand of government? How much of its independence must religion cede to government? And how closely may government collaborate with religion? These enduring questions admit of no definitive answers, at least not without an organizing logic that can bring coherence and purpose to the Establishment Clause. In this Article, I suggest that the concept of the separation of powers can help do just that. Using separation of powers theory, I construct a framework for clarifying the meaning of the Establishment Clause, giving <b>political</b> actors <b>guidance</b> for crafting policy pursuant to it, and making predictable its interpretation in courts...|$|R
500|$|The Commission is {{composed}} of a college of [...] "Commissioners" [...] of 28 members, including the President and vice-presidents. Even though each member is appointed by a national government, one per state, they do not represent their state in the Commission. In practice, however, they do occasionally press for their national interest. Once proposed, the President delegates portfolios among each of the members. The power of a Commissioner largely depends upon their portfolio, and can vary over time. For example, the Education Commissioner has been growing in importance, {{in line with the}} rise in the importance of education and culture in European policy-making. Another example is the Competition Commissioner, who holds a highly visible position with global reach. Before the Commission can assume office, the college as a whole must be approved by the Parliament. Commissioners are supported by their personal cabinet who give them <b>political</b> <b>guidance,</b> while the Civil Service (the DGs, see below) deal with technical preparation.|$|E
2500|$|The persecutions did not end, however. In {{violation}} of the promise made by Beria to the arrested opposition leaders, mass arrests and executions continued.

5|$|In Washington, Savimbi forged close {{relationships}} with influential conservatives, including Michael Johns (The Heritage Foundation's foreign policy analyst {{and a key}} Savimbi advocate), Grover Norquist (President of Americans for Tax Reform and a Savimbi economic advisor), and others, who played critical roles in elevating escalated U.S. covert aid to Savimbi's UNITA and visited with Savimbi in his Jamba, Angola headquarters to provide the Angolan rebel leader with military, <b>political</b> and other <b>guidance</b> in his war against the MPLA government.

5000|$|Lincoln, {{aware that}} his inaugural address would be {{delivered}} in an atmosphere filled with fear and anxiety, and amid an unstable <b>political</b> landscape, sought <b>guidance</b> from colleagues and friends as he prepared it. Among those whose counsel Lincoln sought was Orville Browning, who advised Lincoln to omit the overly aggressive phrase [...] "to reclaim the public property and places which have fallen". He also asked his former rival (and Secretary of State-designate) William Seward to review it. Seward exercised his due diligence by presenting Lincoln with a six-page analysis of the speech in which he offered some 49 suggested changes; of which the president-elect incorporated 27 into the final draft.|$|R
2500|$|In 1961, {{members of}} the CPM central {{committee}} such as Chin Peng, Chen Tien, and Lee An Tung moved to Beijing to seek <b>political</b> advice and <b>guidance</b> from the more experienced Chinese Communist Party. [...] Chin would, however, remain in Beijing for the next 29 years and the party would not lay down its arms until 1989. The reasons for this reversal of the party’s decision to disband, according to Chin, was the advice {{given to him by}} the Vietnamese communist leaders in Hanoi, the opening of the second ‘Vietnam War’, which was followed by China’s Cultural Revolution, all of which stressed a strong militant line to be taken by Asian communist parties.|$|R
50|$|The Palaiologoi {{tried to}} revive the economy, and re-establish {{traditional}} forms of <b>political</b> supervision, and <b>guidance</b> of the economy. It was, however, apparent that the late Byzantine state was unable to gain full control of either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, the state lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins. Late Byzantine officials supposed to implement a regulatory policy used the state prerogatives placed into their hands to pursue their private businesses. Private commercial activity was also affected by the crises in foreign policy, and the internal erosion of Byzantium.|$|R

5000|$|Following Muhammad's {{death the}} Shia or [...] "Party" [...] of Ali {{believed}} he had been designated not merely as the political successor to Muhammad ("Caliph") but also his spiritual successor ("Imam"). And looked toward Ali and his most trusted supporters for both <b>political</b> and spiritual <b>guidance.</b> Ali's descendants were also the only descendants of Muhammad as Ali had married Muhammad's only surviving progeny, his daughter Fatimah. Through the generations, the mantle of leadership of the Shia passed through the progeny of Ali and Fatimah, the Ahl al-Bayt, embodied in {{the head of the}} family, the Imam. Both Ismaʿili and Twelver Shia accept the same initial Imams from the descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah and therefore share much of their early history; the Zaydi are distinct.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the philosophical, social and cultural roots of touch exhibitions in British museums during the Twentieth Century. The {{theory and practice of}} these exhibitions was influenced more by cultural tradition, and <b>political</b> and social <b>guidance,</b> than by the needs of the majority of people with disabilities of sight. In particular, a theory of the use of touch was derived from pedagogies developed in schools for the blind, which were themselves influenced by a philosophy of enlightenment from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This pedagogical and theoretical approach does not serve people with disabilities of sight well. The study concludes that touch should only be used as {{one of a number of}} multi-modal approaches to museum access, and people with disabilities of sight should be considered according to their individual needs...|$|R
50|$|During Blumenthal's deposition, it {{was also}} ascertained by the Committee that, {{at the time he}} sent the emails to Clinton, Blumenthal was being paid an $320,000 {{annually}} by the Clinton Foundation, and was being paid $200,000 a year by David Brock. Although those payments did not necessarily create a conflict of interest for Blumenthal or for Clinton—Blumenthal's financial relationships with Brock's liberal advocacy and media groups, and with the Clinton Foundation and Secretary Clinton, then became a major focus of further questioning by the Committee. Members expressed concerns that his work with Brock's liberal advocacy and media groups, and the financial interests he held at the time in several contract proposals under consideration for Benghazi, may have presented problems when he was simultaneously sending <b>political</b> and messaging <b>guidance</b> to Clinton. During the deposition, Blumenthal testified that he had received the intelligence from a business contact and was not being paid to pass it along to Clinton.|$|R

40|$|Even though NATO has signalised {{the need}} for a unified {{approach}} to counterinsurgency, it seems that nations have different national approaches. This publication examines the Norwegian hallmarks to counterinsurgency as they appeared in the Norwegian-led forces in Faryab province of Afghanistan between 2006 and 2012. The Norwegian political will and its military ability to pursue counterinsurgency operations are analysed through the lenses of five counterinsurgency principles. On the basis of this analysis, the study draws conclusions that cut across the political and military domain. Key findings suggest that there is a weak connection between the Norwegian <b>political</b> and strategic <b>guidance</b> on the one hand, and the tactical military performance on the other. This again leads to a strong difference of opinion between the political-strategic and the military-tactical level. The absence of national coherence between the civilian and military side therefore explain some of the difficulties that occur in counterinsurgency operations, where aligning the various political instruments of the state is a prerequisite for success...|$|R
40|$|Citizens {{minimize}} information {{costs by}} obtaining <b>political</b> information and <b>guidance</b> from other {{individuals who have}} assumed the costs of acquiring and processing political information. A problem occurs because ideal informants, characterized by the joint presence of political expertise and shared viewpoints, are often unavailable or rare within the groups where individuals are located. Hence, individuals must often look beyond their own group boundaries to find such individuals, but obtaining information from individuals located beyond their own groups produces additional information costs. Moreover, the availability of ideal informants varies across groups and settings, {{with the potential to}} produce (1) biases in favor of some groups at the expense of others, (2) varying levels of polarization among groups, and (3) context dependent patterns of informant centrality. The paper’s analysis is based on a series of small group experiments, each of which involves two groups of seven subjects who communicate with one another via networked computers in order to obtain information on candidates. The aggregate implications of the experimental results are analyzed using an agent-based model...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} of didactics – a pragmatist perspective. In this inaugural speech I develop my {{view on the}} concept of didactics, didactic research and the importance of didactics in the current educational policy context. I claim that the subject of Education can {{play an important role in}} the development of didactics due to its long history of didactic concerns and its comprehensive theories about teaching and learning. I particularly emphasize the opportunities that I believe lie in a didactic perspective grounded in Dewey’s pragmatic philosophy. In my opinion Dewey’s work is still highly relevant and can offer a basis for <b>political</b> arguments, pedagogic <b>guidance,</b> methodological alternatives and a way to resolve essential philosophical problems. Furthermore, I highlight environmental and sustainability issues as a new political moral dimension of education which puts education in a genuine and long-term perspective for the future. I argue that this dimension, along with Dewey’s approach to education, is an important corrective to the educational policy tendencies that want to reduce education to a short- term issue of knowledge transfer, individual success and competitiveness of the business sector...|$|R
