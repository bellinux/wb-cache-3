50|$|Although it {{appeared}} that SGI was winning the legal battle over the fifth building, D.C. city planners attempted to mediate the dispute between the Kennedy Center and the Watergate and achieve a contractual rather than legal solution. Three separate proposals were made to both sides on December 7, 1967. On April 22, 1968, SGI agreed to turn its fifth building slightly to the southwest in order {{to open up the}} Watergate complex a little more and give the Kennedy Center a bit of open space. Although the Kennedy Center accepted the proposal, it demanded that the fifth building include apartment units, rather than be completely devoted to office space, to maintain the area's residential nature. The fight now moved to the NCPC. In June 1968, the NCPC held a hearing at which more than 150 Watergate apartment residents clashed with SGI officials over the nature of the final building. On August 8, 1968, SGI and the Kennedy Center reached a resolution, agreeing that only 25 percent of the fifth building's 1700000 sq ft would be used as office space and that the remaining space would become apartment units. The NCPC approved the revised plan in November 1968, and the DCZC did so five weeks later, specifically zoning the building for nonprofit and <b>professional</b> <b>use</b> <b>only.</b>|$|E

50|$|Humans may {{be exposed}} to {{biocidal}} products in different ways in both occupational and domestic settings. Many biocidal products are intended for industrial sectors or <b>professional</b> <b>uses</b> <b>only,</b> whereas other biocidal products are commonly available for private use by non-professional users. In addition, potential exposure of non-users of biocidal products (i.e. the general public) may occur indirectly via the environment, for example through drinking water, the food chain, {{as well as through}} atmospheric and residential exposure. Particular attention should be paid to the exposure of vulnerable sub-populations, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Also pets and other domestic animals can be exposed indirectly following the application of biocidal products. Furthermore, exposure to biocides may vary in terms of route (inhalation, dermal contact, and ingestion) and pathway (food, drinking water, residential, occupational) of exposure, level, frequency and duration.|$|R

40|$|The Acro Rapid Opiates Urine Test is {{a lateral}} flow, rapid {{immunoassay}} for the qualitative detection of opiates in human urine at 2000 ng/mL cut-off concentration. This assay {{is used to}} obtain a visual, qualitative result and is intended for <b>professional</b> <b>use</b> <b>only.</b> This assay provides only a preliminary result. Clinical consideration and professional judgment must be applied to a drug test result, particularly in evaluating a preliminary positive result. In order to obtain a confirmed analytical result, a more specific alternate chemical method is needed. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GC/MS) analysis is the preferred. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Opiates, such as heroin, morphine, and codeine, are central nervous system (CNS) depressants. The use of opiates at high doses produces euphoria and release from anxiety. Physical dependence is apparent in users and leads to depressed coordination, disrupted decision making, decreased respiration, hypothermia and coma. Heroin is quickly metabolized to morphine, morphine glucuronide and 6 -acetylmorphine. Thus, the presence of morphine (or the metabolite, morphine glucuronide) in the urine indicates heroin, morphine, and/or codeine use. The length of time following drug use for which a positive result may occur is dependent upon several factors, including the frequency and amount of drug, metabolic rate, excretion rate, drug half-life, the drug user's age, weight, activity and diet.

It under-identifies by about 50% or vastly over-refers depending on how questionable scores are handled. That {{it is also a}} hands-on measure taking longer to give than the usual 15 - 20 minute well-visit, means that most <b>professionals</b> <b>use</b> <b>only</b> selected items, and may thus further degrade what little accuracy there is.

Practices with nurse practitioners or developmental specialists, and early intervention intake services may have the time to administer accurate but lengthier measures that elicit skills directly from children (e.g., Brigance Screens (developed by Albert Brigance), Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS), or Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Test (BDIST).|$|R

ABSTRACT: The {{subject of this}} dissertation is research {{of the impact of}} the modified VIG intervention method applied in 16 families with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the children being at the age of 17 - 30 months when entering the project. The intervention and subsequent monitoring of the development took place during the years 2011 - 16. The aim of the study was to determine whether it is possible to positively influence the development of a child with autism without the use of intensive therapy guided by a <b>professional,</b> <b>using</b> <b>only</b> parent behavioral training and with the support of attachment behavior. The subjects of research evaluation were the degree of the child's development and the father's and mother's experience with parental roles in relation to the child's disability. The results were surprisingly positive. 38 % (6 children) stepped out of the clinical to nonclinical, 25 % still show the picture of developmental dysphasia, 5 [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Few other {{researchers}} have studied cultural competence in health care <b>professionals</b> <b>using</b> the IDI®; <b>only</b> two studies of this nature {{are relevant to the}} project presented here. One used the IDI® as an assessment tool to gather information to facilitate development of a multidisciplinary course in cultural competence (Munoz et al. 2009). The other study demonstrated a more sustained model that utilized the IDI® as a pre-test, subjected participants to five months of cultural competence intervention, and then repeated the IDI® as a post-test (Altshuler et al. 2003). Synthesizing the applications of the IDI® from these findings, it is clear that this instrument can function both as an assessment and evaluation tool. Building on this foundation, a more deliberate use of the IDI® for assessment and evaluation can assist in both curriculum planning and intervention design.|$|R

40|$|Professional golf {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a difficult sport to model. The volatility of ever changing conditions of play, such as weather, makes predicting a player&# 039;s round score challenging. The relatively large playing field in any given tournament also makes the task of predicting each player&# 039;s final position an ambitious one. A wealth of performance statistics correlated with success are available for elite tournaments in the United States. In this work, we propose a method for modelling <b>professional</b> golf tournaments <b>using</b> <b>only</b> historic round score data and round by round placings. Using the 2012 US Masters as a case study, we developed a methodology for predicting round scores for each player through possible scoring distributions. These scoring distributions were estimated using historic data from the competing players. A player&# 039;s score was generated randomly from a distribution with the likelihood estimated from the player&# 039;s observed historic score data. We simulated the tournament round by round, updating each likelihood using a Bayesian analysis of current score. Each simulation provides {{a measure of the}} probability of success for each player. These probabilities were seen to converge as the tournament was played out and each player&# 039;s actual score became known. We validated the model&# 039;s effectiveness by comparing the predicted outcomes with actual outcomes and those predicted from publicly released market prices...|$|R
40|$|About {{half of all}} New Zealand {{primary and}} {{secondary}} schools {{have been involved in}} an Information Communication Technology (ICT) professional development clusters since 1999. These clusters have supported schools to integrate ICT in to the schools curriculum using a wide variety of different models of professional development. Each cluster lasts for three years and then the funding ceases. This research was based in a school that had finished a cluster in 2004 using one model of <b>professional</b> development, the <b>use</b> of lead teachers to deliver the professional development. The school, a metropolitan mid-decile secondary school, invested extra professional development into a group of teachers who were leading users and who had volunteered to take responsibility for a curriculum area in the school. The research focused on how the lead teacher model offered a sustainable model of professional development once the Ministry of Education funding had stopped. This research was a participant case study of the lead teacher’s model of professional development and employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Initially the school’s teachers were surveyed for their computer literacy and the school’s use of its computer suites was tracked. For the qualitative data the Deputy Principal responsible for professional development was interviewed along with the lead teachers. The lead teacher’s meetings were observed as was a range of staff development carried out by the lead teachers. Firstly this research discovered that most teachers were competent users of ICT for their personal and <b>professional</b> <b>uses</b> but <b>only</b> about half were confident about using ICTs with their students or how to integrate ICT into their curriculum area. This was especially pronounced in the senior school where almost no uses of ICTs were found, apart from a small number of specialist subject uses. It is therefore important that the ICT professional development focuses on the use of ICT for teaching and learning and lead teachers are an appropriate delivery vehicle for the professional development required. The second part of this research looked at the sustainability of the lead teacher model for the delivery of ICT professional development. The research found a number of criteria for the lead teacher model to be sustainable. The lead teacher group needed a clear identity in the school with a visible leader, to be integrated into the ordinary administration and have a clear purpose. Finally the group needs to be regularly reviewed for all of the above. It is important that more research is carried out into the sustainability of other models of <b>professional</b> development <b>used</b> in the clusters...|$|R
