5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> God's laws they {{had to be able to}} read the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in the greed and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} transformative force, leads <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and respect nature which is portrayed as welcoming, spiritual, and restorative for those who enter it peacefully.|$|E
5|$|Partly from Cowper's {{literary}} influence, {{and partly}} because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including Isaac Watts whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing and Charles Wesley, with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother John, the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton {{to go into the}} clergy. Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the Psalms. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the common meter in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.|$|E

25|$|Kojima's love of film is {{noticeable}} in his games {{where he}} pays homage through his stories and characters, sometimes {{to the point}} of pastiche, as in Snatcher. He cited a contrast between films and games as while in his games he intends to portray violence like in a movie, in the game {{it is up to the}} player to decide. He wants <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the effects of violence. As he considers the games too stressful, he also wants comic relief to contrast it.|$|E

25|$|During the war, Frederick {{joined the}} Prussian army and {{was part of}} the {{fighting}} under the command of Field Marshal Friedrich von Wrangel. He distinguished himself with his courageous valour in the Battle of Dybbøl (7–18 April 1864) that marked the defeat of Denmark by the Austro-Prussian coalition. Pleased with the German victory, Victoria expected the military success of her husband would encourage <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that she was the wife of the heir apparent. In a letter to Frederick, she complained of the constant criticism and being considered too British in Prussia and too Prussian in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Arakawa {{wanted to}} {{integrate}} social problems into the story. Her research involved watching television news programs {{and talking to}} refugees, war veterans and former yakuza. Several plot elements, such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after their mother dies, and the brothers helping <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the meaning of family, expand on these themes. When creating the fictional world of Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa was inspired after reading about the Industrial Revolution in Europe; she was amazed by differences in the culture, architecture, and clothes of the era and those of her own culture. She was especially interested in England during this period and incorporated these ideas into the manga.|$|E
25|$|The manga {{series was}} republished in {{different}} formats in Japan. Viz Media licensed the series for English publication in North America under the names Lum and The Return of Lum, but dropped the series after nine volumes were released. The television series, OVAs, {{and five of}} the films were released in North America with English subtitles, {{as well as a}} dub for the films by AnimEigo. They provided extensive notes on the series to allow <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the many cultural references and jokes in the series that would not normally be understood by non-Japanese. The remaining film, , was released bilingually by Central Park Media. Five of the movies, as well as the OVAs, are available from MVM Films in the United Kingdom. The series was released on television in Southeast Asia as Lamu the Invader Girl.|$|E

40|$|Our aim is {{to provide}} {{empirical}} evidence that diagrammatic logics are more effective than symbolic and textual logics in allowing <b>people</b> <b>to</b> better <b>understand</b> information. Ontologies provide an important focus for such an empirical study: <b>people</b> need <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the axioms of which ontologies comprise. A between-groups study compared six frequently-used axiom types using the (textual) Manchester OWL Syntax (MOS), (symbolic) description logic (DL) and concept diagrams. Concept diagrams yielded  significantly better task performance than DL for all six, and MOS for four, axiom types. MOS outperformed concept diagrams for just one axiom type and DL for only three axiom types. Thus diagrams could ensure ontologies are developed more robustly...|$|R
25|$|Though the {{laboratory}} did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique {{because of the}} simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space and have it quickly and efficiently be able to gather all the necessary data. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton {{had to make the}} process as simple as possible for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> As a result, subjects were taken through {{the laboratory}} in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.|$|E
25|$|Boas also {{introduced}} {{the ideology of}} cultural relativism, which holds that cultures cannot be objectively ranked as higher or lower, or better or more correct, but that all humans see {{the world through the}} lens of their own culture, and judge it according to their own culturally acquired norms. For Boas the object of anthropology was to understand the way in which culture conditioned <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and interact with the world in different ways, and to do this it was necessary to gain an understanding of the language and cultural practices of the people studied. By uniting the disciplines of archaeology, the study of material culture and history, and physical anthropology, the study of variation in human anatomy, with ethnology, the study of cultural variation of customs, and descriptive linguistics, the study of unwritten indigenous languages, Boas created the four field subdivision of anthropology which became prominent in American anthropology in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of facial expressions and mouthing {{can be difficult}} to understand when an individual has a visual impairment. Such problems hinder the ability of <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis. Non-verbal communication is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. Visual impairments also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people. Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for clear vision. It causes progressive loss of central vision and possible loss of colour vision. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure.|$|E

No matter what the result the motivation was for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> about MacArthur. I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people. MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together. He really respected and loved the people.

Regarding the previous statement, the singer said she wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that she was normal, and how they could relate to her. Tisdale titled the album Headstrong, because she calls herself a [...] "headstrong" [...] type of person, commenting that she was the term in the sense of knowing how she wants to look, sing, and come across.

Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also {{felt it was important}} that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E

Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire.

500|$|Glee {{choreographer}} Zach Woodlee described [...] "Proud Mary" [...] as the [...] "scariest" [...] number produced to date, citing {{concerns with}} choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging. Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply, preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs, {{and that the}} actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly, flipping the wheelchairs over backwards: [...] "It was like roller derby. All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads—particularly Lea Michele. You lose your balance really quick {{when you try to}} go up a ramp in a wheelchair. Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely. There were pile-ups; there were crashes. Basically, everything that could go wrong, did." [...] Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number, as: [...] "Artie doesn't get to get up ever, so I didn't want anyone to get up."
