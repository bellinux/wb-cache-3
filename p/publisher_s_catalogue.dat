50|$|The term muckraker {{was used}} in the Progressive Era to {{characterize}} reform-minded American journalists who attacked established institutions and leaders as corrupt. They typically had large audiences in some popular magazines. In the US, the modern term is investigative journalism — it has different and more pejorative connotations in British English — and investigative journalists in the USA today are often informally called 'muckrakers'. Muckraking magazines—notably McClure's of the <b>publisher</b> <b>S.</b> S. McClure—took on corporate monopolies and political machines while trying to raise public awareness and anger at urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, prostitution, and child labor.|$|R
50|$|The logo of the {{publishing}} house is an ink sketch of two buffaloes kissing. The <b>publisher</b> <b>S.</b> Anand {{explains that the}} iconography comes from an excerpt from Aravind Malagatti’s autobiography in Kannada, Government Brahmana. It {{is a story about}} how the ideology of caste does not allow a dalit-owned she-buffalo in heat to mate with a he-buffalo owned by a landlord. For the cover art of the April 2003 issue of The Dalit, a journal run by the Dalit Media Network, Chennai, Anand approached the artist Chandru (G. Chandrasekaran) with this story. The logo is a close-up of the artist’s interpretation.|$|R
