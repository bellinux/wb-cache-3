It {{is probably the most}} widely used term but there are a large variety of alternative names used by various authors for this quantity. These include transmission parameter, transmission function, propagation parameter, <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficient</b> and transmission constant. If the plural is used, it suggests that α and β are being referenced separately but collectively as in transmission parameters, propagation parameters, etc. In transmission line theory, α and β are counted among the [...] "secondary coefficients", the term secondary being used to contrast to the primary line coefficients. The primary coefficients are the physical properties of the line, namely R,C,L and G, from which the secondary coefficients may be derived using the telegrapher's equation. Note that in the field of transmission lines, the term transmission coefficient has a different meaning despite the similarity of name: it is the companion of the reflection coefficient.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Motivated by information-theoretic considerations, {{we propose}} a {{signaling}} scheme, unitary space–time modulation, for multiple-antenna communication links. This modulation is ideally suited for Rayleigh fast-fading environments, since {{it does not}} require the receiver to know or learn the <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Unitary space–time modulation uses constellations of space–time signals 8 = 1, where represents the coherence interval during which the fading is approximately constant, and is the number of transmitter antennas. The columns of each 8 are orthonormal. When the receiver does not know the <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which between pairs of transmitter and receiver antennas are modeled as statistically independent, this modulation performs very well either when the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) is high or when. We design some multiple-antenna signal constellations and simulate their effectiveness as measured by bit-error probability with maximum-likelihood decoding. We demonstrate that two antennas have a 6 -dB diversity gain over one antenna at 15 -dB SNR.

40|$|We analyze {{a mobile}} {{wireless}} link comprising M transmitter and N receiver antennas {{operating in a}} Rayleigh flat-fading environment. The <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficients</b> between every pair of transmitter and receiver antennas are statistically independent and unknown; they remain constant for a coherence interval of T symbol periods, after which they change to new independent values which they maintain for another T symbol periods, and so on. Computing the link capacity, associated with channel coding over multiple fading intervals, requires an optimization over the joint density of T M complex transmitted signals. We prove {{that there is no}} point in making the number of transmitter antennas greater than the length of the coherence interval: the capacity for M> Tis equal to the capacity for M = T. Capacity is achieved when the T M transmitted signal matrix is equal to the product of two statistically independent matrices: a T T isotropically distributed unitary matrix times a certain T M random matrix that is diagonal, real, and nonnegative. This result enables us to determine capacity for many interesting cases. We conclude that, for a fixed number of antennas, as the length of the coherence interval increases, the capacity approaches the capacity obtained as if the receiver knew the <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficients...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of stress waves in long polymer rods {{forms the basis}} of two major experimental techniques. The first is a modified Split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) arrangement that employs polymer Hopkinson bars (as opposed to metallic bars) {{in order to determine}} the high strain-rate mechanical properties of soft materials. The second experimental technique consists of a group of methods for determining the viscoelastic properties of polymer rods within a frequency range of 20 Hz to 30 kHz. An experimental, analytical and finite element study of stress waves propagating in viscoelastic rods is reported. A <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is used to account for the attenuation and dispersion of stress waves propagating in polymer rods. Through experimental investigations, an optimal experimental arrangement is used to determine the <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a PMMA rod with an improved level of accuracy in comparison with results available in the open literature. Analytical investigations show difficulties associated with experimental arrangements as well as the numerical procedure adopted which tend to reduce the accurate frequency range of the determined <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The FE analysis of stress waves propagating in polymer rods suggests end effects are important; these end effects are not accounted for in any analytical bar wave theory. The high strain-rate mechanical properties of Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) are measured via a viscoelastic SHPB set-up. A scheme for processing the strain signals from the tests that allows for large strain measurement (approximately 60 %) is presented. The use of viscoelastic SHPB set-up is able to produce a more sensitive measurement when compared with test results in the literature which are obtained using conventional metallic bars. A Finite element model of a viscoelastic Hopkinson bar set-up is developed. The applicability of the model in viscoelastic SHPB testing is validated.

40|$|We {{developed}} a ‘multi-point vibration acceleration method ’ for accurately predicting the cavitation intensity in pumps. Pressure wave generated by cavitation bubble collapse propagates and causes pump vibration. We measured vibration accelerations at several points on a casing, suction and discharge pipes of centrifugal and mixed-flow pumps. The measured vibration accelerations scattered because the pressure wave damped differently between the bubble collapse location and each sensor. In a conventional method, experimental constants are proposed without evaluating pressure propagation paths, then, the scattered vibration accelerations cause the inaccurate cavitation intensity. In our method, we formulated damping rate, transmittance {{of the pressure}} wave, and energy conversion from the pressure wave to the vibration along assumed pressure propagation paths. In the formulation, we theoretically defined a ‘pressure <b>propagation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> ’ which is a correlation coefficient between the vibration acceleration and the bubble collapse pressure.
