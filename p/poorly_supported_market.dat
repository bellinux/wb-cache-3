5000|$|Compositae, the {{original}} name for Asteraceae, were first described in 1792 by the German botanist Paul Dietrich Giseke. [...] Traditionally, two subfamilies were recognised: Asteroideae (or Tubuliflorae) and Cichorioideae (or Liguliflorae). The latter {{has been shown}} to be extensively paraphyletic, and has now been divided into 12 subfamilies, but the former still stands. The phylogenetic tree presented below is based on Panero & Funk (2002) updated in 2014, and now also includes the monotypic Famatinanthoideae.The diamond denotes a very <b>poorly</b> <b>supported</b> node (<50% bootstrap support), the dot a <b>poorly</b> <b>supported</b> node (<80%).|$|R
