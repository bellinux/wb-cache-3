25|$|Elephant seals {{are among}} the seals that can stay on land for the longest periods of time, as they can stay dry for several {{consecutive}} weeks each year. Males arrive in the colonies earlier than the females and fight for control of harems when they arrive. Large body size confers advantages in fighting and the agonistic relationships of the bulls {{gives rise to a}} dominance hierarchy, with access to harems and activity within harems being determined by rank. The dominant bulls (“harem masters”) establish harems of several dozen females. The least successful males have no harems, but may try to copulate with a harem male's females when the male is not looking. The majority of <b>primiparous</b> females and a significant proportion of multiparous females mate at sea with roaming males away from harems.|$|E
2500|$|Under natural conditions, calves {{stay with}} their mother until weaning at 8 to 11 months. [...] Heifer and bull calves are equally {{attached}} to their mothers {{in the first few}} months of life. [...] Cattle are considered to be [...] "hider" [...] type animals, but in the artificial environment of small calving pens, close proximity between cow and calf is maintained by the mother at the first three calvings but this changes to being mediated by the calf after these. [...] <b>Primiparous</b> dams show a higher incidence of abnormal maternal behavior.|$|E

50|$|While all Japanese {{women are}} {{encouraged}} to rest after birth, <b>primiparous</b> women need only focus on one child whereas multiparous women face additional childcare obligations. Therefore, while <b>primiparous</b> Japanese women traditionally return to their mother's home for about one month after leaving the hospital {{to be cared for}} and receive help with the care of the baby, {{it is more likely that}} female family members of a new mother will go to her house to help out if there are additionally children to watch.|$|E

50|$|A {{woman who}} has never carried a {{pregnancy}} beyond 20 weeks is nulliparous, and is called a nullipara or para 0. A {{woman who has}} given birth once before is <b>primiparous,</b> and {{is referred to as}} a primipara or primip; moreover, a woman who has given birth two or more times is multiparous and is called a multip. Finally, grand multipara describes the condition of having given birth three or more times.|$|E
50|$|The Rendena {{is a good}} milk producer.

[...] It {{is used to}} make caprino cheeses such as the Giuncata di capra calabra, and mixed cheeses such as Cacioricotta and Canestrato, which in Calabria have PAT status, and Pecorino Crotonese, which has DOP status.|$|E
5000|$|Women {{with this}} {{condition}} frequently, {{at the time}} of delivery, have a precipitous birth. There is virtually no resistance of the huge pelvic opening {{to the size of a}} newborn so only the soft parts resist the birth. With a huge Justo Major Pelvis, there is no pelvic bone [...] "molding" [...] of the fetal head. With the average pelvic size (2/3 or less Justo Major size) the usual pelvic molding process slows the birth, resulting in a slow and gradual stretching of the vaginal opening for <b>primiparous</b> women. When a huge Justo Major Pelvis allows such an extremely rapid vaginal birth, there can be tears of the perineal soft tissues. At the time of delivery the strong uterine contractions and maternal bearing down almost instantly overwhelm the integrity of a tightened and previously unstretched vaginal orifice. This is often the case if such women have not previously practiced vaginal stretching to the degree that allows such an instant birthing, especially so for a <b>primiparous</b> woman. This [...] "instant delivery" [...] problem causes many OBGYN doctors to stress the importance of women with a huge pelvis practicing pre-delivery vaginal stretching to avoid perineal injury.|$|E
50|$|Monsanto-sponsored trials {{reviewed}} by the FDA asked whether the use of rBST makes cows more susceptible to mastitis. According to the FDA, which used data from eight Monsanto-sponsored trials in its decision in 1993 to approve Monsanto's rBST product, the answer is yes. The data from these eight trials, which involved 487 cows, showed that {{during the period of}} rBST treatment, mastitis incidence increased by 76% in <b>primiparous</b> cows and by 50% for multiparous cows. Overall, the increase was 53%.|$|E
5000|$|The Maltese is {{a valued}} milk breed; the milk has {{pleasant}} taste without an excessively [...] "goaty" [...] odour or flavour. Yield per lactation is 242 ± 87 litres for <b>primiparous,</b> 307 ± 141 l for secondiparous, and 358 ± 160 l for pluriparous, nannies; it may reach 500-600 kg in 300 days. The milk has {{an average of}} 4.28% fat and 3.66% protein. In Sicily the milk is used to make ricotta and traditional caprino cheeses including Padduni, which has PAT status, and Formaggiu ri crapa.|$|E
50|$|A breast abscess is a {{collection}} of pus that develops into the breast with different causes. During lactation, breast abscess develops only rarely, most sources cite about 0.4-0.5% of breastfeeding women. Known risk factors are age over 30, <b>primiparous</b> and late delivery. No correlation was found with smoking status however this may be in part because much fewer smoking women choose to breastfeed. Antibiotics were not shown effective in prevention of lactation abscess but are useful to treat a secondary infection (see the section on the treatment of breast abscess in this article).|$|E
5000|$|The average {{milk yield}} per {{lactation}} of the Nera Verzasca {{was measured in}} 2003 at 185 litres for <b>primiparous,</b> 318 l for secondiparous, and 365 l for pluriparous, nannies; a study in 2008-10 found an average yield of 373 litres in 208 days, {{with an average of}} 3.50% fat and 3.06% protein. In Italy the milk is used to make caprino cheeses such as Formaggella del Luinese, which has DOP status, while in Switzerland much of it is made into Büscion, a fresh goat's-milk cheese; ricotta is made in both areas.|$|E

50|$|The {{milk yield}} of the Nera di Arbus, {{over and above}} that taken by the lambs, averages 50 litres in 100 days for <b>primiparous</b> ewes, and 88-98 l in 180 days for pluriparous ones. The milk averages 6.5% fat and 5.6% protein. Lambs weigh 9.5-9.8 kg at 30 days. Rams yield about 2 kg of wool, ewes about 1.2 kg; the wool is of coarse quality. It is used to make orbace, a coarse hand-woven cloth, from which two {{traditional}} Sardinian garments are made: sa mastrucca, the overcoat worn by shepherds; and su sacu, a heavy waterproof blanket.|$|E
5000|$|The {{milk yield}} of the Agerolese is about [...] for <b>primiparous</b> and [...] for pluriparous cows. Cows may give [...] per day of milk {{with more than}} 3.5% fat. It is used to make butter and Italian cheeses such as Fior di Latte and Provolone del Monaco. This last has DOP status; it is made only in {{thirteen}} comuni of the province of Naples (Agerola, Casola di Napoli, Castellammare di Stabia, Gragnano, Lettere, Massa Lubrense, Meta, Piano di Sorrento, Pimonte, Sant'Agnello, Sorrento, Santa Maria la Carità and Vico Equense), and must contain a minimum of 20% Agerolese milk.|$|E
50|$|A Senegalese {{study focused}} on the {{suckling}} behaviour of giant eland and common eland calves about one to five months old determined that suckling bouts increased with {{the age of the}} calves. No other change occurred in the farmed common eland calves, but in the giant eland calves, the males were found to suckle more than female ones and shorter suckling bouts were marked in <b>primiparous</b> mothers than multiparous ones. The results suggest that Derby elands that lived in their natural habitat adjusted their maternal behaviour so as to be able to readily maintain a vigilant lookout for predators and other similar risks. In contrast, the farmed common elands behaved as in the conditions of captivity, without predators.|$|E
5000|$|The minimum {{milk yield}} of Aspromonte nannies is 120 litres in 150 days for <b>primiparous,</b> 130 L in 160 days for secondiparous and 180 L in 210 days for pluriparous animals. [...] Reported averages are, respectively, 140 L in 150 days, 150 L in 160 days, and 220 L in 210 days. The milk averages 3.95% fat, 3.57% protein and 4.63% lactose, {{and is used}} to make local cheeses of many kinds. These include, among others, caciotta, cacioricotta, canestrato dell'Aspromonte, caprino dell'Aspromonte, caprino di Limina, giuncata di capra, musulupu dell'Aspromonte, mixed-milk cheeses such as {{caciocavallo}} di Ciminà, and various kinds of fresh, baked, smoked or salted ricotta. Many of these have PAT status as traditional products of the area.|$|E
