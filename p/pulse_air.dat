40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{separation}} efficiency in the air-solid phase, we proposed an innovative separation method called the active <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> classifier, which produce <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> by a <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> generator. In this way, the particles received a new acceleration action in each pulsing period, and then, it obtains a better performance than non-pulsing air separators in the laboratory scale. The dynamic equation of the motion particle in the active pulsing airflow was built up, showing that a higher density particle may get a small acceleration. The simulation results of airflow field show that the airflow turbulence acceleration will disperse the particles and a density dominant separation can be achieved. All high density particles, low density particles, and dust of waste catalyst can be acquired by the active <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> classifier. When the airflow velocity is 3. 33 m/s, the frequency of <b>air</b> <b>pulsing</b> is 7 / 3 Hz, the separation efficiency of the active <b>pulsing</b> <b>air</b> classifier reaches its maximum: 97. 63 %.

50|$|Air {{injection}} {{can also}} be achieved {{by taking advantage of}} the negative pressure pulses in the exhaust system at engine idle. A sensitive reed valve assembly called the aspirator valve is placed in the air injection pumping, which draws its air directly from the clean side of the air filter.

This system, marketed as <b>Pulse</b> <b>Air,</b> was used by American Motors, Chrysler, and other manufacturers beginning in the 1970s. The aspirator provided advantages in cost, weight, packaging, and simplicity compared to the pump, but the aspirator functions only at idle and so admits significantly less air within a significantly narrower range of engine speeds compared to a pump.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} understand the atomization process in the specialized printing method which consists of the high frequency oscillating motion of a needle and a micro air jet. Highly viscous liquids, such as glycerin and acrylic paint were successfully printed with this printing method within the line width of 1 mm. High-speed imaging technique was used to observe the evolution and mechanical perturbation of a liquid meniscus which is coated on the oscillating needle. Various parameters which affect print patterns were identified to understand and control the atomization process occurring at the oscillating needle. For time-controlled atomization or printing, a <b>pulse</b> <b>air</b> jet system was implemented to print liquids only when it is demanded, and it was shown that the period of atomization can be controlled by the air jet on-and-off. The inertial coating process was studied to explain the dynamic meniscus profile, compared with static meniscus. Kinematic analysis of the needle motion was performed, which shows that the needle motion is a sinusoidal one undergoing inertial coating. Liquid sheet breakup mechanism {{in the presence of}} the air stream was also studied in conjunction with the principle of the air- blast atomizer. Performing as a printing device or a droplet generator, the reciprocating needle printing method studied here can be applied to printing or coating processes which utilize high viscosity media. by Heejin Lee.

40|$|Abstract Enabling {{diadromous}} fishes to enter, {{pass through}} and exit fish diversion structures, such as fishways, with minimal delay remains a challenge. The Conte Laboratory’s Air Directed Passage (ADP) technology acts to supplement volitional behavioral cues by exploiting fish sensitivity/aversion to high energy flow fields established with a sequentially activated series of parallel air diffusers (medium bubble flexible membrane type) positioned at strategic locations {{along the floor}} of test fishways. Compressed air flow is controlled by a PLC/solenoid valve system that acts to <b>pulse</b> <b>air</b> introductions at high frequency so as to actively herd fish toward upstream water inlet structures. ADP allows for control of progression (sweep) speed, direction, energy level and frequency of repeat sweeps. Tests of ADP were conducted using actively migrating wild adult Connecticut River American shad (Alosa sapidissima) collected mid-May through early June 2014 (N= 408). Collected fish were measured for length, sexed, and tagged externally with 23 mm half-duplex PIT tags and held overnight. Trials were performed in a laboratory flume measuring 3 m X 18 m that received Connecticut River water {{at a rate of}} 368 l/s which provided a working depth of 137 cm. Water entered the flume via a contracted rectangular weir 91 cm in width with a delta H of 35. 6 cm. The flume bulkhead supporting the weir incorporated aprons and a ramped floor to streamline flow. The floor of the flume incorporated 14 recessed rows of diffusers positioned at 1. 2 m centers along its longitudinal axis. Each row relied on 17 diffusers for air release. Air flow was applied at 5 m^ 3 /min with rest periods of 1 min between the 10 successive ADP sweeps used per trial. Fish passage rates were monitored by PIT antennas interfaced to a multi-reader PIT tag recorder. ADP increased passage rate 7. 7 fold over selected test periods when compared to controls, i. e., 3. 83 % vs 0. 44 % per min...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} these two major topics. The first part id {{describing}} flowing through the distribution pipe during the pressure pulse. In the second one the most effective cleaning device configuration and venturi shape are selected. Finally the results of experiments were proofed in the field test. A criterion for uniform distribution of pressurized air along the distribution pipe resulting from condition of constant momentums of the airflow at the outlet from the distribution pipe has been derived. This criterion uses outlet nozzle cross-sections and static pressures in the pipe at the nozzles. Based on this criterion a relation which enables to design outlet nozzle diameters only from pipe and nominal nozzle diameter has been derived as well. The consumption of pressurized air as an important value for evaluation of the overall cleaning efficiency of the whole filter has been calculated for 1 pulse. Derived formula can be used easily in the field since the tank pressure is usually measured. A mathematical model describing air flow through the pipe has been set together. The model results from basic Bernoullis equation and equation of continuity. All necessary quantities (velocity, pressure, temperature and density) along the distribution pipe can be computed during the pressure <b>pulse.</b> <b>Air</b> flows through the outlet nozzles and pressurised air consumption can be calculated from these values. Very good agreement between calculated and experimentally measured values has been achieved. Twelve basic venturi shapes and six displacements between outlet nozzle and venturi were tested. For comparison of results an evaluation system was put together. The system is based on 6 criteria describing an efficient pressure pulse along the bag. The initial set of test was carried out without dust feeding. A gross selection was done. Followingly 4 selected venturis and 3 displacements were measured at conditions simulating a real operation, i. e. fan was in operation and dust was fed. Based on these tests the cleaning device configuration showing the most effective pulse was selected. The selected venturis were applied on the real fabric filter. The states {{before and after the}} retrofit were recorded. The pressurised air consumption, pressure drop and boiler steam production were calculated. The operational costs were evaluated for more objective comparison. Available from STL, Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|Compared with {{conventional}} robots that require {{some sort of}} safety measures in operation, compliant robots capable of interacting with the environment in a gentle way and perform self-adjustment according to the surroundings are of greater need nowadays. To achieve compliance, robots with variable stiffness are highly desirable. Principles of stiffness control for conventional actuators and rigid robots, such as spring-based variable stiffness and impedance mechanisms, have been thoroughly studied. In this thesis, {{the focus is on}} the novel principles of variable stiffness, in particular, on geometry-based and jamming-based methods, and their innovative applications in robotics. The utilization of 3 D printing technology in this research brings new insight into robotic research. At first, a non-assembly design of a compliant pneumatic stepper motor based on the ratchet and pawl mechanism is proposed for robotic drives. The proposed stepper motor can generate rotary stepping motion in response to a train of <b>pulse</b> <b>air</b> pressure. In addition, the pawl is designed as a compliant mechanism instead of conventional rigid component. As a result, the whole mechanism can be fabricated by 3 D printing without any post-assembly or installation of other components. However, the ratchet and pawl mechanism based stepper motor has speed limitation and velocity discontinuity problems. An updated design of non-assembly pneumatic stepper motor allows velocity control, and the switch between continuous motion and stepping motion. The key element to realize the dual motion pattern is an innovative design of a roller valve inspired by the cam-follower mechanism. The roller valve can also modulate the stiffness of robots by air pressure control. The proposed concept of non-assembly robotic design and fabrication based on 3 D printing and the proposed stepper motor designs can bring design innovation to various robots, such as household robots, industrial robots and so on. The geometry-based principle is applicable for compliant robots with rigid parts. For better compliance, jamming technique is applied to a proposed soft robotic spine design. The soft robotic spine is proposed based on the integration of particle jamming and ball joint. The combined mechanism effectively overcomes the unpredictable behavior of jamming due to particle rearrangement and deformation which severely affects its repeatability and stability. The experimental studies have shown stiffness enhancement of 13 times. The compliant spine mechanism can be coupled with an actuation method such as wires/tendons, or soft actuators for robotic applications. The research also finds that the particle jamming technology can bring unexpected effects into biomimetic robotic hand design. The proposed robotic finger design based on the integration of particle jamming and fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator provides an instructive model for robotic gripper applications. The prototype robotic hand demonstrates great performance of reliable grasping. Based on similar jamming interface, a bioinspired robotic palm is designed for the hand. The property of controllable stiffness of the palm allows a full contact of the palm with the object being grasped, thus providing a stable support for object grasping. The proposed palm design demonstrates a close emulation of human palm functions. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

30|$|First, as air is {{introduced}} into contaminated soil, air displaces flushing solution {{in the largest}} pores and creates temporary flushing solution flow around flushing point [12].When an air-flushing system achieves steady state, preferential airflow pathways consisting of the largest network of pores are formed in the soil, and the induced local flushing solution flow ceases [20]. <b>Pulsing</b> <b>air</b> injection frequently creates non-steady-state conditions and induces flushing solution circulation as the air channels form and collapse during each cycle. The induced flushing solution flow created by the pulsed air flushing substantially enhances the contaminant and oxygen mass transfer in the soil [5].
