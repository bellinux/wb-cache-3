5|$|Great Northern Highway {{travels to}} remote areas of Western Australia, {{including}} the Munjina Roadhouse near the Hamersley Ranges, and {{the communities of}} Eighty Mile Beach, Wallal, Sandfire and Mandora, which are located between Broome and Port Hedland. It is the only sealed road between the Northern Territory border and major population centres {{in the north of}} the state. Economically, Great Northern Highway is also a vital link in the resource rich regions of the Wheatbelt, Mid West, Pilbara, and Kimberley. The key industries of mining, agriculture, and pastoral stations are all dependent on the highway as a significant and in some cases only method of transport. Tourism accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} road's traffic, and is a growing part of or <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> source for the regional economies. The highway provides access to a variety of tourist attractions, including New Norcia, the Yilgarn area, and various national parks, including Karijini. Parts of the highway itself are included in the tourist routes Swan Valley Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive203) in Perth, Chittering Valley Tourist Way (Tourist Drive359) in Bullsbrook, Midlands Tourist Way (Tourist Drive360) from Upper Swan to Walebing, and Geikie–Windjana Tourist Way (Tourist Drive350) from Geikie Gorge National Park to Fitzroy Crossing.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, the Tanzanian {{government}} {{declared the}} Ujamaa policy, that set Tanzania into a socialist path. The move slowed down the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> {{of the city}} as the government encouraged people not to move in cities but stay in Ujamaa socialist villages. But by 1980's the Ujamaa policy proved to be a failure into combating increasing poverty, hunger, and delayed development that Tanzania faced. This led to the 1980s liberalization policy that virtually ended socialism and its spirit within the Tanzania's government. The move led to increasing migration of rural dwellers from rural areas into cities with Dar es Salaam becoming the leading city in receiving migrants from rural areas.|$|E

Subsequent research suggested that there was far less ice present (if any) than had originally been thought, but that there may still be some usable deposits of hydrogen in other forms.

25|$|Importantly, however, Canada revived Third Option {{ideals of}} {{political}} and economic distinctiveness that was briefly lost to Joe Clark’s Progressive Conservatives from June 1979 to February 1980. Diversification and distinctiveness of Canadian policy were evident in Trudeau’s creation of the National Energy Program, the extension of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the formulation of specific Central American policy in 1982. Such advancements in Canadian policy were almost immediately contested by the United States. At any rate, Canada had good reason to be optimistic in the international sphere. Unfortunately, just as Trudeau’s policies of peace and diplomacy in Latin America began to peak the Latin American debt crisis retarded any <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> beginning in 1982. In fact, in a four-year period between 1980 and 1984 Canadian exports to Latin America were cut in half.

25|$|To England, Spain {{itself was}} not the central issue, but the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> of French power and its {{capacity}} to dominate Europe {{was seen as the}} primary danger to England's interests at home and abroad. The best way to achieve the country's goals was a source of heated debate. In general terms, the Tories eschewed continental warfare in favour of a 'blue water policy' whereby the Royal Navy waged war against French and Spanish trade at sea {{while at the same time}} protecting and expanding England's commerce. The Tories regarded a major land commitment on the continent as too expensive, and would primarily benefit Allied rather than English interests. In contrast, the Court Whigs and the financiers in London, who would profit most from the land campaign, supported the continental strategy, arguing that the navy alone could never defeat Louis XIV. The debate over the use of English resources would persist throughout the war, but the country's financial strength helped it to develop a number of strategies, most important of which was the ability to attack France across multiple fronts. However, defeating Louis XIV was beyond any single Allied member, and therefore any strategy necessitated the close commercial and political co-operation between England and the Dutch Republic to put together an effective army in the field and to sustain a close relationship with a number of European allies, principally from Germany whose princes would provide essential troops for hire.|$|E
