40|$|Translation, adaptation, {{and other}} forms <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> {{literary}} works can result in bodies of parallel texts. For the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> studying <b>appropriation</b> strategies, {{it is important to}} be able to annotate digital representations of these parallel text structures. This article uses early modern emblem culture (books of engravings or woodcuts, accompanied by mottos and explanatory texts) to investigate the forms this text parallelism may take. It defines requirements for annotation definition and proposes a TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) extension to implement these requirements. In the proposed encoding scheme, TEI feature structures will be used for storing annotation information. This scheme should be useful for annotating parallel text structures as well as for other annotation tasks. The annotation scheme assumes the annotated texts are available in XML. If this is not the case (there is no electronic version of the text at all or perhaps only a facsimile) the article suggests the definition of a TEI proxy document. A TEI proxy document contains enough of the structural aspects of the texts to serve as a basis for attaching annotations to the text. Outside of the annotation context, proxy documents may serve as a basis for adding functionality to image-based editions...|$|R

In addition, when it awarded a fiscal year 2007 Contract modification for nonseverable services, NIAID initially funded only $40.3 {{million of the}} $220.5 million contract obligation with fiscal year 2007 appropriations. Because the Contract was a nonseverable service contract, which represents a single undertaking and provides for a single outcome, NIAID was required to record the full amount of the Contract using fiscal year 2001 or fiscal year 2007 appropriated funds. By not doing so, NIAID potentially violated the Antideficiency Act. NIAID complied with the <b>purpose</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>appropriations</b> statutes. …In written comments on our draft report, NIH agreed that an Antideficiency Act violation had occurred but did not concur with our findings and recommendations regarding the characterization of the Contract as a nonseverable service contract.

We determined that the Contract was overall nonseverable based on the language describing the tasks included in the statement of work.|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices.

NIAID obligated a total of $20.0 million {{in violation of the}} bona fide needs rule: $10.0 million of fiscal year 2007 appropriated funds and $10.0 million of fiscal year 2009 appropriated funds. NIAID planned to obligate future-year appropriated funds as well. Because the Contract was a nonseverable service contract (a single undertaking that provides for a single outcome chargeable to the fiscal year in which the contract is awarded), NIAID was required to record the full amount of the Contract using fiscal year 2006 appropriated funds. By not doing so, NIAID potentially violated the Antideficiency Act. (When services are severable they are continuing and recurring and chargeable to the fiscal year in which the services are provided.) NIAID complied with the <b>purpose</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>appropriations</b> statutes.We recommended that NIAID (1) deobligate $10.0 million of fiscal year 2007 funds and $10.0 million of fiscal year 2009 funds, (2) record the remaining $30.0 million of the $49.8 million Contract obligation against fiscal year 2006 funds, and (3) report an Antideficiency Act violation if fiscal year 2006 funds are not available.NIH concurred with the findings that the Contract is nonseverable and that it should have been funded at the time the Contract was awarded. NIH said that the Department of Health and Human Services would report the violation as required. NIH did not address our recommendations to correct the improper funding for the first 4 years of the Contract.|$|R

5000|$|NIAID {{violated}} {{both the}} bona fide needs rule and the Antideficiency Act by obligating funds in advance <b>of</b> an <b>appropriation.</b> The initial contract action obligated fiscal year 2008 {{funds for a}} period of approximately 14 months (March 1, 2008, through April 30, 2009). Subsequent modifications obligated fiscal year 2008 and 2009 funds through May 31, 2011. Because the Contract was for severable services, NIAID should have obligated only those fiscal year 2008 funds needed for program year 1 and only those fiscal year 2009 funds needed for program year 2.Additionally, NIAID violated the bona fide needs rule by obligating more funds than it needed for program year 1 and using those funds to pay for costs incurred after program year 1. Using the program year estimates provided in the Contract as evidence of the bona fide need, NIAID must resolve these violations by deobligating $16.9 million ($23.7 million less $6.8 million) of fiscal year 2008 funds that were obligated in excess of the agency's bona fide need for program year 1 and obligating the appropriate fiscal year funds for the program years in which the services were provided. If NIAID does not have adequate fiscal year funds available, it will violate the Antideficiency Act for these fiscal years as well.Furthermore, although NIAID estimated that it would require $6.8 million for program year 1, at the time of our audit, it had expended only $4.9 million. NIAID may not use the remaining funds for costs incurred in subsequent program years. Rather, NIAID will need to deobligate an additional $1.9 million ($6.8 million less $4.9 million) of fiscal year 2008 appropriations if it is determined that they are no longer needed during their period of availability. NIAID funded the Contract in compliance with the <b>purpose</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>appropriations</b> statutes. …NIH did not address our recommendations to correct the improper funding for the first 2 program years of the Contract. Until NIH makes these adjustments, HHS cannot report the correct amount of its Antideficiency Act violation. Therefore, we continue to recommend that NIH record the correct Contract obligations and expenditures against the correct fiscal year funds.|$|R

The analysis is based on I survey I conducted among 358 firms in 127 different (four-digit) industries in Switzerland. The main results can be summarized as follows: 1) For process innovations lead time, and for product innovations, superior sales and service efforts are viewed as the most effective means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> 2) For both product and process innovations, patents are the least effective means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> In general, patents are viewed by R&D managers as an effective means of protecting the competitive advantages of new technolgy in the chemical, including the drug industries, in the synthetics and in some cases of the machinery and metal processing industries. In all other industries surveyed they are considered less affective. 3) Finally, the ability of competitors to "invent around" is seen as the most important constraint on the effectiveness of patents. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory.

This study also explored the influences of age, gender and occupation type on MP <b>appropriation.</b> The result <b>of</b> the study allows us to describe important elements <b>of</b> MP <b>appropriation</b> and explore the influence individual characteristics such as gender, age and occupation on different patterns of MP use through our conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> It is found that all of the individual characteristics investigated were significantly related with the MP appropriation and use. We conclude that these individual characteristic variables such as gender, age and occupation type are important moderating variables in understanding MP appropriation and use among the respondents. The results of the study are expected to assist in understanding the use of MP across different ages and occupation and serve as a mechanism in guiding the development of mobile phone applications and design by service providers and manufacturers respectively; as well as in aiding policy formulation on MP use at the work plac...|$|R
