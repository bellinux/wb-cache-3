40|$|Sorting {{of paper}} into {{compatible}} grades {{is a necessary}} step prior to recycling. Current method of manually sorting is tedious, slow, and expensive. Hence, {{significant part of the}} waste paper stream is sent to the landfill. High speed automation of the sorting process will improve the cost efficiency and increase the amount of paper recycled significantly. There have been recent developments in automation of this process. Mechanisms for the distribution of the <b>papers</b> from a <b>bale</b> onto a moving conveyor and the pneumatic actuation to deflect papers into different streams are well established. Correct identification of the sample in real-time before the sample reaches the actuation station still remains a challenge since different types of paper and board samples are mixed in a waste stream, and has a lot of variation in terms of color, chemical composition, coating, and prints in black and white and color to different degrees. This is primarily {{due to the lack of}} satisfactory sensors and sensor fusion algorithms for sample identification in real-time. In this report, we identify key parameters that must be measured (lignin, stiffness, color gloss), sensor design, and integration of the output from sensors to interpret the type of sample using a fuzzy inference system. Results show that the sensor system proposed is capable of identifying the samples at 90 % accuracy. The sensor system can be integrated onto a conveyor and actuation system for automated sorting...|$|R

25|$|Back at Fort William, Selkirk issued {{orders to}} his men on August 15 to {{prohibit}} the Nor'Westers from conducting their normal business in order to disrupt the NWC’s trade. As such, no canoes bearing trade goods were allowed {{to leave for the}} interior nor were any canoes bearing furs dispatched to Montreal, which disrupted the NWC’s trade for the ensuing year costing the company tens of thousands of pounds. The next day, Selkirk began a detailed inventory of Fort William in order to locate any stolen HBC goods and began searching official and personal correspondences for evidence concerning the destruction of the Red River colony. Among the papers at Fort William was found {{a list of all the}} Red River Métis who participated in the destruction of the Red River colony in 1815 as well as 20 bales of goods which were to be sent to these men as gifts. Selkirk also found 30 or 40 packs of furs he claimed were stolen from the HBC’s Brandon House which had apparently been repacked at Fort William. Selkirk sent these <b>papers</b> and the <b>bales</b> of goods and furs to Montreal as evidence. On the 18th, the NWC prisoners were made ready to depart. In all, eight NWC partners were taken prisoner and sent to Montreal, including the head of the company, William McGillivray. Before they departed, each partner’s cassette was searched and personal papers were confiscated. The prisoners were conveyed in three canoes with a fourth following containing armed guards. The canoes were grossly overcrowded, and while on Lake Superior, one canoe overturned and one Kenneth Mackenzie and 8 others drowned. Soon after a NWC canoe arrived at Fort William carrying John McGillivray and Archibald McGillivray who were promptly arrested. On the 25th, two canoes were dispatched under the command of Pierre Pambrun to seize the arms and ammunition at Fort Lac la Pluie, but the officer in charge would not surrender. Even though the fort’s complement was only 7 men, Selkirk’s party was not prepared for a siege so they retreated back to Fort William. Selkirk then dispatched Captain Proteus D’Orsonnens with a second party and 2 field pieces to besiege the fort. The Nor'Westers at Lac la Pluie, now running low on their stores of fish, could not maintain a siege and surrendered. Selkirk also dispatched parties to seize the NWC posts at Fond du Lac and Michipicoton on Lake Superior which was duly accomplished. Capturing Fond du Lac would eventually get Selkirk into some legal trouble as it was on American soil and the goods and furs there were partially owned by John Jacob Astor’s American Fur Company. Selkirk also hatched a plan to build outposts on the HBC’s land situated between Fort William and Lac la Pluie in order to stop all NWC communication between the two posts. He began cutting a road, but the plans were never completed. In September, Selkirk’s men, while helping the Nor’Westers unload cargo from their sloop, took away its 2 small brass cannons and accompanying ammunition. On September 2, Selkirk gathered together the NWC voyageurs and attempted to induce them to break their contracts and leave the company. One voyageur named Letemps refused to attend and campaigned with several clerks to convince the voyageurs to honour their contracts. For this he was arrested on trumped up charges of theft and was sent to Montreal.|$|R
