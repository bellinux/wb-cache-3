25|$|Most subway {{services}} are already at capacity, {{in terms of}} train spacing, during rush hours, except for the , G, J/Z, L, and M trains (the L service already is automated with CBTC). Therefore, transit <b>planners</b> <b>are</b> viewing the installation of CBTC {{as a way to}} free up track capacity for more trains to run, and have shorter headways between trains. However, installing CBTC in the New York City Subway is harder than in other systems due to the subway's complexity. The MTA hopes to install 16 miles of CBTC-equipped tracks per year, while the Regional Plan Association wants the MTA to install CBTC signals on 21 miles of tracks per year.|$|E

25|$|Jane Jacobs' 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities was a {{sustained}} critique of urban planning {{as it had}} developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when Pruitt Igoe; a housing development for low-income people in St. Louis designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, which had been a prize-winning version of Le Corbusier's 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept pluralism and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and disadvantaged groups (Goodchild 1990). It {{is important to note}} that urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of Fordist-Keynesian paradigm of mass, standardized production and consumption, while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, labor markets and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, <b>planners</b> <b>are</b> much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).|$|E

40|$|Dexterous {{manipulation}} has broad {{applications in}} assembly lines, warehouses and agriculture. To perform large-scale manipulation tasks for various objects, a multi-fingered robotic hand sometimes has to sequentially adjust its grasping gestures, i. e. the finger gaits, {{to address the}} workspace limits and guarantee the object stability. However, realizing finger gaits planning in dexterous manipulation is challenging due to the complicated grasp quality metrics, uncertainties on object shapes and dynamics (mass and moment of inertia), and unexpected slippage under uncertain contact dynamics. In this paper, a dual-stage optimization based <b>planner</b> <b>is</b> proposed to handle these challenges. In the first stage, a velocity-level finger gaits <b>planner</b> <b>is</b> introduced by combining object grasp quality with hand manipulability. The proposed finger gaits <b>planner</b> <b>is</b> computationally efficient and realizes finger gaiting without 3 D model of the object. In the second stage, a robust manipulation controller using robust control and force optimization is proposed to address object dynamics uncertainties and external disturbances. The dual-stage <b>planner</b> <b>is</b> able to guarantee stability under unexpected slippage caused by uncertain contact dynamics. Moreover, {{it does not require}} velocity measurement or expensive 3 D/ 6 D tactile sensors. The proposed dual-stage optimization based <b>planner</b> <b>is</b> verified by simulations on Mujoco.
