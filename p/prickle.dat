25|$|Macroscopically, {{the tumor}} is often elevated, fungating, {{or may be}} ulcerated with {{irregular}} borders. Microscopically, tumor cells destroy the basement membrane and form sheets or compact masses which invade the subjacent connective tissue (dermis). In well differentiated carcinomas, tumor cells are pleomorphic/atypical, but resembling normal keratinocytes from <b>prickle</b> layer (large, polygonal, with abundant eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm and central nucleus).|$|E
25|$|The noncanonical PCP pathway regulates cell morphology, division, and movement. Once again Wnt {{proteins}} binds to and activates Frizzled so that Frizzled activates a Dishevelled {{protein that}} is {{tethered to the}} plasma membrane through a <b>Prickle</b> protein and transmembrane Stbm protein. The active Dishevelled activates RhoA GTPase through Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1) and the Rac protein. Active RhoA is able to induce cytoskeleton changes by activating Roh-associated kinase (ROCK) and affect gene transcription directly. Active Rac can directly induce cytoskeleton changes and affect gene transcription through activation of JNK.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prickles</b> are {{comparable}} to hairs but can be quite coarse (for example, rose <b>prickles).</b> They are extensions of the cortex and epidermis. Technically speaking, many plants commonly thought of as having thorns or spines actually have <b>prickles.</b> Roses, for instance, have <b>prickles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Prickles</b> {{may or may}} not {{be present}} on young trees, root suckers, and {{branches}} near the ground; typically, branches high above the ground rarely contain <b>prickles.</b> R. pseudoacacia is quite variable in the quantity and amount of <b>prickles</b> present as some trees are densely prickly and other trees have no <b>prickles</b> at all. The <b>prickles</b> typically remain on the tree until the young thin bark to which they are attached is replaced by the thicker mature bark. They develop from stipules (small leaf like structures which grow at the base of leaves) and since stipules are paired at the base of leaves, the <b>prickles</b> will be paired at the bases of leaves. They range from [...]25-.8 in in length and are somewhat triangular with a flared base and sharp point. Their color is of a dark purple and they adhere only to the bark.|$|R
50|$|Its normal habit {{is that of}} a multi-stemmed, untidy, large shrub with a {{tendency}} for the shoots to scramble using their recurved <b>prickles,</b> and often develops into a single-stemmed tree of 5-10m in height and 300mm trunk diameter. The rounded crown of dense, dark green foliage is composed of very small pinnules. Translucent red pods provide a colourful display when backlit. The flaking bark is light grey, splitting longitudinally and transversely, and revealing a buff under-colour. The persistent <b>prickles</b> are profuse on young twigs, but can also be found on older wood. Unlike members of the genus Acacia, the <b>prickles</b> are not in pairs, but scattered along young twigs ('ataxacantha' = orderless <b>prickles).</b>|$|R
25|$|Referred itch is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} stimulus applied in one region {{of the body is}} felt as an itch or irritation in {{a different part of the}} body. The syndrome is relatively harmless, though it can be irritating, and healthy individuals can express symptoms. Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin – a scratch – to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin. The referred sensation itself should not be painful; it is more of an irritating <b>prickle</b> leading to the compulsion to scratch the area. The stimulus and referred itch are ipsilateral (the stimulus and the referred itch occur on the same side of the body). Also, because scratching or putting pressure on the referred itch does not cause the stimulus area to itch, the relationship between the stimulus and the referred itch is unidirectional. The itching sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation.|$|E
500|$|The preview {{version of}} the episode {{supplied}} {{to the press and}} aired at the press launch omitted the scene that features Rose; before broadcast, only the production team, Tate, and Tennant had seen the scene. The scene contains Rose's departure theme, [...] "Doomsday". Tennant commented [...] "on the night of transmission... the Radio Times won't have told you it's coming, it'll come as a genuine <b>prickle</b> up the spine".|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor of Billboard gave a {{negative}} review for the song, criticizing Madonna's rapping and calling the song [...] "a blurry snarl {{of style and}} composition that's sounds more like a disjointed medley than a song." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was disappointed by the lyrics saying that [...] "what on earth might her extreme point of view involve? That the world is ruled by a shadowy cabal of super-intelligent lizards?... Sadly not. Her extreme point of view {{turns out to be}} that money can't buy you happiness and that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be." [...] He also panned the lyric [...] "I like to express my extreme point of view", saying that it's difficult to hear that line without feeling a <b>prickle</b> of excitement.|$|E

50|$|Other similar {{structures}} are spinose teeth, spinose apical processes, and trichomes. Trichomes {{in particular are}} distinct from thorns, spines, and <b>prickles</b> {{in that they are}} much smaller (often microscopic) outgrowths of epidermal tissue, and they are less rigid and more hair-like in appearance; they typically consist of just a few cells of the outermost layer of epidermis, whereas <b>prickles</b> may include cortex tissue. Trichomes are often effective defenses against small insect herbivores; thorns, spines, and <b>prickles</b> are usually only effective against larger herbivores like birds and mammals.|$|R
50|$|Rubus ferrugineus is a {{perennial}} shrub or small tree with stems up to 6 meters (20 feet) tall, with curved <b>prickles.</b> Stems {{are covered with}} wool and armed with curved <b>prickles.</b> Leaves are compound with 3 or 5 leaflets. Flowers are white. Fruits are black and egg-shaped.|$|R

2500|$|The Naassenes {{taught that}} their primary man was, like Geryon, threefold, {{containing}} in himself the three natures to noeron, to psychikon, to choikon; {{and so that}} in Jesus the three natures were combined, and through him speak to these different classes of men. From the living waters which he supplies each absorbs that for which his nature has attraction. From the same water the olive can draw its oil, and the vine its wine, and in like manner each other plant its special produce: chaff will be attracted by amber, iron only by the magnet, gold only by the <b>prickle</b> of the sea-hawk, so each according to his nature attracts and imbibes a different supply from the same source.|$|E

So intense was the cold that they almost {{continually}} rubbed their noses and cheeks with their mittens. A few minutes' cessation from this allowed the flesh to grow numb, and then most vigorous rubbing was required to produce the burning <b>prickle</b> of returning circulation.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the ninth}} {{day of our}} travel in this wilderness, {{when we came to}} the view of a great lake of water; and you may be sure this was a {{particular}} satisfaction to us, because we had not water left for above two or three days more, at our shortest allowance; I mean allowing water for our return, if we had been driven to the necessity of it. Our water had served us two days longer than expected, our buffaloes having found, for two or three days, a kind of herb like a broad flat thistle, though without any <b>prickle,</b> spreading on the ground, and growing in the sand, which they ate freely of, and which supplied them for drink as well as forage.|$|E
60|$|Copple's advice {{brought home}} to me what could happen even with the {{advantage}} on my side. Also it brought the cold tight <b>prickle</b> to my skin, the shudder {{that was not a}} thrill, the pressure of blood running too swiftly, I did not feel myself shake, but the rifle was unsteady. I rested an elbow on my knee, yet still I had difficulty in keeping the sight on him. I could get it on him, but could not keep it there. Again he came out into the open, {{at the head of a}} yellow slide, that reached to a thicket below. I must not hurry, yet I had to hurry. After all he had not so far to come and most of the distance was under cover. Through my mind flashed Haught's story of a cinnamon that kept coming with ten bullets in him.|$|E

And to convince {{those who know}} it only by description, I will refer them to any account of our early campaigns in Sind, where many a European soldier has been taken up stone dead after sleeping {{an hour or two}} in the morning sun. [FN#2] The Zodiacal Light on the Red Sea, and in Bombay, is far brighter than in England. I suppose this is the [...] "after-glow" [...] described by Miss Martineau and other travellers: [...] "flashes of light like coruscations of the Aurora Borealis in pyramidal form" [...] would exactly describe the phenomenon. It varies, however, greatly, and often for some days together is scarcely visible. [FN#3] Niebuhr considers that the stars are brighter in Norway than in the Arabian deserts; I never saw them so bright as on the Neilgherry hills. [FN#4] Written {{in the days of the}} vans, which preceded the Railway. [FN#5] On one occasion I was obliged personally to exert myself to prevent a party of ladies being thrust into an old and bad transit-van; the ruder sex having stationed itself at some distance from the starting-place in order to seize upon the best. [FN#6] Abraham, for breaking his father's idols, was cast by Nimrod into a fiery furnace, which forthwith became a garden of roses. (See Chapter xxi. of the Koran, called [...] "the Prophets.") [FN#7] David worked as an armourer, but the steel was as wax in his hands. [FN#8] Solomon reigned over the three orders of created beings: the fable of his flying carpet is well known.

They extend from the plains north of Yambu' into the Sinaitic Peninsula. They boast no connection with the great tribe Al-Harb; but they are of noble race, are celebrated for fighting, and, it is said, have good horses. The specimens we saw at Marsa Dumayghah were poor ones, they had few clothes, and no arms except the usual Jambiyah (crooked dagger). By their civility and their cringing style of address it was easy to see they had been corrupted by intercourse with strangers. [FN#12] It is written Wish and Wejh; by Ali Bey Vadjeh and Wadjih; Wodjeh and Wosh by Burckhardt; and Wedge by Moresby. [FN#13] The terrible Afghan knife. [FN#14] These the Arabs, in the vulgar tongue, call Jarad al-Bahr, [...] "sea locusts"; as they term the shrimp Burghut al-Bahr, or the sea-flea. Such compound words, palpably derived from land objects, prove the present Ichthyophagi and the Badawin living on the coast to be a race originally from the interior. Pure and ancient Arabs still have at least one uncompounded word to express every object familiar to them, and it is in this point that the genius of the language chiefly shows itself. [FN#15] The Arab superstition is, that these flashes of light are jewels made to adorn the necks and hair of the mermaids and mermen. When removed from their native elements the gems fade and disappear. If I remember right, there is some idea similar to this among the Scotch, and other Northern people. [FN#16] The word Jabal will frequently occur in these pages. It is applied by the Arabs to any rising ground or heap of rocks, and, therefore, must not always be translated [...] "Mountain." [...] In the latter sense, it has found its way into some of the Mediterranean dialects. Gibraltar is Jabal al-Tarik, and [...] "Mt. Ethne that men clepen Mounte Gybelle" [...] is [...] "Monte Gibello,"-the mountain, par excellence. [FN#17] It was most probably a <b>prickle</b> of the [...] "egg-fruit," [...] or Echinus, so common in these seas, generally supposed to be poisonous. I found it impossible to cure my foot in Al-Hijaz, and every remedy seemed to make it worse. This was as much the effect of the climate of Arabia, as of the hardships and privations of a pilgrimage. After my return to Egypt in the autumn, the wound healed readily without medical treatment. [FN#18] Abu Bakr, Omar, and Osman. [FN#19] I have found both these forms of writing the word in books; Moresby, or rather Mr. Rassam, erroneously spells it [...] "Ridwah."

50|$|The first <b>prickle</b> protein was {{identified}} in Drosophila as a planar cell polarity protein. Vertebrate prickle-1 was first found as a rat protein that binds to a transcription factor, neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF). It was then recognized that other vertebrates including mice and humans have two genes {{that are related}} to Drosophila <b>prickle.</b> Mouse prickle-2 was found to be expressed in mature neurons of the brain along with mouse homologs of Drosophila planar polarity genes flamingo and dischevelled. <b>Prickle</b> interacts with flamingo to regulate sensory axon advance at the transition between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Also, Prickle1 interacts with RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) by transporting REST out of the nucleus. REST turns off several critical genes in neurons by binding to particular regions of DNA in the nucleus.Prickle is recruited to the cell surface membrane by strabismus, another planar cell polarity protein. In the developing Drosophila wing, <b>prickle</b> becomes concentrated at the proximal side of cells. <b>Prickle</b> can compete with the ankyrin-repeat protein Diego for a binding site on Dishevelled.|$|E
