40|$|Keywords: Dengue- Epidemiology -Rio de JaneiroFrom November of 2001 until April of 2002, a {{total of}} 1124 blood samples were {{collected}} from patients suspected of dengue infection attendedin the Hospital Municipal Paulino Werneck (HMPW), Ilha do Governador, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The samples were used for anti-dengue IgM and IgG detection, virus isolation, RT-PCR and Real time PCR. From those samples tested, 13. 1 % (147 / 1124) were positive by IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. From these, 95 (64. 6 %) presented only IgM and 52 (35. 4 %) showed the presence of anti-dengue IgG. Considering the rate between IgM and IgG > 1. 5 as an indicative of primary infection, from the 147 infections by the dengue virus, 102 (69 %) cases were characterized as primary infection and 45 (31 %) as secondary infection. Among the seropositive patients the proportion of females, young adults and individuals residing in Ilha do Governador was higher. The population most affected was white without predominance of a specific gender, age and location of residence. The most significant clinical manifestations observed were rash and itching and leukopenia, lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia constituted the main hematological profile observed in the patients with dengue infection. The epidemic occurred during the hottest {{months of the year}} where elevated temperatures and high <b>pluvial</b> <b>index</b> are common. A higher seropositivity was observed in serum samples collected between the 4 th and 8 th day after the onset of the disease. The virus serotype virus responsible for the epidemic belongs to serotype 3 and Real time PCR demonstrated to be more sensitive than the conventional technique used to detect the infecting serotype...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of Aridity Conditions in South Dobrudja. For most people, {{the arid}} and {{semi-arid}} lands are those where precipitation is low (less than 200 mm per year), and yet enough for supplying streams capable of temporarily carrying the debris resulted from weathering, but insufficient for encouraging {{the development of}} a vegetal cover meant to protect the soil blanket against eroding agents. The drought is a major and permanent climatic risk for the Dobrudja territory as a whole and for South Dobrudja in particular, a territory where hydrographic network is underdeveloped, streams are ephemeral, and semi-endorheic areas are well developed. When the period of moisture deficiency lasts longer, it can bring about a significant water imbalance, which results in crop losses or restrictions in water consumption, thus leading to a number of economic problems. Under the circumstances, the risk of aridity expansion is significant, this being the reason why a better water management system in Romania is urgently needed. In the last decades, the numerous specialty studies undertaken in the area have emphasized an intensification of the process of dryness, because atmospheric and pedological droughts have become more and more serious. Romania {{is a member of the}} United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It actively participates within the drought management network and the Drought Management Center for Southeastern Europe, which comprises 11 countries. The scope is to work together and exchange experience with the neighboring countries that have recorded positive results and acquired a rich experience in terms of drought management. The employment of appropriate <b>pluvial</b> <b>indices</b> in identifying the areas prone to aridity may prove to be convenient tool for finding practical solutions meant to mitigate the impact of this phenomenon on the local communities living in South Dobrudja...|$|R
