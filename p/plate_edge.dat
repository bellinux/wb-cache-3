25|$|Prior to Garibaldi Belt formation, {{a number}} of older, but related {{volcanic}} belts were constructed along the Southern Coast of British Columbia. This includes the east-west trending Alert Bay Volcanic Belt on northern Vancouver Island and the Pemberton Volcanic Belt along the coastal mainland. The Pemberton Belt began its formation when the former Farallon Plate was subducting under the British Columbia Coast 29million years ago during the Oligocene epoch. At this time, the north-central portion of the Farallon Plate {{was just starting to}} subduct under the U.S. state of California, splitting it into northern and southern sections. Between 18and five million years ago during the Miocene period, the northern remnant of the Farallon Plate fractured into two tectonic plates, known as the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates. After this breakup, subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate might have been coincident with the northern end of Vancouver Island eight million years ago during the late Miocene period. This is when the Alert Bay Belt became active. A brief interval of plate motion adjustment about 3.5million years ago may have triggered the generation of basaltic magma along the descending <b>plate</b> <b>edge.</b> This eruptive period postdates the formation of the Garibaldi Belt and evidence for more recent volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt has not been found, indicating that volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt is likely extinct.|$|E
2500|$|Fore-arc {{volcanism}} {{was active}} on northern Vancouver Island 8.0to 2.5million years ago. This created {{a line of}} volcanic rocks and subvolcanic intrusions known as the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt. Named after the village of Alert Bay on Cormorant Island, it extends from the Brooks Peninsula in the southwest {{to the town of}} Port McNeill in the northeast. Geometry and chronometry studies indicate that the Alert Bay Belt formed at a descending <b>plate</b> <b>edge.</b> At the time of its formation, the Nootka Fault was probably coincident with the western end of the Alert Bay Belt, which is now [...] to the northeast. Volcanic features in the Alert Bay Belt include Twin Peaks, Cluxewe Mountain and Haddington Island.|$|E
2500|$|The poorly studied Alert Bay Volcanic Belt {{extends from}} Brooks Peninsula on the northwestern coast of Vancouver Island to Port McNeill on the northeastern coast of Vancouver Island. It {{encompasses}} several separate remnants of late Neogene volcanic piles and related intrusions ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite and {{in age from}} about eight million years old {{in the west to}} about 3.5million years old elsewhere. Major element analyses of Alert Bay volcanic and hypabyssal rocks suggest two different basalt-andesite-dacite-rhyolite suites with divergent fractionation trends. The first coincides with the typical calc-alkaline, Cascade trend, whereas the other is more alkaline and more Fe-enriched following a trend which straddles the calc-alkaline-tholeiite boundary. The western end of the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt is now about [...] northeast of the Nootka Fault. However, {{at the time of its}} formation the volcanic belt may have been coincident with the subducted plate boundary. Also, the timing of volcanism corresponds to shifts of plate motion and changes in the locus of volcanism along the Pemberton and Garibaldi volcanic belts. This brief interval of plate motion adjustment at about 3.5million years ago may have triggered the generation of basaltic magma along the descending <b>plate</b> <b>edge.</b> Because the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt has not been active for at least 3.5million years, volcanism in the Alert Bay Volcanic Belt is probably extinct.|$|E

The {{existence}} of felsite and andesite at Haddington Island suggests it might have formed 3.7 million years ago as the Juan de Fuca and Explorer Plate to its west subducted under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. As the ocean crust of the Juan de Fuca and the Explorer Plate melts, it creates magma that penetrates the crust, causing periodic eruptions of the volcanoes.
