5|$|Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) {{are about}} to kiss in the hall when Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) stops them. He tells them that he has {{received}} complaints about their <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection, which Santana decries as a double-standard, citing the much longer public kisses of Finn (Cory Monteith) and Rachel (Lea Michele).|$|E

But whatever he was, however he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and {{for much of the}} world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.|$|E

As an aspiring entrepreneur myself, I attempted to take a product to market using <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> music rights and encountered significant challenges. Through my startup journey I documented my team’s struggles. Then I compared our struggles with those of others who have attempted to innovate in the music industry using <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> music rights. I found four significant challenges. The challenges include: the lack of a streamlined process for gaining <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> music rights, lack of education about what is allowed by rights holders which has encouraged businesses to use streaming services illegally, the need for an extremely large amount of capital to gain <b>public</b> <b>display</b> <b>of</b> music rights, and ethical issues regarding how far an entrepreneur is willing go to take a product...|$|R

5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn Féin, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived with soldiers and police to try to prevent <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between the police {{and the members of the}} procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E

However, some exhibitionist bondage is done as a social or political statement. This could be an effort {{to raise awareness of}} alternative sexuality or a political metaphor for oppression.|$|E

25|$|During this time, Christians could {{retain their}} churches and {{property}} {{on condition of}} paying a tribute (jizya) for every parish, cathedral, and monastery; frequently such tribute was increased at {{the will of the}} conqueror. Christians also had to abstain from any <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> their faith in the presence of Muslims, as such an act was considered blasphemy under Islamic law and punishable by death.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{research}} looking into attachment style and mate guarding resistance too. It {{has been found that}} women who show more avoidant attachment styles are more likely to resist their partners mate guarding attempts. They are most likely to use avoiding <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection, covert tactics and resisting a partners control as resistance strategies. Those who express anxious attachment styles are more likely to resist mate guarding via covert methods.|$|E
25|$|The Gang of Four grew {{apprehensive}} that spontaneous, large-scale {{popular support}} for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose a set of restrictions on overt <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (seen as Zhou's ally), and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Austrian times, {{when the}} size and amount of public parades or other {{cultural}} expressions corresponded to each cultural group's relative population, the Polish government emphasised the Polish nature {{of the city and}} limited <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> Jewish and Ukrainian culture. Military parades and commemorations of battles at particular streets within the city, all celebrating the Polish forces who fought against the Ukrainians in 1918, became frequent, and in the 1930s a vast memorial monument and burial ground of Polish soldiers from that conflict was built in the city's Lychakiv Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In 2006–07, {{controversy}} arose that Inzamam {{and other}} {{players who were}} members of the Tablighi Jamaat Islamic missionary group, were coercing other players and giving preferential treatment to those players who grew beards and prayed regularly. The then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf expressed his concerns to the then-PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf, who warned Inzamam and told the players to stop <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> religious beliefs. Late Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer also stated that while religion fostered a degree of unity, it also interfered in the team's training and practice sessions. Inzamam publicly denied accusations of forcing Islam on other players.|$|E
25|$|Rome's {{governing}} elite produced laws {{designed to}} limit <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> personal wealth and luxury. None were particularly successful; the same wealthy elite had {{an appetite for}} luxurious clothing. Exotic fabrics were available, at a price; silk damasks, translucent gauzes, cloth of gold, and intricate embroideries; and vivid, expensive dyes such as saffron yellow or Tyrian purple. Not all dyes were costly, however, and most Romans wore colourful clothing. Clean, bright clothing was a mark of respectability and status among all social classes. The fastenings and brooches used to secure garments such as cloaks provided further opportunities for personal embellishment and display.|$|E

He {{mentions}} hardly ever seeing his mother and father, who did not believe in <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> affection. George works at a bank in London, and it is hinted that his father did as well. George had a nanny named Miss Euphemia Andrew as a child, who was also very strict. George is often away at work and rarely spends time with the children. In the film and musical, as the story goes on, he learns lessons about being more affectionate to his family and is taught that they are more important than work.|$|E
25|$|Yasmin Khan {{argued that}} Gandhi's death and funeral helped {{consolidate}} {{the authority of}} the new Indian state under Nehru and Patel. The Congress tightly controlled the epic <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> grief over a two-week period—the funeral, mortuary rituals and distribution of the martyr's ashes—as millions participated and hundreds of millions watched. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimise the Congress party's control and suppress all religious para-military groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests. Gandhi's death and funeral linked the distant state with the Indian people and made more understand the need to suppress religious parties during the transition to independence for the Indian people.|$|E
25|$|Rahmon is a Sunni Muslim {{and he has}} {{frequently}} stressed his Muslim background even though his administration {{is engaged in a}} relentless campaign against <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> Islamic devotion. His suppression of Islamic expression includes banning beards, attendence at the mosque for women and children under eighteen, hajj for people under 40, studying in Islamic schools outside Tajikistan, the production, import or export of Islamic books without permission (implemented in 2017), using loudspeakers to broadcast the adhan, veils, madrassas, Islamist political parties and Arabic-sounding names (implemented in 2016). Furthermore, mosques are heavily regulated, providing unofficial Islamic teaching can lead to up to twelve years of imprisonment and an arduous process is required in order to obtain a permit to establish an Islamic organisation, publish an Islamic book or go on pilgrimage to Mecca. In January 2016, Rahmon performed an Umrah with a number of his children and senior members of his government. That was Rahmon's fourth pilgrimage to Mecca.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, after {{a period}} in which his own equivocal stance on the matter had drawn controversy, Constantinescu's {{successor}} Ion Iliescu established the Wiesel Commission, an international group of expert historians whose mission was the study of the Holocaust in Romania, later succeeded by the Elie Wiesel National Institute. The Final Report compiled by the Commission brought the official recognition of Ion Antonescu's participation in the Holocaust. After that moment, <b>public</b> <b>displays</b> <b>of</b> support for Antonescu became illegal. Antonescu's SMERSH interrogations were recovered from the Russian archives and published in 2006. Despite the renewed condemnation and exposure, Antonescu remained a popular figure: {{as a result of the}} 2006 Mari Români series of polls conducted by the national station TVR 1, viewers nominated Antonescu as the 6th greatest Romanian ever. The vote's knockout phase included televised profiles of the ten most popular figures, and saw historian Adrian Cioroianu using the portion dedicated to Antonescu to expose and condemn him, giving voters reasons not to see the dictator as a great Romanian. The approach resulted in notable controversy after Ziua newspaper criticized Cioroianu, who defended himself by stating he had an obligation to tell the truth.|$|E
