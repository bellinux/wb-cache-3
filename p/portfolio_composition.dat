40|$|Robust {{optimization}} {{has been}} receiving increased {{attention in the}} recent few years due {{to the possibility of}} considering the problem of estimation error in the portfolio optimization problem. A question addressed so far by very few works is whether this approach is able to outperform traditional portfolio optimization techniques in terms of out-of-sample performance. Moreover, {{it is important to know}} whether this approach is able to deliver stable <b>portfolio</b> <b>compositions</b> over time, thus reducing management costs and facilitating practical implementation. We provide empirical evidence by assessing the out-of-sample performance and the stability of optimal <b>portfolio</b> <b>compositions</b> obtained with robust optimization and with traditional optimization techniques. The results indicated that, for simulated data, robust optimization performed better (both in terms of Sharpe ratios and portfolio turnover) than Markowitz's mean-variance portfolios and similarly to minimum-variance portfolios. The results for real market data indicated that the differences in risk-adjusted performance were not statistically different, but the <b>portfolio</b> <b>compositions</b> associated to robust optimization were more stable over time than traditional portfolio selection techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} impact of non-interest income {{businesses}} on bank lending. Using quarterly data on 7, 578 U.

Moreover, we find that a greater reliance on loan servicing is associated with lower lending-deposit spreads.

We show that such effects are not new, in fact we find a strong relation between stock market liquidity and the business cycle. We also show that the <b>portfolio</b> <b>compositions</b> of investors change with the business cycle and that investor participation is related to market liquidity. This suggests that systematic liquidity variation is related to a “flight to quality” during economic downturns. Overall, our results provide an new explanation for the observed commonality in liquidity...|$|R
5000|$|As {{originally}} {{practiced by}} the Boston Consulting Group, the matrix was used in situations where it could be applied for graphically illustrating a <b>portfolio</b> <b>composition</b> {{as a function of}} the balance between cash flows. [...] If used with this degree of sophistication its use would still be valid. However, later practitioners have tended to over-simplify its messages. In particular, the later application of the names (problem children, stars, cash cows and dogs) has tended to overshadow all else—and is often what most students, and practitioners, remember.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{magnitude}} of discrepancies in valuations {{in this kind of}} trade is small (for the benchmark Treasury convergence trade, typically a few basis points), in order to earn significant returns for investors, LTCM used leverage to create a portfolio that was a significant multiple (varying over time depending on their <b>portfolio</b> <b>composition)</b> of investors' equity in the fund. It was also necessary to access the financing market in order to borrow the securities that they had sold short. In order to maintain their portfolio, LTCM was therefore dependent on the willingness of its counterparties in the government bond (repo) market to continue to finance their portfolio. If the company was unable to extend its financing agreements, then it would be forced to sell the securities it owned and to buy back the securities it was short at market prices, regardless of whether these were favourable from a valuation perspective.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} Crown financial <b>portfolio</b> <b>composition</b> from {{a welfare}} perspective. It {{argues that a}} broad definition of the Crown’s portfolio is required for analysing the welfare implications of <b>portfolio</b> <b>composition.</b> In practice, this means incorporating the present discounted value of tax and expenditure flows as well as traditional measures of assets and liabilities. Financial <b>portfolio</b> <b>composition</b> affects welfare {{for a number of}} reasons: imperfect and incomplete markets; distortionary taxes; externalities; and agency problems. There is unlikely to be a single policy objective for choosing the preferred <b>portfolio</b> <b>composition</b> that integrates all of those factors. However, it is argued that the Crown should be risk averse and aim to eliminate all diversifiable risk in its portfolio. There is a reasonable case for adopting a low-risk Crown portfolio. Importantly, that does not necessarily require a low-volatility financial portfolio. Public Finance, Portfolio Management...|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} of optimal portfolios {{is the central}} problem of financial investment decisions. Mathematically speaking, portfolio selection refers to the formulation of an objective function that determines the weights of the portfolio invested in each asset as to maximize return and minimize risk. This paper applies the method of genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain an optimal portfolio selection. However, the GA parameters are of great importance in the procedure of convergence of this algorithm towards the optimal solution such as crossover. While, a five stock portfolio example is used in this paper to illustrate the applicability and efficiency of genetic algorithm method, GA method {{can also be used}} however for a larger number of <b>portfolio</b> <b>compositions.</b> The results obtained confirm previous research studies about the validity and efficiency of genetic algorithm in selecting optimal portfolios. ...|$|R

Since the introduction of the mean-variance model, variance has become the most common risk measure used by practitioners and researchers in portfolio optimization.

Many studies have proposed different risk measures to overcome the drawbacks of variance. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss and compare the <b>portfolio</b> <b>compositions</b> and performances of four different portfolio optimization models employing different risk measures, specifically the variance, absolute deviation, minimax and semi-variance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the gap between policy, authority and limits of the foreign exchange transactions currently used, with the risk limit (VaR) given by the bank management to its Foreign Exchange Business Unit.

In this research, the researcher's found that there is a significant portfolio gap for each market condition and the bank management have to set an optimal and more accommodative <b>portfolio</b> <b>composition</b> to minimize the gap. Within the three compositions researched, the researcher's found that there are advantages and disadvantages for each composition and the need to choose a composition wich is consider the most favorable for the management.

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} has been devoted in the financial literature to excessive portfolio concentrations in domestic risky assets relative to those predicted by standard finance models-generally identified as"home bias"-across international markets.

We develop discriminating hypotheses about the roles of"specific" and"general"human capital endowments and the direct and opportunity costs of asset management in determining how home bias varies among individual investors and across financial markets.
