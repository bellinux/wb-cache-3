40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} the printed screen {{elements}} made by the application of two types of offset rubber blankets (ORB) have been investigated in this work. The force in the contact zone between the offset cylinder (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic papers (fine art paper gloss, fine art <b>paper</b> <b>mat,</b> offset paper, calendered offset paper and recycled paper) have been analyzed. The results show that on the tested printing substrates, the both ORBs form the greatest dot gains in the following order: offset paper, recycled paper, calendered offset paper, fine art <b>paper</b> <b>mat</b> and fine art paper gloss.

40|$|Necessity of {{electricity}} access in remote {{area is the}} main reason for expanding decentralized energy system such as stand-alone power systems. The best electrical power supply must provide a constant magnitude and frequency voltage. Therefore, good power quality is an important factor for the reliable operation of electrical loads in a power system. However, the current drawn by most of electronic devices and non-linear loads are non-sinusoidal, which can result in a poor power quality, especially in off-grid power systems. Poor power quality is characterized by electrical disturbances such as transients, sags, swells, harmonics and even interruptions in the power supply. Off-grid power systems world wide often struggle with system failures and equipment damage due to poor power quality. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>MAT</b> - LAB/Simulink is used to model and analyse s power quality in an off-grid renewable energy system.

Lene Schneider-Kainer, (16 May, 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June, 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian artist, daughter of the painter Sigmund Schneider. She studied art throughout Europe, and married Ludwig Kainer in 1910. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition at the Galerie Gurlitt, and through the 1920 s she became renowned as painter and illustrator. In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey retracing the steps of Marco Polo. She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the Berliner Tageblatt. Due to the rise of the Nazis she settled in Mallorca in 1932, and later Ibiza. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York.

40|$|The male {{annihilation}} technique (MAT) is {{a chemical}} control method designed to deplete the males available for mating {{in a population}} and thus break the reproductive cycle. In the New South Wales fruit fly control program, caneite {{has been used as}} a carrier for the lure and pesticide in MAT blocks for many years. In this <b>paper,</b> <b>MAT</b> blocks containing cuelure as an attractant and malathion as a toxicant were manufactured using two methods, namely bag immersion and roller painting, as part of the control program for Queensland fruit fly in New South Wales between September 1998 and June 2000. These blocks were sampled from storage and the field, along with historical blocks in the field deployed before the current study period. Chemical analyses of these three block types were conducted for malathion, cuelure, and raspberry ketone (a breakdown product of cuelure). There was significantly more cuelure and malathion in blocks made by the bag method than the roller method and in historical blocks. The bag method resulted in chemical concentrations closer to the desired standards. There were no significant differences between the three methods in block weight or in level of raspberry ketone. Cuelure levels declined more quickly than malathion although both chemicals were found in all blocks. For the analysis within samples, there were few significant correlations between raspberry ketone and other parameters, but there were many significant correlations between cuelure, malathion and the block weight. 5 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Novel {{nanoporous}} poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) {{films with}} basalt-like surface morphology are successfully obtained via a one-step, vapor phase process of oxidative {{chemical vapor deposition}} (oCVD) by introducing a new oxidant, CuCl 2, The substrate temperature of the oCVD process is a crucial process parameter for controlling electrical conductivity and conjugation length. Moreover, the surface morphology is also systemically tunable through variations in substrate temperature, a unique advantage of the oCVD process. By increasing the substrate temperature, the surface morphology becomes more porous, with the textured structure on the nanometer scale. The size of nanopores and fibrils appears uniformly over 25 mm × 25 mm areas on the Si wafer substrates. Conformal coverage of PENT films grown with the CuCl 2 oxidant (C-PEDOT) is observed on both standard trench structures with high aspect ratio and fragile surfaces with complex topology, such as paper, results which are extremely difficult to achieve with liquid phase based processes. The tunable nanoporosity and its conformal coverage on various complex geometries are highly desirable for many device applications requiring controlled, high interfacial area, such as supercapacitors, Li ion battery electrodes, and sensors. For example, a highly hydrophilic surface with the static water contact angle down to less than 10 Ý is obtained solely by changing surface morphology. By applying fluorinated polymer film onto the nanoporous C-PEDOT via initiative chemical vapor deposition (ICVD), the C-PEDOT surface also shows the contact angle higher than 150 Ý.

Digital imageHelmuth Nathan was a surgeon, painter, and sculptor. Nathan hailed from an old Jewish family that had lived in Schleswig-Holstein since the early 17 th century. After his medical training, which he received in Hamburg and Freiburg, Nathan settled in Hamburg to specialize as a surgeon. In 1936, {{he and his wife}} were forced to emigrate to the United States, where he was able to work, due to his numerous scientific publications. In 1955, Nathan started working at the newly established Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx and became one of its chief surgeons in 1960. Even after his retirement, Nathan continued to teach a course that he himself had introduced to the academic field: combining art history and the history of medicine. Artistic luminaries such as Salvadore Dali, George Grosz, and Chaim Gross would volunteer to give guest lectures to Nathan's students. Apart from being a prolific writer in the medical field, Nathan created a plethora of paintings, drawings and sculptures. His models were political figures, musicians, artists, and other physicians. Ludwig Tietz (1897 - 1933) was a noted physician who, after the Nazi takeover of Germany, devoted most of his time to issues of Jewish relief. He served as a member of the Central Union of German Citzens of the Jewish Faith and was executive director of the Central Committee of German Jews for Relief and Rehabilitation.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers, all {{of them on the}} topic of function spaces on fractals. The papers summarised in this thesis are: <b>Paper</b> I <b>Mats</b> Bodin, Wavelets and function spaces on Mauldin-Williams fractals, Research Report in Mathematics No. 7, Umeå University, 2005. <b>Paper</b> II <b>Mats</b> Bodin, Harmonic functions and Lipschitz spaces on the Sierpinski gasket, Research Report in Mathematics No. 8, Umeå University, 2005. <b>Paper</b> III <b>Mats</b> Bodin, A discrete characterisation of Lipschitz spaces on fractals, Manuscript. The first paper deals with piecewise continuous wavelets of higher order in Besov spaces defined on fractals. A. Jonsson has constructed wavelets of higher order on fractals, and characterises Besov spaces on totally disconnected self-similar sets, by means of the magnitude of the coefficients in the wavelet expansion of the function. For a class of fractals, W. Jin shows that such wavelets can be constructed by recursively calculating moments. We extend their results to a class of graph directed self-similar fractals, introduced by R. D. Mauldin and S. C. Williams. In the second paper we compare differently defined function spaces on the Sierpinski gasket. R. S. Strichartz proposes a discrete definition of Besov spaces of continuous functions on self-similar fractals having a regular harmonic structure. We identify some of them with Lipschitz spaces introduced by A. Jonsson, when the underlying domain is the Sierpinski gasket. We also characterise some of these spaces by means of the magnitude of the coefficients of the expansion of a function in a continuous piecewise harmonic base. The last paper gives a discrete characterisation of certain Lipschitz spaces on a class of fractal sets. A. Kamont has discretely characterised Besov spaces on intervals. We give a discrete characterisation of Lipschitz spaces on fractals admitting a type of regular sequence of triangulations, and for a class of post critically finite self-similar sets. This shows that, on some fractals, certain discretely defined Besov spaces, introduced by R. Strichartz, coincide with Lipschitz spaces introduced by A. Jonsson and H. Wallin for low order of smoothness...|$|R

The vibration behavior of a flat steel plate has been improved by the gluing of a lightweight composite formed by a core of polyurethane foam and two <b>paper</b> <b>mats</b> placed on its faces. This composite enables the natural frequencies to be increased and the modal density of the plate to be reduced, moving about the natural frequencies of the plate out of excitation range, thereby improving the vibration behavior of the plate.

The model of composite + flat steel plate determined by FEM was used to conduct parametric study, and the most influential factors for 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd mode were identified using a multifactor analysis of variance (Multifactor-ANOVA).
