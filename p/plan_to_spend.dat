2500|$|By August 1978, actual {{construction}} costs were now $85 million ($ in [...] dollars) and {{were expected to}} top $122 million ($ in [...] dollars). The Senate approved a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> another $54 million ($ in [...] dollars) on the structure, and cap costs at $135 million ($ in [...] dollars). [...] Initially, the House approved this plan. But when constituents bitterly complained, the House reversed itself on both counts. By 1979, construction estimates had soared to $179 million ($ in [...] dollars), and the General Accounting Office said it would rise to $230 million ($ in [...] dollars) without changes. In July 1979, the Senate agreed to cap costs at $137.7 million ($ in [...] dollars) after an acrimonious three-hour debate during which some senators suggested the building be torn down. The Architect of the Capitol ordered changes in the design to keep {{construction costs}} under the $137.7 million cap. These included elimination of a penthouse-level dining room, $906,000 ($ in [...] dollars) in furnishings for an interior gymnasium, oak paneling for each senator's office, dimmer switches for lights, a $400,000 ($ in [...] dollars) art gallery, $227,000 ($ in [...] dollars) in carpeting for auxiliary space, $167,700 ($ in [...] dollars) for vertical blinds, and $1.2 million [...] ($ in [...] dollars) for finishes and furnishings for a large central hearing room with hidden multimedia bays.|$|E

6000|$|Claude's {{house is}} {{arranged}} {{with his usual}} defiance of all conventionalities. Dining or drawing-room proper there is none; the large front room is the studio, where he and Sabina eat and drink, as well as work and paint but out of it opens a little room, the walls of which are so covered with gems of art (where the rogue finds money to buy them is a puzzle), that the eye can turn nowhere without taking in some new beauty, and wandering on from picture to statue, from portrait to landscape, dreaming and learning afresh after every glance. At the back, a glass bay has been thrown out, and forms a little conservatory, for ever fresh and gay with tropic ferns and flowers; gaudy orchids dangle from the roof, creepers hide the framework, and you hardly see where the room ends, and the winter-garden begins; and in the centre an ottoman invites you to lounge. It costs Claude money, doubtless; but he has his excuse,--"Having once seen the tropics, I cannot live without some love-tokens from their lost paradises; and which is the wiser <b>plan,</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> money on a horse and brougham, which we don't care to use, and on scrambling into society {{at the price of}} one great stupid party a year, or to make our little world as pretty as we can, and let those who wish to see us, take us as they find us?" ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{was because}} she was false {{altogether}} and deception {{came out of her}} with her breath; she was so depraved that it was easier to her to fabricate than to let it alone. Laura would not have asked her to give an account of her day, but she would ask her now. She shuddered at one moment, as she found herself saying--even in silence--such things of her sister, and the next she sat staring out of the front of the cab at the stiff problem presented by Selina's turning up with the partner of her guilt at the Soane Museum, of all places in the world. The girl shifted this fact about in various ways, to account for it--not unconscious as she did so that it was a pretty exercise of ingenuity for a nice girl. Plainly, it was a rare accident: if it had been their <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> the day together the Soane Museum had not been in the original programme. They had been near it, they had been on foot and they had rushed in to take refuge from the rain. But how did they come to be near it and above all to be on foot? How could Selina do anything so reckless from her own point of view as to walk about the town--even an out-of-the-way part of it--with her suspected lover? Laura Wing felt the want of proper knowledge to explain such anomalies. It was too little clear to her where ladies went and how they proceeded when they consorted with gentlemen in regard to their meetings with whom they had to lie. She knew nothing of where Captain Crispin lived; very possibly--for she vaguely remembered having heard Selina say of him that he was very poor--he had chambers {{in that part of the}} town, and they were either going to them or coming from them. If Selina had neglected to take her way in a four-wheeler with the glasses up it was through some chance that would not seem natural till it was explained, like that of their having darted into a public institution. Then no doubt it would hang together with the rest only too well. The explanation most exact would probably be that the pair had snatched a walk together (in the course of a day of many edifying episodes) for the 'lark' of it, and for the sake of the walk had taken the risk, which in that part of London, so detached from all gentility, had appeared to them small. The last thing Selina could have expected was to meet her sister in such a strange corner--her sister with a young man of her own! ...|$|E
