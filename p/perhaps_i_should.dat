500|$|Andrew Keir as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Nigel Kneale {{had long}} been highly {{critical}} of Brian Donlevy's interpretation of Quatermass and lobbied for the role to be recast, arguing that enough time had passed that audiences would not resist a change of actor. A number of actors were considered for the part including André Morell who had played Quatermass in the television version of Quatermass and the Pit. However, Morell {{was not interested in}} revisiting a role he had already played. The producers eventually settled on Scottish actor Andrew Keir who had appeared in supporting roles in a number of Hammer productions including The Pirates of Blood River (1962), The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964) and [...] (1966). Keir found the shoot an unhappy experience: he later recalled, “The director – Roy Ward Baker – didn't want me for the role. He wanted Kenneth More... {{and it was a very}} unhappy shoot. [...] Normally I enjoy going to work every day. But for seven and a half weeks it was sheer hell.” Roy Ward Baker denied he had wanted Kenneth More, who he felt would be [...] "too nice" [...] for the role, saying, “I had no idea he [...] was unhappy while we were shooting. His performance was absolutely right in every detail and I was presenting him as the star of the picture. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have interfered more.” Keir went on to appear for Hammer in The Viking Queen (1967) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971). He reprised the role of Quatermass for BBC Radio 3 in The Quatermass Memoirs (1996), making him the only actor other than Donlevy to play the role more than once.|$|E
2500|$|Kenneth Arrow (1983) {{describes}} Foundations as [...] "the only example I know of {{a doctoral}} dissertation that is a treatise, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say of a treatise that has so much originality in every part that it is entitled to be accepted as a thesis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Milward Kennedy in {{his review}} in The Guardian of 21 September 1934 said after {{summarising}} the set-up of the plot that, [...] "Poirot has no part in this book; instead, {{a young man and}} a young woman who blend charm and irresponsibility with shrewdness and good luck contrive amusingly and successfully to usurp the functions of the police. The fault which I find is the overimportance of luck. For the villains it was, for example, singular good luck which enabled them to discover and identify an obscure vicar's fourth son asleep on a solitary picnic; it was very bad luck for them {{that he was able to}} assimilate a sixteenth times fatal dose of morphia. They were lucky, again, in having always at hand just the properties required to make an extempore murder seem something else; and as for the Bright Young Couple – but these are defects which are little noticeable in the gay stream of Mrs. Christie's narrative. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have noticed them had I not read the book so quickly that, in a secluded village, there was nothing for it next day but to read it again with a sterner eye but no less enjoyment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If what, Mrs. Finn? You mean, <b>perhaps,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ever {{be allowed}} to call myself his son-in-law. It may seem to you to be arrogant, {{but it is an}} honour which I expect to win." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will {{be better}} <b>perhaps</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> go. People will think that I am estranged from Lucius. But if I go, you will come to me? He will let you do that; will he not?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On the surface, the {{two main}} {{characters}} have little in common. As O'Brian wrote in The Ionian Mission, [...] "Although (they) were almost as unlike as men could be, unlike in nationality, religion, education, size, shape, profession, habit of mind, they were united in a deep love for music, and many and many an evening had they played together, violin answering cello or both singing together far into the night." [...] This musical connection began in the first paragraph of the first book in the series, when the two characters meet at a concert. They also share a delight in puns and dry witticisms, and particularly memorable wordplay is sometimes repeated in subsequent novels in the series, years later in book-time. One character in the novel, Sir Joseph Blaine, saw the two friends as romantics, in his remarks on Maturin in HMS Surprise Chapter 4: [...] "As I was saying, strong; but not without his weaknesses. He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day - the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now - and if I {{had not been so}} shocked by his condition, I should have been tempted to laugh. He is himself a perfect Quixote: an enthusiastic supporter of the Revolution until ‘93; a United Irishman until the rising, Lord Edward’s adviser.... And now Catalan independence. Or <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say, Catalan independence from the beginning, simultaneously with the others. But always heart and soul, blood and purse in some cause from which he can derive no conceivable personal benefit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Wallace. [...] "I should {{dispose of}} him in some way, so {{that he should not}} be the means of any more trouble. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> give him away; <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> open the cage and let him run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I {{known all}} this {{story from the}} first, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have done what I have done to-day and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have forgiven and forgotten, for in truth even if the dwarf still lies, I believe your word, O Shabaka, and {{understand}} how all came about. But now {{it is too late}} to change. Say, O Priest of the Mother, is it not too late?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid Fred {{is not to}} be trusted, Mary," [...] {{said the}} father, with hesitating tenderness. [...] "He means better than he acts, <b>perhaps.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>should</b> think it a pity for any body's {{happiness}} to be wrapped up in him, and so would your mother." ...|$|R
60|$|It was in vain I {{strove to}} warn the fellow of whither he was drifting; in vain I admonished and sought to curb his headlong recklessness. I have said that I had a {{friendship}} for him, {{and because of that}} I took more pains, <b>perhaps,</b> than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have taken in another's case.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because had I done so {{she would}} have thought and you might have thought, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> myself <b>should</b> have thought that I did it, as once I offered to do, to win her whom I desired above all things on earth. Now she is dead and it is otherwise. Shrive me, father, and do your office." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} that <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{never get the}} ivory from the graveyard of the elephants, as the Black Kendah might prevent this.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg pardon," [...] hastily {{explained}} Miss Gentle, [...] "I don't mean frightened, of course; <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have said}} alarmed, or agitated--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we will {{consider}} that settled. Good morning, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say au revoir;" [...] and, bowing again, he left the office.|$|E
6000|$|... "That I won't tell you," [...] he said, [...] "in {{case you}} should be superstitious. At the same time, I am bound to confess {{that if we could}} both of us hear exactly what Jocelyn Thew is saying to-night across those red roses, <b>I</b> think <b>perhaps</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> back the House of York." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've nursed {{the estate}} ever since {{it came to}} me; I've carried on the {{tradition}} as best I could; I've not been as good a man, <b>perhaps,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have wished, but I've always tried to remember my old father's words: 'I'm done for, Horry; the estate's in your hands now.'" [...] He cleared his throat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I, certainly, have {{no reason}} to boast of parentage, after what I have seen this night," [...] said the girl, in a saddened voice. [...] "I had a mother, it is true; but of her name even, I am ignorant--and, as for my father, it is better, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never know who he was, lest I speak too bitterly of him!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is a {{negative}} sort of goodness, I fear. I have never been tried or tempted severely. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> fail under the test." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall do nothing;--or, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{in such a}} case {{acknowledge}} it, {{and tell}} him that we have nothing more to say to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I do;--quite as much, and <b>perhaps</b> more than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> love {{any of the}} others. Only {{there are plenty of}} things that aren't in Anton that I would love in the other men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not a}} {{question}} of pocket," [...] Mr. Parker continued, disregarding my remark, [...] "it is {{a question}} of taste and judgment; discrimination is <b>perhaps</b> the word <b>I</b> <b>should</b> use. Now in my younger days--Eh? What's that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 179. It is well, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> at once confess {{myself to}} hold the {{principle}} of limitation in its utmost extent; and to entertain no doubt of the rightness of my ideal, but only of its feasibility. I am ill at ease, for instance, in my uncertainty whether our greatly regretted Chairman will ever be Pope, or whether some people whom I could mention, (not, of course, members of our Society,) will ever be in Cocytus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{look after}} it, I'll keep it under. Rather <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say I'll bribe it and amuse it; I'll gorge it with earthly grandeurs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To be sure, my dear,' he returned, with a most {{flagrant}} {{assumption of}} unconsciousness, 'I did omit it. How--or <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather say where--IS Bella?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{you have}} to-day come of age. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have been {{glad to see}} such an {{occasion}} noticed at Greshamsbury with some more suitable signs of rejoicing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! my boy," [...] {{the gentleman}} said, [...] "you {{have asked the}} only thing, <b>perhaps,</b> which <b>I</b> <b>should</b> feel obliged to refuse you. Already {{we have more than}} our number, and to avoid the importunity of the many who wish to go, or of my {{powerful}} friends who desired to place sons or relations in my charge, I have been obliged to swear that I would take no other sailor, in addition to those already shipped.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my wish," [...] he continued, [...] "to {{remain in}} this {{neighbourhood}} {{for a short}} time--perhaps a fortnight and <b>perhaps</b> a month. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> value your introduction to the hotel here, and the extension of such hospitality as may seem fitting to you, under the circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps so, old man, <b>perhaps</b> so; but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not {{get into}} fever heat about it. You see, the matter at present principally {{concerns}} Halliburn. It is his business and privilege to stand first {{in the line of}} defence of the character of the young lady to whom he is engaged.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} he has been here. I met him at the station at Exeter. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not say so, but I wish he had {{remained}} away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{speak of}} morals or religion--my own or anybody else's. Though <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have been a}} very good Christian if you pretty women hadn't made me an idolater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you had not}} {{smiled as}} you did, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have come out here tonight," [...] he said, with his playful earnestness of tone. [...] "It was your triumph." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{on hearing}} this most of the Boers broke out laughing, for, though very religious, {{we are not a}} people who place faith in visions. Thereupon I grew angry, and spoke to them more strongly, <b>perhaps,</b> than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have done, {{reducing}} them to silence, for they were all of them a little afraid of my tongue. Also I told them the story of that dream of Ralph's and of what had just passed with Gaasha, showing them that there was more in it than they imagined. After I had done Ralph spoke also, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|I may add that, {{after our}} brief {{talk in the}} King's kraal, while Panda was dozing, I had no further words with Saduko on this matter of his marriage, for between its {{proposal}} and the event he avoided me, nor did I seek him out. On {{the day of the}} marriage also, I trekked for Natal, and for a whole year heard no more of Saduko, Nandie, and Mameena; although, to be frank, I must admit I thought of the last of these persons more often, <b>perhaps,</b> than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have done.|$|R
6000|$|... "A dog. How horrible! What was it doing? Hunting? If {{there are}} no hares here what could it be hunting? A rabbit, or a {{pheasant}} with a broken wing, or <b>perhaps</b> a fox? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not mind so much {{if it were a}} fox. I hate foxes; they catch young hares when they are asleep and eat them." ...|$|R
