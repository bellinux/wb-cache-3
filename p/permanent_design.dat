25|$|In {{order to}} handle the {{increasing}} size of ocean liners, new mooring systems have been introduced to allow successful berthing of these vessels. Most significantly was a special temporary mooring system, designed and implemented by engineering firm Arup Group in 2012 to allow the mooring of the Queen Mary II. This involved a series of temporary drag anchors to be installed on the seabed around Campbell's Cove and the passenger terminal to take the ship's bow lines. This temporary system has subsequently been kept for larger vessels to moor, pending the design and implementation of a more <b>permanent</b> <b>design.</b> As {{a result of this}} temporary mooring system's success, a permanent new mooring dolphin with both fixed above-water pile and a concrete deck mooring structure was introduced adjacent to Campbell's Cove {{to the north of the}} OPT.|$|E
2500|$|Abney Park has a {{claim to}} be the {{earliest}} complete design for a permanent [...] "Egyptian Revival" [...] entranceway at a cemetery anywhere in the world. The gateway at Mount Auburn Cemetery, from which it took its inspiration, was at that time still a temporary structure, being made of dusted wood and sand; its <b>permanent</b> <b>design</b> was not built until two years after Abney Park opened. In England there were already some examples of the use of Egyptian Revival architecture on a small scale, including one example of a small gate installed at a cemetery for Nonconformists near Sheffield in 1836. However, Abney Park Cemetery became the first to employ the style for cemetery buildings, and also the first to introduce it for a complete entrance design.|$|E
