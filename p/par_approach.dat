Thunderstorms were in the area as the flight {{approached}} Clark AB. An indefinite ceiling was at 300 feet and visibility was 2000 m. The crew carried out a <b>PAR</b> <b>approach</b> to runway 02. The aircraft descended below the glidepath and the crew were urged to initiate go around as the C-135 had descended below the PAR lower safety limit. By then, the co-pilot had the runway in sight and the approach was continued. On final, the undercarriage struck the perimeter fence. The airplane struck a TACAN facility, hit the ground and slid across a road, striking a cab and killing the driver. The airplane broke up and caught fire. Five of the ten crewmembers and all 74 passengers were fatally injured, along with the unfortunate cab driver.|$|E
50|$|Precision {{approach}} radar (PAR) {{is a type}} of radar {{guidance system}} designed to provide lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft pilot for landing, until the landing threshold is reached. After the aircraft reaches the decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA), guidance is advisory only. Controllers monitoring the PAR displays observe each aircraft's position and issue instructions to the pilot that keep the aircraft on course and glidepath during final approach. It is similar to an instrument landing system (ILS) but requires control instructions. One type of instrument approach that can make use of PAR is the ground-controlled approach (GCA). Air traffic controllers must transmit a minimum of every 5 seconds to the pilot their relation to the azimuth portion and, once intercepting the glidepath, their elevation. The approach is terminated when the aircraft reaches the OCA/H (Obstacle Clearance Altitude/Height). Nevertheless, information is provided till threshold and aircraft may be monitored by controller till touchdown. Controller in charge of PAR should not be responsible for any duty other than the <b>PAR</b> <b>approach</b> concerned.|$|E

[...] Boston UniversityBACKGROUND: The {{potential}} of hospital performance measurement (HPM) {{to contribute to}} improved quality of care and patient outcomes is underrepresented in the health system strengthening literature and no standardized HPM instrument exists for hospitals in developing countries. The problem centered Participatory Action Research (<b>PAR)</b> <b>approach</b> is particularly suited to addressing complex organizational problems in low resource settings and is gaining acceptance as an applied research method in healthcare settings. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study using the <b>PAR</b> <b>approach</b> {{was carried out in}} 4 hospitals in Cameroon. Quantitative (415 surveys) and qualitative (129 interviews and 77 observations) methods examined how participating in the design of a HPM instrument influences health personnel's knowledge, attitude, interest, and intention to continue use of performance measurement for quality improvement. Changes in scores for the above outcomes from before and after implementation of the performance indicators were compared to scores from a non-participating control hospital at the same time points. RESULTS: Personnel designed and pilot tested performance measurement indicators in all hospital services. Hospitals that actively participated in instrument design showed a statistically significant increase in HPM knowledge and attitude, and {{were more likely to report}} intention to continue using HPM as compared to the non-participating hospital. Hospital personnel participating in the design process were more aware of the workload barriers to implementing HPM but nonetheless were more motivated to continue the HPM effort. In addition, the <b>PAR</b> <b>approach</b> fostered ownership, increased skills, raised awareness of performance gaps, and led to a contextually appropriate tool. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of designing and implementing an HPM instrument in a low-resource health care system and highlight the positive benefits of the <b>PAR</b> <b>approach.</b> Further research is needed to determine the effect of regular HPM on quality of care and its sustainability over time in resource constrained settings...|$|E

In such a case, the major perioperative complication is acute obstruction immediately after surgery. We review the etiology of obstructive complications that present postoperatively in the first 24 hours. CASE REPORTS: Acute postoperative stoma obstruction (esophageal outlet stenosis) was observed in 5 patients who underwent 9. 75 -cm Lap-Band placement for morbid obesity. 2 of these patients had a postoperative upper GI series showing a misplaced band with gastric slippage, and repeat operation was required. 3 patients had gastric obstruction without slippage. Of the latter, 1 patient insisted that the band be removed rather than being replaced with a longer one, and the remaining 2 were managed with conservative treatment, involving extended hospitalization until the edema subsided and the patient slowly regained the ability to swallow. CONCLUSION: Obstructive symptoms associated with the Lap-Band using the <b>pars</b> flaccida <b>approach</b> can be addressed conservatively in most patients or by minimally invasive surgery; however we believe that routine use of the 11 -cm Lap-Band for the <b>pars</b> flaccida <b>approach</b> could easily prevent this early complication...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the experiences of physical therapists who were conducting clinical research, facilitated by a <b>PAR</b> <b>approach.</b> DESIGN: A mixed-methods research design was used. METHODS: Physical therapists completed questionnaires, were interviewed, and participated in focus groups prior to and after the 1 -year intervention and 1 year later. The research facilitator took field notes. Questionnaire data were analyzed descriptively, and themes were developed from the qualitative data. Twenty-five therapists took part in 4 self-selected groups. RESULTS: Three groups actively participated in the PAR research projects (n= 14). The remaining 11 therapists decided not to be involved in clinical research projects but took part in the study as participants. After 1 year, one group completed the data collection phase of their research project, and a second group completed their ethics application. The third group ceased their research project but hosted a journal club session. At completion of the study, the experiences of the physical therapists were positive, and their confidence in conducting research and orientation toward research had increased. The perceptions of physical therapists toward research, relationships among individuals, and how the clinical projects were structured influenced the success of the projects. LIMITATIONS: Only physical therapists of one hospital and no other health care practitioners were included in this study.

40|$|The growing ethno-racial {{diversity}} {{reflected in}} Canadian society has prompted increased academic interest, {{particularly in the}} field of social work, in understanding how people from different ethno-racial groups experience and perceive the world. In this paper, we talk about the challenges of creating such knowledge, or engaging in “cross-cultural research”. We focus this discussion on three main dimensions of the research process: the goals and values underlying the research; the nature of knowledge negotiated in the research relationship; and the way that power is structured in the researcher/participant relationship. We begin by describing each of these with reference to “traditional ” ways of doing cross-cultural research, and articulate how such approaches work to sustain the colonialist project. We then discuss the growing trend towards using “Participatory Action Research ” (PAR) as an alternative approach to conducting research in the social sciences that is respectful, liberating, and geared towards social change. We suggest, however, that the idealization that PAR can somehow create an innocent or non-oppressive space for research is an illusion.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} a Participatory Action Research (<b>PAR)</b> <b>approach</b> in the community's reappropriation of an externally-generated linguistic research project. By employing a <b>PAR</b> <b>approach,</b> we show that the indigenous researcher and community can still appropriate the work even if the research initiative has emerged from outside. The Mayangna of Nicaragua had established a linguistic research team in the mid 1990 's. They were recently presented with a research initiative to document meronymies and spatial frames of reference {{as part of a larger}} project. Though part of this data had already been collected, this new project presented the opportunity to enlarge the database and view it from another perspective. The native researchers accepted that externally initiated proposal. Subsequently, a collaborative team was formed with indigenous and external researchers. The first step of the negotiation of the project involved a reevaluation of the experimental materials to adapt them to more culturally appropriate versions. Practical training on the technical aspects of the project ensued, including four parts: 1) experimental training in administering the tasks, 2) technical practice in video recording 3) the manipulation and uploading of digital media to ELAN, an annotation software tool, and 4) the actual collection and transcription of the data. During the first part of the training, the indigenous researchers performed the successive roles of participant, experimenter, and documenter. In this process, the indigenous researchers were able to evaluate the cultural appropriateness of the task design, and acquired new technological skills Ð building upon what they had acquired in a previous, internally-initiated research project. Through a continued rotation of roles, all native researchers trained collaboratively with each other and with the external researchers to conduct the experimental tasks, record results, and begin to interpret those results. This training culminated with the indigenous researchers all acting as main researchers in applying the corresponding experimental tasks with speakers of their own communities. As a result of applying a <b>PAR</b> <b>approach</b> to this project, we can observe that when native researchers take increasingly more responsibility for a project, even one that emerges external to the research group, they obtain greater directive power over the research process and the results obtained. The indigenous researcher is, thus, in a position to evaluate and adapt the research project, ultimately becoming the experts on the research design, implementation, and interpretation of the data, and consequently reappropriating the process for their own community use and benefit...|$|E

Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study in 10 NHs in the Netherlands. A participatory action research (<b>PAR)</b> <b>approach</b> was applied, with local stakeholders in charge of selecting tailored interventions based on opportunities for improved antibiotic prescribing that they derived from provided baseline data. An algorithm was used to {{evaluate the}} appropriateness of prescribing decisions, based on infections recorded by physicians. Effects of the interventions on the appropriateness of prescribing decisions were analysed with a multilevel logistic regression model. Pharmacy data were used to calculate differences in antibiotic use and recorded infections were used to calculate differences in guideline-adherent antibiotic selection. Results: The appropriateness of 1059 prescribing decisions was assessed. Adjusting for pre-test differences in the proportion of appropriate prescribing decisions (intervention, 82 %; control, 70 %), post-test appropriateness did not differ between groups (crude: P = 0. 26; adjusted for covariates: P = 0. 35). We observed more appropriate prescribing decisions at the start of data collection and before receiving feedback on prescribing behaviour.

40|$|Especially in {{the last}} decade or so, there have been {{dramatic}} advances in fluorescence-based imaging methods designed to measure a multitude of functions in living cells. Despite this, many of the methods used to analyze the resulting images are limited. Perhaps the most common mode of analysis is the choice of regions of interest (ROIs), followed by quantification of the signal contained therein in comparison with another "control" ROI. While this method has several advantages, such as flexibility and capitalization on the power of human visual recognition capabilities, it has the drawbacks of potential subjectivity and lack of precisely defined criteria for ROI selection. This can lead to analyses which are less precise or accurate than the data might allow for, and generally a regrettable loss of information. Herein, we explore the possibility of abandoning the use of conventional ROIs, and instead propose treating individual pixels as ROIs, such that all information can be extracted systematically with the various statistical cutoffs we discuss. As a test case for this approach, we monitored intracellular pH in cells transfected with the chloride/bicarbonate transporter slc 26 a 3 using the ratiometric dye SNARF- 5 F under various conditions. We performed a parallel analysis using two different levels of stringency in conventional ROI analysis as well as the pixels-as-ROIs (<b>PAR)</b> <b>approach,</b> and found that pH differences between control and transfected cells were accentuated by ~ 50 - 100 % by using the <b>PAR</b> <b>approach.</b> We therefore consider this approach worthy of adoption, especially in cases in which higher accuracy and precision are required...|$|E
40|$|Eight eyes {{exhibited}} massive {{proliferation of}} lens epithelial remnants following Nd-YAG posterior capsulotomy. All eyes had pre-existing retinal pathology. Six had undergone vitrectomy (four for proliferative diabetic retinopathy) before extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. The other two eyes had familial exudative vitreoretinopathy or retinopathy of prematurity, respectively. Five eyes required {{removal of the}} lens proliferations via a <b>pars</b> plana <b>approach.</b> High levels of growth factors in the posterior segment associated with proliferative disorders of the retina {{may play a role}} in lens cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Short Abstract — Structure {{inference}} {{of cellular}} networks from microarray experiments provides important insight about {{the network of}} interactions in cells under different conditions. Unfortunately, many structure inference algorithms do not scale to whole-genome data that have several thousands of variables. We propose a two-step approach for learning the structure of large networks. We first pre-cluster the network nodes and learn networks per cluster. We then revisit the cluster assignment of selected variables with poor neighborhoods. Preliminary results suggest that our <b>approach</b> performs at <b>par</b> to <b>approaches</b> that learn the complete network without pre-clustering...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{instructional}} and organizational strategies used by participatory action research (PAR) facilitators at the Summer Youth Research Institute of the Institute for Community Research in Hartford, Connecticut (US), a six-week program that engages urban multi-ethnic teenagers in youth participatory action research (YPAR) for social change. During {{the last three}} decades, PAR {{has proven to be}} a very effective methodology for creating sustainable solutions to social problems by involving community members in the process of identifying, investigating, and collectively resolving them. In particular, YPAR provides young people with the opportunity to study social problems that affect themselves and their communities. Through experiential learning, YPAR allows youth to understand that structural injustices are produced, not natural, and can be challenged. Youth discover spaces for hope and resistance and become agents of change for their own communities. While recent years have witnessed an increased effort from researchers and practitioners alike to apply <b>PAR</b> <b>approaches</b> to various fields within community and international development, little has been written addressing educators about the designing and implementation process of a curriculum in PAR methodology. The present exploratory ethnographic study aims to address the theory-practice gap of PAR literature, which offers only a limited number of case study analyses of the facilitation and implementation process of PAR projects, and offer advice for PAR facilitators which is currently lacking...|$|R
