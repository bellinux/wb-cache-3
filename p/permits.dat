5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{auctioning}} <b>permits</b> provides {{the government with}} revenues.

Auctioning <b>permits</b> can therefore be more efficient and equitable than allocating <b>permits</b> (Hepburn, 2006, pp.236–237). Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E

From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point.

5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} <b>permits.</b> Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with <b>permits</b> surrendered including any <b>permits</b> traded within the cap.

5|$|One way of {{addressing}} carbon leakage {{is to give}} sectors vulnerable to international competition free emission <b>permits</b> (Carbon Trust, 2009).

Border adjustments work by setting a tariff on imported goods from less regulated countries. A problem with border adjustments is {{that they might be}} used as a disguise for trade protectionism.
