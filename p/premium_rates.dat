25|$|High {{variable}} costs mean that Pandora {{does not have}} significant operating leverage, {{and in the next}} couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours. Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours. Mobile revenues will improve over time as Pandora shifts from relying on third-party ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at <b>premium</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|E
25|$|The AMA {{has also}} {{supported}} changes in medical malpractice law to limit damage awards, which, it contends, {{makes it difficult}} for patients to find appropriate medical care. In many states, high risk specialists have moved to other states that have enacted reform. For example, in 2004, all neurosurgeons had relocated out of the entire southern half of Illinois. The main legislative emphasis in multiple states has been to effect caps on the amount that patients can receive for pain and suffering. These costs for pain and suffering are only those that exceed the actual costs of healthcare and lost income. At the same time however, states without caps also experienced similar results; suggesting that other market factors {{may have contributed to the}} decreases. Some economic studies have found that caps have historically had an uncertain effect on <b>premium</b> <b>rates.</b> Nevertheless, the AMA believes the caps may alleviate what is often perceived as an excessively litigious environment for many doctors. A recent report by the AMA found that in a 12-month period, five percent of physicians had claims filed against them.|$|E

After Dodson's death in 1757, Edward Rowe Mores took over the leadership of the group that eventually became the Society for Equitable Assurances.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the telecommunication industry in Denmark is quite liberal. There are no requirements to register with national authorities when providing telecommunication services or <b>Premium</b> <b>Rate</b> Services. Only Network Operators, {{who want to make}} use of the scarce frequency resources, must register with the National IT and Telecom Agency. This liberal approach may be a contributory factor to the fact that there are no official statistics on <b>Premium</b> <b>Rate</b> Services available from public authorities.

The areas covered, reflects the regulation that is relevant to those <b>Premium</b> <b>Rate</b> Services provided in Denmark. The emphasis of the article is laid on the regulation safeguarding consumers in the context of <b>Premium</b> <b>Rate</b> Services.
