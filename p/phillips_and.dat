5|$|The 1897–8 {{season at}} Newport saw the {{beginning}} of a 'historic' partnership at half-back between <b>Phillips</b> <b>and</b> Llewellyn Lloyd that lasted till 1901. <b>Phillips</b> <b>and</b> Lloyd were thought of as a pair, both playing along similar lines and sharing the work of scrum-half and outside-half. While Lloyd was a smarter runner, Phillips was a better kick, but both of them could drop goals, and were remarkable in their kicks to touch.|$|E

This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E

Together with Macarthur, <b>Phillips</b> <b>and</b> Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women's Employment, which organised relief work for the female unemployed.

5|$|Sleaford was {{primarily}} an agricultural town until the 20th century, supporting a cattle market, with seed companies, such as Hubbard and <b>Phillips,</b> <b>and</b> Sharpes International Seeds, being {{established in the}} late 19th century.
