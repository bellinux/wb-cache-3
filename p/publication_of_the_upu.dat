50|$|<b>The</b> century <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{postage stamp}} was celebrated in 1940 {{with a set}} of six stamps {{depicting}} Victoria and George VI side-by-side.

50|$|Any and all {{conflicts}} that might arise affecting <b>the</b> franking <b>of</b> mails serviced by multiple administrations which result from differences in these various postal regulations and/or practices are mediated by <b>the</b> <b>UPU,</b> a specialized agency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations which sets {{the rules and}} technical standards for international mail exchanges. <b>The</b> <b>UPU</b> co-ordinates <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regulations <b>of</b> postal systems of its member nations, including {{as they relate to}} franking, to permit the servicing and exchange of international mails. Prior to <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>UPU</b> in 1874, international mails sometimes bore mixed franking (<b>the</b> application <b>of</b> franking of more than one country) before the world's postal services universally agreed to deliver international mails bearing only <b>the</b> franking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country <b>of</b> origin.|$|R

Toward <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>UPU</b> issued rules concerning stamp design, intended to ensure maximum efficiency in handling international mail. One rule specified that stamp values be given in numerals (denominations spelled out in letters not being universally comprehensible); another, that member nations all use the same colors on their stamps issued for post cards (green), normal letters (red) and international mail (blue), a system that remained in use for several decades.|$|R

50|$|An Extraterritorial Office of Exchange (ETOE) is {{a commercially}} {{oriented}} office or facility operated by or {{in connection with}} a postal operator in a country other than its parent country. At its 2004 Congress in Bucharest, the Universal Postal Union decided that traffic originating from ETOEs is strictly commercial which is not covered by <b>the</b> provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>UPU</b> Convention, unless <b>the</b> laws or policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destination country allow ETOE traffic to be considered as international mail.

5000|$|Prior to <b>the</b> {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>UPU,</b> {{each country}} had {{to prepare a}} separate postal treaty with other nations if it wished to carry international mail to or from them. In some cases, senders would have to calculate postage for each leg of a journey, and find mail forwarders in a third country {{if there was no}} direct delivery. To remove this complexity, the United States called for an International Postal Congress in 1863. This led Heinrich von Stephan, Royal Prussian and later German Minister for Posts, to found the Universal Postal Union. It is currently the third oldest international organization after the Rhine Commission and <b>the</b> ITU. <b>The</b> <b>UPU</b> was created in 1874, initially under the name [...] "General Postal Union", under <b>the</b> Treaty <b>of</b> Bern signed on October 9, 1874.

The United States has negotiated a separate terminal dues formula with thirteen European countries {{that includes a}} rate per piece plus a rate per kilogram; it has a similar arrangement with Canada. <b>The</b> <b>UPU</b> also operates <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> International Reply Coupons and addresses concerns with ETOEs.|$|R
5000|$|The dual {{denomination}} scheme {{broke down}} when <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French franc declined, {{and for the}} next stamp issue, in 1938, the two administrations had simplified matters by using <b>the</b> same currency <b>of</b> [...] "gold francs". <b>The</b> twelve values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1938 issues all depicted the same [...] "beach scene", including huts, palm trees, a canoe, and a volcano in the distance.
