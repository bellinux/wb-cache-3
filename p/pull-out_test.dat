40|$|Bamboo {{reinforced}} concrete as a building material {{is expected to}} be an alternative to steel {{reinforced concrete}}. Due to the fact that steel is not renewable and polluting steel mills are fairly high. The bond strenght is a major concern for the natural fiber used as reinforcement in structural composites. This paper reports study on the bond strenght of bamboo reinforcement in concrete. To determine the adhesion reinforcement in concrete often do by the <b>pull-out</b> <b>test.</b> The research objective was to compare the bond strenght between <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> and beam bending tests. The test used light weight concrete with foam additives klerak. Bamboo slats, coated paint and sprinkled with sand. The result <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> is equal to 0. 41 MPa.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to assess the {{ultimate}} bond stress of normal and high strength concrete. This study contains two phases. The first phase included the studied bond behavior using two different models. In the first model, single <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> (SPOT), the concrete section of specimen was subjected to compressive stresses. In the second model, double <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> (DPOT), the concrete section of specimen was subjected to tensile stresses. So this phase of study aimed to make a comparison between the single <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> and the double <b>pull-out</b> <b>test.</b> To compare the behavior of these models, different levels of compressive strength were considered {{through the use of}} different coarse aggregate types, different W/C ratios and different cement contents. The second phase focused on the study of bond strength of high strength concrete using double <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> to assess design ultimate bond stress. In this phase, the effect of concrete compressive strength, bar diameter, concrete cover, embedded length, and pre-flexural crack length was studied. Based on the test results, a proposed concept to assess design ultimate stress of normal and high strength concrete was adopted. Equations to calculate the design ultimate bond stress, and required development length were suggested...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA new {{analytical}} approach {{able to predict}} the mechanical behaviour of fully grouted rockbolts subjected to <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests</b> is proposed in this paper.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between various steel strip geometries and the bonding energy through <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests</b> of aerated concrete specimens is investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Soil-reinforcement {{pull-out}} {{tests are}} essential for evaluating the strength, in-tegrity, and effectiveness of the soil-reinforcement system. In this paper, a new <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> model that calculates the soil-geosynthetic reinforcement interface shear stress for highly extensible geosynthetic reinforcement is proposed. Based on a new bilinear interface shear model, the geosynthetic <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> results are calculated {{with regard to the}} variation of the mobilised geosynthetic tension with distance, geosynthetic pre-yield and post-yield beha-viour, and the effective and extended length of the geosynthetic reinforcement The resulting nonlinear equation for the soil-geosynthetic interface shear stress pull-out mechanism is nondimensionalised, expressed in a finite difference form, and solved numerically using the Gauss-Siedel technique. A parametric study is carried out for a range of relative stiffness va-lues and interface shear stresses. The normalised load-displacement relationship and the variation of the pull-out force and reinforcement displacements, with distance along the rein-forcement, are presented. The values calculated using the proposed model are compared with experimental <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> results for a needle-punched, nonwoven geotextile, polyeste...|$|E
40|$|As a tight {{bond between}} the repair and the old {{concrete}} is required, the soundness of the prepared surface has to be carefully assessed. This paper {{presents the results of}} an investigation intended to assess and compare quantitatively different test methods, namely the Schmidt rebound hammer, the <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> and the pull-off test, to evaluate superficial mechanical integrity of a substrate after concrete removal operations. Although it does not yield a precise evaluation of compressive strength, the Schmidt rebound hammer test is recognized as a useful tool for performing quick surveys to assess concrete uniformity. The pull-off test is very well correlated with the splitting-tensile test, but it is not suited for vertical and overhead surfaces. The Capo <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> has limited interest for surface preparation, as it is applicable to flat surfaces only.

40|$|A {{wire netting}} fence {{supported}} with zinked steel pipe trusses was blown {{down by a}} typhoon (1985, 13). The cause of the failure {{was thought to be}} that bond between the mortar used for the bases of the fence and the steel pipes was not sufficient to resist the pull-out forces of the wind. In order to examine the bond strength between mortar and steel pipes, pull-out and push-down tests were conducted. The embedded lengths of the pipe in the mortar are 800 mm for the <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> and from 50 to 150 mm for the push-down test. The strength of mortar varied in each test. The <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> results was compared with those of the push-down test and {{it was found that the}} bond strength for the deeply embedded pipes in the <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> is about fifty percent of that for the pipes embedded from 50 to 150 mm in the push-down test.

40|$|Sabkha soil is {{abundant}} along the Arabian Gulf and Red Sea coasts {{and is a}} problematic soil due to its acute water sensitivity and chemical aggressiveness. In many situations, it is required to improve the load carrying capacity of sabkha, {{and the use of}} geotextiles was found appropriate. The objectives of this research were to study frictional characteristics of sand-geotextile-sand and sabkha-geotextile-sand interfaces and to compare the pull-out resistance of locally available nonwoven geotextiles taking into account different test parameters. An experimental setup was developed to conduct the <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests.</b> These test results have indicated the existence of three stages of deformation in the geotextile under <b>pull-out</b> <b>testing,</b> which ultimately lead to the slippage of the entire geotextile strip. The use of the pull-out plate reduces the effects of the lateral earth pressure developed on the front wall of the pull-out box and ensures that the free geotextile is kept within the box and, thus, under the required confinement throughout the <b>test.</b> The <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests</b> results indicated that high tensile strength geotextiles require a large pull-out force {{in the case of the}} sand-geotextile-sand interface, whereas the least extensible geotextile requires the maximum pull-ou...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{shedding}} is {{a critical}} problem in biomedical textile debridement materials, which leads to infection and impairs wound healing. In this work, single fiber <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> was proposed as an in vitro evaluation for the fiber shedding property of a textile pile debridement material. Samples with different structural design (pile densities, numbers of ground yarns and coating times) were prepared and estimated under this testing method. Results show that single fiber <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> offers an appropriate in vitro evaluation for the fiber shedding property of textile pile debridement materials. Pull-out force for samples without back-coating exhibited a slight escalating trend with the supplement in pile density and number of ground yarn plies, while back-coating process significantly raised the single fiber pull-out force. For fiber shedding mechanism analysis, typical pull-out behavior and failure modes of the single fiber <b>pull-out</b> <b>test</b> were analyzed in detail. Three failure modes were found in this study, i. e., fiber slippage, coating point rupture and fiber breakage.

40|$|In {{the past}} twenty years in Croatia a number of {{reinforced}} earth constructions have been built, of which two reinforced earth walls stand out due to their dimensions: Strikići and Sveta Trojica. In the building of these walls polyester strips were used as reinforcement elements, whereas as fill material crushed stone aggregate was used. For designing these constructions knowledge about the interaction mechanisms between the polyester strip and the soil is required. So far, most of the published studies have been directed to the determination of the friction interaction coefficient of the polyester strip and the fill material which was sand or gravel, whereas tests on the interaction between the geosynthetic strip and the crushed stone aggregate have not been performed. In order to determine the friction interaction coefficient between the crushed stone aggregate which is commonly used as fill material and the geosynthetic strip <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests</b> of the polyester strip were carried out.

EBM is a methodology able to process metallic powders layer-by-layer. Pedicle screw-produced by the EBM process by the MT Ortho (VS), and commercial screws (VC and VT) were examined. VS screws showed lower resistance to <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests</b> than VC and VT screws. This behavior can be attributed to a lower sharpness and a lower depth of thread. These features, which may be negative from the point of view of the resistance to <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests,</b> could have positive effects from the point of view of stress concentration on bone. To analyze these effects, fatigue <b>pull-out</b> <b>tests</b> were also carried out and the different screw-bone interface behavior was evaluated using photoelasticity and finite element analysis. The results obtained by numerical simulation confirm what was previously stated, a thread with a geometry less sharpened ensures a better distribution of the loads and reduces the notch effect, allowing a balance of the disadvantage due to the lower primary stabilization. The fatigue limit and fatigue curve were obtained by the thermographic (Risitano) method.
