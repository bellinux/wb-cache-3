25|$|Some {{years later}} the <b>porcelain</b> <b>industry</b> started to develop, favoured by the {{presence}} of kaolinite which was discovered near Limoges in 1768 (near St Yrieix, south-west of Limoges). Many of the inhabitants became employed in the new sector or in connected activities (including the lumbering of wood needed for firing the porcelain) in manufacture and exporting needed for European distribution of Limoges Boxes, dinnerware, and other porcelain wares. Because the Limousin region has had a long history of breeding (Baronet sheep and Limousine cows), the leather industry also settled in and around Limoges {{along the banks of the}} Vienne–the river providing the necessary water and power. Factories in Limoges and St Junien still produce luxury leather shoes, gloves, and bags.|$|E

500|$|Chelsea (Old English Cealchyð, chalk wharf), about [...] west of Westminster on {{the north}} bank of the River Thames, has existed as a {{settlement}} since at least Anglo-Saxon times.

Chelsea enjoyed good road and river connections to the seat of government at Westminster and the commercial centre of the City of London since at least the 14th century. It was a centre of the British <b>porcelain</b> <b>industry,</b> and a major producer of baked goods– at peak periods almost 250,000 chelsea buns per day were sold.

25|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century, Golden {{maintained}} {{a small town}} population of around 2,500 people. Several industries faded or were destroyed by tragic events, , but others flourished to continue Golden's industrial legacy, including its brewing, brick making, clay mining and <b>porcelain</b> <b>industries.</b> Golden became even more connected through mass transit, with two trolley lines extending to Denver, while the movie theater gradually took {{the place of the}} opera house for downtown entertainment. Downtown revitalization efforts began in the 1920s with its first streetscape and ornamental lighting project and urban renewal on its north and east, anchored by new senior high and grade schools. The historic cultural tension between the city's north and south sides gradually eased, and the town successfully endured additional major economic depressions, including the Silver Crash of 1893 and the Great Depression. The School of Mines gained a worldwide academic reputation, Coors rapidly came to the forefront of the national and international brewing and ceramics industries, and the city modernized with a recreation center, paved streets and more.|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} interaction between global political-economic transformations and changing concepts of Chinese art in the nineteenth century. Its {{focus is on the}} porcelain from the renowned "porcelain city," Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province of southeast China. Jingdezhen has been the center of world porcelain production since the thirteenth century. Although Jingdezhen's <b>porcelain</b> <b>industries</b> experienced tremendous changes and upheaval during the nineteenth century- including expanding overseas trade, decimation by the Taiping rebels in 1853, reinstatement of imperial patronage by the Qing Court during the Tongzhi Restoration - scholars of science, art, and Jingdezhen history alike rarely investigate this period. Contrary to scholarly consensus, the nineteenth century witnessed a surge in the production of texts and visual images detailing the aesthetics, technology, and manufacturing of Jingdezhen porcelain. This study focuses on the systemic production of knowledge about a material object - Jingdezhen chinaware - by tracing the global trajectories of key documents and visual images on porcelain that circulated within and across boundaries of such places as China, France, and Japan. I will highlight the circulation of such texts and visual images at crucial historical junctures of the nineteenth century, concentrating on periods of industrialization, inter-state conflict, and changing trade patterns. Thus this project will attempt to articulate the global and political processes that negotiate and re-position an object's materiality [...] specifically the materiality of Jingdezhen porcelain [...] in relation to its visual and textual aspects. By historicizing the discourse and practices of a specific object of trade and art, especially one that was and remains closely associated with a particular place and culture, I examine how concepts of self and other find material embodiment through representative objects of culture and exchang...|$|R

40|$|Moulding {{pressure}} and thickness are pre-fixed {{variables in the}} <b>porcelain</b> stoneware tile <b>industry.</b> This paper examines the effect of both parameters on technological and microstructure properties of unfired and fired porcelain stoneware bodies. The moulding pressure in unfired tiles has a noticeable effect on bending strength and load borne. Common technological properties such as water absorption, porosity, bulk density and bending strength {{were obtained from the}} fired tiles. The results indicate that the variation in properties is independent of the thicknesses of the tiles. Moulding pressure affects at lower values, whereas higher moulding pressure produces tiles with similar technological properties. The microstructure exhibits a constant amount of mullite and quartz in all pieces after the firing process. Observations from scanning electron microscopy show that mullite crystals enlarge as moulding pressure increases, but the shape of the crystals are unaffected by the individual thicknesses. Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the mullite needles increases with the moulding pressure, which is invariable to the thicknesses of the tiles. Although the total porosity remains constant, the number of pores is influenced by the thickness. The moulding pressure also influences pore size. The results show a strong relationship between the number of closed pores and the thickness of the ceramic tile. JAEDoc_ 08 _ 00362 Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{perceptions}} of workmanship in the English <b>porcelain</b> and earthenware <b>industries</b> between 1760 and 1800. Research by Berg and Clifford has demonstrated a {{new interest in}} and valuation of workmanship by contemporaries in the eighteenth century. Yet little is known of what contemporaries understood workmanship to mean, or be. This thesis argues that understandings of workmanship affected both the consumption and production practices of eighteenth-century contemporaries. It does so by concentrating on six groups of people – industrial tourists, consumers, retailers, designers, manufacturers and workers. It demonstrates the {{different ways in which}} contemporaries perceived hand skills and tacit knowledge by examining a range of sources such as letters, prints, trade cards, travel accounts and objects. This thesis concludes that meanings of ‘workmanship’ - that combination of effort, work and skill - were shifting {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century. For those not employed in manufacturing, reading manuals, seeing production in action and handling objects all challenged their ideas of workmanship. These experiences encouraged contemporaries to question the meaning of innovative products and the manufacturing techniques used to make them. Similarly, in manufacturing the development of the design process and the demands of novelty and standardisation forced manufacturers, designers and modellers to ask how to achieve ‘excellent workmanship’. At the same time, workers understood and valued their work in different terms – as a hard-won, social and physical skill. This thesis argues that for eighteenth-century contemporaries ‘workmanship’ was a complex idea, under challenge from developments in production and consumption. In so doing it moves the interlinked history of manufacturing and consumption away from the extant debates of economic historians and into a different sub-disciplinary space, namely cultural history; a space that has tended to neglect the cultural aspects of production.
