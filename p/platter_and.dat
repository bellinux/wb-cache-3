5|$|According to the manufacturer, the Xerxes.20plus {{incorporates}} key design {{elements from}} the TMS3, including the tungsten carbide bearing ball, {{inner and outer}} aluminium platter, mat and decoupler blobs. The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus. The bearing is of a higher quality; the <b>platter</b> <b>and</b> sub-platter have been redesigned. A mat with distinctive cut-outs {{is placed on the}} platter assembly to support the disc. While the top board sits on decoupling blobs, the lower half has bright polished-metal feet. The bearing ball, Blobs and mat are available to existing owners for retrofitting their legacy Xerxes.10 and Xerxes.20 turntables.|$|E

500|$|Marianos Argyros ( [...] , [...] ) was a Byzantine aristocrat {{and member}} of the Argyros family. A monk, in 944 he {{supported}} the assumption of sole rule by Constantine VII, and was allowed to leave the monastery and enter imperial service. He held a succession of senior military commands, fighting in southern Italy against local rebels and the Fatimids, and in the Balkans against the Magyars. In 963, he tried to oppose the takeover of the imperial throne by the general Nikephoros Phokas by assuming control over Constantinople and arresting his father, Bardas Phokas the Elder. During the ensuing clashes, he was hit on the head by a <b>platter,</b> <b>and</b> died on the next day, 16 August 963.|$|E
500|$|In {{the time}} of the Twelve Tables, a [...] "{{manifest}}" [...] thief and a [...] "non-manifest" [...] thief were treated differently. Manifest theft denoted some sort of being caught in the act. Being found later with the stolen thing was not manifest theft, unless it was found during a seemingly bizarre ritual (furtum lance licioque conceptum), whereby the searcher would come with a silver <b>platter</b> <b>and</b> wearing few clothes. Gaius is highly critical of the by-then obsolete ritual, imagining the platter was for removal of the goods. In practice, it may have been for an offering to the household gods. Being almost naked would have prevented the searcher bringing with him a thing he would then pretend to find. Gaius reports that manifest theft brought a penalty of a severe flogging and enslavement for freemen. Slaves found liable for manifest furtum would be thrown off to their deaths off the Tarpeian Rock. The manifest thief was at {{the time of}} the Twelve tables was not given a full trial, his case merely adjudicated by a magistrate. The extreme penalty must have acted as a deterrent. The victim could kill the thief on the spot in two situations: at night, and where the thief was using a weapon and had been verbally warned. The verbal warning was designed to make the act of killing more public, and prevent it being an underhand way of committing murder. This rule was accepted by Gaius but is questioned by Ulpian. The penalty for non-manifest theft was always double damages.|$|E
500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the <b>platter</b> <b>and</b> lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E

2500|$|Flemish waffles, or Gaufres à la Flamande, are a {{specialty}} of northern France and portions of western Belgium. The original recipe, published in 1740 by Louis-Auguste de Bourbon in Le Cuisinier Gascon, is as follows: Take [...] "deux litrons" [...] (1.7 liters or 7 cups) of flour and mix it {{in a bowl}} with salt and one ounce of brewer's yeast barm. Moisten it completely with warm milk. Then whisk fifteen egg whites and add that to the mixture, stirring continuously. Incorporate [...] "un livre" [...] (490 grams or 1.1 pounds) of fresh butter, and let the batter rise. Once the batter has risen, take your heated iron, made expressly for these waffles, and wrap some butter in a cloth and rub {{both sides of the}} iron with it. When the iron is completely heated, make your waffles, but do so gently for fear of burning them. Cooked, take them out, put them on a <b>platter,</b> <b>and</b> serve them with both sugar and orange blossom water on top.|$|E
2500|$|Buffalo Bill and his Wild West {{was back}} in Du Bois in September 1901. At this time McCreight lived in his townhouse, and had not yet moved to The Wigwam. [...] “At {{the opening of the}} 20th Century a crowd of twelve Oglala Lakota came to spend the evening with the writer. [...] Besides Chief Lone Bear, Chief Flying Hawk was in the party. [...] The yard outside was covered with neighbors, big and little, who had seen them come, arrayed in their war bonnets, beaded regalia and gay plumes of eagle quills, as they climbed to and spread over the wide veranda and swung open their richly covered blankets. [...] It was a {{surprise}} visit from old-time western friends. [...] Don [...] was quickly dispatched for cigars, fruit and candy, with a large market basket and instructions to deliver same to the back door,to apportion the supplies, and pass them around when the Indians got seated inside. [...] Don was thirteen, and full of business. [...] At the proper time, he appeared from the kitchen with both arms full, a cigar for each man on the <b>platter,</b> <b>and</b> another with candy, bananas, oranges and grapes. [...] Don set the fruit basket on a table in the outer room, and proceeded to pass the cigars, beginning with the big chief. [...] As he modestly handed the platter to the chief to take one cigar, the whole dozen or more were scooped from the plate and quickly stored within his blanket. [...] The boy was “game,” and went back his kitchen stores and brought another supply, and went on passing them to the others-one at a time.” “Chief Lone Bear noticed a pair of boxing gloves on the floor and signed to the writer to explain. They belonged to the [...] twins, aged five. More signals indicated he wanted to see them box. The two boys stood with open eyes gazing at the strange people, and it took a little coaxing to get the boys to put on the gloves. [...] But they, too, were game, and came to dad to have them tied on. All smiles, the visitors spread their chairs, through the arch into the big parlor, so as to form a large area, for the bout. [...] Dad called “time” and the boys went to it rough and tumble. They immediately forgot their modesty and the audience. [...] No fight in the prize rings of New York or Boston ever witnessed better sparring. It was a battle to the finish; bloody noses and howls of laughter from the Indians all the while it lasted. [...] When they were exhausted and their dad stopped the fight, the old chief ordered that they both be adopted into the tribe as worthy of membership in [...] "The Nation of the Fighting Sioux." ...|$|E
