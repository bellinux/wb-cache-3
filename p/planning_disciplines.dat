The document further underlined that NATO's forces should be able to conduct a variety of missions, from high to low intensity, and emphasized the likelihood that NATO will need to carry out a greater number and range of smaller operations. The CPG also confirmed the principle that 40% of the member states' military forces must be redeployable, and 8% must constantly be on operations abroad. This principle makes it, among other things, possible to effectively compare the contributions made by various states, irrespective of the size of their populations.|$|E

It has illuminated subtle and fine traits; it has displayed nobilities, and it has brought out aspects of human absurdity to which only the pencil of Mr. George Morrow could do adequate justice.

The FEAF provides an enduring standard for developing and documenting architecture descriptions of high-priority areas. It provides guidance in describing architectures for multi-organizational functional segments of the Federal Government.

Interim releases since that time have provided successive increases in definition for the core reference models (see below), as well as a very robust methodology for actually developing an architecture in a series of templates forming the Federal Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM) and its next generation replacement, the Collaborative Planning Methodology (CPM), which was designed to be more flexible, more widely applicable, and more inclusive of the larger set of <b>planning</b> <b>disciplines.</b>|$|E

At present the landscape <b>planning</b> <b>discipline</b> is facing a rethinking of its models due to the inadequacy of its founding standpoints and of some ideologically manufactured claims based in turn on a specious conception of identity. This is proven by the fact that several regional plans are having a very hard time applying basic rules and regulations to the practicality of the planning at a local level. In order to better explain the above mentioned points, we are going to present the case of the Sardinian Regional Landscape Plan (SRLP) in which several critical issues arise and converge as they stem from the uncertainty of the rules and are consequently accompanied by seriously negative outcomes...|$|R

The findings are based on the views represented in literature and on the opinions of Turkish urban planners. The objective of the field survey is to search for opinions of Turkish urban planners about the effects of the ICTs and its implications on the spatial developments of urban and rural areas and also urban planning. In the fieldwork, the opinions of Turkish planners were surveyed in a questionnaire for this article. The questionnaire contained different statements about the effects of ICTs on spatial development and the development of planning practices. The likert scale was used to measure respondents’ attitudes by asking to which they agree or disagree with statements. The findings of this article have illustrated that ICTs have effects on urban and spatial structure. Starting from this point, ICTs should be argued out as an important input into the urban and regional <b>planning</b> <b>discipline...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Ruhrallee is a {{historical}} arterial road connecting the wealthy {{south of the city}} of Essen with the  region south of the city. The old sycamore alley gives the low-density residential neighborhood its  spatial qualities and its own identity. But the spatial and social potentials are not legible and livable  due to the heavy traffic on the existing road cutting the neighborhood. The street cannot assume its spatial function.  Therefore the City of Essen and the Federal Government want to build a tunnel road under the  existing street, in order to improve the situation for the neighborhood.  The Institute for Urban Design and Planning in cooperation with the Institute for Traffic Planning at the University of Duisburg-Essen carried through an evaluation of various scenarios in terms of traffic flow  and visual intrusion of the planned tunnel road as well as the refurbished old street space. The main  focus of the study is the integration of the tunnel entrance and the proposed road alignment into the  existing urban fabric.

40|$|The Alps in the plans: {{the images}} of {{mountains}} in the spatial planning policies of Northern Italian regions. In {{the last ten years}} have seen the evolving of the idea of the Alps into a lot more varied and richer image than before. The new image of the Alps consists in an idea of fresh resources, a place of unexpressed but promising potentialities, in opposition to the old idea of marginality, of undeveloped and abandoned territory. At the same time the Alps come across more as a unity of territories, a space for a shared identication of dwellers, albeit their very different and complex identities. This new image comes from a certain interest, generally shared internationally, on the subject (i. e. the International Year of the Mountain 2002). It also comes from the higher presence of Mountains in the international debate, scientifically and inter-disciplinary speaking. Last but not least our mountains get more attention thanks to the work of some NGO (i. e. CIPRA), or nets of local actors (i. e. Alpenallianz), or European programs (i. e. ETC programme Alpine Space). The spatial <b>planning</b> <b>disciplines</b> have somewhat contributed to this new image of the Alps as well, by sharing a renovated interest for its world.
