5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. <b>Private</b> <b>contractors</b> who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. These tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, {{and the right to}} tax local areas.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after World WarII, No.1 AD {{introduced}} the first jets into RAAF service. In 1961, it ceased airframe maintenance, {{but continued to}} service aero engines. By the 1970s, the depot's main focus was ground-based equipment, though it still handled some aircraft components. No.1 AD was disbanded in December 1994, its functions having {{been taken over by}} other units and <b>private</b> <b>contractors.</b> At the time of its disbandment, it was the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation.|$|E

5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to <b>private</b> <b>contractors,</b> who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs. These contractors often provided benefits such as cheap laundry services and free meals to legislators to secure contracts {{and encourage them to}} ignore their abuse of prisoners. Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
5|$|MetroAccess is a {{paratransit}} service which WMATA provides through <b>private</b> <b>contractors.</b> It began {{operation in}} May 1994 {{and since that}} time annual ridership has grown from 200,000 to more than 2.4 million passengers. MetroAccess operates 365 days a year, providing door-to-door, shared rides reserved from one to seven days in advance. It is now the sixth largest paratransit service in the United States with a fleet of more than 600 vehicles and more than 1,000 employees. WMATA staff determines eligibility to use the service in response to written applications. The cost per passenger for MetroAccess is significantly higher than its fixed-route counterparts, and Metro has worked to provide as many opportunities to encourage and facilitate the use of fixed-route transit by its customers with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|On 6November 1981, the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, {{presented}} the Queen's Colour to No.1 AD. By September {{the following year}} the depot's strength was down to 235 staff, but it pioneered the support of various new technologies for the Air Force, in fields such as electroplating, fibre optics, and electronics. It was also responsible for developing and testing components for the F-111, Macchi MB-326 and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet jets. From 1986, restructuring and outsourcing began to impact heavily upon the RAAF's technical services. In February 1990, No.1 AD came {{under the control of}} Logistics Command, formed when Support Command was split into logistical and training components. By then the depot's functions had largely been taken over by other units and <b>private</b> <b>contractors,</b> and it was disbanded on 2December 1994. No.1 AD was, at the time, the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation and, according to the RAAF Historical Section, the oldest continuously operating maintenance depot of any air force.|$|E

5|$|When {{she brings}} the scandal to the {{attention}} of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative defense and security contracts. However, she finds allies in her investigation: Madeleine Rees, head of the Human Rights Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward. When Raya is found dead, Kathryn sends an email to fifty senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. She and Ward acquire evidence of an official admitting the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she brings it to the BBC News. The final credits note that after Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with <b>private</b> <b>contractors</b> such as Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).|$|E
5|$|Similar issues {{occurred}} in New Brunswick where 18,000customers remained without power through July11. More than 310crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity {{expected to be}} fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C$12million (US$11.1million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and <b>private</b> <b>contractors</b> after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower. An estimated 6,000people took advantage of this through July10. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents {{to get rid of}} spoiled food from power outages. Gaëtan Thomas, {{president and chief executive officer}} of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August2005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area. Earlier cuts to the company's tree-trimming budget were cited as a possible cause in the scale of damage. As such, their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C$6million to C$8million.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Helen passed through, cleanup efforts began as power crews had to remove downed trees before fixing power lines. The main power {{lines in the}} city were {{restored}} within 24hours and rural areas were stated to have their power back {{within a day or}} two. Two days after the storm, 500 homes remained without electricity and frustrated residents were further angered after discovering that the Power and Water agency was in control of tree removal and not emergency services. With the power company in charge of clearing downed trees, they stated that their crews would only be dealing with cases involved power lines. Residents with trees in their yards or even on their homes were told to contact <b>private</b> <b>contractors</b> to remove them. By 9January, more than 100 homes were still without power in northern Darwin, resulting in angry outcries from those still left in the dark. Cleanup efforts dragged on for more than two months as debris was still present in Darwin in March. Removal of tree stumps took through at least mid-April as the cost to remove downed trees exceeded A$1million (US$882,000). Due to the damage wrought by Helen, its name was retired following its usage. However, it was not replaced by any particular name as a new naming scheme was implemented the following season.|$|E

5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use public highways, {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage <b>private</b> <b>contractors</b> from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E
