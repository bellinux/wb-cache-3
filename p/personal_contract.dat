5|$|Turner was {{discovered}} in 1936 at the Top Hat Malt Shop in Hollywood, California. At the age of 16, she was signed to a <b>personal</b> <b>contract</b> by Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy, who took her {{with him when he}} moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Turner attracted attention in her first film, LeRoy's They Won't Forget (1937), and she later starred in featured roles, often as an ingenue. Her auburn hair was bleached blonde for a 1939 film at MGM, and she remained blonde {{for the rest of her}} life, except for a few film roles.|$|E
25|$|The {{first years}} of the 20th was time of {{increased}} labour movement activity; also the yard and engineering shop workers were dissatisfied to their working conditions. The daily working time was long and salaries low, and in change of lot of responsibility the workers had hardly any rights. The first notable strike took place in 1902, when the yard smiths were striking for one month. The action did not lead to favourable results for the workers; instead of reaching a collective agreement, each worker made a <b>personal</b> <b>contract</b> with the employer.|$|E
25|$|Vera Miles, who {{was under}} <b>personal</b> <b>contract</b> to Hitchcock and had {{appeared}} on both his television show {{and in his}} film The Wrong Man, was originally scheduled to play Madeleine. She modeled for {{an early version of}} the painting featured in the film. Following delays, including Hitchcock becoming ill with gallbladder problems, Miles became pregnant and so had to withdraw from the role. The director declined to postpone shooting and cast Kim Novak as the female lead. Ironically, by the time Novak had tied up prior film commitments and a vacation promised by Columbia Pictures, the studio that held her contract, Miles had given birth and was available for the film. Hitchcock proceeded with Novak, nevertheless. Columbia head Harry Cohn agreed to lend Novak to Vertigo if Stewart would agree to co-star with Novak in Bell, Book and Candle, a Columbia production released in December 1958.|$|E

500|$|Central to the FBO {{identity}} were Westerns and the studio's major cowboy star, Fred Thomson. In both 1926 and 1927, he ranked {{number two}} in the Exhibitors' Herald survey of the [...] "Top Stars of the Year," [...] right behind Tom Mix. With Thomson's <b>personal</b> <b>contract</b> with Kennedy due to expired in mid-1927, [...] Kennedy—sending that Thomson had reached {{the peak of his}} popularity and seeing a financial opportunity for FBO—arranged a four-picture deal with Paramount Pictures, one of the major Hollywood studio. The deal essentially ceded Thomson to the rival studio. For FBO's guarantee of $75,000 in financing per picture, Thomson would star in Paramount productions. In return, Paramount would return the $75,000 in financing plus an additional $100,000 to FBO and pay Thomson's $15,000 a week salary.|$|E
500|$|De Havilland and {{her sister}} Joan Fontaine are the only {{siblings}} to have won Academy Awards in a lead acting category. According to biographer Charles Higham, the sisters always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when Olivia had trouble accepting {{the idea of having}} a younger sister, and Joan resenting her mother's favoring Olivia. Olivia would rip up the clothes that her sister was given to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan to stitch them together again. [...] This tension was made worse by Fontaine's frequent childhood illnesses, which led to her mother's overly protective expression, [...] "Livvie can, Joan can't." [...] DeHavilland was the first to become an actress, and for several years Fontaine was overshadowed by her sister's accomplishments. When Mervyn LeRoy offered Fontaine a <b>personal</b> <b>contract,</b> her mother told her that Warner Bros. was [...] "Olivia's studio" [...] and that she could not use the family name, [...] "deHavilland".|$|E
500|$|In 2000 the Lassie {{trademark}} {{was sold}} by the eight remaining members of the Weatherwax family to Classic Media (which in 2012, Classic Media was acquired by DreamWorks Animation and renamed into DreamWorks Classics and ultimately became the property of trademarks' current owners, Universal Studios as of 2016). In 2004 Robert Weatherwax's <b>personal</b> <b>contract</b> to supply a dog {{to play the role}} of Lassie ended and neither side pursued a renewal. [...] After several years of stand-in collies that were not related to the line, Classic Media contracted with Carol Riggins, who had been co-trainer with Robert Weatherwax, and her 9th generation dog HeyHey, who had played the role of Lassie during the last 13 episodes of the Canada Lassie series under the Weatherwax Trained Dogs banner. [...] Carol Riggins continues today as the official owner and trainer of Lassie with another [...] "Pal", a 10th generation direct descendant of the original Pal.|$|E

500|$|With the {{negotiations}} between Matsuzaka and the Red Sox at a stalemate as the negotiation period neared its close, The Washington Post Dave Sheinin questioned both parties' intentions. Sheinin {{believed that the}} Red Sox had foreseen the contractual stalemate and had submitted a high bid simply to deny the New York Yankees an opportunity to negotiate with Matsuzaka. However, after Matsuzaka's agent Scott Boras threatened to take Matsuzaka back to NPB if his price was not met, Sheinin theorized that Boras intentionally wanted to hinder contract negotiations. ESPN The Magazines Tim Kurkjian described the situation as [...] "the most obvious game of chicken ever." [...] Sheinin suggested that, should {{the negotiations}} fail, Boras could take legal action {{on the grounds that}} the requirement of MLB teams to pay large transfer fees to NPB teams artificially depressed the player's <b>personal</b> <b>contract.</b> Boras did not believe that the transfer fee should affect the player's compensation.|$|E
500|$|Fineman and Brent both {{departed}} FBO {{around the}} time of the purchase. Kennedy appointed Edwin King as the studio's production chief, but the new owner took a personal hand in guiding the company creatively as well as financially. Kennedy soon brought stability to FBO, making it one of the most reliably profitable outfits in the minor leagues of the Hollywood studio system. Westerns remained the studio's backbone, along with various action pictures and romantic scenarios; as Kennedy put it, [...] "Melodrama is our meat." [...] During this period, the average production cost of FBO features was around $50,000, and few were budgeted at anything more than $75,000. By comparison, in 1927–28 the average cost at Fox was $190,000; at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, $275,000. One major expense was taken on directly by Kennedy: with several studios competing for Fred Thomson, Kennedy signed him to a <b>personal</b> <b>contract</b> for $15,000 a week. This was the highest straight salary for any actor in the industry, matched only by Tom Mix's new arrangement with Fox. Under the contract, Kennedy struck a deal in early 1927 with Paramount Pictures for the major studio to produce and distribute a series of four Thomson [...] "super westerns." [...] Kennedy participated in the films' financing (and profits) and the actor's company stayed on the FBO lot. Of the four Thomson features that reached theaters in 1927, three were FBO releases.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Dickinson's big-screen {{breakthrough}} role came in Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, {{in which}} she played a flirtatious gambler called [...] "Feathers" [...] who becomes attracted to the town sheriff played by Dickinson's childhood idol John Wayne. The film co-starred Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan. When Hawks sold his <b>personal</b> <b>contract</b> with her to a major studio without her knowledge, she was unhappy. Dickinson nonetheless {{became one of the}} more prominent leading ladies of the next decade, beginning with The Bramble Bush with Richard Burton.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the effects of price restrictions in <b>personal</b> services <b>contracts</b> for direct health care providers. This is a unique method of contracting designed specifically to facilitate the hiring of highly specialized health care providers, primarily physicians, that typically demand a high rate of compensation than that generally offered by the services. Legislation that authorized increased use of such contracts for health care services simultaneously mandated wage ceilings. Some economic impacts of wage ceilings in labor markets are presented. Shortages and a loss of military surplus are likely to be associated with wage ceilings. Recent data concerning <b>personal</b> services <b>contracts</b> are presented and examined, the result of the data evaluation provides some surprises. First, many <b>personal</b> services <b>contracts</b> are not being utilized as originally intended. In fact very few are actually used for physicians' services. Second, there is an appearance of impropriety in some of these contracts. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
