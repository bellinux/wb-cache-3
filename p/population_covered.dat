2500|$|Under his administration, a {{healthcare}} reform bill was approved. Rosselló's Health Reform made Puerto Rico {{one of the}} few jurisdictions in the entire world to have had virtually 100% of its <b>population</b> <b>covered</b> by health insurance. [...] Additionally, under this Reform, Puerto Rico became the only jurisdiction in the USA to have nearly 100% of its infants under the age of 2 vaccinated. [...] He led two campaigns for Puerto Rican statehood in 1993 and 1998 in which locally enacted plebiscites were held to consult the Puerto Rican electorate on the political status with the United States. He supported the congressional Young Bill, which sought to carry out a referendum in Puerto Rico to define the political status of the island. However, the bill died in committee in the Senate of the United States. Nevertheless, Rosselló carried out a non-binding plebiscite in 1998 which gave electors four options and a fifth None of the Above column. The opposing Popular Democratic Party led a campaign to boycott the plebiscite and called the electorate to vote for the None of the Above column. The boycott was successful, as the None of the Above column – which did not represent any kind support for any status option – garnered 50.3% of the total votes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Differential Evolution (DE) is a {{tool for}} {{efficient}} optimisation, and {{it belongs to the}} class of evolutionary algorithms, which include Evolution Strategies and Genetic Algorithms. DE algorithms work well when the <b>population</b> <b>covers</b> the entire search space, and they have shown to be effective on a large range of classical optimisation problems. However, an undesirable behaviour was detected when {{all the members of the}} population are in a basin of attraction of a local optimum (local minimum or local maximum), because in this situation the population cannot escape from it. This paper proposes a modification of the standard mechanisms in DE algorithm in order to change the exploration vs. exploitation balance to improve its behaviour. ...|$|R
