5000|$|From 1995 to 2002, PET {{business}} has grown after {{engaging in the}} downstream production of PET <b>preforms,</b> <b>bottles</b> and closures through {{a joint venture with}} Serm Suk Pcl, as well as through various expansion projects leading to increased capacities ...|$|R
50|$|Parle Agro also diversified into {{production}} of PET <b>preforms</b> (semi-finished <b>bottles)</b> in 1996. Its customers include {{companies in the}} beverages, edible oil, confectionery and pharmaceutical segments.|$|R
25|$|In {{the second}} step, the preforms are heated rapidly and then {{inflated}} against a two-part mold to form {{them into the}} final shape of the <b>bottle.</b> <b>Preforms</b> (uninflated <b>bottles)</b> are now also used as robust and unique containers themselves; besides novelty candy, some Red Cross chapters distribute {{them as part of}} the Vial of Life program to homeowners to store medical history for emergency responders. Another increasingly common use for the preforms are containers in the outdoor activity geocaching.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the main}} project {{investment}} {{was for the}} manufacture of PET <b>preforms</b> and <b>bottles</b> targeting the growing carbonated soft drink industry in Pakistan, {{a small part of}} the investment envisaged a plastic bag making unit to meet the needs of the industries in the North. Subsequently in 1992 EPL was converted into a public limited company and was successfully listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange in March 1994.|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{identify}} non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), which is still a challenging task for analytical chemists, PET pellets, <b>preforms</b> and <b>bottles</b> were analyzed by an optimized headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). Fingerprints obtained by the proposed method were analyzed by three chemometric tools: Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and a multi-block method (Common Components and Specific Weights Analysis CCSWA) in order to extract pertinent variations in NIAS concentrations. Total ion current (TIC) chromatograms were used for PCA and ICA while extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) were used for CCSWA, each ion corresponding to a block. PCA managed to discriminate pellets and <b>preforms</b> from <b>bottles</b> due to several NIAS. Volatiles like 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane, ethylene glycol, ethylbenzene and xylene {{were responsible for the}} discrimination of pellets and preforms. Less volatile compounds like linear aldehydes and phthalates were responsible for the discrimination of bottles. ICA showed more specific discriminations especially for bottles and pellets while CCSWA managed to discriminate preforms. The proposed methodology, combining HS-SPME/GC-MS with chemometric tools proved its efficiency in highlighting NIAS in PET samples in a relatively simple and fast approach compared to classical techniques...|$|R
50|$|While {{cartridges}} are mess-free {{and more}} convenient to refill than <b>bottle</b> filling, <b>converter</b> and <b>bottle</b> filling systems are still sold. Non-cartridge filling systems {{tend to be}} slightly more economical {{in the long run}} since ink is generally less expensive in bottles than in cartridges. Advocates of bottle-based filling systems also cite less waste of plastic for the environment, a wider selection of inks, easier cleaning of pens (as drawing the ink in through the nib helps dissolve old ink), and the ability to check and refill inks at any time.|$|R
50|$|EPL {{was set up}} {{with the}} active support and {{guidance}} of Pepsi International in Pakistan as a vendor of international standards for the supply of PET bottles to the carbonated soft drink industry. This valuable assistance ensured the achievement of high quality, consistent and reliable production of PET bottles capable of successfully performing in the harsh heat, transport and retail conditions of Pakistan. EPL procured highly sophisticated and modern plant and equipment from the best machinery manufacturers of Germany, UK and USA. In order to obtain high quality and output in the most cost-efficient manner, EPL {{with the help of}} international consultants and experts on PET <b>bottles</b> and <b>preforms,</b> Inter-Tech Ltd, USA and the technical advice of Pepsi-Cola International, USA, procured the 2-stage technology for separate manufacture of <b>bottles</b> and <b>preforms</b> rather than the single-stage technology for producing both <b>preforms</b> and <b>bottles</b> in the same injection and blow-molding cycle on one machine. The latter is a slow process in comparison to the 2-stage process and is not technically and commercially feasible for high output low-cost manufacture of bottles required to meet the high-volume demand of the CSD and mineral water markets worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes were ground, contaminated, washed, {{manufactured}} into multilayer <b>preforms</b> and <b>bottles,</b> {{and then}} tested for migration. The model contaminants were toluene, trichloroethane, chlorobenzene, phenyldecane, benzophenone, phenylcyclohexane, and copper(II) acetylacetonate. No migration was detected through a barrier of virgin PET (186 +/- 39 mym) into 3 % acetic acid food simulant using general {{methods of testing}} with a detection limit of 1 myg kg- 1. Migration was < 1 myg kg- 1 even for 6 -month-old bottles placed {{in contact with the}} simulant for a further 6 months; that is, a test period considerably in excess of the shelf life of soft drinks. Neither was migration detectable in the more severe simulating solvents (e. g., 50 % aqueous ethanol and 100 % ethanol). Targeted analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy was then used to achieve a sub microgram per kilogram limit of detection and establish the performance of the barrier. Three-layer bottles with the contaminated PET buried were compared with 1 -layer bottles in which contaminated PET contacted the food simulant directly. Migration into 3 % acetic acid from 1 -layer bottles was from < 0. 2 up to 0. 4 myg kg- 1, and the worst-case substance was toluene. Therefore, the virgin PET layer reduced migration from an already low level, by more than 2 orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Plastic bottles {{are most}} {{commonly}} made from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) by {{injection stretch blow molding}} (ISBM). The required bottle performance criteria vary with its application but typically include top load strength, burst strength, and barrier properties, {{each of which}} is influenced by the bottle processing parameters. Experimental process optimization is time-consuming and costly, and computer modeling methods now offer a viable alternative. In this study, the optimum cooling time of the <b>bottle</b> <b>preform</b> was determined by conducting structural analysis of the actual bottles. On the other hand, the process simulation and the simulation of structural analysis of the PET fruit juice bottles were conducted under the same conditions with those from actual bottles produced. The experimental results were compared with simulation results. The structural simulation studies validated most of the experimental findings. The discrepancy between the experimental study and the simulation predictions were explained...|$|R
40|$|Stretch {{blow molding}} {{is the process}} of choice for the {{production}} of PET containers, for the food and beverage industry as well as the pharmaceutical sector. The stretch blow molding process involves three stages, the reheat stage where previously injection molded preforms are heated to desired forming temperature distribution, followed by the forming and the solidifcation stages. The process is a high volume process with costly tooling for both the preform and the container. The design of the tooling, via virtual technologies is preferable so as to minimize costly tooling reworks. Industry has readily accepted the use of finite element technologies in the prediction of the stretch blow molding process. This acceptabce is now generating large amounts of information that are invaluable for future designs. The challenge is now to structure and make use of this information in an efficient way as possible. A design database structure has been set up for information representation from past designs, including a design, <b>preform</b> and <b>bottle</b> databases. Mathematical methodology has been established to represent preform design. The design database and a series of user-defined heuristic design rules for stretch blow molded containers are used to extract unknown input needed in the design methodology. The heuristic knowledge represents the different product characteristics based on mechanical requirements. Those rules and the data extraction will evolve and adapt themselves taking into account new design database, new rules and modified rules. The model inputs are the bottle fill level capacity, bottle diameter, bottle length and bottle transition length, whereas the outputs of the model are the preform shape and weight.

5000|$|Advantages: Very {{high volumes}} are produced. Little {{restriction}} on <b>bottle</b> design. <b>Preforms</b> {{can be sold}} as a completed item for a third party to blow. Is suitable for cylindrical, rectangular or oval bottles.Disadvantages: High capital cost. Floor space required is high, although compact systems have become available. In the single-stage process both <b>preform</b> manufacture and <b>bottle</b> blowing are performed in the same machine. The older 4-station method of injection, reheat, stretch blow and ejection is more costly than the 3-station machine which eliminates the reheat stage and uses latent heat in the preform, thus saving costs of energy to reheat and 25% reduction in tooling. The process explained: Imagine the molecules are small round balls, when together they have large air gaps and small surface contact, by first stretching the molecules vertically then blowing to stretch horizontally the biaxial stretching makes the molecules a cross shape. These [...] "crosses" [...] fit together leaving little space as more surface area is contacted thus making the material less porous and increasing barrier strength against permeation. This process also increases the strength to be ideal for filling with carbonated drinks.|$|R

40|$|Rapid Heating Cycle Molding (RHCM) is {{a widely}} used {{technology}} for manufacturing high gloss components without visible surface defects. Due to the several improvements such as the injection pressure reduction, the increasing on molded parts quality and the possibility to control the mold temperature, this technology is becoming an interesting solution for injection molding of thin wall components with engineering polymers. The elevated mold temperature, however, substantially increases the cycle time, thus lowering the productivity to a great extent. Development of capable techniques for rapidly heating and cooling a mold with a relatively large mass is technically challenging because of the constraints set by the injection molding process. In this work a porous mold insert with a regular deterministic geometry was developed and optimized through a numerical simulations to increase heat exchange between water and the cavity surface. An accurate mold numerical model was developed and experimentally validated. The results showed a substantial increase of the global coefﬁcient of thermal conduction compared to the existing technologies for the rapid variation of the mold cavity temperature. A further experimental study {{was focused on the}} RHCM inﬂuence on microstructure and mechanical properties of long glass fibre reinforced polypropylene. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was employed to allow a direct observation of the fibres orientation and image analysis was used to measure the residual ﬁbres length distribution. Tensile strength and fatigue analysis were performed in order to characterize the injection molded specimens, with a CIM and RHCM technologies, from static and dynamic point of view. The using of an high mold temperature resulted in a lower ﬁbre orientation while the residual ﬁbre length was enhanced. Concerning mechanical properties, the employment of a RHCM technology ensure an increasing of the tensile strength for thin wall components while both static and dynamic properties are decreased for thick parts. The mold temperature inﬂuence on injection molding of PET thin wall <b>bottle</b> <b>preforms</b> was also numerically investigated. The increasing in mold temperature resulted in a substantial decreasing of injection pressure without overcoming the limit of crystallization degree imposed by the subsequent blow molding process. A ﬁnal aim of this work regarded the employment of a RHCM technology in order to control the mold temperature and the annealing phase during the injection molding of parts made with PLA. The analysis showed an interesting capability of adjusting the mold temperature in order to control the material crystallization degree and consequently its mechanical properties...|$|R
