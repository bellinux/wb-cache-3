40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> in the Chinese pork market between 1994 and 2016 and examine any {{incidence}} and causes of asymmetric <b>price</b> <b>transmission.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The approach uses threshold autoregressive models, asymmetric error correction models and autoregressive moving average models to examine the <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> using monthly pig and pork prices from 1994 to 2016. Findings: While a symmetric <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> between pork and pig prices was identified for the period between June 1994 and June 2007, an asymmetric <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> response between pork and pig prices was found for the period July 2007 to June 2016.

40|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{literature}} on <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> focuses on whether price changes occurring at one stage of the food sector are fully transmitted in changes to retail prices. The role of market structure in determining the degree of <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> is often emphasised, the presumption being that if downstream markets are imperfectly competitive <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> will be less than complete. However, an important feature of market structure, often by-passed in empirical studies of market power {{is the nature of}} the underlying cost conditions.

40|$|Beef {{and pork}} prices at farm, {{wholesale}} and retail are examined {{for evidence of}} a dynamic and asymmetric <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> using an endogenous switching model. Dynamic adjustment means that it take time for prices to adjust {{to changes in the}} market. <b>Price</b> <b>transmission</b> is asymmetric if the speed or completeness of price adjustment depends on the direction that the price or a related price is moving. Some of the previous research on <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> in agricultural markets attempts to use market power abuses as an explanation of price-transmission asymmetry. Other research shows that <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> asymmetry can arise in competitive markets and that competitive and anti-competitive issues can make prices adjust faster upwards or downwards. By making stronger assumptions about the how live animal production relates to meat production and consumption and on the cost structure of packing and retailing, stronger statements about <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> and potential market-power problems can be made. Incomplete or irreversible <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> can be taken as evidence of market power issues given these stronger assumptions. However, these assumptions must be true or the tests will not be valid. Two potential sources of incomplete-irreversible effects were included in the endogenous switching models. The only statistically significant evidence of incomplete <b>price</b> <b>transmission</b> is in the wholesale-to-retail transmission in pork. The estimates imply that the 89 ½% of wholesale price changes get passed to the retail price.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a conjectured supply function (CSF) equilibrium models of oligopolistic competition among electricity producers formulated as mixed linear complementarity problems (MLCP). Similar to the conjectured supply function approach, a conjectured <b>transmission</b> <b>price</b> (CTP) response function is formulated {{in order to}} model how generating companies can influence the <b>transmission</b> <b>price.</b> The model simulates a bilateral market design based on a point-to-point <b>transmission</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme corresponding to the locational marginal pricing (LMP) based congestion management. The focus {{of this paper is}} to study the outcome of the market equilibrium by a stepwise increase of each strategic generator’s CTP response parameter. An estimation of this parameter will not be within the scope of this paper. The results show that strategic generators behave more profitably when they have some information about how to affect <b>transmission</b> <b>prices.</b> However, depending on where they are located with respect to the congested transmission line, they pursue different policies in terms of manipulating congestion prices. A three-node network is presented to illustrate the application.
