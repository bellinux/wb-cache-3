Current methods employ qualitative methods, and the manufacturer must correctly interpret the inspection criteria set by the customer {{in order to meet the}} design specifications. The interpretation of what is acceptable often differs from the customer to manufacturer and even from inspector to inspector. In this thesis, the visual inspection of cast metal are explored in depth, and improvements to current methods are proposed. First, the risk of Type I and II errors from the inspection process were evaluated based off of varying states of environmental and human factors in the inspection process; however, it was discovered high variation among inspectors still exists due to the subjectivity of the standards. This signals a need for a more quantitative standard to evaluate the surface of a casting. In response a digital standard is proposed, which specifies three parameters to allow the customer to communicate their exact needs in regards to surface finish to the manufacturer. These parameters are calculated based off of a part’s true geometry <b>post</b> <b>shrinkage</b> in absence of surface roughness and abnormalities, or underlying geometry. Since the underlying geometry differs from the part’s intended geometry, methods will be explored to estimate the underlying geometry from a point cloud of the part’s surface. The proposed methods will be compared to identify which approach best estimates the ideal underlying geometry. Once an ideal method is identified, it will be used as a standard method to calculate the underlying geometry in order to create consistency among inspectors at both the customer and manufacturer. The work completed in this thesis will raise awareness of the risk associated with current visual inspection methods for cast metal surfaces. The new, digital standard will reduce the variation in this inspection process allowing greater confidence in the parts leaving the manufacturer. Additionally, the standard will allow the customer to improve communication with the manufacturer in order to achieve the quality of surface required for their specific needs...|$|E
40|$|In high-dimensional data {{settings}} where p≫ n, many penalized regularization approaches were studied for simultaneous variable selection and estimation. However, with {{the existence of}} covariates with weak effect, many existing variable selection methods, including Lasso and its generations, cannot distinguish covariates with weak and no contribution. Thus, prediction based on a subset model of selected covariates only can be inefficient. In this paper, we propose a <b>post</b> selection <b>shrinkage</b> estimation strategy to improve the prediction performance of a selected subset model. Such a <b>post</b> selection <b>shrinkage</b> estimator (PSE) is data-adaptive and constructed by shrinking a post selection weighted ridge estimator {{in the direction of}} a selected candidate subset. Under an asymptotic distributional quadratic risk criterion, its prediction performance is explored analytically. We show that the proposed post selection PSE performs better than the post selection weighted ridge estimator. More importantly, it improves the prediction performance of any candidate subset model selected from most existing Lasso-type variable selection methods significantly. The relative performance of the post selection PSE is demonstrated by both simulation studies and real data analysis. Comment: 40 pages, 2 figures, discussion pape...|$|R
40|$|Ferroelectric {{thin films}} of PbTiO 3 are {{prepared}} directly on Si(100) substrate {{for the first}} time by spin coating an aqueous sol of lead and titanium hydroxy complex and post annealing at various temperatures. The X-ray diffraction patterns show that the films are polycrystalline in nature. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the films 0. 3 mu m in thickness are essentially crack-free. Since there is no organic content in the precursor solution, <b>post</b> deposition <b>shrinkage</b> is reduced. This helps to decrease the possibility of film cracking. The ferroelectric properties of the films are comparable to those obtained by the complex alkoxide route and other expensive techniques. Copyright (C) 1997...|$|R
40|$|Research and {{experience}} using {{various types of}} mine backfill - hydraulic, rock, paste, and blended - has indicated several benefits to the mining industry. Backfill is a general term that refers to any waste material that is placed into underground mine workings. Paste backfill in particular has shown environmental and economic benefits. Paste fill is generally produced from total mine tailings, meaning that it can include waste rock, sands, and clay-sized particles. It also contains no free water, meaning that water will not flow freely through it after placement causing <b>post</b> filling <b>shrinkage.</b> These characteristics make it the most environmentally 2 ̆ 2 friendly 2 ̆ 2 backfill option currently available. In addition, paste backfill is non-segregating and stackable, containing about 80...|$|R
30|$|From the {{numerical}} analysis, when the embossed part was cooled, it shrank {{from the edge}} toward the thermal center of the embossed part but the sidewall of a mold cavity contacting the <b>post</b> prevented its <b>shrinkage.</b> This caused thermal stress and stress concentration in the post. As {{the distance between the}} posts and thermal center increased, thermal stresses also increased since they were proportional to the amount of shrinkage of the embossed part.|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} has shown that interferometric SAR techniques can be used to monitor deformation at landslides and volcanoes under specific conditions. Special filtered interferograms are being used to reduce speckle and minimize errors created by vegetation. InSAR images were used to monitor current post slide motion along existing fault lines at the Frank Slide a 30 x 10 6 m 3 rock avalanche, in the Canadian Rockies. This information is used to understand the post failure mechanism and mobility of the slide. At Miyake-Jima Island in Japan a filtered interferogram was used to monitor <b>post</b> eruption volcanic <b>shrinkage.</b> The volcano erupted in July-August 2000 that led to the total evacuation of inhabitants from the island. Our differential InSAR results show subsidence at the summit after the eruption, and allow us to monitor the post eruption processes, thereby assisting in planning the return of local residents to the island...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallurgical coke for blast furnace and foundry use, and for some domestic boiler cokes are produced by carbonising coals in slot-type ovens. The coal is heated by heat transferred from the hot oven walls (usually 1250 °C) so that a temperature gradient is set up within the oven charge. A layer of plastic coal is formed (350 - 500 °C) which moves progressively towards the oven centre as carbonisation proceeds. Immediately after re-solidification, and again near 700 °C, the semi-coke suffers shrinkage as the carbon structure reorganises The <b>post</b> re-solidification <b>shrinkage</b> is the more severe and results in large, horizontal and vertical primary fissures being formed which allow breakage of the charge into lumps as it is pushed from the oven. A large central fissure, formed when the two plastic layers meet, divides the charge into two. Further breakage occurs at primary fissures on handling the coke after pushing. Smaller secondary fissures present in the resultant coke lump {{are believed to be}} a result of the shrinkage near 700 °C. Coke has three roles in the blast furnace: as a source of heat, a source of reducing agents and as a support for the burden. The latter function is particularly important {{at the bottom of the}} stack when coke is the only solid material present. The blast furnace output is dependent on the quantity of air that can be pushed up the stack. This depends on the permeability of the coke bed in the lower reaches of the stack. To maintain permeability, the coke should not suffer size degradation as it progresses down the stack; a mixture of large and small coke particles is disastrous. Thus coke quality tends to be assessed in terms of resistance to size degradation in a drum test. Size degradation occurs as a result of volumetric breakage at fissures and abrasion of surfaces. Brittle fracture theory suggests that volumetric breakage should occur as a result of the propagation of secondary fissures in coke lumps [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) {{are local}} dilatations of the infrarenal aorta. If left {{untreated}} they may rupture {{and lead to}} death. One form of treatment is the minimally invasive insertion of a stent-graft into the aneurysm. Despite this effective treatment aneurysms may occasionally continue to expand and this may eventually result in post-operative rupture of the aneurysm. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is a particularly useful tool for investigating aneurysm biomechanics as both the wall stresses and fluid forces can be examined. Methods: Pre-op, Post-op and Follow-up models were reconstructed from CT scans of a single patient and FSI simulations were performed on each model. The FSI approach involved coupling Abaqus and Fluent via a third-party software - MpCCI. Aneurysm wall stress and compliance were investigated {{as well as the}} drag force acting on the stent-graft. Results: Aneurysm wall stress was reduced from 0. 38 MPa before surgery to a value of 0. 03 MPa after insertion of the stent-graft. Higher stresses were seen in the aneurysm neck and iliac legs post-operatively. The compliance of the aneurysm was also reduced post-operatively. The peak Post-op axial drag force was found to be 4. 85 N. This increased to 6. 37 N in the Follow-up model. Conclusion: In a patient-specific case peak aneurysm wall stress was reduced by 92 %. Such a reduction in aneurysm wall stress may lead to shrinkage of the aneurysm over time. Hence, postoperative stress patterns may help in determining the likelihood of aneurysm <b>shrinkage</b> <b>post</b> EVAR. Post-operative remodelling of the aneurysm may lead to increased drag forces...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{report the}} use of 'gamma knife' (GK) {{radiosurgery}} in 25 patients with pituitary adenomas not cured despite conventional therapy, including external beam radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients had previously received conventional radiotherapy for a mean of 11. 8 years prior to receiving GK; 23 out of 25 had also undergone pituitary surgery {{on at least one}} occasion. Seventeen had hyperfunctioning adenomas that still required medical therapy without an adequate biochemical control [...] ten somatotroph adenomas, six corticotroph adenomas and one prolactinoma, while eight patients had non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPAs). RESULTS: Following GK, mean GH fell by 49 % at 1 year in patients with somatotroph tumours. Serum IGF 1 fell by 32 % at 1 year and by 38 % at 2 years. To date, 80 % of the patients with acromegaly have achieved normalisation of IGF 1, and 30 % have also achieved a mean GH level of < 1. 8 ng/ml correlating with normalised mortality. A total of 75 % NFPAs showed disease stabilisation or <b>shrinkage</b> <b>post</b> GK. The patient with a prolactinoma showed a dramatic response: 75 % reduction in prolactin at 2 years, with a marked shrinkage on magnetic resonance imaging. The results in corticotroph adenomas were variable. Prior to GK, 72 % of the patients were panhypopituitary, and 42 % of the remainder have developed new anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies to date. No other adverse events have been detected at a mean follow-up of 36. 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that GK is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for patients with NFPAs and acromegaly not satisfactorily controlled with surgery and radiotherapy...|$|R
