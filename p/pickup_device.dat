2500|$|Philo Taylor Farnsworth (August 19, 1906 – March 11, 1971) was an American {{inventor}} {{and television}} pioneer. He made many contributions that were {{crucial to the}} early development of all-electronic television. He is {{perhaps best known for}} his 1927 invention of the first fully functional all-electronic image <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> (video camera tube), the [...] "image dissector", as well as the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system. He was also the first person to demonstrate such a system to the public. Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera, which he produced commercially {{in the form of the}} Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation, from 1938 to 1951, in Fort Wayne, Indiana.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{and film}} cameras share an optical system, {{typically}} using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image <b>pickup</b> <b>device.</b> The diaphragm and shutter admit {{the correct amount}} of light to the imager, just as with film but the image <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Most digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.|$|E

50|$|That {{the output}} images are {{oriented}} {{the same way}} around (in the case of CCD image sensors). In the prism assembly illustrated above, where the red light is the direct path, the blue path is reflected once and the resultant image is not laterally inverted, unlike the red and green. In cameras using vacuum tube video <b>pickup</b> <b>devices</b> this was solved by merely reversing the connections for the line scan coils; with CMOS imagers, the row or column address sequence is simply reversed. But with CCD sensors {{it is necessary to}} build a mirror image sensor for one channel. The Philips prism assembly (center right) has all three color channels laterally inverted and can thus use three similar CCDs.|$|R
25|$|Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a {{textiles}} magnate, patented {{the modern}} form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, {{the line was}} drawn off {{the leading edge of}} the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line <b>pickup,</b> a <b>device</b> which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.|$|R
5000|$|Several guitar manufacturers, such as Godin, offer guitar {{models with}} an {{integrated}} [...] "RMC hexaphonic pickup and preamp system" [...] that {{is compatible with}} Roland guitar-synth hardware. The RMC pickup system uses a piezo-crystal <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> built into the saddles of the guitar bridge. This piezo-pickup conducts the vibrations of the strings as a piezo-acoustic signal that can be converted into a (13-pin) hexaphonic synth signal. This setup {{can be found in}} the xtSA and the LGX models.|$|E
50|$|The Contax i4R is {{a digital}} camera {{manufactured}} by Kyocera. The i4R was announced on 28 September 2004. Its design {{was one of the}} more unusual of Contax's designs. Kyocera released it to the public in November, 2004 with a price of 299 GBP. The i4R features a Carl Zeiss Tessar T* 6.5mm f/2.8 lens. Its image <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> is a charge-coupled device with 4.19 &times; 106 gross pixels. The i4R is PictBridge-compliant. Besides its usually small size for the time, its other unusual feature was its ability to focus down to about two inches (five centimetres).|$|E
50|$|A <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> is a {{transducer}} (specifically {{a variable}} reluctance sensor) that captures or senses mechanical vibrations produced by musical instruments, particularly stringed instruments {{such as the}} electric guitar, electric bass guitar, Chapman Stick, or electric violin, and converts them to an electrical signal that is amplified using an instrument amplifier (such as a guitar amplifier) to produce musical sounds through a loudspeaker in a speaker enclosure. The signal from a pickup can also be recorded directly, using a DI box (a common practice with the electric bass) or broadcast on the radio or television. Most electric guitars and electric basses use magnetic pickups. Acoustic guitars, upright basses and fiddles often use a piezoelectric pickup.|$|E
25|$|Many inventors {{had built}} {{electromechanical}} television systems before Farnsworth's seminal contribution, but Farnsworth {{designed and built}} the world's first working all-electronic television system, employing electronic scanning in both the <b>pickup</b> and display <b>devices.</b> He first demonstrated his system to the press on September 3, 1928, and {{to the public at}} the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia on August 25, 1934.|$|R
50|$|Phono cartridges, {{also known}} as <b>pickups,</b> are {{electromechanical}} <b>devices</b> which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. The cartridge contains a removable or permanently mounted stylus, the tip of which makes physical contact with the record's groove. In popular usage and in disc jockey jargon, the stylus, and sometimes the entire cartridge, is often called the needle. The electrical signal generated by the cartridge can be amplified and then converted into sound by a loudspeaker.|$|R
5000|$|His {{most famous}} {{invention}} came in 1945 when Pickering, {{frustrated with the}} acoustical limitations of sound reproduction from phonograph records, developed a <b>pickup</b> (a <b>device</b> which translates the vibrations of the needle into electrical impulses for amplification) which reduced record wear and significantly increased {{the accuracy of the}} sounds coming through the speaker. [...] Pickering felt that phonograph records recorded sound at reasonable levels of fidelity, but that the reproduction standards were not acceptable. [...] Listening to the results from his new device, Pickering felt that the improvement in sound [...] "wasn't just a little, it was magnificent." [...] Further development resulted in the Pickering cartridge. [...] Pickering showed Sumner Hall, who had recorded the Sperry Symphony at a Carnegie Hall concert, some prototypes of his pickup. Hall encouraged development, and Pickering & Co was started in November 1945. [...] Initially the Pickering apparatus was only marketed for professional use in recording studios and radio stations, but by 1947 it became clear that there was potential in the consumer market. [...] Pickering made his designs for 78rpm records, and the 1948 introduction of the LP record caught him off-guard. As a result, he had to completely re-work his design.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 Zenith {{came up with}} {{a remote}} control called the [...] "Lazy Bones", which was {{connected}} with wires to the TV set. The next development was the [...] "Flashmatic" [...] (1955), designed by Eugene Polley, a wireless remote control that used a light beam to signal the TV (with a photosensitive <b>pickup</b> <b>device)</b> to change stations. One problem was that during the daytime the sensitivity degraded. In 1956 Zenith began producing the Robert Adler-designed remote control called the [...] "Zenith Space Command", which sent an ultrasonic tone to the TV set, where it was picked up with a miniature microphone sensitive to only that tone. At the cost of $259.95, it was truly a luxury item.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, Rank Precision Industries was {{experimenting with}} the flying-spot scanner (FSS), which {{inverted}} the {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) concept of scanning using a television screen. The CRT emits a pixel-sized electron beam which is converted to a photon beam through the phosphors coating the envelope. This dot of light is then focused by a lens onto the film's emulsion, and finally collected by a <b>pickup</b> <b>device.</b> In 1950 the first Rank flying spot monochrome telecine was installed at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios. The advantage of the FSS is that colour analysis is done after scanning, so {{there can be no}} registration errors as can be produced by vidicon tubes where scanning is done after colour separation—it also allows simpler dichroics to be used.|$|E
5000|$|The name of Holden Illingworth, a {{textiles}} magnate, {{was first}} {{associated with the}} modern form of fixed-spool spinning reel. When casting the Illingworth reel, line was drawn off {{the leading edge of}} the spool, but was restrained and rewound by a line <b>pickup,</b> a <b>device</b> which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels. [...] In 1948, the Mitchell Reel Company of Cluses, France introduced the Mitchell 300, a spinning reel with a design that oriented the face of the fixed spool forward in a permanently fixed position below the fishing rod. The Mitchell reel was soon offered in a range of sizes for all fresh and saltwater fishing. A manual line pickup was used to retrieve the cast line, which eventually developed into a wire bail design that automatically recaptured the line upon cranking the retrieve handle. An anti-reverse lever prevented the crank handle from rotating while a fish was pulling line from the spool. With the use of light lines testing from two to six pounds, modern postwar spinning reels were capable of casting lures as light as 1/8 oz, and sometimes lighter.|$|R

This paper presents a new planar loop coupler based on Al 2 O 3 as dielectric substrate and discusses both the signal-beam interaction and the scattering behaviour of the coupler working as a kicker. The planar concept is analyzed {{by means of a}} 3 -d full-wave finitedifference method in the frequency domain and the results are compared to the image current approach, which is commonly used for coupler design. 1 Figure. 1.

40|$|Beam-based {{methods to}} measure BPMs center offset with {{reference}} to the pickup center and BPMs resolution are proposed. Being built in a BPM, the methods provide a BPM verification by its own means. Use of the same beam signals which are used for the position measurement, for verification at any present beam intensity provides reliability and accuracy of the methods. The methods can be used for measurement of rms amplitude of beam vibrations as well. A device is developed for subnanosecond bunches to measure BPMs center offset and resolution. It has accuracy close to 10 − 3 and can be used either in a four parallel channel BPM or in a BPM with multiplexing the <b>pickup</b> signals. These <b>devices</b> are used in Bergoz Instrumentation Log-Ratio BPMs. The circuit and characteristics of the device are described. The accuracy is discussed. Test results are presented.

40|$|The PEP-II B-Factory is {{designed}} to operate at high currents with many bunches (1658) to achieve the luminosity required for physics studies. Interactions of a beam with its environment in a storage ring raise various issues of concern for accelerator physics, mechanical design and device performance. First, for accelerator physics, wakefields generated by interactions of a beam with beamline components, if not properly controlled, will drive single-bunch and coupled-bunch instabilities. The total broad-band impedance of the ring cannot exceed a budget limited by single-bunch effects. The growth rate of a coupled-bunch mode contributed from narrow-band impedance should be smaller than the damping rate due to synchrotron radiation; otherwise, suppression by feedback control will be necessary. Second, the energy loss by a beam at a beamline component {{in the form of}} higher-order-mode (HOM) power leads to additional heating on the component, and to TE mode radiation through openings on vacuum chamber walls. Last, calculations of transfer and beam impedances of <b>pickup</b> and kicker <b>devices</b> are essential for improving their performance and for identifying trapped modes. To address these issues quantitatively requires numerical simulations of each beamline component which include the realistic geometry and the relevant physics involved in the particular beam-environment interactions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} and characterized high-Tc planar SQUID magnetometers {{and first}} derivative gradiometers with directly-coupled <b>pickup</b> loops. The <b>devices</b> {{were made from}} single layer of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -δ thin film on LSAT bicrystal substrate with 30 ° or 24 ° misorientation angle. Magnetic properties were investigated by applying a magnetic field B 0 for the SQUID magnetometer patterned with holes to reduce the maximum structural width. We found an increasing low frequency noise with cooling fields B 0 larger than 1. 5 μT. This value consists with the threshold field estimated from the maximum structural width. A magnetic field noise level of 500 fT/Hz 1 / 2 at 10 Hz was observed by using FLL electronics with a bias current reversal in a moderate magnetically-shielded room consisting of only two 1 mm thick layers of permalloy. Measurements of magnetocardiograms demonstrate the suitability of this magnetometer for biomagnetic applications. On the other hand, the gradiometer with two symmetric pickup loops was operated without any shielding. The performance obtained was a field gradient resolution of about 1 pT/cmHz 1 / 2 at 1 kHz and 10 pT/cmHz 1 / 2 at 1 Hz, with a baseline of 4 mm. The imbalance of this gradiometer was around 0. 7 %, limited by the sensitivity to homogeneous field of the SQUID itself...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} to the engine cylinder is essential for internal combustion, engine simulation, especially under motored conditions. If the heat loss rate is correctly estimated, it is then easy {{to determine if a}} low maximum compression pressure is due to increased blowby or not. This paper proposes a method to determine the heat flux rate to the combustion chamber walls of a motored DI diesel engine and evaluate the heat transfer model used. The method is based on processing the measured pressure diagram Li the engine cylinder using a time step equivalent to 0. 15 ° CA. The measured pressure diagram is a P-t diagram, and thus the TDC (top dead centre) of the engine must be determined precisely in order to be converted to a P-V diagram. The TDC is measured using a magnetic <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> mounted on the engine flywheel and is also determined, in cases where this is impossible, using a modified version of a thermodynamic method developed by the author. The heat flux determination method is applied on a modified Ricardo E- 6 engine in the author's laboratory over a range of engine speeds under cold and warm conditions. There is very good coincidence between the measured and calculated heat flux rates at all speeds examined, revealing the validity of the heat transfer model used. The results are promising and compare very well with experimental results published in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of fatigue cracks under installed fasteners {{has been a}} major goal of the aging aircraft NDE community. The Sliding Probe, Magneto-Optic Imager, Rotating Self-Nulling Probe, Low Frequency Eddy Current Array, and Eddyscan systems are among the instruments developed for this inspection. It has been verified that the {{detection of}} fatigue cracks under flush head aluminum and titanium fasteners can be accomplished with a high resolution by the above techniques. The detection of fatigue cracks under ferromagnetic and protruding head fasteners, however, {{has been found to be}} much more difficult. For the present work, the inspection for fatigue cracks under SAE 4340 Steel Hi-Lok fasteners is explored. Modifications to the Rotating Self-Nulling Eddy Current Probe System are presented which enable the detection of fatigue cracks hidden under the protruding head of the ferromagnetic fastener. Inspection results for samples with varying length EDM notches are shown, as well as a comparison between the signature from an EDM notch and an actual fatigue crack. Finite Element Modeling is used to investigate the effect of the ferromagnetic fastener on the induced eddy current distribution in order to help explain the detection characteristics of the system. This paper will also introduce a modification to the Rotating Probe System designed specifically for the detection of deeply buried flaws in multilayer conductors. The design change incorporates a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor as the <b>pickup</b> <b>device</b> to improve the low frequency performance of the probe. The flaw detection capabilities of the GMR based Self- Nulling Probe are presented along with the status of the GMR based Rotating Probe System for detection of deeply buried flaws under installed fasteners...|$|E
40|$|Froth {{flotation}} is {{an exceedingly}} complex physicochemical process. The convenience of distilling {{much of the}} complexity of the bubble-particle interactions into a single parameter has led to the continuing popularity of the classical 'induction time' to quantify the threshold for bubble-particle attachment to occur. Despite this popularity and the simplicity of the concept, there is no single universal method of evaluating the induction period. In this paper, we begin with a critical review of the available techniques for estimating the induction period. These are: back-calculation from experimental (micro) flotation tests; pushing a particle toward a stationary bubble (or vice versa) using an atomic force microscope (AFM); pushing a bubble toward a stationary bed of particles in the 'Induction Timer'; pushing a bubble toward a stationary solid surface using the 'integrated thin film drainage apparatus' (ITFDA); and dropping particles onto a submerged stationary bubble using the 'Milli-Timer' device. Each one of these methods has advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice depends on the application. In the experimental section, we present quantitative comparison of the induction periods estimated using two different techniques, namely the Induction Timer and the Milli-Timer. The same particles were tested in each device, under the same conditions. It was found that by tuning the operation of the particle <b>pickup</b> <b>device,</b> similar estimates of induction period could be obtained to the estimates made by direct observation with the Milli-Timer. In the former device a bubble is driven toward a particle bed at a controlled rate, whereas in the latter a particle's motion is governed by the hydrodynamics. The potential to match these presents an intriguing prospect for better understanding the bubble-particle interaction, and the possibility to 'calibrate' the simpler Induction Timer against direct observations. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{compression}} curve of a DI (Direct Injection) diesel engine {{is affected by}} various parameters, such as heat loss, initial temperature and pressure, speed, compression ratio and blowby. Usually the engineer makes use of the measured motored pressure diagram and especially of the maximum compression pressure value to determine the engine condition (wear). However, {{in order to have}} an accurate indication of the engine condition, one must consider accurately all the previous mechanisms. This poses a very difficult task since, for example, not even the compression ratio is usually accurately known for an operating engine. Thus, a low maximum compression pressure value may not be caused by increased blowby rate, and so this may lead to a wrong indication of cylinder condition. The present work introduces a new method for determining cylinder condition (wear) and especially the blowby rate. The method is based on the determination of the position of the maximum compression pressure value relative to the TDC (Top Dead Centre) position. The maximum pressure position (before TDC) varies greatly with blowby rate, but is practically unaffected by heat losses, initial temperature and pressure and compression ratio. Experiments have been conducted on a Ricardo E- 6, DI diesel engine for various compression ratios, engine speeds and operating temperatures (cold and warm operation) under motoring conditions. Pressure has been measured using a time step equivalent to 0. 1 -degree-CA, while the TDC position has been determined using a magnetic <b>pickup</b> <b>device.</b> A mathematical simulation accounting for heat losses and blowby has been used to examine the effect of various parameters on maximum compression pressure and its position relative to TDC. The results from both experiments and simulation are found to be in good agreement concerning pressure curves, maximum pressure position and their variation with the parameters examined. The results are promising, showing a high potential for determining any cylinder condition by processing the corresponding measured pressure diagram...|$|E
