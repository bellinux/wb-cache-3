50|$|First {{found in}} prehistoric bronze, in medieval times, shield bosses {{were made by}} armourers out of sheets of iron or steel. The armourer started with a flat, {{relatively}} thin sheet and sank the metal into a bowl, which might then be <b>planished</b> and polished.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Planishing</b> (from the Latin planus, [...] "flat") is a {{metalworking}} {{technique that}} involves finishing the surface by finely shaping and smoothing sheet metal. This {{is done by}} hammering with a <b>planishing</b> panel hammer or slapper file against a shaped surface called a <b>planishing</b> stake that is held in a vice or a mounting hole in a blacksmith's beak anvil, or against hand-held, shaped, metal tools that are known as Dollies or Anvils. The shape of the stake or dolly has to match the desired work piece contour, and so they {{come in a variety}} of complex shapes. Alternatively, <b>planishing</b> may be done by the use of an English Wheel. After approximately forming a metal object, by stretching with techniques such as sinking and raising, and then shaping and smoothing an object, metal workers use <b>planishing</b> for surface finishing. <b>Planishing</b> is a hand-driven process used in auto body repair and sheet metal craft work such as medieval armour production.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>planishing</b> hammers are {{generally}} {{in contact with}} the outside surface of the piece, they are flat, have rounded edges and are polished to avoid marring the work. Pneumatic (air powered) <b>planishing</b> hammers strike hundreds of blows per minute.|$|R
50|$|The cup was {{designed}} in 1897 by the jeweller Robert Linzeler and {{was made by}} Bratiau in 1898. It is made of <b>planished</b> solid silver and weighs 10 kilos. The lot is 58 centimetres wide (81 with the handles) and 57 centimetres high. Placed on an ebony plinth, it is considered as a masterpiece of Art nouveau style.|$|E

[...] The company location was at Pratt and Miller Streets in Meriden, occupying a unique triangular-shaped building that has since been demolished. Across the street across from the Meriden Public Library original, brick back buildings of the original Manning, Bowman & Co. can be seen.|$|E
50|$|These {{locomotives}} were to {{form the}} basis for further development of the Pacific type, which was to become the standard express passenger steam locomotive type in South Africa. They were handsome locomotives and their appearance was enhanced by the use of <b>planished</b> steel plates to cover the boiler and cylinder lagging. They were equipped with two whistles of different tones and a steam turbine generator, mounted on the smokebox between the headlight and the chimney, to power the Edwards headlight.|$|E
50|$|Various hammers and dollies {{used for}} <b>planishing.</b>|$|R
50|$|An English {{wheel is}} a better tool for a skilled {{craftsman}} for low-crown applications than manually hammering. <b>Planishing</b> manually using dollies and slapper files or <b>planishing</b> hammer, after hammer forming is very labour-intensive. Using a pear shaped mallet and sandbag to stretch the sheet metal (sinking), or by raising on a stake, speeds up the fabrication of higher crown sections. A pneumatic hammer or power hammer is faster still. The English wheel is very effective when used for <b>planishing,</b> (for which it was originally patented in England), to a smooth final finish after these processes.|$|R
5000|$|Gideon <b>Planish</b> is a 1943 {{novel by}} American writer Sinclair Lewis. The novel {{tells the story}} of Gideon <b>Planish,</b> an unprincipled social climber who becomes {{involved}} in various shady philanthropic organizations in his quest for stature without accountability. The work did not fare as well with critics as some of Lewis' earlier social novels, and is considered one of his minor works.|$|R

50|$|The engines from Beyer, Peacock were war-time {{austerity}} {{models on}} which <b>planished</b> steel boiler lagging {{was replaced by}} ordinary steel lagging, while cosmetic dressing items like stainless steel lagging bands, chrome-plated handrails and rounded corners {{on the front of}} the firebox lagging were absent or replaced by unplated items. While the boiler barrels of the pre-war engines were of nickel steel, the austerity locomotives had boiler barrels made of carbon steel with steel plates of 1/16 in greater thickness. When it was subsequently found that the increased thickness was unnecessary, 13/16 in thick carbon steel plates were used on later orders, the same thickness as earlier used with nickel steel plates, which resulted in a desirable reduction in axle loads.|$|E
50|$|Two of {{the engines}} were {{equipped}} with live-steam injectors {{on the right-hand side}} and exhaust steam injectors on the left-hand side. On the other fourteen locomotives, the boiler was fed by two no. 13 live-steam injectors, one on each side and situated immediately in front of the firebox, mounted low enough to ensure that water could still be drained effectively from the water tender when the engine was on a 1 in 40 (2Â½%) gradient. The injector feed pipes led to a combined top-feed check valve, situated on the first barrel plate on the top centre-line of the boiler. Feedwater entered the boiler through a spray nozzle beneath which was a baffle tray. The boiler was completely lagged with asbestos mattresses and covered with <b>planished</b> steel, carried on a steel crinoline structure and secured in position by stainless steel bands.|$|E

50|$|Care must {{be taken}} not to allow sheet metal to work harden and become brittle during <b>planishing.</b> If it does, it must be annealed.|$|R
50|$|Both {{metal and}} wood slappers {{are used for}} metalworking. Generally wood slappers are covered with a leather-face. Slappers {{can be used to}} shrink, contour, and <b>planish</b> (smooth) the panel without leaving rough marks to clean up. The slapper {{controls}} more surface with each blow than a hammer can and is very easy to use because it has the same angle of attack as a body hammer. This means the user does not need to change their arm and hand position when moving from hammer to slapper. The slapper can be far more effective than the hammer for shrinking because its leverage gives greater mechanical advantage over the rough spots. The slapper is great for working metal over a T-stake or for gouging and <b>planishing.</b> A good slapper can make radius bends and crowns quite well. A slapper works well with forming stakes and post dollies for lightly <b>planishing</b> and pulling cold shrinks.|$|R
50|$|The Doble Detroit {{incorporated}} key ignition, {{doing away}} {{with the need for}} manual ignition of the boiler system. John Doble also constructed a flash boiler with rectangular casing in which atomized kerosene fuel was ignited with a spark plug, in a carburetor-type venturi and used forced draft provided by an electrically driven fan. This rapidly heated the feedwater contained in vertical grids of tubes welded to horizontal headers. The steam-raising part of the boiler was partitioned off by a wall of heat-resisting material jacketed with <b>planished</b> steel from a smaller compartment in which were similar grids of tubes for feedwater heating. There seem to have been at least two versions of this boiler, the first with the burner and combustion chamber at the bottom, the other with them {{at the top of the}} casing; this led to the subsequent counterflow monotube boiler arrangement. Boiler operation was fully electro-mechanically automated: the bottom of the boiler housed a metal tray with a row of quartz rods. As heat increased, the tray expanded, pushing the rods forward and shutting off the burner. As the system cooled, the quartz rods receded, engaging the burner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the {{approach}} spans of Quanzhou Bay Cross-sea Bridge, these standard spans are 50 m or 70 m, width is 20. 05 m. The approach spans {{have been built}} by using short Line segments precast and erection method. This is the first application in the cross sea bridges. According to characteristics of this project, the research on prefabrication and erection technology of wide box girders {{has been carried out}} to solve the technical problems in the process of construction. The research show that: 1) In precasting process, the vertical deformation of wide box girder is very small under dead load and temperature load etc. so the influence of prefabrication and erection accuracy can be ignored; 2) The temporary anchor using prestressed steel strand better than <b>planished</b> steel; 3) When using epoxy gasket to adjust geometric line shape, the thickness of cemented layer has a great influence on the linear adjustment; 4) The epoxy gasket and bridge erecting machine should be used together, Alignment adjustmen could obtain satisfactory results...|$|E

40|$|This article elaborates {{the impact}} that crises of {{authority}} provoked by animal magnetism, mesmerism, and hypnosis in the 19 th century had for field formation in American education. Four layers of analysis elucidate how curriculum historyâs repetitive focus on public school policy and classroom practice became possible. First, the article surveys external conditions of possibility for the enactment of compulsory public schooling. Second, âinternalâ conditions of possibility {{for the formation of}} educational objects (e. g., types of children) are documented via the processes of diffÃ©rance that were generated from within the experiences of confinement. Third, the article maps how these were interpenetrated by animal magnetic debates that were lustered and <b>planished</b> in educationâs emerging field, including impact upon behavior management practices, the contouring of expertise and authority, the role of Will in intelligence testing and child development theories, and the redefinition of public and private.

50|$|Gideon <b>Planish</b> is {{considered}} a minor work and it was obvious Lewis was rehashing many of his old ideas as many themes and points ring familiar with the target being the shady industry of less-than-legitimate fundraising organizations. While the main character was without moral boundaries, he did remain loyal to his wife (a rare quality in Lewis' characters) but he never achieved anything genuine or of substance as he attempted to achieve everything which focused on style and perception. An earlier character of Lewis', Elmer Gantry, crosses paths with <b>Planish</b> {{several times in the}} book but their interactions serve only as a method to emphasize to the reader the similarities between the crooks in organized religion and the crooks in general philanthropy.|$|R
50|$|Lewis {{followed}} up this first great success with Babbitt (1922), {{a novel that}} satirized the American commercial culture and boosterism. The story was set in the fictional Midwestern town of Zenith, Winnemac, a setting to which Lewis returned in future novels, including Gideon <b>Planish</b> and Dodsworth.|$|R
50|$|Winnemac is {{a fictional}} U.S.state invented by the writer Sinclair Lewis. His novel Babbitt {{takes place in}} Zenith, its largest city (population 361,000, {{according}} to a sketch-map Lewis made to guide his writing.). Winnemac is also a setting for Gideon <b>Planish,</b> Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, and Dodsworth.|$|R
5000|$|Key to {{producing}} the right shape {{is to have}} the right amount of stretched metal surface over this wider area. If this is achieved, it is possible to [...] "move" [...] the metal with minimal extra stretching, filling the low spots with metal from the high spots. This smoothing is almost like <b>planishing</b> using a moderate pressure setting, but is still heavier than that used for <b>planishing.</b> It is a time consuming and fiddly iterative process, {{that is one of the}} most difficult and skillful parts of wheeling. As the size of the panel/section increases, the work involved and the level of difficulty increases disproportionately. This is also a reason that very large panels can be very difficult to do and are made in sections. High crown panels/sections may need to be annealed due to work-hardening of the metal, which makes it brittle unworkable and liable to fracture.|$|R
50|$|One {{common use}} of this peening (stretching) process {{can be seen in}} the auto repair and auto custom {{fabrication}} industries where manual or machine assisted peening is used to stretch thin sheet metal to create curved surfaces. The manual method uses a hand held peening hammer and is a form of <b>planishing.</b> There are also machine assisted methods that use a version of a power hammer to peen the sheet metal.|$|R

50|$|Common tools {{used for}} <b>planishing</b> include panel beating hammers, slappers, and neck hammers. Heavy rawhide or {{hardwood}} hammers are often used. It {{is more difficult}} to make mistakes with heavy rawhide or wood mallets, but they are less effective for large imperfections. A worker, using repeated, relatively soft glancing blows, smooths the metal toward the curvature of the stake. If the metal begins to look dimpled, the worker is using too much force in individual hammer blows.|$|R
