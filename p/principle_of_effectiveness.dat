40|$|Private {{state aid}} {{enforcement}} {{with respect to}} below market value transactions carried out by Swedish municipalities – A study on the conformity of Swedish procedural and substantial rules with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of EC law Recently in Sweden, several local governmental entities (municipalities) have engaged in commercial transactions that, essentially, have been aimed at transferring the ownership of public services – for example schools and local medical care centers – to private undertakings. A few of these transactions have been declared by Swedish administrative courts to constitute illegal below market value transfers of public resources. The essay seeks {{to determine whether the}} Swedish national provisions that govern legal claims based on the directly effective Art. 88 (3) of the EC Treaty, are compatible with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> i. e. to what extent these provisions (do not) render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Art. 88 (3) EC. The author investigates the conformity of national rules with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> in a situation where a) a private party seeks to enforce recovery of unlawfully adopted state aid and b) the European Commission has yet to take any action with respect to the aid measure. By examining the ECJ case-law on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> vis-à-vis the case-law on Art. 88 (3) EC, the author concludes, inter alia, that several Swedish procedural provisions are deemed to be found incompatible with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Furthermore, the author ends up concluding that in respect of a competitor’s right to enforce aid recovery, the current case-law of the ECJ leaves certain key questions unanswered, most notably whether or not national law must provide a competitor the possibility to bring a recovery action directly against the aid recipient...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the recent}} {{amendment}} of the Hungarian Citizenship Act, Hungarians living outside the borders can acquire an additional nationality, and become dual or multiple nationals. The study analyses the prohibition or recognition of dual nationality and the relevant practice of neighbouring states as {{the main purpose of}} the amendment was to enable Hungarians living in territories detached owing to historical events to acquire nationality. By assuming international obligations states may limit their discretion in matters of nationality, which otherwise fall within the domestic jurisdiction of states. Human rights drive the regulation of nationality in certain cases all the more towards the realm of international law. For that reason, human rights limiting the regulation of nationality, such as the right to a nationality, the prohibition of (arbitrary) deprivation of nationality and the prohibition of discrimination, also need to be examined. The analysis also extends to the lack of effectiveness of nationality of Hungarians concerned as well as the binding nature of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> The study concludes that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> may not serve as a basis for other states to declare non-recognition of nationality of these individuals.

Although the conclusions of the recent report may not have been grossly affected, some of the inferential statistics were almost certainly biased by the methods used. I conclude that, unless such artefacts are fully dealt with in the future, and unless the statistical methods for assessing the PoIE evolve, strong evidence in support of the PoIE will remain lacking.
