5000|$|Ling {{was the son}} of John Lynge, a <b>parchment</b> <b>maker</b> from Norwich. He was apprenticed to Henry Bitteman in 1570 and was {{admitted}} to the Stationers' Company as a [...] "freeman" [...] (full member) in 1578. He generally partnered with other publishers. In 1597 he edited Politeuphuia, or Wits Commonwealth, a collection of prose quotations. He has also been credited by some critics with editing England's Helicon (1600), a collection of Elizabethan lyric poems.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} in {{creating}} a codex is to prepare the animal skin. The skin is washed with water and lime, but not together, {{and it has to}} soak in the lime for a couple of days. The hair is removed and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame called a herse. The <b>parchment</b> <b>maker</b> attaches the skin at points around the circumference. The skin attaches to the herse by cords. To prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin the cord attaches to around a pebble called a pippin. After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a lunarium or lunellum to clean any surviving hairs. Once the skin completely dries, the maker gives it a deep clean and processes it into sheets. The number of sheets from a piece of skin depends {{on the size of the}} skin and the final product dimensions. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a bifolium. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers. Defects can often be found in the membrane, whether from the original animal, human error during the preparation period, or from when the animal was killed. Defects can also appear during the writing process. Unless it is kept in perfect condition, defects can appear later in the manuscript’s life as well.|$|E
50|$|Stoneleigh House, in High Street, was {{formerly}} {{the premises of}} <b>parchment</b> <b>makers.</b> Springs were fed under the house into ponds which were used for soaking and cleaning the skins. Remnants of the drying sheds and other buildings still exist at the rear.|$|R
50|$|Parchment was the {{original}} mediaeval material for keeping northern homes warm, for {{those who could not}} afford glass for the windows. The patron saint of <b>parchment</b> <b>makers</b> was the same St Bartholomew. With paper replacing parchment, the name of the traditional Martinmas party, the Wayzgoose, might have been transferred to both papermakers' and printers' parties.|$|R
50|$|Besides much agriculture, brewing, a tannery (Tanyard Lane) {{and to a}} small extent brickmaking, {{more than}} 25 men were {{employed}} in the sheep related trade as fellmongers, more than four were <b>parchment</b> <b>makers,</b> five were millers {{and there was a}} surgeon, an oil painter, James M. Burfield, and a watch maker in the town during the 1881 census.|$|R
50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1914 by the merger of the National Amalgamated Society of Printers' Warehousemen and Cutters, the National Union of Paper Mill Workers, and the United Vellum and <b>Parchment</b> <b>Makers</b> of Great Britain. Alfred Evans, {{formerly}} of the Warehousemen and Cutters, became general secretary, while William Ross, formerly of the Paper Mill Workers, became assistant general secretary.|$|R
5000|$|Vellum {{comes from}} the Latin word vitulinum which means “of calf”/ “made from calf”. For modern <b>parchment</b> <b>makers</b> and calligraphers, and {{apparently}} often in the past, the terms parchment and vellum are used based on the different degrees of quality, preparation and thickness, and not according to which animal the skin came from, and because of this, the more neutral term [...] "membrane" [...] is often used by modern academics, especially where the animal has not been established by testing.|$|R
5000|$|The Godescalc Evangelistary was an {{important}} part of Charlemagne’s educational and ecclesiastical reforms. The manuscript was a preliminary attempt to standardize language in the Carolingian kingdom and this cultural achievement of replacing the Merovingian script was lasting. The Carolingian minuscule was so successful that after the year 800, most of France had adopted the new way of writing. [...] Although the Evangelistary is named after Godescalc, the production involved a team of writers, editors, Godescalc himself (who was a poet and scribe), <b>parchment</b> <b>makers,</b> an illuminator, a painter, and a book binder. Godescalc began a trend of luxuriously decorated Bible manuscripts in the Carolingian world. His Evangelistary was a richly decorated work worthy of matching the desires of the commissioning monarch. The Evangelistary offered not only a new alternative for illuminators and scribes of the Carolingian era, but a form of writing that would be adopted and stay in effect until today.|$|R
40|$|National audienceThis {{book is a}} {{complete}} study of the material and cultural aspects of manuscripts making in Christian Ethiopia. Palaeography, making of parchment, preparation of inks, preparation of quires, binding, preparation of the writing surface, writing and copying, meaning of notes and decorations, illuminations [...] . all information necessary for a real codicology of Ethiopian manuscripts is detailed for the first time, with its Amharic and Ge‘ez terminology. Thanks to the professional experience of the author, who has been travelling all over Ethiopia, synchronicity and regionalism have been taken into account. This study {{is based on a}} very vast corpus of manuscripts. The author also deals with cultural and social aspects as the education of scribes, their daily work, and finally gives some short biographies of famous scribes. The book in Amharic is published together with a short English postface by Anaïs Wion (CNRS). It presents the author, the history of this book initiated by the great historian Tadesse Tamrat, {{the state of the art}} in the study of Ethiopian manuscripts and, of course, the need for the publication of the present study. A set of photos of the tools of scribe and <b>parchments</b> <b>makers</b> has been shot and will be inserted all through the book...|$|R
