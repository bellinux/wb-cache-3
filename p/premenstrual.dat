5|$|Few {{high-quality}} {{studies have}} been performed which demonstrate that stress causes or worsens acne. While the connection between acne and stress has been debated, some research indicates that increased severity is associated with high stress levels in certain contexts such as hormonal changes seen in <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{progesterone}} {{has been}} widely used {{in the treatment of}} <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome. A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for or against the effectiveness of progesterone for this indication. Another review of 10 studies found that progesterone was not effective for this condition, although it stated that insufficient evidence is available currently to make a definitive statement on progesterone in <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone {{has shown}} {{reasonable}} efficacy in relieving {{a number of}} <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome symptoms like mood swings & physical symptoms.|$|E
25|$|SSRIs, {{including}} sertraline, {{reduce the}} symptoms of <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome. Side effects such as nausea are common. Sertraline is effective in alleviating {{the symptoms of}} <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began {{during the first week}} of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better family functioning, social activity and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14days before menses, was shown to work as well as continuous treatment.|$|E
25|$|Citalopram is {{frequently}} used off-label to treat anxiety, panic disorder, dysthymia <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder, {{body dysmorphic disorder}} and obsessive–compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms appear predictably {{during the}} luteal (<b>premenstrual)</b> phase, reduce or {{disappear}} predictably shortly before or during menstruation, and remain absent during the follicular (preovulatory) phase.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine is {{primarily}} {{used to treat}} major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder and menopausal hot flashes.|$|E
25|$|A meta-analysis, {{including}} {{studies with}} fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram versus placebo, showed SSRIs {{to be effective}} in reducing symptoms of <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome, whether taken continuously or just in the luteal phase.|$|E

25|$|Escitalopram as well {{as other}} SSRIs are {{effective}} in reducing the symptoms of <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome, whether taken in the luteal phase only or continuously. There is no good data available for escitalopram for seasonal affective disorder as of 2011. SSRIs {{do not appear to be}} useful for preventing tension headaches or migraines.|$|E
25|$|Some {{physical}} {{effects of the}} rape are not immediately apparent. Follow up examinations also assess the patient for tension headaches, fatigue, sleep pattern disturbances, gastrointestinal irritability, chronic pelvic pain, menstrual pain or irregularity, pelvic inflammatory disease, multiple yeast infections, sexual dysfunction, <b>premenstrual</b> distress, fibromyalgia, vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, burning during urination, and generalized vaginal pain.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline is {{used for}} a number of conditions, {{including}} major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder (PMDD), panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder (SAD). It has also been used for premature ejaculation and vascular headaches but evidence of the effectiveness in treating those conditions is not robust.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine is {{frequently}} {{used to treat}} major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder, and trichotillomania.

25|$|Paroxetine, {{also known}} by the trade names Paxil and Seroxat among others, is an {{antidepressant}} of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It is used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder. It has also {{been used in the}} treatment of hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause.|$|E
25|$|Up to 80% women {{report having}} some {{symptoms}} prior to menstruation. These symptoms qualify as PMS in 20 to 30% of pre-menopausal women. <b>Premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder (PMDD) {{is a more}} severe form of PMS that has greater psychological symptoms. PMDD affects three to eight percent of pre-menopausal women. Antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors class {{may be used in}} addition to usual measures for in PMDD.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} the menstrual cycle include bloating, lower back pain, abdominal cramps, constipation/diarrhea, swelling or tenderness in the breasts, cyclic acne, and joint or muscle pain, and food cravings. The exact symptoms and their intensity vary significantly from woman to woman, and even somewhat from cycle to cycle and over time. Most women with <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome experience {{only a few of}} the possible symptoms, in a relatively predictable pattern.|$|E
25|$|Fluoxetine, {{also known}} by trade names Prozac and Sarafem among others, is an {{antidepressant}} of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It {{is used for}} the treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia nervosa, panic disorder, and <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder. It may decrease the risk of suicide in those over the age of 65. Fluoxetine has also been used to treat premature ejaculation. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Premenstrual</b> {{syndrome}} (PMS) {{refers to}} {{physical and emotional}} symptoms {{that occur in the}} one to two weeks before a woman's period. Symptoms often vary between women and resolve around the start of bleeding. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes. Often symptoms are present for around six days. A woman's pattern of symptoms may change over time. Symptoms do not occur during pregnancy or following menopause.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} women {{experiencing}} <b>Premenstrual</b> Syndrome, they were either given a placebo beverage or a carbohydrate-rich one. The patients were tested at home; their moods, cognitive performance, and food craving were measured before the consumption of the beverage and 30, 90, and 180 minutes after consumption. The {{results showed that the}} carbohydrate-rich beverage significantly decreased self-reported depression, anger, confusion, and carbohydrate craving 90 to 180 minutes after consumption. Memory word recognition also improved significantly.|$|E
25|$|It is an intermediate-acting {{benzodiazepine}} with a {{slow onset}} of action, so it is usually prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and alcohol withdrawal, and for anxiety associated with depression. Physicians may use oxazepam outside its approved indications to treat social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapists {{who used}} MDMA {{believed}} the drug eliminated the typical fear response and increased communication. Sessions were usually {{held in the}} home of the patient or the therapist. The role therapist was minimized in favor of patient self-discovery accompanied by MDMA induced feelings of empathy. Depression, substance abuse, relationship problems, <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome, and autism were among several psychiatric disorders MDMA assisted therapy was reported to treat. According to psychiatrist George Greer, therapists who used MDMA in their practice were impressed by the results. Anecdotally, MDMA was said to greatly accelerate therapy.|$|E
25|$|Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors, or serotonin-specific re-uptake inhibitor (SSRIs), are a {{class of}} chemical compounds that {{have contributed to the}} major advances as antidepressants where they have revolutionised the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders. The SSRIs are e.g. therapeutically useful in the treatment of panic disorder (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and anorexia. There is also clinical evidence of SSRIs efficiency in the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and their ability to prevent cardiovascular diseases.|$|E
25|$|Topical {{application}} of progesterone {{with the intention}} of systemic therapy should not be equated with local treatment. Despite {{the fact that it is}} not approved for use in menopausal HRT, topical progesterone is registered in some countries under the brand name Progestogel as a 1% gel for direct local application to the breasts to treat <b>premenstrual</b> mastodynia (breast pain). It has been found in clinical studies to inhibit estrogen-induced proliferation of breast epithelial cells and to abolish breast pain and tenderness in women with the condition. The effectiveness of topical progesterone for this indication may be related in part to the fact that the site of {{application of}} topical progesterone has been found to significantly influence its absorption. A study observed a significant increase in serum levels of progesterone when it was applied as a topical ointment to the breasts but not when it was applied to other areas like the thigh or abdomen.|$|E
500|$|Females with <b>premenstrual</b> {{syndrome}} (PMS) report [...] {{changes in}} appetite across the menstrual cycle more than non-sufferers of PMS, possibly {{due to their}} oversensitivity to changes in hormone levels. In women with PMS, food intake is higher in the luteal phase than follicular. The remaining symptoms of PMS, including mood changes and physical symptoms, also occur during the luteal phase. No difference for preference of food types has been found between PMS sufferers and non-sufferers.|$|E
500|$|Yoga {{has been}} studied and may be {{recommended}} to promote relaxation, reduce stress and improve some medical conditions such as <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome. Yoga {{is considered to be}} a low-impact activity that can provide the same benefits as [...] "any well-designed exercise program, increasing general health and stamina, reducing stress, and improving those conditions brought about by sedentary lifestyles". It is particularly promoted as a physical therapy routine, and as a regimen to strengthen and balance all parts of the body.|$|E

2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of bipolar disorder can be complicated by coexisting (comorbid) psychiatric conditions including the following: obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, eating disorders, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder, social phobia, <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome (including <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder), or panic disorder. [...] A careful longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes, enriched if possible by discussions {{with friends and family}} members, is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist.|$|E
2500|$|The formal medical {{description}} of <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome (PMS) {{and the more}} severe, related diagnosis of <b>premenstrual</b> dysphoric disorder (PMDD) goes back at least 70 years to a {{paper presented at the}} New York Academy of Medicine by Robert T. Frank titled [...] "Hormonal Causes of <b>Premenstrual</b> Tension". The specific term <b>premenstrual</b> syndrome appears to date from an article published in 1953 by Dalton and Green in the British Medical Journal. Since then, PMS has been a continuous presence in popular culture, occupying a place that is larger than the research attention accorded it as a medical diagnosis. It has been argued that women are partially responsible for the medicalization of PMS. [...] By legitimizing this disorder, women have contributed to the social construction of PMS as an illness. [...] It has also been suggested that the public debate over PMS and PMDD was impacted by organizations who had a stake in the outcome including feminists, the American Psychiatric Association, physicians and scientists. Until the 1950s, there was little research done surrounding PMS and it was not seen as a social problem. [...] By the 1980s, however, viewing PMS in a social context had begun to take place.|$|E
2500|$|Mild PMS is common, {{and more}} severe {{symptoms}} would qualify as PMDD. PMS is not {{listed in the}} DSM-IV, unlike PMDD. To establish a pattern and determine if it is PMDD, a woman's physician may ask her to keep a prospective record of her symptoms on a calendar {{for at least two}} menstrual cycles. This will help to establish if the symptoms are, indeed, limited to the <b>premenstrual</b> time, predictably recurring, and disruptive to normal functioning. [...] A number of standardized instruments have been developed to describe PMS, including the Calendar of <b>Premenstrual</b> syndrome Experiences (COPE), the Prospective Record of the Impact and Severity of Menstruation (PRISM), and the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).|$|E
2500|$|Black cohosh is {{used today}} mainly as a dietary {{supplement}} marketed to women as remedies for {{the symptoms of}} <b>premenstrual</b> tension, menopause and other gynecological problems. A meta-analysis of contemporary evidence supports these claims, but the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support its use for menopausal symptoms. Study design and dosage of black cohosh preparations {{play a role in}} clinical outcome. An in vitro investigation with pure compounds found in black cohosh identified some beneficial effects of these compounds on physiological pathways underlying [...] osteoporosis.|$|E
