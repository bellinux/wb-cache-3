40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a method to}} model the optical properties over the (400 - 750 nm) spectral range of a dense microalgal culture using the chemical and physical properties of the algal cells. The method {{was based on a}} specific program called AlgaSim coupled with the adding-doubling method: at the individual cell scale, AlgaSim simulates the spectral properties of one model, three-layer spherical algal cell from its size and chemical composition. As a second step, the adding-doubling method makes it possible to retrieve the total transmittance of the algal medium from the optical properties of the individual algal cells. The method was tested by comparing the simulated total transmittance spectra for dense marine microalgal cultures of Isochrysis galbana (small flagellates) and <b>Phaeodactylum</b> <b>tricornutum</b> (diatoms) to spectra measured using an experimental spectrophotometric setup. Our study revealed that the total transmittance spectra simulated for the quasi-spherical cells of Isochrysis galbana were in good agreement with the measured spectra over the whole spectral range. For <b>Phaeodactylum</b> <b>tricornutum,</b> large differences between simulated and measured spectra were observed over the blue part of the transmittance spectra, probably due to non-spherical shape of the algal cells. Prediction of the algal cell density, mean size and pigment composition from the total transmittance spectra measured on algal samples was also investigated using the reversal of the method. Mean cell size was successfully predicted for both species. The cell density was also successfully predicted for spherical Isochrysis galbana, with a relative error below 7 %, but not for elongated <b>Phaeodactylum</b> <b>tricornutum</b> with a relative error up to 26 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Diatoms play {{a decisive}} role in global primary production, {{have a key}} role in the marine food web, and serve as food for the {{industrial}} culture of aquatic animals. In addition, species of diatoms have been chosen as tools for measuring sea water quality and for bioassay procedures. Among them, <b>Phaeodactylum</b> <b>tricornutum</b> (Bohlin) Lewin, 1958, represents a good biological model due to its ease of handling and also to its physiological, genetic and growth characteristics. We investigated the use of the Epifluorescence Microscopy (EPM) to visualize and enumerate P. tricornutum cells and bacteria in cultures containing both kinds of microorganisms. The cell suspension was filtered, stained with SYBR Green and analyzed by EPM. P. tricornutum can be enumerated using EPM with comparable accuracy as using a hemocytometer. The same kind of growth curve is obtained with either method. EPM is an advantageous alternative to the classic light microscope counting method; it allows the simultaneous enumeration of P. tricornutum and bacteria in a single sample, measuring red autofluorescence and green fluorescence respectively.

In this study, a combination of thermoluminescence, chlorophyll fluorescence and P 700 absorbance measurements {{have been used to}} elucidate the effects of iron deficiency in the photosynthetic electron transport of the marine diatom <b>Phaeodactylum</b> <b>tricornutum.</b> Thermoluminescence was used {{to determine the effects of}} iron deficiency on Photosystem II activity. Excitation of iron-replete <b>Phaeodactylum</b> <b>tricornutum</b> cells with single turn-over flashes induced the appearance of thermoluminescence glow curves with two components with different peaks of temperature and contributions to the total signal intensity: the B band (23 ºC, 63 %), and the AG band (40 ºC, 37 %). Iron limitation did not significantly alter these bands, but induced a decrease of the total thermoluminescence signal. Far red excitation did not increase the amount of the AG band in iron-limited cells, as observed for iron-replete cells. The effect of iron deficiency on the photosystem I activity was also examined by measuring the changes in P 700 redox state during illumination. The electron donation to photosystem I was substantially reduced in iron-deficient cells. This could be related with the important decline on cytochrome c 6 content observed in these cells. Iron deficiency also induced a marked increase in light sensitivity in <b>Phaeodactylum</b> <b>tricornutum</b> cells. A drastic increase in the level of peroxidation of chloroplast lipids was detected in iron-deficient cells even when grown under standard conditions at low light intensity.

The results of this work suggest that iron deficiency induces partial blocking of the electron transfer between photosystem II and photosystem I, due to a lower concentration of the electron donor cytochrome c 6.
