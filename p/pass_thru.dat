Another method is to use feedback, which more closely resembles how analog filters with feedback operate. In the case of low pass filters, all these methods tend to give a trade off in getting the signal to pass while attenuating the higher frequency noise. An alternative {{is to use a}} median filter, which selects the mid value of a group of points. While this is not as computationally simple as other filters, it allows for the attenuation of noise while allowing sudden changes in signal level to <b>pass</b> <b>thru</b> unaltered.

40|$|Apple seeds {{will not}} {{germinate}} {{immediately after the}} fruit has become mature enough for picking. It {{is necessary for the}} seed to <b>pass</b> <b>thru</b> a stage of after-ripening. The freshly extracted apple seed contains about 85 percent moisture. At room temperature approximately one-half of the moisture is lost during the first five days. Soaking the seed prior to planting does not increase germination. Ninety-one percent of apple seeds prevented from drying out when they were extracted from the fruit germinated. The best temperature for storage was found to be a temperature between 10 and 30 C. Seeds which had air dried germinated poorly in all cases. Apple seeds which had been air dried and kept for a year did not germinate. Apple seeds may be planted any time after Nov. 1. Where seeds are to be shipped long distances, special precaution must be made to keep the seeds from deteriorating. The seed coat is not a factor in causing delayed germination...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. Much {{attention}} has been given to how to model the price spread since Gardner's important contribution was published in the mid seventies. Most farm-retail price spread studies are applied on agriculture products restricted to domestic trade only. Globalization and weaker trade barriers allow products to reach new markets, {{and at the same time}} impose exchange rate as a new and important factor in the system. This study present a framework on how to model the price spread when farm and retail price are traded in different currencies. The price spread and price linkage relationship is estimated as a system using exchange rate and mark-up costs. The proposed framework is applied on farmed Atlantic salmon using Norwegian farm price and French retail price. The most important results suggests that exchange rate is, as expected, the most important factor; that exchange rate <b>pass</b> <b>thru</b> is not complete, but the law of one price is supported; that a formulation on market efficiency hold; and that changes in farm price are not reflected in the price spread...|$|E

40|$|If we try {{to measure}} the {{backward}} optical diffraction radiation (BODR) of high energy electrons from a conductive slit or a semi infinitive plate, the electron beam will <b>pass</b> <b>thru</b> the bending or steering magnets or magnet lenses before striking the target. The synchrotron radiation (SR) from these magnets can obscure the BODR measurements. An analysis of the properties of SR from these magnets is in this paper presented. A model based on the modified Lenar Wikherd potentials was created, and the SR angular distribution from relativistic electrons in bending and steering magnets for different conditions of radiation in the optical region was calculated. The analysis shows, that for {{the conditions of the}} KEK ATF extraction line, the intensity of SR exceeds that of the backward optical transition radiation (BOTR) from the conducting targets, and it is much lager than the intensity of the BODR. The SR intensity from the steering magnets depends on its tuning and may be comparable to BOTR. Thus, these results it is seen, that the problem of separation of the BODR and SR in the BODR measurements is important. Two methods resolving of this problem is in this article suggested...|$|E
