40|$|To better {{utilize the}} {{sunlight}} for efficient solar energy conversion, {{the research on}} visible-light active photocatalysts has recently attracted a lot of interest. The photosensitization of transition metal oxides is a promising approach for achieving effective visiblelight photocatalysis. This review article primarily discusses the recent progress {{in the realm of}} a variety of nanostructured photosensitizers such as quantum dots, plasmonic metal nanostructures, and carbon nanostructures for coupling with wide-bandgap transition metal oxides to design better visible-light active <b>photocatalysts.</b> The underlying <b>mechanisms</b> of the composite photocatalysts, e. g., the light-induced charge separation and the subsequent visible-light photocatalytic reaction processes in environmental remediation and solar fuel generation fields, are also introduced. A brief outlook on the nanostructure photosensitization is also given...|$|R
40|$|Today {{bituminous}} concrete is {{a conventional}} paving material. Among its advantages one can name dustlessness and noiselessness, fine wear (up to 1 mm a year) and fine maintainability. As the main disadvantages {{of this material}} one can name high slipperiness under humidification, low durability and weather resistance. Besides that, during placement of the bituminous concrete {{a lot of different}} air pollutants are emitted, which are harmful for environment and human’s health (they are listed in the paper according to the US Environmental Protection Agency materials). As an alternative, one can use cement-concrete pavement, which is in many ways more efficient than the bituminous concrete. It is proposed to enhance environmental performance of the cement-concrete pavement via usage of photocatalysis. The mechanism of different photocatalytic reactions is described in the paper, namely heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalysis, photo-induces, photoactivated catalysis and catalytical photoreactions. It is pro-posed to use heterogeneous photocatalysis with titanium dioxide as a <b>photocatalyst.</b> The <b>mechanism</b> of photo oxidation of air contaminants, with the usage of titanium dioxide is 2 described. The paper sets problems, connected with the sensibilization of TiOto thevisible light (it is proposed to use titanium dioxide, doped with the atoms of certain elements to increase its sensibility to the visible light) and with {{the development of a new}} photocatalytic paving concrete, which will meet the requirements, specified for paving in the climatic and traffic conditions of the Russian Federation...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{photocatalytic}} degradation of methylene blue (MB) solution using commercial ZnO and TiO 2 (P 25) photocatalysts, {{in the form of}} slurry and immobilized on glass slides, under ultraviolet (UV) and solar irradiations. The average particle sizes of ZnO and P 25 were 100 nm and 30 nm, respectively. Under both the irradiations, the photocatalytic activities of ZnO and P 25 slurry resulted in better photocatalytic performance than the immobilized photocatalysts. Interestingly, ZnO showed better degradation capability in comparison to P 25 under the solar irradiation. This result revealed that solar light provided a good source of energy to degrade MB in the presence of ZnO. The cyclic voltammetry analysis suggested that the <b>photocatalysts</b> possessed different <b>mechanisms</b> for the degradation of MB. The potential of immobilizing photocatalysts without compromising their performance may lead to easy handling of these materials, resulting in expanding their applications, for example, as a photoanode for photoelectrochemistry...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{employed}} a photocatalytic method {{to restore the}} liquid effluent from a palm oil mill in Malaysia. Specifically, the performance of both TiO 2 and ZnO was compared for the photocatalytic polishing of palm oil mill effluent (POME). The ZnO photocatalyst has irregular shape, bigger in particle size but smaller BET specific surface area (9. 71 m 2 /g) compared to the spherical TiO 2 photocatalysts (11. 34 m 2 /g). Both scavenging study and post-reaction FTIR analysis suggest that the degradation of organic pollutant in the TiO 2 system {{has occurred in the}} bulk solution. In contrast, it is necessary for organic pollutant to adsorb onto the surface of ZnO photocatalyst, before the degradation took place. In addition, the reactivity of both photocatalysts differed in terms of <b>mechanisms,</b> <b>photocatalyst</b> loading and also the density of photocatalysts. From the stability test, TiO 2 was found to offer higher stability, as no significant deterioration in activity was observed after three consecutive cycles. On the other hand, ZnO lost around 30 % of its activity after the 1 st-cycle of photoreaction. The pH studies showed that acidic environment did not improve the photocatalytic degradation of the POME, whilst in the basic environment, the reaction media became cloudy. In addition, longevity study also showed that the TiO 2 was a better photocatalyst compared to the ZnO (74. 12 %), with more than 80. 0 % organic removal after 22 h of UV irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Highly active photocatalysts were {{obtained}} by impregnation of nanocrystalline rutile TiO 2 powders with small amounts of Cu(II) and Fe(III) ions, resulting in the enhancement of initial rates of photocatalytic degradation of 4 -chlorophenol in water by factors of 7 and 4, compared to pristine rutile, respectively. Detailed structural analysis by EPR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) revealed that Cu(II) and Fe(III) are present as single species on the rutile surface. The mechanism of the photoactivity enhancement was elucidated {{by a combination of}} DFT calculations and detailed experimental mechanistic studies including photoluminescence measurements, photocatalytic experiments using scavengers, OH radical detection, and photopotential transient measurements. The results demonstrate that the single Cu(II) and Fe(III) ions act as effective cocatalytic sites, enhancing the charge separation, catalyzing "dark" redox reactions at the interface, thus improving the normally very low quantum yields of UV light-activated TiO 2 <b>photocatalysts.</b> The exact <b>mechanism</b> of the photoactivity enhancement differs depending {{on the nature of the}} cocatalyst. Cu(II) -decorated samples exhibit fast transfer of photogenerated electrons to Cu(II/I) sites, followed by enhanced catalysis of dioxygen reduction, resulting in improved charge separation and higher photocatalytic degradation rates. At Fe(III) -modified rutile the rate of dioxygen reduction is not improved and the photocatalytic enhancement is attributed to higher production of highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals produced by alternative oxygen reduction pathways opened by the presence of catalytic Fe(III/II) sites. Importantly, it was demonstrated that excessive heat treatment (at 450 °C) of photocatalysts leads to loss of activity due to migration of Cu(II) and Fe(III) ions from TiO 2 surface to the bulk, accompanied by formation of oxygen vacancies. The demonstrated variety of mechanisms of photoactivity enhancement at single site catalyst-modified photocatalysts holds promise for developing further tailored photocatalysts for various applications...|$|R
40|$|Studies of {{the optical}} {{properties}} and catalytic capabilities of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag), have {{formed the basis}} for the very recent fast expansion of the field of green photocatalysis: photocatalysis utilizing visible and ultraviolet light, {{a major part of the}} solar spectrum. The reason for this growth is the recognition that the localised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Au NPs and Ag NPs can couple the light flux to the conduction electrons of metal NPs, and the excited electrons and enhanced electric fields in close proximity to the NPs can contribute to converting the solar energy to chemical energy by photon-driven photocatalytic reactions. Previously the LSPR effect of noble metal NPs was utilized almost exclusively to improve the performance of semiconductor photocatalysts (for example, TiO 2 and Ag halides), but recently, a conceptual breakthrough was made: studies on light driven reactions catalysed by NPs of Au or Ag on photocatalytically inactive supports (insulating solids with a very wide band gap) have demonstrated that these materials are a class of efficient <b>photocatalysts</b> working by <b>mechanisms</b> distinct from those of semiconducting photocatalysts. There are several reasons for the significant photocatalytic activity of Au and Ag NPs. (1) The conduction electrons of the particles gain the irradiation energy, resulting in high energy electrons at the NP surface which is desirable for activating molecules on the particles for chemical reactions. (2) In such a photocatalysis system, both light harvesting and the catalysing reaction take place on the nanoparticle, and so charge transfer between the NPs and support is not a prerequisite. (3) The density of the conduction electrons at the NP surface is much higher than that at the surface of any semiconductor, and these electrons can drive the reactions on the catalysts. (4) The metal NPs have much better affinity than semiconductors to many reactants, especially organic molecules. Recent progress in photocatalysis using Au and Ag NPs on insulator supports is reviewed. We focus on the mechanism differences between insulator and semiconductor-supported Au and Ag NPs when applied in photocatalytic processes, and the influence of important factors, light intensity and wavelength, in particular estimations of light irradiation contribution, by calculating the apparent activation energies of photo reactions and thermal reactions...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} {{has been made}} to {{synthesize}} the novel mesoporous Santa-Barbra-Amorphous-spherical shaped (SBA- 15 -S) and Korean Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KIT- 6) mesoporous silica materials by hydrothermal treatment method. Afterward, these samples were used as support materials for synthesis of novel isolated Ti-SBA- 15 -S as well as Ti-KIT- 6 with different Si/Ti (200, 100, 50 ratios) both in dried and calcined forms. Thereafter, the properties of the materials have been characterized through Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) to see the specific surface area, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to observe the surface morphology and microstructures, Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) to see the band gap energies and their corresponding wave lengths, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to investigate the behavior of Ti interaction with mesoporous materials, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was done to observe the elemental composition, empirical formula as well as chemical and electronic states of the elements and Fourier-Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) spectra to observe the Ti interaction to silica and presence of OH groups which {{play a significant role in}} photocatalytic activity. Photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction in Ti-KIT- 6 (Si/Ti= 100) showed better CH 4 production rate (4. 15 μmol•gcat. - 1 •h- 1) than the corresponding Ti-KIT- 6 -dried (2. 63 μmol•gcat. - 1 •h- 1) and the Ti-SBA- 15 -calcined/dried (1. 85, 3. 45 μmol•gcat. - 1 •h- 1, respectively) in the initial photocatalytic reaction of CO 2 to methane. The Ti-KIT- 6 (Si/Ti = 100) material also showed more OH groups, which are useful to obtain a higher production rate of the products, particularly methane, which was even higher than the best commercial TiO 2 (Aeroxide P 25, Evonik Industries AG, Essen, Germany) photocatalyst. In addition, CH 3 OH, H 2 and CO, are the other main fuel products produced by the Ti-KIT- 6 -calcined (Si/Ti= 100) after optimization. The increased surface concentration of OH groups found in the Ti-KIT- 6 -calcined (Si/Ti= 100) than the other two ratios (Si/Ti= 200, 50), the presence of more accessible surface reaction active sites due to the lower numbers of Ti-O-Ti or TiO 2 agglomerates, and the more isolated Ti species which are uniformly dispersed on the 3 -D KIT- 6 mesoporous silica support without collapsing the mesoporous structure, have boosted the higher activity. The photocatalytic activity results of optimized Ti-KIT- 6 calcined Si/Ti = 100 ratio preceded by the competitive adsorption of CO 2 and H 2 O vapors towards other fuel products with 4. 14, 0. 029, 2. 55, 1. 45 µmol g-cat- 1 h- 1 for CH 4, CH 3 OH, H 2, CO, respectively. Similarly, various key parameters including, UV light source (300, 200 W), UV light intensity, H 2 O/CO 2 ratios and catalyst shapes, as well as water vapor effect, and long-term stability have been explored for optimized photocatalyst, which strongly influences the performance of the catalyst towards fuels production. Moreover, another effort was made to synthesize the TiO 2 nanoparticles (TNPs) prepared by sol-gel method and new nanostructured Mesoporous TiO 2 by nanocasting technique or template method using KIT- 6 as a template in order to establish the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 with water vapor. In addition, commercial TiO 2 (Aeroxide P 25) was used for comparison of photoactivity. Thus, the synthesized materials have been characterized by using BET, FE-SEM, XRD, SAXS, and UV-Vis, analyses techniques. TNPs have of an average 11 nm TiO 2 particle size, higher surface area of (151 m 2 /g) as compared to commercial TiO 2 Aeroxide P 25 i. e. (53 m 2 /g) which also demonstrate an enhance adsorption capacity. Furthermore, Meso. TiO 2 has shown a greater surface area (190 m 2 /g) along with mesoporosity with (4 nm) which is much more higher than that of TNPs and also from commercial TiO 2 (Aeroxide P 25). Overall, Meso. TiO 2 was superior in photocataltic activity of CO 2 reduction towards renewable fuel products than that of other TiO 2 s. The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction comparison with titania nanoparticles (TNPs) and Evonik P 25 which showed the improved resuls towards fuel production such as (14. 01, 0. 11, 83. 50, 26. 30 µmol g-cat- 1 h- 1 for CH 4, CH 3 OH, H 2, CO respectively). However, various reaction factors, activation/regeneration of <b>photocatalyst</b> and reaction <b>mechanism</b> and pathways of CO 2 reduction on Meso. TiO 2 have been explored. Finally, nanostructured TiO 2 /KIT- 6 series with (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 90 %) by using different titania wt% have been prepared by precipitation following the sol-gel hydrolysis and condensation of titania precursor dispersed within/surface of the mesoporous silica KIT- 6. The characterization was made by N 2 adsorption/desorption isptherms, FE-SEM, XRD and UV-Vis, analyses techniques to observe the physio-chemical properties of materials and their corelation with photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, screening of the TiO 2 series showed that selectivity toward fuel products depends on the various titania loadings. However, on the basis of our required products (hydrocarbon and H 2, CO) the 20 wt% TiO 2 /KIT- 6 nanocomposite was found to be the optimized photocatalyst with higher photocatalytic products formation than that of other wt% nanocomposites. The photocatalytic activity of CO 2 reduction for 20 wt% TiO 2 /KIT- 6 showed the production for CH 4, CH 3 OH, H 2, CO with 44. 55, 1. 08, 9. 20, and 120 µmol g-cat- 1 h- 1, respectively. Furthermore, the affect of thermal treatment was explored for 20 % TiO 2 /KIT- 6 to observe the change in structure and its corealation with photocatalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism/pathways for CO 2 reduction with H 2 O vapor on TiO 2 /KIT- 6 nanocomposite has also been discusse...|$|R
