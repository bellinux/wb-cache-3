40|$|Abstract: Most of the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>assessments</b> (PSA) for Nuclear Power Plants were {{originally}} created to make conservative {{estimates of the}} core damage frequencies for internal events, which might occur during power operation. The PSA models have then been expanded to replace conservative estimates with more realistic assumptions and to include other types of initiating events, modes of operation and end states. The development has resulted in very large and detailed models, which are hard to understand completely, even for an experienced PSA engineer. Today, the trend to increase the level of detail and {{the scope of the}} PSA models continues as a consequence of regulatory requirements. Hence the Nordic PSA Group (NPSAG) has initiated a project with the aim of identifying methods to reduce the complexity of the PSA models.

The gallium-based PDHRS has replaced the previous sodium-based PDHRS. To evaluate the safety and thermal performance of the gallium-based PDHRS, safety analysis and heat exchanger tests were performed. The safety analysis, using both deterministic and probabilistic analyses methods, confirmed the unique safety feature of the UCFR- 100. The transient analysis for design basis accidents showed the rapid cooling characteristic of the gallium-based PDHRS of the UCFR- 100. In addition, compared with the sodium-based PDHRS, the <b>probabilistic</b> <b>safety</b> analysis, using the level- 1 <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Assessments</b> method, showed the significant decrease of the minimal cut sets and the significant reduction of the failure probability of the gallium-based PDHRS of the UCFR- 100. Finally, compared with the sodium-to-air feature in the sodium-based PDHRS, the gallium-to-water heat exchanger in the gallium-based PDHRS enhanced the heat transfer performance and facilitated economic advantages to the entire system. In conclusion, the gallium-water PDHRS represented risk reduction of the entire reactor system with the effective thermal performance. clos...|$|R

Knowledge gained from their use in improving the TSs for operating nuclear power plants is providing methods and insights for using PSAs at this early stage. Evaluating the safety or the risk significance of the TSs to be defined for an advanced plant encompasses diverse aspects: (a) determining the basic limiting condition for operation (LCO); (b) structuring conditions associated with the LCO; (c) defining completion times (equivalent to allowed outage times in the TS for conventional plants); and, (d) prescribing required actions to be taken within the specified completion times. In this paper, we consider the use of PSA in defining the TSs for an advanced nuclear plant, namely General Electric`s Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR).

40|$|The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) Charter envisions {{the safe}} and {{reliable}} operation of nuclear systems as an essential priority in the development of next-generation systems. Safety and reliability goals broadly consider operations, improved accident management and minimization of consequences, investment protection, and reduced need for off-site emergency response. This emphasis on enhanced safety and reliability has been duly reflected in the Policy Group’s selection of the system designs, as well as in recognition of the need to establish in 2004 a system cross cutting methodology working group on Risk and Safety (RSWG). The group was charged with the responsibility to promote a homogeneous approach to safety and quality in the design of Generation IV systems and define the framework for safety design and evaluation methodology which could be applied to all reactor systems.

Successful calculation of the reliability and ageing of components is critical for forecasting safety and directing preventative maintenance, and <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>assessment</b> for optimum nuclear power plant life management provides a comprehensive review of the theory and application of these methods. Part one reviews probabilistic methods for predicting the reliability of equipment. Following an introduction to key terminology, concepts and definitions, formal-statistical and various physico-statistical approaches are discussed. Approaches based on the use of defect-free models are considered, along with those using binomial distribution and models based on the residual defectiveness of structural materials. The practical applications of probabilistic methods for strength reliability are subsequently explored in part two. Probabilistic methods for increasing the reliability and safety of nuclear power plant components are investigated, as are the use of such methods for optimising non-destructive tests, hydraulic tests, technical certification and planned-preventative maintenance.

A comprehensive review of operating experience from the last ten years has been conducted by the Joint Research Centre with the objective of deriving lessons learned and recommendations useful for nuclear regulatory bodies and utilities alike. This paper is focused on one particular challenge that any nuclear plant faces whenever it plans its next outage period: how to manage the configuration of all systems under a complex environment involving numerous concurrent activities, and how to make sure that systems are returned to their valid configuration before the plant resumes power operation. This study highlights the importance of conveying accurate but synthesized information on the status of the plant to the operators in the main control room. Many of the lessons learned are related to the alarm display in the control room and to the use of check lists to control the status of systems.

40|$|Abstract: Modelling {{fission product}} (FP) {{behaviour}} during severe light-water reactor accidents covers a considerable diversity of phenomena such as solid-state diffusion, high temperature chemistry, aerosol physics and radioiodine chemistry. Over {{a number of}} years IPSN developed computer codes for modelling FP behaviour where, now, improved versions of these are included in the integral code ASTEC, jointly developed by GRS and IPSN. Whereas ASTEC models a whole accident sequence, this paper describes just its FP modules: ELSA for release from the core, SOPHAEROS for radionuclide transport in the reactor coolant system and IODE for radioiodine behaviour in the containment building. The approaches used aim to provide reliable indications of FP behaviour without excessive calculation times. This said, the degree to which modelling is simplified to render calculations faster must be compatible with the level of confidence required in the predictions. Based on results of validation campaigns of the FP models in ASTEC V 0 and in the context of needs arising from analyses for <b>probabilistic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>assessments,</b> further essential modelling improvements are being made for integration in ASTEC V 1. Recent enhancement of ELSA has improved prediction of semi-volatile FP (e. g., Ba, Sr, Mo, etc.) release from solid fuel and included release models for degraded-core geometries and control rod materials. Enhancement of SOPHAEROS concerns improved numerical efficiency, addition of a new, comprehensive thermochemistry database and inclusion of a pool scrubbing module.

40|$|The Parametric Source Term (PST) {{software}} allows {{estimation of}} radioactivity release fractions for Level 2 <b>Probabilistic</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Assessments</b> (PSAs). PST was {{developed at the}} Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission`s (NRC`s) Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) Program. PST contains a framework of equations that model activity transport between volumes in the release pathway from the core, through the vessel, through the containment, and to the environment. PST quickly obtains exact solutions to differential equations for activity transport in each volume for each time interval. PST provides a superior method for source term estimation because it: ensures conservation of activity transported across various volumes in the release pathway; provides limited consideration of the time-dependent behavior of input parameter uncertainty distributions; allows input to be quantified using state-of-the-art severe accident analysis code results; increases modeling flexibility because linkage between volumes is specified by user input; and allows other types of Light Water Reactor (LWR) plant designs to be evaluated with minimal modifications. PST is a microcomputer-based system that allows the analyst more flexibility than a mainframe system. PST has been developed to run with both MS DOS and MS Windows 95 /NT operating systems. PST has the capability to load ASP Source Term Vector (STV) information, import pre-specified default input for the 6 Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) initially analyzed in the NRC ASP program, allow input value modifications for release fraction sensitivity studies, export user-specified default input for the LWR being modeled, report results of radioactivity release calculations at each time interval, and generate formatted results that can interface with other risk assessment codes.
