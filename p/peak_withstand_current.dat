40|$|Power devices {{intended}} for high-voltage systems must be tested according to international standards, {{which includes the}} short-time withstand current test and <b>peak</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>current</b> test. However, these tests require very special facilities which consume huge amounts of electrical power. Therefore, mathematical tools to simulate such tests are highly appealing since they allow reproducing the electromagnetic and thermal behavior of the test object in a fast and economical manner. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element method (3 D-FEM) approach to simulate the transient thermal behavior of substation connectors is presented and validated against experimental data. To this end, a multiphysics 3 D-FEM method is proposed, which considers both the connector and the reference power conductors. The transient and steady-state temperature profiles of both the conductors and connector provided by the 3 D-FEM method prove its suitability and accuracy as compared to experimental data provided by short-circuit tests conducted in two high-current laboratories. The proposed simulation tool, which was proven to be accurate and realistic, may be particularly useful during the design and optimization phases of substation connectors since it allows anticipating the results of mandatory laboratory tests.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to study the individual and combined effects of current velocity and substratum composition on the waterlouse Asellus aquaticus (L.). Both factors affected growth, mortality, behavior, and food consumption of A. aquaticus. Short-term effects of increasing current velocity depended {{on the type of}} substratum. Critical current velocity for detachment was almost the same on sand as on a polished surface whereas on gravel A. aquaticus could <b>withstand</b> higher <b>current</b> velocities by hiding in interstitial spaces. Long-term experiments with different combinations of current velocity and substratum composition showed that current velocity had a greater effect than substratum on survival and growth. Substratum, however, had a greater influence on the distribution of individuals in the experimental units. Since growth was reduced at high current velocity and no changes in levels of food intake were observed it is concluded that a substantial amount of energy is required for <b>withstanding</b> <b>current</b> at higher flow rates. Furthermore, mortality showed a strong inverse correlation to growth.

40|$|Limiting {{resistors}} {{are currently}} {{required to be}} connected in series with tantalum capacitors {{to reduce the risk}} of surge current failures. However, application of limiting resistors decreases substantially the efficiency of the power supply systems. An ideal surge current limiting device should have a negligible resistance for DC currents and high resistance at frequencies corresponding to transients in tantalum capacitors. This work evaluates the possibility of using chip ferrite beads (FB) as such devices. Twelve types of small size FBs from three manufacturers were used to evaluate their robustness under soldering stresses and at high surge current spikes associated with transients in tantalum capacitors. Results show that FBs are capable to <b>withstand</b> <b>current</b> pulses that are substantially greater than the specified current limits.

40|$|A 1. 2 -kV/ 24 -A SiC-MOSFET and a 1. 2 -kV/ 30 -A Si-Insulated gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) have been electrothermally stressed in unclamped inductive switching conditions at different ambient temperatures ranging from - 25 Â°C to 125 Â°C. The devices have been stressed with avalanche currents at their rated currents and 40 % higher. The {{activation of the}} parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT) during avalanche mode conduction results from the increased body resistance causing a voltage drop between the source and body, greater than the emitter-base voltage of the parasitic BJT. Because the BJT current and temperature relate through a positive feedback mechanism, thermal runaway results {{in the destruction of}} the device. It is shown that the avalanche power sustained before the destruction of the device increases as the ambient temperature decreases. SiC MOSFETs are shown to be able to <b>withstand</b> avalanche <b>currents</b> equal to the rated forward current at 25 Â°C, whereas IGBTs cannot sustain the same electrothermal stress. SiC MOSFETs are also shown to be capable of <b>withstanding</b> avalanche <b>currents</b> 40 % above the rated forward current though only at reduced temperatures.

Various partitioning configurations were examined to determine the most advantageous one for performance and feasibility. Apart from throughput, partitioning proved to be beneficial also for power.

Ideally, leakage-resilient systems <b>withstand</b> <b>current</b> and future attacks; restoring {{confidence in the}} secu-rity of implemented cryptographic systems. Understanding the relation between classes of leakage functions is an important aspect. In this work, we consider the memory leakage model, where the leak-age class contains functions over the systemâs entire secret state. Standard classes include functions with bounded output length, functions that re-tain (pseudo) entropy in the secret, and functions that leave the secret computationally unpredictable. Standaert, Pereira, and Yu (Crypto, 2013) introduced {{a new class of}} leakage functions they call simulatable leakage. A leakage function is simulatable if a simulator can produce indistinguishable leakage without access to the true secret state. We extend their notion to general appli-cations and consider two versions. For weak simulatability: the simulated leakage must be indistinguishable from the true leakage in the presence of public information. For strong simulatability, this requirement must also hold when the distinguisher has access to the true secret state. We show the following: â¢ Weakly simulatable functions retain computational unpredictability. â¢ Strongly simulatability functions retain pseudoentropy. â¢ There are bounded length functions that are not weakly simulatable. â¢ There are weakly simulatable functions that remove pseudoentropy. â¢ There are leakage functions that retain computational unpredictabil-ity are not weakly simulatable...|$|R
