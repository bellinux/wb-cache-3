50|$|The colonial badge was in use since 1843 in {{one version}} or another {{until it was}} {{replaced}} by the coat of arms granted in 1959. Throughout several revisions, the idea of the badge remained. It depicted three merchants and a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> on a wharf on the left in the foreground. In the background there was a square-rigged ship and a Chinese junk in the harbour backed by conical hills. Above was the royal arms of the United Kingdom.|$|R

Several long booms extend {{over the}} deck of the ship, and many port holes are visible along the hull. A two-story cement building is visible at right, and an overhead gangplank goes from the ship to the mezzanine corridor of the transit shed.

60|$|Big lights {{hung from}} the room of the long shed, but did not pierce the gloom that lurked between the <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> A flock <b>of</b> sheep, moving in a dense woolly mass, came down a gangway; {{squealing}} pigs occupied a bay across the <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> goods. The front of the shed was open and in places one saw a faint reflection that looked like water. Opposite Barbara, {{the gap between the}} low roof and dock-sill was filled by a deckhouse and a steamer's funnel. Steam blew across the opening farther on, and in the vapor bales and boxes shot up and rattling chains plunged down. Through the roar of the winches she heard coarse shouts and the bellowing of cattle.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{features}} some gameplay {{elements that}} resemble features in other first-person shooters. The heads-up display (HUD) shows the player character's helmet, with a tactical visor. The player acts {{as leader of}} a squad of four elite troops. The squadmate order system allows the player general tactical control over the three non-player characters (NPCs) squadmates that round out the four-man commando team. Many objects in the game environment will highlight when the crosshair is placed over them. The player can then press the use key to issue an order automatically associated with the object; for example, a sealed door may highlight with a synchronized team breach-and-clear command, or a computer console might give have a [...] "slice" [...] (computer hacking) command, while a <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> boxes suitable for a cover position with good vantage may provide a [...] "take up Sniper/Anti-Armor position" [...] command. Where possible, the squadmates will usually take their preferred roles (sniper, demolitions and technical). The player can also order the squad to move to secure any position (wherever the crosshair is pointed), or perform search-and-destroy. Also, there are orders to command the squadmates to group up or spread out according to the player's discretion for the situation.|$|R
6000|$|A stupid job, and fit {{only for}} an old man, my comrades used to tell me, to be the night-watchman of a captive (though honoured) ship. And {{generally}} {{the oldest of the}} able seamen in a ship's crew does get it. But sometimes neither the oldest nor any other fairly steady seaman is forthcoming. Ships' crews had the trick of melting away swiftly in those days. So, probably on account of my youth, innocence, and pensive habits (which made me sometimes dilatory in my work about the rigging), I was suddenly nominated, in our chief mate Mr. B-'s most sardonic tones, to that enviable situation. I do not regret the experience. The night humours of the town descended from the street to the waterside in the still watches of the night: larrikins rushing down in bands to settle some quarrel by a stand-up fight, away from the police, in an indistinct ring half hidden by <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo,</b> with the sounds of blows, a groan now and then, the stamping of feet, and the cry of [...] "Time!" [...] rising suddenly above the sinister and excited murmurs; night-prowlers, pursued or pursuing, with a stifled shriek followed by a profound silence, or slinking stealthily along-side like ghosts, and addressing me from the quay below in mysterious tones with incomprehensible propositions. The cabmen, too, who twice a week, on the night when the A.S.N. Company's passenger-boat was due to arrive, used to range a battalion of blazing lamps opposite the ship, were very amusing in their way. They got down from their perches and told each other impolite stories in racy language, every word of which reached me distinctly over the bulwarks as I sat smoking on the main-hatch. On one occasion I had an hour or so of a most intellectual conversation with a person whom I could not see distinctly, a gentleman from England, he said, with a cultivated voice, I on deck and he on the quay sitting on the case of a piano (landed out of our hold that very afternoon), and smoking a cigar which smelt very good. We touched, in our discourse, upon science, politics, natural history, and operatic singers. Then, after remarking abruptly, [...] "You seem to be rather intelligent, my man," [...] he informed me pointedly that his name was Mr. Senior, and walked off--to his hotel, I suppose. Shadows! Shadows! I think I saw a white whisker as he turned under the lamp-post. It is a shock to think that in the natural course of nature he must be dead by now. There was nothing to object to in his intelligence but a little dogmatism maybe. And his name was Senior! Mr. Senior! ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{gives an}} account of the results of working out a {{generalized}} dynamic model <b>of</b> fixation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads jointly with flexible and thrust elements. Working out a generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> fixation is rather a complicated problem not in the sense of solving differential equations systems but in the sense of presenting them as a complex mechanical system “cargo – pads – flexible elements – thrust bars”. Generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads observed that this model represents technology of joint work of flexible and thrust fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> on rolling stock.

5000|$|Consider two players: Alice and Bob. Alice moves first. At {{the start}} of the game, Alice has two <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> coins in front <b>of</b> her: one <b>pile</b> {{contains}} 4 coins and the other pile contains 1 coin.
