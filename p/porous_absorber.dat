40|$|A Kundt's tube {{was used}} to measure the sound {{absorption}} of a porous fibreous plaster for different thicknesses and surface smoothnesses. Measurements were also done with the plaster in a multi layer absorbing system together with a layer of air and <b>porous</b> <b>absorber</b> backed by a hard wall. Frequencies up to 4 kHz was included and the results compared to an empirical model by Delany and Bazely. This model predicts the acoustical impedance of isotropic homogenous materials made of fibers from two parameters, the flow resistivity and frequency. The flow resistivity for the plaster was determined to 400 x 10 3 (Ns/m 4) by curve fitting between measured values and the model and then used for optimize the thickness of an air layer in a three layer absorber. It was found that an air layer of 10 - 20 cm closest to the hard surface in a multilayer plaster/absorber/air/hard backing absorber increases low frequency absorption. If the plaster is applied directly on a hard suface a thicker layer absorbs sound better than a thin. When applied on a underlayer of <b>porous</b> <b>absorber</b> a thin layer is better.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of nuisance noise and {{the removal of}} unwanted sound modes within a room or component enclosure-are accomplished through the use of acoustic absorbers. Sound absorption can be achieved through conversion of the kinetic energy associated with pressure waves, into heat energy via viscous dissipation. This occurs within open porous materials, or by utilising resonant effects produced using simple cavity and orifice configurations. The manufacture of traditional <b>porous</b> and resonant <b>absorbers</b> is commonly realised using basic manufacturing techniques. These techniques restrict the geometry of a given resonant construction, and limit the configuration of <b>porous</b> <b>absorbers.</b> The aim of this work is to exploit new and emerging capabilities of Rapid Manufacturing (RM) to produce components with geometrical freedom, and apply it to the development of broadband acoustic absorption. New and novel absorber geometric configurations are identified and their absorption performance is determined. The capabilities and limitations of RM processes in reproducing these configurations are demonstrated. The geometric configuration of RM resonant absorbers is investigated. Cavity modifications aimed at damping the resonant effect by restricting the motion of cavity air, and adding increased viscous resistance are explored. Modifications relating to cavity shape, the addition of internal perforations and increased cavity surface area have all been shown to add acoustic resistance, thereby increasing the bandwidth of absorption. Decreasing the hydraulic radius of the cavity cross section and reducing internal feature dimensions provide improved resistance over conventional configurations.

40|$|Fossil energy {{carriers}} may {{be replaced}} {{in the future}} by hydrogen to save fossil resources and to avoid emission of carbon dioxide. To achieve this, a technology for a sustainable and environmentally friendly mass production of hydrogen is needed. A promising way is {{the application of a}} thermochemical cycle with solar heat as the energy source offering potentially higher efficiency and economical advantages over other processes. Especially, the Hybrid Sulfur Cycle is a promising candidate for the solar production of hydrogen from water. A key step in this process is the highly endothermic decomposition of sulfuric acid at temperatures between 800 °C and 1200 °C. This reaction can be carried out in a receiver-reactor which is irradiated with concentrated solar radiation from a heliostat field. To investigate this process a test reactor was developed and built. The reaction takes place on the surface of a catalytically coated <b>porous</b> <b>absorber</b> irradiated through a quartz pane of the receiver-reactor. The reactor contains two chambers with two different porous absorbers to transform the solar radiation into heat. The first absorber is a ceramic foam which enables the evaporation of the liquid H 2 SO 4. The second absorber is a parallel channel monolith with a catalyst coating dedicated for the SO 3 -dissociation. Experiments with the test reactor were carried out in DLR’s solar furnace in Cologne. Firstly the feasibility of a solar decomposition of sulfuric acid in a <b>porous</b> <b>absorber</b> reactor was investigated and proven. Then the reactor was qualified at different operating points and with different catalyst coatings. Finally, the receiver-reactor and strategy of operation was stepwise improved with respect to chemical conversion and reactor efficiency. Several test series were performed with variation of the absorber temperature, the mass flow and the dilution rate. Mass flow of sulfuric acid, space velocity, and the absorber temperature were identified and quantified as parameters with the most relevant influence on chemical conversion and reactor efficiency. The operation behavior observed and the detailed knowledge of dependencies of different operation parameters assist in evaluating the potential of scaling up the described technology. ...|$|E
