In response to the report, Crew initiated due <b>process</b> <b>procedures</b> to determine disciplinary action for the administrators involved. Crew was later blamed for organizing efforts to remove independent oversight and engaging in a campaign to have Stancik removed by accusing him of exaggerating his reports saying they were overly dramatic and adversely affected the school system.|$|E

A properly designed system will provide a high degree of assurance that every step, process, and change has been properly evaluated before its implementation. Testing a sample of a final product is not considered sufficient evidence that every product within a batch meets the required specification.|$|E

50|$|The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 and {{the state}} laws passed in pursuance thereof “zero tolerance” laws, must afford {{the maximum amount of}} {{procedural}} due process to the student who are expelled for bringing a weapon to school. The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 makes no mention or provision for procedural due process, except to make a provision for adherence to the Individual with Disabilities Education Act. States lack uniformity in the procedural process prior to the one-year expulsion. Some states, such as West Virginia, offer formal procedural due <b>process</b> <b>procedures,</b> while others, such as Utah, offer limited procedural due process. Procedural due process further requires that orderly and legally defensible procedural steps be employed in depriving students. The U.S. Supreme Court determined in Goss v. Lopez that students facing suspensions of up to 10 days or less were entitled to oral or written notice of charges, an explanation of evidence to be used against them and an opportunity to present their side of the issue. Another concern expressed was that it would fail to reach private schools that do not receive federal support and would therefore fail to achieve its goal.|$|E

In December 2012, Justice Nizamul Huq resigned when Skype recorded emails between the justice and Ahmed Ziauddin that compromised the fairness of the tribunal were revealed on YouTube and in publications such as The Economist and Amar Desh. Elsewhere in the media, Bergman has criticised the due <b>process</b> <b>procedures</b> of the International Crimes Tribunal as flawed. He has been critical of the tribunal's due process and principles in following rule of law. Bangladesh's tribunal raised a further contempt charge against Bergman in April 2014 concerning three articles he had published on his blog about the court. At issue is his writings about how many people died during the Bangladesh Liberation War with the court using the official figure of three million and Bergman saying that number is disputed by evidence. He was convicted by that court at the end of 2014, where it was proclaimed that he [...] "hurt the feelings of the nation." ...|$|E

'A couple of weeks after Kompass was put on administrative leave on April 27, a U.N. administrative tribunal reversed the decision to place Kompass on leave.'(...) 'In one email, Lapointe bypassed the standard procedure of convening a panel of experts to determine whether an investigation has merit. Instead, she told her chief investigator that the case was too politically sensitive to convene a panel of investigators to consider its merits. In another email, she expressed a certain confidence that Kompass had been in fault.' (...) 'The decision to bypass her own office procedures prompted her chief investigator, Michael Stefanovic, to recuse himself from the probe, which he said had violated U.N. due <b>process</b> <b>procedures.</b> In a dramatic closed-door May 13 briefing before the U.N. General Assembly’s key budget committee, Stefanovic accused his boss of committing an “abuse of authority” and said that he had filed a formal complaint before the United Nations.

5000|$|Native American groups often enslaved war captives {{whom they}} {{primarily}} used for small-scale labor. Others however, {{were used in}} ritual sacrifice, usually involving torture as part of religious rites, and these sometimes involved ritual cannibalism. There {{is little evidence that}} the slaveholders considered the slaves as racially inferior; they came from other Native American tribes and were casualties of war. Native Americans did not buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for redeeming their own members. Most of these so-called Native American slaves tended to live on the fringes of Native American society and were slowly integrated into the tribe. The word [...] "slave" [...] may not accurately apply to such captive people, for all the Iroquoian peoples (not just the Iroquois tribes) adopted captives, but for religious reasons, there was a <b>process,</b> <b>procedures</b> and many seasons when such adoptions were delayed until the proper spiritual times. Such delayed adoptees, were held to add to the spiritual power of the clan group, and while performing forced labor as part of their ritual rebirth, were actually the antithesis of slaves in the white mans world.|$|E
