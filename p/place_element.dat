It is argued here that the velars-empty elements connection is a promising line of thinking, but certain adjustments are needed to correctly interpret that connection. The ultimate conclusion is that velars only refer to the place elements I and U for phonological operations, that is, these only can be evoked on occasion, while any other independent velar <b>place</b> <b>element</b> is superfluous...|$|E

40|$|Nouns meaning ‘place, region’ and ‘part’ are {{compounded}} in Kannada with a `bleached’ noun (a putative postposition) to form AxPart and Part readings. As {{in other}} languages, the AxPart or ‘region’ reading does not pluralize, {{does not permit}} adjectival modification, and allows for MeasureP modification (unlike the part reading). AxParts may also be formed out of nouns by the fusion of a dative marker or a genitive marker with the N; these case markers introduce the <b>Place</b> <b>element.</b> The dative case may be optionally overt (e. g. pakka-kke ‘side-dative,’ ‘to a side’), or covert (in AxParts like munde ‘front’). The genitive marker gives a sense of immediate adjacency that we designate the NextPart reading. Interestingly, the dative and genitive cases in Kannada also allow nouns to assume the function of predicative and attributive adjectives...|$|E

Virtual reality can be utilized to control remote robot for pick and <b>place</b> <b>element.</b> The operator monitored and controlled the situation information of working site by Human Machine Interface. Therefore, we worked in harsh or dangerous environments that thing can be avoided. The procedure to operate mobile robot in virtual reality describes as follow: An experiment site with really experimental equipment is first established. Then, the experimental equipment and scene modeling are input to virtual reality for establishing a environment similar to the reality. Finally, the remote mobile robot is controlled to operate pick and place tasks through wireless communication by the object operation in virtual reality. The robot consists of a movable robot platform and robotic arm. The virtual reality is constructed by EON software; the Human Machine Interface is established by Visual Basic. The wireless connection is equipped the wireless Bluetooth, which is set the PC and PLC controller. With experimental tests to verify the robot in virtual reality and the wireless remote control, the robot could be operated and controlled to successfully complete pick and place tasks in reality by Human Machine Interface...|$|E
40|$|El mundo naval está muy presente en la vida de Jørn Utzon desde su infancia, no sólo por haber nacido en un país de gran cultura naval como Dinamarca, sino porque vivió desde dentro la profesión de su padre como diseñador de barcos. Su atención al horizonte y el sol es {{inevitable}} como navegante que también fue. El sol como elemento del lugar, y al que hasta ahora no se había prestado la importancia que tiene en su obra, es un elemento trascendente en sus casas. El presente artículo profundiza en esta relación entre Jørn Utzon y el sol, a través de su vocación de navegante. The naval {{world was}} present in Utzon’s life from his childhood, not only for being born in {{a country in which}} the most distant point from the coast is sixty kilometres away and in which almost every family has a boat to sail at leisure time, but also because he lived so close to his father’s engineering profession, and the shipyard boisterous atmosphere. The way he pays attention to sun and horizon is inevitable as the sailor he was. This is the reason why Utzon looks curiously to the place in a broad way, looking for relations between place and architecture. Architecture was one of his passions, maybe the most powerful, but only one more. Architecture channelled the other concerns about navigation, nature, cosmos [...] . His well known travels around the world to Mexico, USA, Morocco, Middle East and Japan, contribute to his knowledge {{about the importance of the}} place in architecture, as well as knowing cultures adaptation mechanism to the specific environment, for instance this is the case of Morocco desert cities: “ But all the building complexes that have really inspired me –the desert cities in Morocco, for example– have been pushed into position in relation to the place, and in relation to the sun. Then they take on the character that the old cities or Greek temples have” Jørn Utzon. The sun as a <b>place</b> <b>element,</b> that hasn’t been researched the Utzon’s projects, is a transcendent element in his houses. His two houses in Spain, and several built in Denmark, are oriented in an accurate way in relation to the sun. This paper explores the relationship between Jørn Utzon and the sun, through his vocation as a sailor...|$|E

It {{is believed that}} the phenomena collected {{from a number of}} languages follow from the internal structure of velar segments. These alternations reveal that any independent <b>place</b> <b>elements</b> are superfluous in the phonological expression of velars. It will be shown that a highly constrained theory of skeletal structure (VC Phonology), and an equally constrained theory of elemental composition (tier geometry), can account for the facts.
