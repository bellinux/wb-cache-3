Assuming that alloparenting evolved as an adaptive response {{to the demands of}} the environment, I was interested in exploring how alloparenting behaviour changes with drastic changes in the local ecology of a population. I describe infant care-taking practices in a rural, traditionally living Toba population and in a peri-urban Toba population that is changing from a traditional foraging to a market economy lifestyle. The mother is the primary caretaker in both cases. However, the mothers engage other individuals in childcare more often in the rural population than in the peri-urban one. In the rural population, grandmothers and sisters are actively involved in allomothering. The infant was observed in allomother contact about 60 % of the observation time. In contrast, peri-urban Toba babies spend almost 80 % of their time in direct contact with their mothers. Here, husbands are the primary alternative caretakers, followed by sisters and grandmothers. This <b>peri-urban</b> <b>population</b> is undergoing a drastic lifestyle change, with important demographic, nutritional, and epidemiological consequences. In response to a less demanding subsistence lifestyle and a changing social context, alloparenting practices have changed.

40|$|This {{study of}} the costs, quality and {{financial}} equity of primary health services in Ecuador, based on 1985 data, examines three assumptions, common in international health, concerning Ministry of Health (MOH) and Social Security (SS) programs. The assumptions are that MOH services are less costly than SS services, that they are of lower quality than SS services, and that MOH programs are more equitable {{in terms of the}} distribution of funds available for PHC among different population groups. Full costs of a range of primary health services were estimated by standard accounting techniques for 15 typical health care establishments, 8 operated by the MOH and 7 by the rural SS program (RSSP), serving rural and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>populations</b> in the two major geographical regions of Ecuador. Consistent with the conventional premise, MOH average costs were much lower than RSSP costs for several important types of services, especially those provided by physicians. Little difference was found for dental care. The lower MOH physician service costs appeared to be attributable primarily to lower personnel compensation (only partially offset by lesser productivity) and to greater economies of scope. Several measures of the quality of care were applied, with varying results. Based on staff differences and patterns of expenditures on resource inputs, notably drugs, RSSP quality appeared higher, as assumed. However, contrary to expectation, a questionnaire assessment of staff knowledge and procedures favored the MOH for quality. Program equity was judged in terms of per capita budgeted expenditures (additional measures, such as the likelihood of receiving necessary care, would have required household survey data {{beyond the scope of this}} program-based study). The results support the assumption of greater MOH financial equity, as its program reveals less variation in budgeted expenditures between different population groups covered. Additional evidence of equity, using other indicators, would be helpful in future research. The paper's findings have policy implications not only for Ecuador's health sector but also for policy-makers in other countries at similar levels of socioeconomic development. These implications are spelled out in order to guide officials wrestling with issues of efficiency, quality, and equity as they search for the best use of scarce resources to promote health. costs efficiency equity quality...|$|R

Knowledge of the spatial {{distribution}} of HIV outcomes is vital so that appropriate public health interventions can be directed at locations most in need. In this regard, spatial clustering analysis of HIV-related mortality events has not been performed in a rural sub-Saharan African setting. Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic was used to identify HIV-related and all-cause mortality clusters (p< 0. 05) in a population-based demographic surveillance survey in rural KwaZulu Natal, South Africa (2000 - 2006). The analysis was split pre (2000 - 2003) and post (2004 - 2006) rollout of antiretroviral therapy, respectively. Between 2000 - 2006 a total of 86, 175 resident individuals ≥ 15 years of age were under surveillance and 5, 875 deaths were recorded (of which 2, 938 were HIV-related) over 343, 060 person-years of observation (crude all-cause mortality rate 17. 1 / 1000). During both time periods a cluster of high HIV-related (RR =  1. 46 / 1. 51, p =  0. 001) and high all-cause mortality (RR =  1. 35 / 1. 38, p =  0. 001) was identified in peri-urban communities near the National Road.

For the first time, this study evaluates the different mangrove resources in and around Banjul (i. e., timber, non-timber, edible, and ethnomedicinal products) and their utilization patterns, including the possibility of ecotourism development. The questionnaire-based results have indicated that more than 80 % of <b>peri-urban</b> <b>population</b> rely on mangroves for timber and non-timber products and consider them as very important for their livelihoods. However, at the same time, urban households demonstrate limited knowledge on mangrove species and their ecological/economic benefits. Among others, fishing (including the oyster—Crassostrea cf. gasar collection) and tourism are the major income-generating activities found in the TWNP. The age-old practices of agriculture {{in some parts of}} the TWNP are due to scarcity of land available for agriculture, increased family size, and alternative sources of income. The recent focus on ecotourism (i. e., boardwalk construction inside the mangroves near Banjul city) received a positive response from the local stakeholders (i. e., users, govern-ment, and non-government organizations), with their appropriate roles in sharing the revenue, rights, and responsibilities of this project.

40|$|Introduction: Out-of-pocket (OOP) {{payments}} {{are the principal}} source of health care finance in most Asian countries, and India is no exception. Availability and accessibility {{of the health care}} are important for the overall health status of any community. Aim: To assess the proportion of monthly family income spent on medical and dental expenses. Materials and Methods: A door to door survey was conducted in Govinpuri ward of Modinagar using dual stage random sampling. A 14 -item open-ended questionnaire was used, which was filled by the investigator by interviewing the head of the family. Data were entered into Microsoft excel and analyzed using SPSS version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results: A total of 101 families were included in the study. The major amount of the monthly family income was spent on medical treatment as compared to dental treatment. The average OOP expenditure on the dental and medical treatment was 2135. 94 ± 656. 8 international normalized ratio (INR) and 8771. 28 ± 1056. 43 INR (P = 0. 038), respectively. Medical insurance formed a substantial proportion of the monthly family expenditure as compared to dental insurance (P = 0. 023). The total medical expenses were 13. 21 %, and dental expenses were 8. 84 % of family income. Conclusion: The present study revealed that the family expenditure on medical and dental treatments differs significantly among the <b>peri-urban</b> <b>population</b> of Modinagar.

Tampon-collected specimens can be tested using molecular methods, but this type of self-screening has not been properly evaluated as a screening method in South Africa before. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing of self-collected tampons as a screening method in an urban and <b>peri-urban</b> <b>population</b> in Gauteng by comparing the results with the current standard of conventional cytology. In addition, HPV prevalence, type, distribution and incidence of cytological abnormalities in this population are described. METHOD: Seven hundred and twenty women attending public healthcare facilities in and around Tshwane, Gauteng province, were invited to participate. The women collected a tampon sample for molecular testing, and were then screened by healthcare workers collecting a conventional cervical cytology smear. HPV testing was undertaken using the Linear Array® HPV Genotyping Test (Roche Molecular Systems). RESULTS: Data for analysis were available for 631 women. Three hundred and fifty-four (58 %) were positive for highrisk HPV, while (15. 4 %) had an abnormal cytology result. Women aged 30 - 39 years had the highest prevalence of both high-risk HPV (75 %) and abnormal cytology (22 %). Infection with multiple types was common. Higherrisk viruses were not over-represented in, and no dramatic decrease in HPV prevalence was observed in, older women. Cytological abnormalities were detected in only 3. 74 % of women who tested negative for high-risk HPV, but were found in 24. 2 % of high-risk HPV positive women. CONCLUSION: HPV testing on self-collected tampon samples was feasible, highly sensitive and demonstrated a high negative predictive value for current cytological abnormalities in this population.

50|$|The US State Department {{notes that}} the United States Government {{channels}} its development assistance to Bolivia through USAID. USAID {{is well known in}} Bolivia, especially in rural areas where thousands of projects have been implemented. USAID has been providing assistance to Bolivia since the 1960s and works with the Government of Bolivia, the private sector, and the Bolivian people to achieve equitable and sustainable development. USAID/Bolivia provides about $85 million annually in development assistance through bilateral agreements with the Bolivian Government and unilateral agreements with other organizations. USAID programs are implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector, and the Bolivian Government. USAID's programs support Bolivia's National Development Plan and are designed to address key issues, such as poverty and the social exclusion of historically disadvantaged populations, focusing efforts on Bolivia's <b>peri-urban</b> and rural <b>populations.</b> USAID's programs in Bolivia strengthen democratic institutions; provide economic opportunities for disadvantaged populations through business development and trade; improve family health; promote sustainable use of natural resources and biodiversity conservation; provide farmers alternatives to illicit coca cultivation; and improve food security.|$|R
40|$|Chlamydial disease {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the main factors threatening the long-term survival of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Despite this, large epidemiological studies of chlamydial infection and disease in wild koala populations are lacking. A better understanding of the prevalence, transmission and pathogenesis is needed to improve control measures, such as the development of vaccines. We investigated the prevalence of Chlamydia pecorum infection and disease in 160 koalas in a <b>peri-urban</b> wild <b>population</b> in Queensland, Australia and found that 31 % of koalas were Chlamydia PCR positive and 28 % had clinically detectable chlamydial disease. Most infections were at the urogenital site (27 %; both males and females) with only 14 % at the ocular site. Interestingly, we found that 27 % (4 / 15) of koalas considered to be sexually immature (9 - 13 months) were already infected with C. pecorum, suggesting that a significant percentage of animals are infected directly from their mother. Ocular infection levels were less prevalent with increasing age (8 % in koalas older than 4 years), whereas the prevalence of urogenital tract infections remained high into older age (26 % in koalas older than 4 years), suggesting that, after mother-to-young transmission, C. pecorum is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection. While 28 % of koalas in this population had clinically detectable chlamydial disease (primarily urogenital tract disease), many PCR positive koalas had no detectable disease and importantly, not all diseased animals were PCR positive. We also observed higher chlamydial loads in koalas who were C. pecorum infected without clinical disease than in koalas who were C. pecorum infected with clinical disease. These results shed light on the potential mechanisms of transmission of C. pecorum in koalas and also guide future control measures, such as vaccination...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] The coloured population has the second-highest prevalence of diabetes in South Africa. However, the data {{were based on a}} study conducted almost 20 years ago in a <b>peri-urban</b> coloured <b>population</b> of the Western Cape. We aimed to determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome in an urban coloured population in South Africa. Design. In a cross-sectional survey, 642 participants aged ≥ 31 years were drawn from an urban community of Bellville South, Cape Town, from mid-January 2008 to March 2009. Type 2 diabetes was assessed according to the WHO criteria, and metabolic syndrome was based on the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), ATP III and 2009 Joint Interim Statement (JIS) definition. Results. The crude prevalence of 28. 2 % (age-adjusted 26. 3 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 22. 0 - 30. 3) for type 2 diabetes was: 4. 4 % (age-adjusted 3. 2 %, 95 % CI 1. 6 - 4. 9) for impaired fasting glycaemia, and 15. 3 % (age-adjusted 15. 0 %, 95 % CI 11. 4 - 18. 6) for impaired glucose tolerance. Undiagnosed type 2 diabetes was present in 18. 1 % (age-adjusted 16. 8 %, 95 % CI 13. 3 - 20. 4). The crude prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher with the JIS definition (62. 0 %) than the IDF (60. 6 %), and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATP III (55. 4 %). There was good overall agreement between the MetS criteria, k= 0. 89 (95 % CI 0. 85 - 0. 92). Conclusion. The prevalence of diabetes has increased hugely in the coloured community, and the high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes portends that cardiovascular diseases might grow to epidemic proportions in the near future in South Africa.
