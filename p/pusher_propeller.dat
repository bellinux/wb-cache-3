5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller.</b> The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller</b> {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E

25|$|The {{powerplant}} {{arrangements were}} unorthodox, {{with the two}} outboard engines housed inside the fuselage, each driving a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller</b> via shafts and bevel gearboxes, and a central pusher engine in a nacelle between the wings.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of conventional}} configuration, {{with the exception}} of a pylon mounted <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller,</b> and is constructed from balsa, plywood and aluminium alloy. Originally covered with silver-doped Nylon the aircraft now sports a transparent plastic skin on the fuselage.|$|E

25|$|The Banshee is a built mostly out of {{composite}} material (Kevlar and glass-reinforced plastic) with a tailess delta wing platform. The first models used a 26hp 342 cc Normalair-Garrett two-cylinder two-stroke driving a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller.</b> Performance was 35-185 kt with an endurance from 1–3 hours. Flight control is by two elevons.|$|E
25|$|A 150hp Hispano-Suiza 8Aa {{water-cooled}} engine located immediately aft of {{the wings}} drove a two blade <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller</b> mounted {{at the extreme}} tail, via a long shaft. Using a ventral fin with a long tail skid to protect the propeller and a short vertical stabilizer, the C1 had no fixed horizontal stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|Built {{mostly from}} aluminum, the XV-1 {{fuselage}} {{consisted of a}} streamlined tube mounted on skid landing gear, with a rear-mounted engine and a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller.</b> It also had tapered stub wings mounted high on the fuselage. In turn, twin tailbooms and twin vertical surfaces, interconnected by a horizontal stabilizer elevator, were mounted to the wings. A three-bladed main rotor powered by blade tip pressure jets was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, above the wing roots.|$|E
50|$|The Piaggio P.136 was an Italian {{twin-engine}} amphibian flying boat, with an all-metal hull, <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers,</b> a gull wing, and retractable landing gear.|$|R
50|$|During {{the long}} {{eclipse of the}} {{configuration}} the use of <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers</b> continued in aircraft which derived a small benefit from the installation and could have been built as tractors. Biplane flying boats, had for some time often been fitted with engines located above the fuselage to offer maximum clearance from the water, often driving <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers</b> to avoid spray and the hazards involved by keeping them well clear of the cockpit. The Supermarine Walrus was a late example of this layout.|$|R

25|$|The {{convertiplane}} {{featured a}} single Continental-built R-975 radial piston engine that powered twin air compressors. The compressors pumped air via ducts {{to the main}} rotor for vertical flight, while the engine drove the two-bladed <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller</b> for horizontal flight. During forward flight the wing provided 80% of the lift with the remainder generated by the main rotor autorotating at about 50% of normal rpm. When in hover mode, the rotor turned at 410 RPM but slowed to 180 RPM for high-speed flight above 125 knots.|$|E
25|$|In six-engined {{configuration}} the R-class zeppelins had single pusher {{engines in}} the rear of the front control gondola and two engine cars either side amidships, with a further three engines {{in the rear}} gondola. Of the rear gondola engines, one drove a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller</b> direct at the rear of the gondola and two more in the centre of the gondola drove propellers, via gearboxes and transmission shafts, mounted on framework either side of the gondola. Five-engined R-class zeppelins omitted the rear gondola direct-drive centre engine.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{go through}} the process of {{submitting}} an unorthodox design for official consideration, Miles decided to build and fly a mock-up. Miles tasked Ray Bournon with designing a small single-engined single-seat aircraft, the Miles M.35. Design and construction was completed in six weeks. The result was a small wooden aircraft with a high-set front wing and low-set rear wing, fixed tricycle undercarriage, and <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller,</b> with the engine {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and the pilot sitting in the front of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Henschel Hs P.75, a 1941 {{design with}} {{slightly}} swept-back wings {{placed at the}} rear, swept-back canards at the front, and double <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers</b> at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing propeller diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin Propeller is equipped with a pull <b>propeller</b> and a <b>push</b> <b>propeller.</b> The vortex street of the front pull propeller passes between the blades of the rear <b>push</b> <b>propeller</b> without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the pull propeller means that more water reaches the <b>push</b> <b>propeller</b> from the sides. The strut is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the propeller stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a lift component in the thrust direction, which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|R
5000|$|In Russia Alexander Mozhaiski {{constructed}} a steam-powered monoplane driven by one large tractor and two smaller <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers.</b> In 1884, it was launched from a ramp and remained airborne for 98 ft.|$|R
25|$|The Savoia-Marchetti S.64 was a {{monoplane}} {{developed in}} Italy in 1928 specifically {{to contest the}} world duration and distance records. It was an unusual pod-and-boom design, with the empennage carried on two open truss structures that extended aft from the wings, similar to the arrangement used on the S.55. The powerplant was mounted {{on a set of}} cabane struts above the wing, and consisted of a single engine driving a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller.</b> The cockpit was located inside the stubby fuselage pod and was fully enclosed. The S.64 made its first flight on 3 April 1928 with Alessandro Passeleva at the controls.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{aeronautical}} engineer Fred Weick was assistant {{chief of the}} aeronautics division of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). In 1934 he asked permission to build an aircraft based on the 1931 Stout Skycar, using fabric instead of aluminum covering, and control modifications based on NACA research. Weick {{and a group of}} co-workers designed and assembled the experimental aircraft with a group of his colleagues who worked on the project in their spare time and paid for it themselves. The resulting aircraft, known as the W-1, featured tricycle landing gear, a parasol wing, and a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller</b> configuration.|$|E
25|$|Tom Prescott {{worked for}} Sikorsky Aircraft, Piper Aircraft, and Learjet. He left Learjet in 1983 {{to produce the}} Prescott Pusher. The pusher was tested using a 1/5 scale model in the Wichita State University wind tunnel in 1983. Flying scale models were tested in 1984, {{which led to the}} {{development}} of the drooped wing tips for better low speed handling and reduced drag. The aircraft was modeled using CAD/CAM software for creating drawings and defining machine cuts on the fuselage steel, becoming the first CAD/CAM designed homebuilt aircraft. The AVIA Products Co was purchased to develop an electrically controlled variable pitch fiberglass <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dormoy also {{designed}} a rotary wing aircraft opted for air camera work in 1930. To this end he designed the Buhl A-1, an autogiro with a <b>push</b> <b>propeller</b> engine located behind {{the pilot and}} camera operator.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle's {{construction}} {{differs from}} the traditional GEA's scheme which uses under-wing airflow from the engines located in front. Designers of [...] "Burevestnik-24" [...] used a bi-plane scheme with the engines which are located on the top wing, facing rearwards with <b>pushing</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} Harry Atwood {{brought to}} Sandusky, Ohio, was a Burgess - Wright. This model featured two chain-driven <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers</b> and twin floats or pontoons. The Burgess Company {{was founded by}} America's Cup yacht designer/builder Starling Burgess. Atwood was, for a time, one of the company's aviators...|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} RW 3 Multoplan {{was designed}} by Hanno Fischer who founded Rhein-West-Flug Fischer in 1955 {{in order to test}} the aerodynamic principles that he propounded. These were first tested in the Fibo 2a light aircraft. This was followed by the first RW 3A Multoplan D-EJAS which was a tandem two-seat light aircraft of mixed construction with a high aspect ratio wing, retractable tricycle undercarriage and a T-tail. The 65 h.p. Porsche 678/0 engine was buried in the centre fuselage and drove a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller</b> mounted in a vertical slot between the fin and rudder. The two occupants were provided with dual controls and were accommodated beneath a long blister canopy. A second RW 3A-V2 was built and tested.|$|E
25|$|Shorts {{airframe}} number S.39 {{was given}} to an experimental twin-engined aircraft based on the Type S.27, the Triple Twin. This was powered by two 50hp Gnome Omega engines, one {{in the front of}} the nacelle driving a pair of tractor propellers mounted on the interplane struts, with the chain drive to the left-hand propeller crossed so that the front propellers revolved in opposite directions, and the second engine mounted behind the trailing edge of the lower wing driving a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller.</b> As first built and flown the wings were of equal span, with trailing edge ailerons fitted to both upper and lower wings. It was first flown by McClean on 18 September 1911 and bought by the Admiralty in June 1912, being given the serial number T.3.|$|E
25|$|Of pod and boom layout the Ogar has a T-tail on a tubular Aluminium alloy tubular boom {{extending}} from the keel of the fuselage pod, which houses the cockpit and engine. A variety of materials are used in construction, with a glass-fibre cockpit shell over two load bearing wooden frames. The wings are of wooden single spar construction skinned with plywood and covered with glass-fibre. The engine is mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage pod, aft of the wing trailing edge at the same level and driving a <b>pusher</b> <b>propeller.</b> The undercarriage consists of a semi-retractable mainwheel fitted with a disc brake, steerable tailwheel and optional outrigger wheels on flexible struts at the wing-tips. Accommodation for two pilots is provided side-by-side under an aft-hinged upward opening canopy. The Ogar was certified for simple aerobatics.|$|E
50|$|The Model HS was a two place, {{side-by-side}} configuration seating, open cockpit, biplane {{with twin}} rudders, powered {{with a single}} engine, propelled by two chain driven <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers.</b> The engine was fully enclosed in {{the nose of the}} aircraft with a driveshaft running rearward to the propeller drive chains.|$|R
25|$|The engine {{installations}} differed {{with each}} aircraft type but generally followed {{the layout of}} a single nose engine, usually driving a two-bladed propeller and with the interwing engine nacelles on either side suspended by struts between the mainplanes each housing two engines in tandem, geared to drive single <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Before forming Scaled Composites, Burt Rutan had {{designed}} several aircraft for amateur builders, including the VariEze, often {{considered one of}} general aviation's most innovative designs. He also designed the Beechcraft Starship, which was, however, a commercial failure. These aircraft were distinctive because of their canard configuration, winglets and <b>pusher</b> <b>propellers.</b>|$|R
