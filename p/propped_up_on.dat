Minority shareholders in these firms seem {{to be subject to}} expropriation through tunneling but also gain from <b>propping</b> <b>up.</b> <b>On</b> balance, there seems to be more tunneling than <b>propping</b> <b>up.</b> Both types of firms have larger state ownership compared {{to the rest of the}} Chinese market but firms that are <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> are larger and have larger state ownership than firms subject to tunneling. <b>Propped</b> <b>up</b> firms are more likely to have foreign shareholders and to be cross-listed abroad compared to firms that are subject to tunneling. <b>Propped</b> <b>up</b> firms also tend to have worse operating performance in the fiscal year preceding the announcement of the related party transaction. Finally, we find that related party transactions representing tunneling are accompanied by significantly less information disclosure compared to related party transactions representing propping.

Prague: Charles University, 2 nd Faculty of Medicine, Department of Rehabilitation and Sports, 2016, 70 p., Supervisor: PhDr. Ingrid Palaščáková Špringrová, Ph. D. Abstract The Acral Coactivation Therapy, {{based on}} neurophysiology, {{is a method}} the {{principle}} of which consists in <b>propping</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> acral parts of the limbs with the aim to coactivate ventral and dorsal muscle chains in order to center the root joints and to straighten the axial skeleton subsequently. The practical part of the thesis is aimed at verification of the Acral Coactivation Therapy principles. Two groups of individuals were objects of the research: mountaineers and general population. Normal arches of upper limbs statistically prevailed {{in the group of}} the mountaineers, which proves the impact of regular physical activity on musculoskeletal system and its function. Surface electromyography recorded the impact of correction of the acral part on change in muscular activity. The results of the electromyographic measurement showed the same trends in muscular activity changes as the outcomes resulting from the Acral Coactivation Therapy. Statistically, the most substantial changes were [...] ...|$|R

500|$|By midnight only Tonnant {{remained}} engaged, as Commodore Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars {{continued his}} fight with Majestic and fired on Swiftsure when the British ship moved within range. By 03:00, {{after more than}} three hours of close quarter combat, Majestic had lost its main and mizzen masts while Tonnant was a dismasted hulk. Although Captain Du Petit Thouars had lost both legs and an arm he remained in command, insisting on having the tricolour nailed to the mast to prevent it from being struck and giving orders from his position <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> deck in a bucket of wheat. Under his guidance, the battered Tonnant gradually drifted southwards away from the action to join the southern division under Villeneuve, who failed to bring these ships into effective action. Throughout the engagement the French rear had kept up an arbitrary fire on the battling ships ahead. [...] The only noticeable effect was the smashing of Timoléons rudder by misdirected fire from the neighbouring Généreux.|$|E

500|$|In the House, as {{the session}} began at 4:30 pm, the Whig MP Henry Brougham, a leading {{opponent}} of the Orders, {{drew attention to the}} Prime Minister's absence and remarked that he ought to be there. A messenger was sent to fetch Perceval from Downing Street, but met him in Parliament Street (Perceval having decided to walk and dispense with his usual carriage) {{on his way to the}} House, where he arrived at about 5:15. As Perceval entered the lobby, he was confronted by Bellingham who, drawing a pistol, shot the Prime Minister in the chest. Perceval staggered forward a few steps and exclaimed [...] "I am murdered!" [...] before falling face down at the feet of William Smith, the MP for Norwich. (It was also variously reported Perceval had said [...] "Murder" [...] or [...] "Oh my God".) Smith only realised that the victim was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards. By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a table with his feet on two chairs, he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later, the pulse had stopped, and Perceval was declared dead.|$|E

2500|$|Early Roman art was {{influenced}} by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period. By the 2nd century BCE, [...] "most of the sculptors working at Rome" [...] were Greek, often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.|$|E

2500|$|After a {{demo version}} of the album was put down in Artane, Dickens {{requested}} to have it re-recorded digitally at a more professional studio as the analogue equipment used at Aigle had created an abundance of tape hiss, causing the music to suffer. Nicky found the quality of Enya's multi-track vocals had also diminished, leaving them the only option of re-recording them, though he later found digital record had lost [...] "warmth in the bottom end". With studio time booked at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London, Enya and Nicky re-recorded and mastered Watermark with Ross Cullum who carried out co-production, engineering, and mixing duties. [...] "Storms in Africa" [...] and [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] were completed on the studio's two Mitsubishi 32-track recording machines. Away from the [...] "intimate and personal" [...] setting of recording in Ireland, Enya found working in London more difficult as the busy city caused many distractions. Cullum completed {{the majority of the}} album's mixing at Wessex Sound Studios, with Jim Barton credited as the mixer on [...] "Orinoco Flow". During the final stages of recording, Enya tripped on a step which resulted in two cuts to her knee. She continued to work, [...] "taking these heavy pain-killers, sitting at the desk, in the studio with one foot <b>propped</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> cushions."
