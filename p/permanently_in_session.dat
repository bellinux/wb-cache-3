While James I had held the same opinions as his son with regard to royal prerogatives, he had enough charisma to persuade the Parliament to accept his policies. Charles did not have this skill in human management and so, when faced with a crisis in 1639-42, he failed to prevent his Kingdoms from sliding into civil war.

50|$|On 9 December, the United Kingdom demanded reparations from Albania. Albania denied {{involvement}} in the laying of mines, blaming Greece. In January 1947, the United Kingdom attempted to involve the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union objected, but the Security Council heard the British complaint. A fact-finding committee consisting of Polish, Australian and Colombian representatives reached no conclusions despite ten meetings. A Soviet veto, supported by Poland, blocked a resolution that would have accused Albania of indirect responsibility for the minefield. The Security Council passed a resolution on 9 April 1947, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining, recommending that the United Kingdom and Albania resolve the dispute in the International Court of Justice. This recommendation was made pursuant to Article 36, paragraph 3 of the United Nations Charter. On 22 May, the United Kingdom brought suit against Albania. The ICJ, being <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session,</b> was available to begin hearing the case immediately. Despite having a long backlog of matters for consideration, such as a request for an advisory opinion on Article 4 of the United Nations Charter, the Corfu Channel case was considered first.|$|E
50|$|Charles I's {{accession}} also {{marked the}} beginning of an intense schism between King and Parliament. Charles's adherence to the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings, a doctrine foreign to the English mentality he had inherited from his father, fuelled a vicious battle for supremacy between King and Parliament. Therefore, when Charles approached the Parliament to pay for a campaign against the Scots, they refused, declared themselves to be <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session</b> and put forward a long list of civil and religious grievances that Charles would have to remedy before they approved any new legislation. Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Ireland, Charles I's Lord Deputy there, Thomas Wentworth, had antagonised the native Irish Catholics by repeated initiatives to confiscate their lands and grant them to English colonists. He had also angered them by enforcing new taxes but denying Roman Catholics full rights as subjects. What made this situation explosive was his idea, in 1639, to offer Irish Catholics the reforms they had been looking for in return for them raising and paying for an Irish army to put down the Scottish rebellion. Although the army was to be officered by Protestants, the idea of an Irish Catholic army being used to enforce what was seen by many as tyrannical government horrified both the Scottish and the English Parliament, who in response threatened to invade Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|Don Juan {{signed the}} Pacification on 12 February 1577, thereby {{apparently}} giving royal assent to it. He took care, however, {{to stress the}} clauses about maintaining the Catholic religion outside the provinces of Holland and Zeeland, that the States General had attempted to [...] "fudge." [...] The States General then accepted him as the legitimate governor-general, and even agreed to pay the arrears of the royal troops (the refusal of which had arguably been {{the cause of the}} problems with the mutineers). This agreement was enshrined in the Edict of 1577. However, that Edict seemed to provide for a return to the status quo ante in which the States General would not be <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session.</b> Holland and Zeeland protested against this arrangement and refused to submit to it. Neither would they give up the fortresses they had occupied, as provided for in the Pacification. The relations between the new governor-general and the States General also soon deteriorated. The States General even appointed their own governor-general, the Archduke Matthias. In 1579, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma, became royalist Governor General of the Netherlands and he immediately offered the southern Catholic nobles their original privileges back. With the Spanish army under control and their local liberties returned, the Walloon nobles and Southern provinces no longer had any reason to rebel. However, the Northern, Calvinist-controlled provinces were as unwilling to give up their religion as Philip II was to allow them to practice it. The French-speaking provinces thereupon concluded the Union of Arras, which the other provinces immediately answered with their own Union of Utrecht. The Habsburg Netherlands split up.|$|E

40|$|In the old Polish {{political}} culture a deputy was regarded {{not as a}} representative of the whole nation (genUy) but as a mandataIy of a local diet obliged to follow the binding instruction he received from the diet (imperative mandate). At the end of the 18 th century it was necessary to change this situation. This problem was to be solved by the Great Seym (1788 - 1792), which in this article is associated with the notion of a mild revolution. The Polish mild revolution was a great social movement dominated by the enlightened landed gentry, who strongly believed in the fundamentallegislative role of the Seym convened in Warsaw in 1788. This Seym became confederated Seym (taking decisions on all questions by a simple majority vote) and permanent governing Seym (combining legislative and executive powers and <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session).</b> The great role of the permanent Seymwas that it elevated the middle genUy to the position of the real sovereign of the Commonwealth. Owingto this the enlightened provincial gentry was able to identify with the deputies debating in Warsaw as far as political reforms were concerned. The enlightened landed gentry greatly appreciated the legislative activity of the Seym, thanks to which the prestige of the deputies as real representatives of the interests of the provincial gentry was increasing. At the same time the landed gentry became more and more disappointed in the binding instruction. During the local diets in February and November 1790 the landed gentry realized that the local diets were dominated by political forces which made it impossible for the enlightened provincial genUy to fully politically identify with the Seym debating in Warsaw. Hence the provincial genUy started to distrust the binding instruction and began to accept the idea of a deputy {{as a representative of}} the whole gentry. The new concepts of the gentry concerning the relations between the Seym and local diets were shaped not on the theoretical grounds but in the course of political events dominated by the mild revolution. These changes in the consciousness of the provincial gentry made it easier for the king, who was the opponent of the binding instruction, to introduce to the Third of MayConstitution the decision that a deputy is a representative of the nation. The new relations between the Seym and the local diets were shown by the fact that local diets played the role of a specifically understood referendum expressing moral and political opinions and not taking binding decisions. Mter the Third of May Constitution local diets were reduced to the role of constituencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of the}} {{permanent}} Seym was introduced into Polish political culture {{at the end of}} the 18 th century owing to Stanisław Staszic's work entitled The Remarks on Jan Zamoyski's Life (1787). The permanent Seym, <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session</b> and consisting of the same members, combined legislative and executive power. It was hoped that the creation of {{the permanent}} Seym would lead to the abolition of the Permanent Council (a kind of government under Russia's protectorate) and as a result, Poland was supposed to gain full independence by political means. At the same time, the permanent Seym was to make the middle gentry the dominant power of the Commonwealth, and free the State from magnates' supremacy. At the beginning of the debates of the Great Seym (1788 - 1792], the idea of the permanent Seym appealed to the gentry very much. However, the permanent Seym was never formally created due to the fact that the political initiative at the Seym was taken over by the Puławy party, whose leader Ignacy Potocki and his followers did not approve of the idea of the permanent Seym. Instead, they were in favour of the ready Seym - ready to be convened. At the turn of 1788 / 89 a compromise was reached between the parliamentary majority represented by the middle gentry, who supported the permanent Seym, and the Puławy party. The essence of the compromise was that the Seym which was currently in session was to become the permanent Seym and in the future it was to be transformed into the ready Seym. After the overthrow of the Permanent Council (19 January 1789), the Seym in session became the permanent Seym. Its creation contributed to the increase of the gentry's political culture and first of all their sense of responsibility for the State. However, at the same time, the weaknesses of the Seym became visible: first of all its inefficiency as the highest executive power. Gradually, the gentry became more and more aware of the necessity of existing of a separate executive power like the Guardians of Law, which would function as a government. Consequently, a compromise between the middle gentry and the king was worked out, which resulted in passing the Third of May Constitution by the Seym. The compromise meant that on the one hand, the principle of the separation of powers was adopted and the Guardians of Law - a kind of government was established (in accordance with the king's intentions), whereas on the other hand, the sovereignty of the Seym was strongly emphasised without keeping the balance of powers (in accordance with the intention of the gentry). And such was the final result of the creation of the permanent Seym...|$|E
40|$|The Great Seym, {{also called}} the Four Years' Seym (6 th October 1788 - 29 th May 1792), was {{dominated}} by the independence oriented deputies, who turned into a gentry parliamentary formation as an independent political subject. Having no real leadership of its own, this political formation {{was bound to be}} influenced by political and reformatory initiatives first of the Puławy party, headed by Ignacy Potocki, who represented a radically republican character of reforms (at the beginning of the Seym) and then the initiatives of the King (in the second stage of the debates). The great Seym formed a Confederation (on the initiative of the gentry) and took decisions on all questions by a simple majority vote. At the beginning of the Seym debates, the independence oriented deputies cooperating with the Puławy party, who were the advocates of the pro-Prussian orientation, liberated Poland from Russian dependence (the abolition of the War Department on the 3 rd November 1788 and of the Permanent Council on the 19 th January 1789). At the turn of 1788 and 1789 the Great Seym became the permanent governing Seym (<b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session</b> and combining legislative and executive powers) as the gentry wanted and in the future {{it was supposed to be}} the ready Seym as the Puławy party wanted. The enlightened middle gentry became the real sovereign of the Commonwealth. In the first stage of the debates (1788 - 1790) the Puławy party politically overpowering the king, who defended the Permanent Council (dependent on Russia), took over the reformatory initiative and combined several proposals concerning the State's political system with the idea of independence. Thanks to this they facilitated the social acceptance of the reforms in the future constitution. The gentry parliamentary formation cooperating with the Puławy party and emphasizing their own identity formed the framework of a new enlightened model of a gentry dominated state. Mter the King had joined the Polish-Prussian alliance in March 1790, the gentry following the traditional slogan: "The King with the People, the People with the King", supported Stanisław August. In the parliamentary elections in November 1790 the King's followers gained more than 60 % seats in the Parliament and it was the newly elected deputies who helped the King to realize his constitutional ideas (since the election the Seym consisted of the old deputies and the newly elected ones). Consequently, a number of Ignacy Potocki's radically republican reforms lost their popularity. The main author of the Constitution Third of May was the King but in fact the Constitution and all the Third of May reforms were a result of a mutual compromise of three political subjects: the King, the Puławy party and the gentry parliamentary formation. The Constitution Third of May considerably reformed the State's political system forming a constitutional-parliamentary monarchy; the succession to the throne was introduced and the sovereignty of the Seym was strongly emphasized. The Constitution Third of May also introduced an advanced municipal reform and initiated the reform concerning the problem of peasants. The Seym debates were interrupted by the military intervention of Russia...|$|E

40|$|The Puławy party, {{cooperating}} with wide circles of enlightened landed gentry, made the Seym a political weapon {{of the struggle}} for {{the independence of the}} Commonwealth. By abolishing the Permanent Council (19 January 1789) and overthrowing the system of Russian protectorate they were able to gain full independence of the Commonwealth by political means. As far as the process of changes in the State's political system is concerned they emphasised the leading role of the Seym not the government in the Commonwealth thus trying to undermine the position of the king. They combined oligarchic views with radically republican reformist ideas. Republican tendencies won approval of the gentry; however, a lot of radically republican ideas were met with indifference or even disapproval of the enlightened landed gentry. The compromise concerning the reform of the Seym reached by the Puławy party and the gentry parliamentary formation {{at the beginning of the}} debates was of great importance for the future. The essence of the compromise was that the seym which was currently in session was to become the permanent governing Seym (combining legislative and executive powers and <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session)</b> just as the gentry wanted and according to the future constitution it was supposed to be the ready Seym (always ready to be convened in definite circumstances and consisting of the same members elected every two years) as the Puławy party wanted. The greatest achievement of the Puławy party during the first stage of the debates of the Great seym was attracting wide circles of the gentry to the reformist proposals represented by them. At the very beginning of the Great Seym the Puławy party popularized the following concepts; the ready Seym, the Guardians (a kind of government) as an organ indispensable for the functioning of a modern State (although it was supposed to have only a supervisory role), collegiate administration governing bodies. At the same time they made it possible to introduce in the future Montesquieu's principle of the separation of powers, which was the opposite of the idea of the Permanent governing Seym. By associating the concept of changes in the State's political system with the abolition of the Permanent Council and thus with the idea of independence they made the proposed reforms very popular with the gentry. As a result they paved the way for the future constitution. They also made the local diets free from magnates' domination by depriving the landless gentry (who were the tool of the magnates) of political rights. Besides they worked out the concept of the peasants' reform and they also supported hereditory succession to the throne. At the end of 1790 they lost political initiative for the benefit of the king, who became the main author of the Constitution which showed clear monarchical tendencies. The Puławy party was not able to introduce many of their ideas into the Constitution. Nevertheless, the Puławy party together with the gentry parliamentary formation succeeded in shaping the sovereignty of the Seym and practically managed to hand over central State' s administration into the hands of the collegiate administration governing bodies, which had a great deal of autonomy. And although a number of the proposals put forward by the Puławy party were not welcomedby the king and the gentry. their ability to reach reformist compromises is an undeniable contribution to the debates of the Great Seym. The ability to hold a constructive political dialogue both with the king and the gentry parliamentary formation made it possible for the debates of the Great Seym to culminate in the 3 rd of May Constitution and further reformist acts...|$|E
40|$|By {{the middle}} of January 1789 {{the concept of the}} ready Seym (always ready to be convened in {{definite}} circumstances and consisting of the same members elected every two years) had been put forward by the leaders of the Puławy party (Ignacy Potocki, Stanisław Kostka Potocki) in the Seym and presented in S. K. Potocki' s work “The Remarks” on General “Improvement of the National Government” (published anonymously). This idea was connected with the abolition of the Permanent Council (a kind of government under Russia's protectorate) and thus with the liberation from Russia's supremacy. As a result, this concept became associated with a reform aiming at regaining independence and received wide support from the gentry including Members of Parliament. This should be regarded as a great political success of the Puławy party. It must also be pointed out that the idea of the ready Seym was promoted by the Potockis {{at the expense of the}} concept of the permanent Seym (combining legislative and executive powers and <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session),</b> a concept which was very popular with the gentry at that time. It was a compromise: the Seym which was currently in session was to become the permanent Seym after the abolition of the Permanent Council (which happened on 19 th January 1789) : however, in the future after the proposed reform it was to become the ready Seym. Reaching this compromise should also be considered a great achievement of the Puławy party. By promoting the idea of the ready Seym and making it popular with the gentry the Puławy party laid a solid foundation for the constitutional reform of the Commonwealth during the Great Seym (1788 - 1792). The concept of the ready Seym was supported by the king and was first included in “The principles concerning improvement of the form of government” (December 1789) and next in the Third of May Constitution (1791). By associating in {{the middle of}} January 1789 the proposal of creating the Guardians of Law (a kind of government), as well as the ready Seym, with the abolition of the Permanent Council and a reform aiming at regaining independence the Puławy party considerably contributed to making the Guardians popular with the gently and parliamentarians. According to the Puławy party the Guardians of Law were supposed to be a supervising body, not a decision-making one; the real executive power was to be exercised by the collegiate governing bodies in the form of the Commissions of War, Police, Finance and Education, directly elected by the Seym and subordinated to it. As a result the Puławy party could also count on getting support from the wide circles of the landed gently. However, they did not manage to include the provision concerning the supervisoly only role of the Guardians in the final version of the constitution. Instead, the concept of the Guardians, which was made popular with the gently by the Puławy party, was used in the king's version of the constitution, according to which the Guardians were to be a decision-making body and such a provision was included in the Third of May Constitution. The Guardians of Law became a supreme power for the whole administration, in fact a kind of government, however, the sovereignty of the Seym was strongly emphasized at the same time. It should be pointed out that the Royal party gained the advantage at the expense of the Puławy party. The king's success and the social approval of this provision resulted from a kind of compromise between the king and the gently parliamentary formation, significant changes in the mentality of the gently and general reformatory consequences connected with the functioning of the Seym in session as the permanent Seym which combined legislative and executive powers...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} since the {{beginning}} of the 16 th centuty the Seym had been playing a dominant role in the political life of the Commonwealth caused that the reform of the State's political system had to be initiated by the Seym thus making its leading position in the State even stronger. About the middle of the 18 th centuty due to the limited sovereignty of the Commonwealth and the opposition of Russia it was not possible to carry out a global reform of the Seym. In order to overcome liberum veto in 1764 the Family resorted to a substitute solution and applied the principle of general gentty confederation to the Seym (confederated Seym taking decisions by majority vote). On the other hand, due to Russia's consent it was possible to introduce fundamental reforms of the executive power in the form of "Seym sections", which reflected the structure of the Seym. These "Seym sections" were of two types: either they had the form of coliegiate administration governing bodies or the Permanent Council. They consisted of senators, gentty who were not senators and representatives of the King (ministers) or even the King himself. These "Seym sections" were, as the gentty saw it, executive organs replacing the Seym. Collegiate administration governing bodies, promoted by Czartotyscy since 1764, functioned independently from each other and were subordinated only to the Seym. These collegiate bodies broke the almost unlimited prerogatives of ministers (one-man offices). they enabled the enlightened landed gentty to really participate in the State's administration. they embodied the principles of democratic State in the awareness of the gentty. The Permanent Council (from 1775), whose supporter was the King, had a centralized character and realized the vision of a state with a strong governmental- administrative centre. The gentty decided that the collegiate administration governing bodies are better suited to the model of the gently's Commonwealth than the Permanent Council. Fundamental reforms of the State's political system were carried out by the Great Seym (1788 - 1792), which made Poland independent of Russia's domination. It was a confederated Seym, which elevated the enlightened middle gently to the position of the real sovereign of the Commonwealth thus making them more inclined to reach reformist political compromise with the Puławy party (at the beginning of the Seym) and with the King (in the second stage of the debates). At the beginning of the debates a compromise between the gently parliamentary formation and the Puławy party was made. The essence of this compromise was that the Seym which was currently in session was to become the permanent governing Seym (combining legislative and executive powers and <b>permanently</b> <b>in</b> <b>session)</b> Just as the gentry wanted and according to the future constitution it was supposed to be the ready Seym (always ready to be convened in definite circumstances and consisting of the same members elected every two years) as the Puławy party wanted.

In the second stage of the debates the gently parliamentary formation reached a reformist compromise with the King. The essence of this compromise was that the gentry accepted the decision making prerogatives of the Guardians of Law and thier controlling function in reference to the whole administration (contrary to the Puławy party according to whom the Guardians were supposed to have only a supervisory role). The King, on the other hand, accepted the sovereignty of the Seym and the autonomy of the collegiate administration governing bodies functioning independently from each other and not directly included in the structure of the government as the gently and Puławy party wanted...|$|E
