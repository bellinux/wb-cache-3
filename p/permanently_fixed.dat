5|$|In 1578, {{during the}} reign of Sebastian and {{on the eve of the}} fatal Battle of Alcácer Quibir, the flag was again modified. The number of castles was <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> at seven and the royal crown was {{converted}} into a closed three-arched crown, which symbolized a stronger royal authority. With Sebastian's death and the short-lived reign of his great-uncle Cardinal Henry, in 1580, a dynastic crisis was solved with the Spanish king Philip II acceding to the Portuguese throne as Philip I, installing a Spanish dynasty. The accession was made on the condition that Portugal was ruled as a separate, autonomous state, not as a province. This was fulfilled as Portugal and Spain formed a personal union under Philip I and his successors. A consequence of this administrative situation was the maintenance of the flag created under Sebastian's reign as the Portuguese national flag, while Spain had its own. As the ruling house in Portugal, the Habsburg banner also included the Portuguese arms.|$|E

25|$|All {{components}} of Alpha Centauri display significant proper motions {{against the background}} sky, similar to the first-magnitude stars Sirius and Arcturus. Over the centuries, this causes the apparent stellar positions to slowly change. Such motions define the high-proper-motion stars. These stellar motions were unknown to ancient astronomers.

The aforementioned initial four prototypes (V1-V4) were built with the conventional gear configuration. Changing to a tricycle arrangement—a <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> undercarriage on the fifth prototype (V5, code PC+UE), with the definitive fully retractable nosewheel gear on the V6 (with Stammkennzeichen code VI+AA, from a new code block) and subsequent aircraft corrected this problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{architects of}} Bretton Woods had {{conceived}} {{of a system}} wherein exchange rate stability was a prime goal. Yet, {{in an era of}} more activist economic policy, governments did not seriously consider <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> rates on the model of the classical gold standard of the 19th century. Gold production was not even sufficient {{to meet the demands of}} growing international trade and investment. Further, a sizable share of the world's known gold reserves were located in the Soviet Union, which would later emerge as a Cold War rival to the United States and Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the most}} popular style is the sled-foot trestle base. With this design, each pair of legs is put {{together}} {{in the form of}} an 'I' with two vertical bars. The leg pairs are connected by a pair of stretchers. These stretchers can be <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> to the leg-pairs, or they can be made removable with tusk tenons or a bed-bolt arrangement. One of the advantages of this style is that there is no end-grain resting on the floor, so the legs are not as prone to wick-up moisture and rot.|$|E

50|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{process of}} applying a permanent wave to hair {{is one example}} of oxidative cross-linking. In that process the disulfide bonds are reduced, typically using a mercaptan such as ammonium thioglycolate. Following this, the hair is curled and then 'neutralized'. The neutralizer is typically an acidic solution of hydrogen peroxide, which causes new disulfide bonds to form under conditions of oxidation, thus <b>permanently</b> <b>fixing</b> the hair into its new configuration.|$|R
50|$|The Missouri Department of Transportation {{announced}} a tentative closing schedule for repairs to the Champ Clark Bridge in 2012. The repairs were deemed necessary to <b>permanently</b> <b>fix</b> damage inflicted {{on the structure}} in December 2011 where a vehicle struck the through-truss section of the bridge. Repairs included removal and replacement of rivets, installation of supports & new steel. The bridge was to be closed for approximately a week.|$|R
25|$|ClearType {{and allied}} {{technologies}} require display hardware with fixed pixels and subpixels. More precisely, {{the positions of}} the pixels and subpixels on the screen must be exactly known to the computer to which it is connected. This is the case for flat-panel displays, on which {{the positions of the}} pixels are <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> by the design of the screen itself. Almost all flat panels have a perfectly rectangular array of square pixels, each of which contains three rectangular subpixels in the three primary colors, with the normal ordering being red, green, and blue, arranged in vertical bands. ClearType assumes this arrangement of pixels when rendering text.|$|E
25|$|The {{separated}} fragments {{are then}} transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon filter; this procedure is called a Southern blot. The DNA fragments within the blot are <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> to the filter, and the DNA strands are denatured. Radiolabeled probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called variable number tandem repeat sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.|$|E
25|$|For aneurysms in the aorta, arms, legs, or head, the {{weakened}} {{section of}} the vessel may {{be replaced by a}} bypass graft that is sutured at the vascular stumps. Instead of sewing, the graft tube ends, made rigid and expandable by nitinol wireframe, can be easily inserted in its reduced diameter into the vascular stumps and then expanded up to the most appropriate diameter and <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> there by external ligature. New devices were recently developed to substitute the external ligature by expandable ring allowing use in acute ascending aorta dissection, providing airtight (i.e. not dependent on the coagulation integrity), easy and quick anastomosis extended to the arch concavity Less invasive endovascular techniques allow covered metallic stent grafts to be inserted through the arteries of the leg and deployed across the aneurysm.|$|E

25|$|A chair {{without a}} back or arm rests is a stool, or when raised up, a bar stool. A chair with arms is an armchair; one with upholstery, {{reclining}} action, and a fold-out footrest is a recliner. A <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> chair in a train or theater is a seat or, in an airplane, airline seat; when riding, it is a saddle or bicycle saddle; {{and for an}} automobile, a car seat or infant car seat. With wheels it is a wheelchair; or when hung from above, a swing. An upholstered, padded chair for two people is a 'loveseat', while if it is {{for more than two}} person it is a couch, sofa, or settee; or if is not upholstered, a bench. A separate footrest for a chair, usually upholstered, is known as an ottoman, hassock, or pouffe.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} elected MPs and {{constituencies}} or electoral divisions is not <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> by law, but is declared by the Prime Minister prior to each general election {{pursuant to the}} Parliamentary Elections Act, which governs the conduct of elections to Parliament, taking into account recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee. For {{the purposes of the}} 2011 general election, there were 87 seats in Parliament organised into 12 Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and 15 Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each SMC returns one MP while each GRC returns between three and six MPs, at least one of whom must be from the Malay, Indian or other minority communities. Two GRCs were designated as four-member wards, 11 as five-member wards, and two as six-member wards. Nine GRCs were designated as wards for which at least one member of the Malay community had to be fielded as a candidate, and six as wards for which at least one member of the Indian or some other minority community had to be fielded. A group of persons wishing to stand for election in a GRC must all be members of the same political party, or a group of independent candidates.|$|E
25|$|General {{elections}} in Singapore {{must be held}} within three months after five years have elapsed from {{the date of the}} first sitting of a particular Parliament of Singapore. However, in most cases Parliament is dissolved and a general election called {{at the behest of the}} Prime Minister before the five-year period elapses. The number of constituencies or electoral divisions is not <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> by law, but is declared by the Prime Minister prior to each general election pursuant to the , which governs the conduct of elections to Parliament, taking into account recommendations of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee. For the 2015 general election, there were 89 seats in Parliament organised into 13 Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and 16 Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Each SMC returns one Member of Parliament while each GRC returns between three and six MPs, at least one of whom must be from the Malay, Indian or other minority communities.

25|$|Late on 18 January, {{the main}} railway station in Berlin {{suffered}} from major structural damage. A two-ton girder fell from {{a height of}} 40metres (130ft), damaging an outside stairwell. The station was completely evacuated, as glass plates from the façade were coming loose and falling to the pavement below. On the early afternoon of 19 January, the station was {{opened to the public}} again. Discussion started as to whether the eight-month-old station was suffering from design failures, but these claims were rejected by both Deutsche Bahn and the architect. The girders provide no means of structural support and are, for architectural reasons, only lying on small supports similar to a shelf and not <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> in place. The DB claimed that it will address the problem by welding additional supports in front of the girders, and that they would close the station at winds exceeding 8 bft until the problem was resolved. On the afternoon of 21 January 2007, the station was closed again to the public due to heavy winds at the time. and remained closed until 20:00 CET. Some politicians have suggested opening Berlin's Bahnhof Zoo for long-distance services again to have an alternative to Hauptbahnhof in cases of bad weather until the problem has been addressed, but the Deutsche Bahn has refused these suggestions on the claims that they would be both unfeasible and unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|A {{removable}} implant supported denture (also an implant supported overdenture) {{is a type}} {{of dental}} prosthesis which is not <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> in place. The dental prosthesis can be disconnected from the implant abutments with finger pressure by the wearer. To enable this, the abutment is shaped as a small connector (a button, ball, bar or magnet) which can be connected to analogous adapters in the underside of the dental prosthesis. Facial prosthetics, used to correct facial deformities (e.g. from cancer treatment or injuries) can utilise connections to implants placed in the facial bones. [...] Depending on the situation the implant may be used to retain either a fixed or removable prosthetic that replaces part of the face.|$|E
500|$|Many winter service {{vehicles}} can be fitted with snowplows, to clear roads which are blocked by deep snow. In most cases, the plows are mounted on hydraulically-actuated arms, {{allowing them to}} be raised, lowered, and angled to better move snow. [...] Most winter {{service vehicles}} include either <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> plows or plow frames: 75% of the UK's Highways Agency vehicles include a plow frame to which a blade can be attached. Winter service vehicles with both a plow frame and a gritting body are known as [...] "all purpose vehicles", and while these are more efficient than using dedicated vehicles, {{the weight of the}} hopper often decreases the range of the vehicle. Therefore, most operators will keep at least a few dedicated plowing vehicles in store for heavy storms.|$|E
25|$|Together with France {{and other}} EU states, Germany has played {{the leading role}} in the European Union. Germany (especially under Chancellor Helmut Kohl) {{was one of the main}} {{supporters}} of admitting many East European countries to the EU. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security apparatus. German Chancellor Schröder expressed an interest in a permanent seat for Germany in the UN Security Council, identifying France, Russia, and Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germany's bid.

5000|$|In 1832, {{with the}} help of a {{pharmacist}} friend, Joaquim Correa de Mello, Florence began to study ways of <b>permanently</b> <b>fixing</b> camera obscura images, which he named [...] "photographia". In 1833, they settled on silver nitrate on paper, a combination which had been the subject of experiments by Thomas Wedgwood around the year 1800. Unlike Wedgwood, who was unable to make photographs of real-world scenes with his camera or render the photograms that he did produce light-fast, Florence's notebooks indicate that he eventually succeeded in doing both. Unfortunately, partly because he never published his invention adequately, partly because he was an obscure inventor living in a remote and undeveloped province, Hércules Florence was never recognized internationally as one of the inventors of photography.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after his}} appointment, a ruling by Bland displeased {{a party to}} the suit, who persuaded the Maryland House of Delegates to attempt to abolish the office of Chancellor, and failing that, to {{eliminate}} the salary for the position. The Maryland Senate rejected initial efforts to reduce the Chancellor's salary from $3,400 to $2,200 or $2,500, but eventually passed a House bill that made no provision for the salary, in order to avoid a fiscal crisis. In the next session of the legislature, Bland presented a memorandum arguing that the actions of the legislature threatened the independence of the judiciary. This appeal succeeded, and the legislature thereafter passed a bill to <b>permanently</b> <b>fix</b> the salary of the Chancellor at the sum of $3,400, and to pay Bland in arrears at that rate.|$|R

500|$|Zhang Heng is {{the first}} person known to have applied {{hydraulic}} motive power (i.e. by employing a waterwheel and clepsydra) to rotate an armillary sphere, an astronomical instrument representing the celestial sphere. The Greek astronomer Eratosthenes (276–194BC) invented the first armillary sphere in 255BC. The Chinese armillary sphere was fully developed by 52BC, with the astronomer Geng Shouchang's addition of a <b>permanently</b> <b>fixed</b> equatorial ring. In AD 84 the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring, and finally Zhang Heng added the horizon and meridian rings. This invention is described and attributed to Zhang in quotations by Hsu Chen and Li Shan, referencing his book Lou Shui Chuan Hun Thien I Chieh (Apparatus for Rotating an Armillary Sphere by Clepsydra Water). It was likely not an actual book by Zhang, but a chapter from his Hun I or Hun I Thu Chu, written in 117 AD.

40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} experimentally that an efficient alignment of a reactive liquid crystal (LC) mesogen is achievable by employing a relief diffraction grating having a pitch {{smaller than the}} correlation length of the LC mesogen. Full alignment of the reactive LC mesogen using a 500 lines/mm diffraction grating is confirmed by polarization microscopy. A grating of 200 lines/mm exhibited partial alignment in the deepest regions of the groove. Alignment was not maintained in areas closer to the relief profile peaks of the periodic structure (which caused the spatial modulation of the alignment to occur). UV exposure of the aligned layer allowed to <b>permanently</b> <b>fix</b> the alignment due to polymerization of the unsaturated acrylate bonds.
