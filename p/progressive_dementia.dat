40|$|Pathological {{diagnosis}} {{remains the}} gold standard for the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), but being able to differentiate between CJD and non-prion diseases clinically is important because many of the non-prion, rapidly <b>progressive</b> <b>dementias</b> are treatable. Diagnostic criteria need both high sensitivity and specificity while remaining applicable to clinical practice. Despite extensive updates to the clinical criteria for sCJD, there remains a heavy emphasis on neurological signs. We describe a psychiatric presentation of sCJD that did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria until very late in a prolonged disease course and required biopsy for diagnosis.

25|$|MPS III, Sanfilippo syndrome, {{is marked}} by severe {{neurological}} symptoms. These include <b>progressive</b> <b>dementia,</b> aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, seizures, some deafness and loss of vision, and an inability to sleep {{for more than a}} few hours at a time. This disorder tends to have three main stages. During the first stage, early mental and motor skill development may be somewhat delayed. Affected children show a marked decline in learning between ages 2 and 6, followed by eventual loss of language skills and loss of some or all hearing. Some children may never learn to speak. In the syndrome's second stage, aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, profound dementia, and irregular sleep may make children difficult to manage, particularly those who retain normal physical strength. In the syndrome's last stage, children become increasingly unsteady on their feet and most are unable to walk by age 10.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{diagnosis}} of paraphrenia is not currently included in the DSM-IV or the ICD-10, many studies have recognized the condition as [...] "a viable diagnostic entity that is distinct from schizophrenia, with organic factors {{playing a role in}} a significant portion of patients."

40|$|The {{association}} of {{motor neuron disease}} (MND) with rapidly <b>progressive</b> aphasic <b>dementia</b> has been recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome within the group of frontotemporal dementias (FTDs). Although the clinical and neuropsychological features of this syndrome have been defined, {{a small number of}} post-mortem studies have been published with heterogeneous neuropathological findings. We performed cognitive, neuro-imaging and neuropathological studies on a 71 -year-old male with rapidly <b>progressive</b> aphasic <b>dementia</b> and MND. We initially found a selective non-fluent aphasia associated with hypoperfusion of the left frontotemporal cortex. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed an asymmetric change of brain metabolites, with greater changes in the left temporal lobe. The bulbar manifestations of MND occurred over the following 6 months, and the patient died of bronchopneumonia. The neuropathological examination revealed loss of neurons in the hypoglossal nucleus and anterior horns of the cervical spinal cord with microvacuolation and dot-like ubiquitin-positive deposits in the frontoparietotemporal cortex, but no changes suggestive of Alzheimer's, Pick's or Lewy body disease.

40|$|The authors {{determined}} {{the outcome of}} geropsychiatric hospitalization for 73 very low-functioning demented patients (GAF score < 21).

40|$|Total {{tau protein}} (t-tau) levels in {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) (CSF-tau) are markedly elevated {{in patients with}} Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Some CSF-tau may leak into the blood. We evaluated t-tau levels in serum (serum-tau) as a possible marker for the differential diagnosis of CJD from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other rapidly <b>progressive</b> <b>dementias</b> (RPD). Serum- and CSF-tau levels were determined in patients with sporadic CJD (n = 12), AD (n = 10) and RPD but no CJD (non-CJD-RPD; n = 9) who showed RPD fulfilling the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for possible CJD at onset and had a final diagnosis other than CJD. We also analyzed serum-tau levels in healthy volunteers as a control group (n = 10). Serum- as well as CSF-tau levels were significantly elevated in CJD group compared to those in AD, non-CJD-RPD and healthy control groups. Serum-tau would be a simple and useful marker to distinguish CJD from AD and non-CJD-RPD, requiring further large study to confirm this. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{life span}} {{and lack of}} {{medication}} for prevention or treatment of <b>progressive</b> <b>dementias</b> will significantly {{increase the number of}} individuals with advanced dementia worldwide.

This paper is presenting measures that may be used in this patient population. Evaluation of global goals of palliative care may include measuring quality of life by QUALID scale, comfort by DS-DAT scale, and engagement by MPES scale. Symptom control may be achieved by measuring pain by PAINAD or PACSLAC scales, by evaluating behavioral symptoms and their management (agitation by SOAPD scale, apathy by AES scale and rejection of care by RTC-DAT scale), and by monitoring patients for dyspnea using RDOS scale. Outcomes of palliative care {{at the end of life}} may be evaluated by EOLD-CAD scale and by determining family satisfaction with care (EOLD-SWC).

40|$|The {{cognitive}} processes supporting spatial navigation are {{considered in the}} context of a patient (CF) with possible very early Alzheimer's disease who presents with topographical disorientation. Her verbal memory and her recognition memory for unknown buildings, landmarks and outdoor scenes was intact, although she showed an impairment in face processing. By contrast, her navigational ability, quantitatively assessed within a small virtual reality (VR) town, was significantly impaired. Interestingly, she showed a selective impairment in a VR object-location memory test whenever her viewpoint was shifted between presentation and test, but not when tested from the same viewpoint. We suggest that a specific impairment in locating objects relative to the environment rather than relative to the perceived viewpoint (i. e. allocentric rather than egocentric spatial memory) underlies her topographical disorientation. We discuss the likely neural bases of this deficit in the light of related studies in humans and animals, focusing on the hippocampus and related areas. The specificity of our test indicates a new way of assessing topographical disorientation, with possible application to the assessment of <b>progressive</b> <b>dementias</b> such as Alzheimer's disease...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neurofilament light (NFL) and heavy chain (NFHp 35), total tau (t-tau), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to detect disease specific profiles in sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (sCJD) patients and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. CSF levels of NFL, NFHp 35, t-tau, and GFAP of 23 sCJD patients and 55 AD patients were analyzed and compared to non-demented controls. Median NFL, NFHp 35, GFAP, and t-tau levels were significantly increased in sCJD patients and AD patients versus controls (p < 0. 0001 in all). NFL, NFHp 35, and t-tau levels were significantly increased in sCJD patients versus AD patients (p < 0. 005), but GFAP concentrations did not differ between sCJD and AD. The results suggest that neuroaxonal damage, reflected by higher CSF levels of NFL, NFHp 35, and t-tau, is more pronounced in the pathophysiology of sCJD than in AD. The comparable CSF GFAP concentrations suggest that astroglial damage or astrocytosis is equally pronounced in the pathophysiology of AD and sCJD.

40|$|Importance: Early and {{accurate}} in vivo diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) {{is necessary for}} quickly distinguishing treatable from untreatable rapidly <b>progressive</b> <b>dementias</b> and for future therapeutic trials. This early diagnosis is becoming possible using the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) seeding assay, which detects minute amounts of the disease-specific pathologic prion protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or olfactory mucosa (OM) samples. Objective: To develop an algorithm for accurate and early diagnosis of CJD by using the RT-QuIC assay on CSF samples, OM samples, or both. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-control study, samples of CSF and OM were collected from 86 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable (n[*]=[*] 51), possible (n[*]=[*] 24), or suspected (n[*]=[*] 11) CJD and 104 negative control samples (54 CSF and 50 OM). The CSF and OM samples were analyzed using conventional RT-QuIC. The CSF samples underwent further testing using improved RT-QuIC conditions. In addition, the diagnostic performance of a novel, easy-to-use, gentle flocked swab for sampling of OM was evaluated. Data were collected from January 1 to June 30, 2015. Main Outcome and Measures: Correlations between RT-QuIC results and the final diagnosis of recruited patients. Results: Among the 86 patients (37 men [43...|$|R
