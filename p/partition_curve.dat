40|$|Traditional sink-float {{methods for}} {{measuring}} the density distribution of particulate samples rely on expensive and toxic heavy liquids. An alternative method has been developed which uses aqueous glycerol solutions in a laboratory-scale Reflux Classifier run in semi-batch mode. The high viscosity of these solutions promotes laminar high-shear flow in the channels which suppresses the effect of particle size on separation performance. Thus this technique was able to accurately measure the yield-ash curve of coal samples, and from this their density distribution could be inferred. Applying this approach to feed, product and reject samples enabled calculation of the density partition separation performance. Samples were collected from two case studies: a laboratory-scale continuous Reflux Classifier and a single spiral start from a full-scale coal handling and preparation plant.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{determining}} the efficiency curves - i. e. partition number versus particle volumetric grade - for two-product separators is presented. Areal grade measurements are made on polished sections of the feed, the concentrate and the tailings of the separator and a kernel-based inversion technique is then used to obtain the volumetric grade distribution of the three assemblages of particles. The inversion is constrained by mass-balance equations. A plain kernel (by number of occurrences) and a weighted kernel (each occurrence counted with its area) are used for the solution. The weighted damped least-squares solution minimizes balance error and provides the <b>partition</b> <b>curves</b> of the separator.

In this work, we present a new method to analyze partition data obtained by this technique {{based on the assumption}} that the number of fluorescently-labeled protein molecules bound per liposome follows a Poisson distribution. To not overestimate the recovered partition coefficients, we first show that the variation in liposome brightness caused by this statistical distribution must be considered explicitly in data analysis when the parameter used to establish the <b>partition</b> <b>curves</b> is the fractional instead of the absolute amplitudes associated with the slowest diffusing particles in the system (lipid vesicles), a choice frequently made in FCS partition studies. We further extend the theoretical model describing the membrane partition of a fluorescently-labeled protein by considering the presence of a trace amount of free fluorescent dye (non-binding component) in the system. We show that this situation can account for an apparent maximal binding level lower than 100 % in the experimental <b>partitioning</b> <b>curves</b> obtained for Alexa 488 fluorescently-labeled lysozyme and liposomes prepared with variable anionic phospholipid content.

In {{this study we}} explore the diagnostic potential of hydrograph partitioning for model calibration in mountain areas, where meltwater from snow and glaciers is an important source for river runoff (in addition to rainwater). We propose an index-based method to partition the hydrograph according to dominant runoff water sources, and a diagnostic approach to calibrate a mountain hydrological model. First, by accounting for the seasonal variability of precipitation and the altitudinal variability of temperature and snow/glacier coverage, we develop a set of indices to indicate the daily status of runoff generation from each type of water source (i. e., glacier meltwater, snow meltwater, rainwater, and groundwater). Second, these indices are used to partition a hydrograph into four parts associated with four different combinations of dominant water sources (i. e., groundwater, groundwater + snow meltwater, groundwater + snow meltwater + glacier meltwater, and groundwater + snow meltwater + glacier meltwater + rainwater). Third, the hydrological model parameters are grouped by the associated runoff sources, and each group is calibrated to match the corresponding hydrograph partition in a stepwise and iterative manner. Similar to use of the regime curve to diagnose seasonality of streamflow, the hydrograph <b>partitioning</b> <b>curve</b> based on a dominant runoff water source (more briefly called the <b>partitioning</b> <b>curve,</b> not necessarily continuous) {{can serve as a}} diagnostic signature that helps relate model performance to model components.

The imperfect separation given by these systems and the use of large density ranges lead to the determination of apparent partition curves instead of actual partition curves for the process.

40|$|Many of the {{empirical}} hydrocyclone cut size models available consider the feed solids {{content to be}} an important variable in determining the efficiency and resultant classification. However, feed viscosity as a whole is admittedly a more accurate variable to consider as it can be affected by many factors, including solids content, particle size distribution, particle size, mineralogy, pulp chemistry, particle shape and carrier fluid temperature. Earlier theoretical models did try to incorporate slurry viscosity but were developed for very low solids content systems due to the difficulty in measuring slurry viscosity at higher concentrations. Current hydrocyclone models being applied in industry have difficulty in predicting rheological fluctuations at constant solids content, for example with an increase in feed clay content. Investigations, focussed on expanding the studies of previous researchers in this area, were conducted. Experiments involved the design and operation of two test rigs incorporating three hydrocyclone sizes (75, 100, 165 mm), with two different ore types (platreef ore, copper ore) from a secondary stage operation used as the feed material. A change in relative viscosity was investigated by altering the viscosity of the carrier fluid (water) by the addition of sucrose, and modification of the slurry temperature. Hydrocyclone feed flow rate and solids content were also modified. A custom made on-line tube rheometer allowed viscosities of feed concentrations of up to 43 % (by vol.) to be measured over a range of shear rates (200 /s to 1500 /s). The slurries under investigation were found to be settling in nature, and therefore a decision was made to exclude data below the critical settling velocity of the tube. Rheological characterisations revealed both ore types exhibited Bingham plastic behaviour. A concentration versus viscosity relationship was determined from the rheological data and the resultant viscosity values were then linked to hydrocyclone efficiency. The significant findings of this work included the following: * Increased pulp viscosity achieved by 1) sucrose addition and 2) decreased slurry temperatures resulted in a drop in hydrocyclone performance attributed to the combined effect on the <b>partition</b> <b>curve</b> parameters namely - an increased cut size (d 50 c), decreased water split to O/F (C) and reduced value of alpha. *Increased pulp viscosity achieved by 3) feed solids content had dissimilar effects on the <b>partition</b> <b>curve</b> parameters. An optimum viscosity point was reached for water split to O/F and alpha parameters, however cut size increased with increased pulp viscosity. * Rheological effects on the cut size parameter appeared more significant for the largest of the three cyclone body diameters used in the study. This {{can be attributed to the}} decreased tangential velocities inside the larger cyclone radius. The combined rheology and hydrocyclone data from this thesis will provide useful validation data for the new hydrocyclone models currently being developed as part of the P 9 project.

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{transport of}} particles of different densities along inclined channels was examined using the reflux classifier (RC), a novel system {{consisting of a}} set of parallel inclined plates above a fluidized bed. Fluidization water is passed through the base of the vessel, suspending the system of particles, in turn entraining the particles through a set of inclined channels. Sand, ilmenite and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles were used in separate investigations. Faster settling particles tended to deposit onto the inclined surfaces and slide back down, and hence return to the fluidized bed. Slower settling particles remained suspended and hence reported with the overflow water. Over time, a semi-batch separation was achieved and a <b>partition</b> <b>curve</b> produced. A generalized empirical relationship which takes into account the superficial fluidization velocity, aspect ratio of the channels, angle of inclination of the channels and particle Reynolds number was developed in order to describe the broad range of experimental data. The relationship should prove useful in predicting the separations from the RC under specific conditions and the likely throughput advantage of the RC over a conventional fluidized bed. The asymptotic form of the relationship, obtained for an infinite channel aspect ratio, provides a description relevant to hydraulic conveying, especially in the area of directional drilling in which particles are conveyed up the inclines. This relationship also indicates the strong potential for separating particles on the basis of density, with the analysis indicating no particle size dependence when the particle Reynolds number is relatively high...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, coal {{washability}} analysis, {{which is}} used to obtain the cumulative yield—ash % relationship—has traditionally been generated using the float-sink method AS 4156. 1 - 1994. This technique relies on heavy organic liquids to fractionate coal and mineral particles based on particle density. These organic liquids are considered problematic for health, safety, and environmental reasons. This paper examines water-based methods for attaining coal washability data for - 50 + 0. 045 mm particles, covering a water fluidization method based on the Reflux Classifier, and two batch jigging devices. Data produced by the three methods are compared with results obtained using the float-sink method. The cumulative yield versus cumulative ash curves generated by all three methods were found to be in reasonable agreement with the data obtained using the float-sink method, but with a consistent discrepancy evident at relatively low ash levels. The discrepancy was attributed to the effects of dispersion, a phenomenon inherent in most particle separation processes. The fractionation achieved using the Reflux Classifier required further fractionation by size separation, while the two jigs generally required no fractionation by size provided the initial size range was not too broad. The Boner Jig, in which the vessel is moved up and down at a given frequency and amplitude, showed the best performance on the - 16 + 0. 25 mm sizerange. The Mintek Jig, in which the upward fluid flow is varied, showed the best performance on the - 50 + 16 mm size range. For the ultrafine particles, covering the size range - 0. 25 + 0. 045 mm, the Reflux Classifier proved to be the ideal choice, achieving higher yields than multistage flotation. It was also demonstrated, using the data from the Reflux Classifier, that the ‘‘true’’ washability data could be deduced mathematically by combining a model of the separation process, with the normalized <b>partition</b> <b>curve...</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to provide an {{overview}} on mock theta functions and their connection to weak Maass forms. The theory of modular forms has important applications to many areas of mathematics, e. g. qua-dratic forms, elliptic <b>curves,</b> <b>partitions</b> as well as other areas throughout mathematics.

40|$|In {{this work}} an activator-depleted reaction-diffusion system is {{investigated}} on polar coordinates {{with the aim}} of exploring the relationship and the corresponding influence of domain size on the types of possible diffusion-driven instabilities. Quantitative relationships are found in the form of necessary conditions on the area of a disk-shape domain with respect to the diffusion and reaction rates for certain types of diffusion-driven instabilities to occur. Robust analytical methods are applied to find explicit expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the diffusion operator on a disk-shape domain with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions in polar coordinates. Spectral methods are applied using chebyshev non-periodic grid for the radial variable and Fourier periodic grid on the angular variable to verify the nodal lines and eigen-surfaces subject to the proposed analytical findings. The full classification of the parameter space in light of the bifurcation analysis is obtained and numerically verified by finding the solutions of the <b>partitioning</b> <b>curves</b> inducing such a classification. Furthermore, analytical results are found relating the area of (disk-shape) domain with reaction-diffusion rates in the form of necessary conditions for the different types of bifurcations. These results are on one hand presented in the form of mathematical theorems with rigorous proofs, and, on the other hand using finite element method, each claim of the corresponding theorems are verified by obtaining the theoretically predicted behaviour of the dynamics in the numerical simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of jig {{technology to the}} recovery of diamonds in kimberlite and alluvial deposits {{has long been known}} and accepted The current drive to maximize the recovery from resources has triggered a resurgence of interest in the retreatment of tailings deposits. Due to the typically very low grades of these resources, innovative thinking is required in order to treat them profitably. The De Beers Group saw this opportunity about 4 years ago at the Williamson Mine in Tanzania and installed 6 InLine Pressure Jigs, supplied by Gekko Systems, as pre-concentrators ahead of a conventional Dense Media Separation plant. Installation and operational issues militated against the success of this plant until late 2004 when a joint De Beers/Williamson/Gekko initiative was launched to rectify the installation and resolve the issues. Process control instrumentation was retrofitted to one IPJ and a battery of recovery tests were performed, yielding 100 % recovery of simulants and tracers. <b>Partition</b> <b>curves</b> were plotted and an operating regime for continuous operation was recommended based on the excellent results obtained. Simultaneously, Namdeb have adopted IPJ technology for the purpose of shell removal in marine/alluvial gravels on the Floating Treatment Plant and for the Pocket Beaches mobile plant. and to explore the possibility of preconcentration of all diamondiferous materials on the West Coast. Operating data and test results are presented from both the Williamson tests and the Namdeb operations...|$|R
