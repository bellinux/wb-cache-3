The DC-DC converter is {{considered as a}} hybrid system and modeled by Mixed Logical Dynamical modeling approach. The main objective of the paper is to design a Fuzzy Predictive Control to achieve desired voltage output without increasing complexity of the hybrid model of DC-DC converter in various conditions. A model {{predictive control}} is designed based on the hybrid model and applied to the system. Although {{the performance of the}} model predictive control method is satisfactory in normal condition, it suffers from lack of robustness in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> and uncertainty. So, to succeed in facing up to the problem a fuzzy supervisor is utilized to adjust the main predictive controller based on the measured states of the system. In this paper it is shown that the proposed fuzzy predictive control scheme has advantages such as simplicity and efficiency in normal operation and robustness in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> and uncertainty.

This controller does not need the knowledge of modal variables and spacecraft angular velocity. The absence of measurements of these variables is compensated by appropriate dynamics of the controller, which supplies their estimates. The Lyapunov technique is applied in the design of this dynamic controller. Possible source of instability of the controlled system in real cases are the influence of the flexibility on the rigid motion, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> acting on the structure, and parameter variations.
