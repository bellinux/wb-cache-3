25|$|When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Azzam {{issued a}} fatwa, Defence of the Muslim Lands, the First Obligation after Faith declaring {{that both the}} Afghan and Palestinian struggles were jihads in which killing {{occupiers}} of your land (no matter what their faith) was fard ayn (a <b>personal</b> <b>obligation)</b> for all Muslims. The edict was supported by Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti, Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of Cumberland is expounded in De legibus naturae. Its main design is {{to combat the}} principles which Hobbes had promulgated as to the constitution of man, the nature of morality, and the origin of society, and to prove that self-advantage is not the chief end of man, that force is not the source of <b>personal</b> <b>obligation</b> to moral conduct nor the foundation of social rights, and {{that the state of}} nature is not a state of war. The views of Hobbes seem to Cumberland utterly subversive of religion, morality and civil society. He endeavours, as a rule, to establish directly antagonistic propositions. He refrains, however, from denunciation, and is a fair opponent up to the measure of his insight.|$|E
500|$|Where a {{beneficiary}} under {{a secret}} trust predeceases the testator, {{his or her}} personal representative will inherit instead, as in Re Gardner. If the gift had been made directly as part of testator's will it would have lapsed and formed part {{of his or her}} residuary estate by the beneficiary's death, but since he or she inherits {{as a result of a}} separate secret trust that rule does not apply. Where the trustee of a secret trust predeceases the testator, or renounces his trusteeship before the death of the testator, the position of the secret trust in unclear. In the case of a half-secret trust, the trust ought to be good on the basis that [...] "equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee". Of a fully secret trust, it was indicated by Lord Buckmaster in Blackwell v Blackwell that such a trust might not fail: [...] "the legatee might defeat the whole purpose by renouncing the legacy... I entertain no doubt that the Court, having once admitted the evidence of the trust, would interfere to prevent its defeat." [...] Against this, it has been argued that the arrangement is the result of a <b>personal</b> <b>obligation</b> as thus fails if renounced or if the trustee predeceases the testator.|$|E

2500|$|In the High Court Deakin and Lyne {{continued}} to be represented by Higgins , apparently {{in his capacity as}} the then Attorney-General, and the Commissioner {{continued to}} be represented by Isaacs [...] The argument recorded in the Commonwealth Law Reports does not set out any objection that the decision would directly affect the interests of the judges. The arguments for Deakin and Lyne were that their salaries were not earned in Victoria, but in Australia as a whole. The tax was unlawful as an interference between an officer of the Commonwealth and the Government. The Commissioner argued that income tax was a <b>personal</b> <b>obligation</b> that did not depend upon the source of the income being from the Commonwealth, the Income Tax Act 1895 was a valid Act in 1895 and did not become invalid {{as a result of the}} passage of the Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1976, Buchanan {{convinced}} {{the owner of}} a Michigan printing company that he could help the business grow. The two founded American Speedy Printing, which grew through franchising to more than 730 stores in 44 states. Later, Buchanan and American Speedy were defendants in a string of lawsuits during the late 1980s and early 1990s by franchisees and master franchisees, who said they were not making the money that Buchanan had said they could expect. After the bankruptcy, he was accused by a creditors committee of taking excessive compensation and actions that resulted in overstated earnings for American Speedy. In a 1995 deposition, {{he said that he had}} no <b>personal</b> <b>obligation</b> to repay the loan from Merrill Lynch; a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over taxes [...] on the money Buchanan received from Merrill Lynch stretched through the 1990s. Buchanan, his business partner, and Merrill Lynch were sued violating the Michigan Corporation Act. It ended with Buchanan paying $1.5 million.|$|E
2500|$|Transnational Islamist ideology, {{specifically}} of {{the militant}} Islamists, assert that Western policies and society are actively anti-Islamic, or {{as it is}} sometimes described, waging a [...] "war against Islam". Islamists often identify {{what they see as}} a historical struggle between Christianity and Islam, dating back as far as the Crusades, among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. Osama bin Laden, for example, almost invariably described his enemy as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. Defensive jihad differs from offensive jihad in being [...] "fard al-ayn", or a <b>personal</b> <b>obligation</b> of all Muslims, rather than [...] "fard al-kifaya", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required from others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than an aggressor, and of giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.|$|E

2500|$|... "Consideration" [...] {{indicates}} {{the fact that}} all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of estoppel or culpa in contrahendo, can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations. In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding. In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply {{on the basis of a}} [...] "meeting of the minds" [...] or a [...] "concurrence of wills". Germany has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their 'abstraction principle' (Abstraktionsprinzip) means that the <b>personal</b> <b>obligation</b> of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract) the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. Unjust enrichment law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.|$|E
