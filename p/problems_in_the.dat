5|$|Lameness in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due to pain in {{any part of}} the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. Lameness can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop lameness, trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E
