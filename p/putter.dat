5|$|Jazz {{musician}} <b>Putter</b> Smith {{was invited}} by Harry Saltzman to play Mr. Kidd, after a Thelonious Monk Band show. Musician Paul Williams was originally cast as Mr. Wint. When he couldn't {{agree with the}} producers on compensation, Bruce Glover replaced him.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{researches}} of influence of indicators of absolute force on parameters of technical preparedness of the qualified shot <b>putters</b> are presented. Purpose: to investigate influence {{of the level of}} development of absolute force on indicators of technical preparedness of the qualified shot <b>putters.</b> Material & Methods: analysis and generalization of scientific and methodical literature, pedagogical testing, video filming with the subsequent biomechanical analysis, methods of mathematical statistics. 12 qualified shot <b>putters</b> participated in the research. Results: the high correlation interrelation between the level of development of absolute force and separate indicators of technical preparedness of shot <b>putters</b> is revealed. Conclusions: technical preparedness of shot <b>putters</b> farthest depends on the level of development of absolute muscular strength of legs, chest and hands, in particular, triceps...|$|R
50|$|Other {{designers}} in {{the golf}} industry noticed Bettinardi’s work {{which led to}} Robert making <b>putters</b> for Scotty Cameron from 1993-1998.

50|$|The first PGA Tour victory {{while using}} a PING club came in 1962 at the Cajun Classic Open Invitational by John Barnum.

5|$|The United States sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China. A total of 213 U.S. competitors took part in 18 sports; the only 2 sports Americans did not compete in were soccer 5-a-side and 7-a-side. The American delegation included 16 {{former members of the}} U.S. military, including 3 veterans of the Iraq War. Among them were shot <b>putter</b> Scott Winkler, who was paralyzed in an accident in Iraq, and swimmer Melissa Stockwell, a former United States Army officer who lost her left leg to a roadside bomb in the war.|$|E
5|$|Hunter played {{high school}} {{football}} at Canonsburg High School in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, {{where he was a}} three-year starter as an offensive and defensive tackle. In 1950, he was co-captain of the WPIAL Class A football champions while earning All-Conference, All-County, All-WPIAL and All-State honors. He was a three-year heavyweight in wrestling at Canonsburg, recording 18 pins with a total of 33 wins, six losses and four ties. Hunter also won three letters in track and field as a sprinter, shot <b>putter,</b> discus thrower and javelin thrower. He was inducted into the Washington-Greene County Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 2001. He also became an Eagle Scout while he was in high school.|$|E

He {{was used as a}} quarterback in 1941, his sophomore year. He also played as a linebacker and a placekicker. Saban was named to the Associated Press All-Big Ten second team as a quarterback in 1942. He was the captain of Indiana's 1942 team and was selected as its most valuable player. Saban was also a standout shot <b>putter,</b> winning a Big Ten Conference competition at Illinois Institute of Technology in 1943 with a throw of 48 feet and 11 1/2 inches.|$|E
50|$|<b>Putters</b> are {{a special}} class of clubs with a loft not {{exceeding}} ten degrees, designed primarily {{to roll the}} ball along the grass, generally from a point on the putting green toward the hole. Contrary to popular belief, <b>putters</b> do have a loft (often 5° from truly perpendicular at impact) that helps to lift the ball from any indentation it has made. Newer <b>putters</b> also include grooves on the face to promote roll rather than a skid off the impact. This increases rolling distance and reduces bouncing over the turf. <b>Putters</b> are the only class of club allowed to have certain features, such as two striking faces, non-circular grip cross-sections, bent shafts or hosels, and appendages designed primarily to aid players' aim.|$|R

5|$|The American {{track and}} field team {{consisted}} of 26 men and 17 women. Among them was shot <b>putter</b> Scott Winkler, a U.S. Army veteran who was paralyzed in Tikrit, Iraq in 2003 after he fell off a truck while holding 50 pounds of ammunition. The team set six world records and won a total of nine gold, fourteen silver, and five bronze medals, two more medals than the team won in Athens. Jessica Galli won five medals, {{more than any other}} team member, while Amanda McGrory, Tatyana McFadden, and Jim Bob Bizzell each won at least three medals. Jeremy Campbell was the only U.S. {{track and field}} athlete to win two golds.|$|E
5|$|Zara Northover {{represented}} Jamaica at the Beijing Olympics as {{its only}} female shot <b>putter</b> of the games. Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and an athlete affiliated with Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, Northover participated for in Beijing {{at the age}} of 24. She had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the August 15 qualification round, Northover was placed in the second heat. She competed against 16 other athletes. Northover put the shot 15.85meters, placing last out of the 16 finishing athletes in her heat. Georgia's Mariami Kevkhishvili-Machavariani placed ahead of her (15.99meters). Her heat was led by China's Gong Lijiao (19.46meters) and Belarus' Nadzeya Ostapchuk (19.08meters). Overall, Northover ranked 31st of the 33 athletes who completed the qualification round. She did not advance to the finals the next day.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} chaff dispenser and Orange <b>Putter</b> tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} anthropometric and somatotypical differences between German male junior shot <b>putters</b> (n = 19) and javelin throwers (n = 19). Recreational athletes (n = 11) {{served as the}} control group (age range 16 – 23 years). Overall, the shot-putters were larger and had longer legs and arms {{as compared to the}} junior javelin throwers. For the smaller javelin throwers of the higher performance category shorter legs compared to the height of the hull were observed on average. There was a notably shorter leg of the spear throwers. The powerful javelin throwers had longer arms than the less powerful. For all anthropometric widths and depths, and the circumferences and the body weight, the junior shout <b>putters</b> achieved higher values than the spear throwers and recreational athletes. The skinfold thicknesses, the body fat mass and the BMI were highest among the shot <b>putters.</b> The shot <b>putters</b> had the highest values for endomorphy and pyknomorphia (Knussmann), on the other hand, the lowest values for ectomorphy. For the shot <b>putters</b> body height, shoulder width, hand width, foot width, chest circumference, minimal forearm circumference, calf circumference, arm span, plastic index and macrosomia were positively related to performance. Some skinfolds (calf, thigh) correlated negatively with the shot put distances. For the javelin throwers radiale, stylion, dactylion and ectomorphy correlated negatively with the throw widths, but the AKS index, the BMI, the Quetelet index, the Rohrer index, the Livi index, the Pelidisi index, the Broca index, mesomorphy, the metric index and plastic index correlated positively with the performance. The higher class shot <b>putters</b> of the present study achieved a mean somatotype of 2. 9 – 5. 6 – 1. 1 and the higher class javelin throwers of 2. 1 – 4. 9 – 1. 8. As the shot <b>putters</b> and the javelin throwers of the present investigation were rather young, there is still a significant development potential for the mesomorphic component in comparison to Olympians...|$|R
