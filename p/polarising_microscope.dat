50|$|A micellar cubic {{phase is}} a lyotropic liquid crystal phase formed when the {{concentration}} of micelles dispersed in a solvent (usually water) is sufficiently high that {{they are forced to}} pack into a structure having long-ranged positional (translational) order. For example, spherical micelles a subic packing of a body-centred cubic lattice. Normal topology micellar cubic phases, denoted by the symbol I1, are the first lyotropic liquid crystalline phases that are formed by type I amphiphiles. The amphiphiles' hydrocarbon tails are contained {{on the inside of the}} micelle and hence the polar-apolar interface of the aggregates has a positive mean curvature, by definition (it curves away from the polar phase). Inverse topology micellar cubic phases (such as the Fd3m phase) are observed for some type II amphiphiles at very high amphiphile concentrations. These aggregates, in which water is the minority phase, have a polar-apolar interface with a negative mean curvature. The structures of the normal topology micellar cubic phases that are formed by some types of amphiphiles (e.g. the oligoethyleneoxide monoalkyl ether series of non-ionic surfactants are the subject of debate. Micellar cubic phases are isotropic phases, but are distinguished from micellar solutions by their very high viscosity. When thin film samples of micellar cubic phases are viewed under a <b>polarising</b> <b>microscope</b> they appear dark and featureless. Small air bubbles trapped in these preparations tend to appear highly distorted and occasionally have faceted surfaces.|$|E

The study suggests that it is likely that more than one clay source was used for production of this pottery, but that most of the pottery comes from a single source. This finding is in line with previous studies which suggest some trading of pottery between the Fijian islands but a single source of clay for most of the pottery found at Bouwera.

Aim The aim of this paper was to determine the thickness of the primary and secondary dentine around the main foramen of the mesial and distal root of the lower first permanent molar in teeth of various ages. Material and Method Fifty extracted lower first molars of both male and female patients extracted for various reasons were used in the study. All teeth were allocated to three age groups: under 25 years old (15 teeth), between 26 and 50 (20 teeth) and over 51 years old (15 teeth). After access cavity preparation, canal orifices were enlarged and root canals were explored using hand K-files # 10. Using a diamond disc, the root tip was then cut off {{in the area of the}} apical foramen. Dentine thickness was determined using a complex configuration comprising of several devices which were interconnected by software. These included a <b>polarised</b> <b>microscope</b> (Leica DMLSP), a digital camera (Leica DC 300) and a scanner. Results The results showed that the greatest mean thickness of the primary dentine was in the mesial root of the first lower molar in the first age group (0. 177 mm), followed by the third (0. 145 mm) whilst the least mean thickness was observed in the second age group (0. 141 mm). In the distal root, the mean thickness of the primary dentine was in the second (0. 175 mm), then the first (0. 138 mm) and finally the third group (0. 100 mm). The mean thickness of the secondary dentine in the mesial root was observed in the second group (1. 25 mm), followed by the third (1. 11 mm) whilst the least mean thickness was found in the first age group (0. 95 mm). The mean thickness of the secondary dentine in the distal root was observed in the second group (1. 26 mm), then the third (1. 18 mm) whilst the least mean thickness was found in the first age group (0. 99 mm).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals that appear as non-birefringent when observed under the <b>polarised</b> light <b>microscope.</b>  METHODS—Two observers examined independently 10  synovial fluid samples obtained during an episode of arthritis attributable to CPPD crystals. Ten synovial fluid samples from patients with acute gout were used as a reference. The examination was performed after placing a fluid sample in a Niebauer haemocytometric chamber; a crystal count was done first under ordinary light, then in the area corresponding to a 0. 1  ml, under polarised light RESULTS—The percentages of birefringence appreciated for CPPD were 18 % (confidence intervals (CI) 12,  24) for observer 1, and 17 % (CI 10,  24) for observer 2  (difference NS). The percentages of birefringence for monosodium urate were 127 % (CI 103,  151) for observer 1  and 107 % (CI 100,  114) for observer 2  (difference NS). Percentages above 100 % indicate that crystals missed under ordinary light became apparent under polarised light.  CONCLUSION—Only about one fifth of all CPPD crystals identified by bright field microscopy show birefringence when the same synovial fluid sample is observed under polarised light. If a search for CPPD crystals is conducted under polarised light, {{the majority of the}} crystals will be missed. Ordinary light allows a better rate of CPPD crystal detection but observation under polarised light of crystals showing birefringence is required for definitive CPPD crystal identification. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} is to characterized four series of azobenzene with different substituents to be employed as azobenzene-liquid crystal composite mixture in optical storage devices. Firstly, the azobenzene substituents effects on liquid crystallinity were observed under <b>polarising</b> optical <b>microscope</b> and their phase transition temperatures were confirmed by calorimetric study. After that, photoisomerisation studies were conducted in solution form by using UV–Vis spectrophotometer in order to measure the time required for cis–trans isomerisation in thermal back relaxation process. In azobenzene with fluorine addition, monofluoro azobenzene with ester functional group gave smectic-A and nematic phases with thermal back relaxation around 22 hours. Better results were obtained by azobenzene with olefinic terminal chain; the presence of alkene enhanced the thermal back relaxation to 45 hours due to the unsaturated bonding in the molecule, capable of photo-crosslinking. However, incorporation of group- 17 elements such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine in the olefinic azobenzene shorten the thermal back relaxation time although smectic-A and nematic phases were generated. Prototype of optical storage devices created showed good stability with high contrast display due to their thermal back relaxation and mesophases. This study is a bold step to tailor the property of light-sensitive azobenzene to make them suitable for optical storage device applications.

40|$|The {{influence}} of an endogenous surfactant present in Eudragit NE 30 D {{on the structure}} and drug release (clenbuterol) properties of thin matrices has been examined. Both drug-free and drug-loaded matrices {{were found to be}} non-isotropic in structure, the former having a marbled appearance under the <b>polarising</b> light <b>microscope,</b> and the latter showing numerous needle-shaped crystals. At loading above approx. 10 % w/w clenbuterol it was also possible to observe aggregates of the drug. Differential scanning calorimetry enabled the identification of melting peaks at approx. 50 °C for the needle-shaped crystals and approx. 80 °C for the larger drug aggregates. The former are composed of a surfactant used by the manufacturer for the synthesis of Eudragit NE 30 D by emulsion polymerization. This surfactant undergoes a phase separation from the polymer on storage at room temperature. It could, however, be extracted from the polymer by refluxing in water to yield an isotropic system. The extract showed a melting peak at 50 °C and also UV, IR, NMR, and mass spectra in accordance with an o-substituted nonyl phenol surfactant. Matrices prepared from the purified Eudragit NE 30 D showed drug release rates of only one third the magnitude of those found with matrices prepared from the raw polymer. Substantially reduced scatter in the release data was also found with the purified polymer...|$|R
