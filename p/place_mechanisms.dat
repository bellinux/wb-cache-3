50|$|The Diamond Model is a {{measurement}} framework that considers five dimensions {{for the assessment}} of the degree of innovation: Strategy, process, organization, linkages and learning. In the assessment of the strategy three areas are being tested. First the model needs to know, whether the company has a well-managed strategic planning process in place, afterwards, whether innovation is incorporated within the entire corporate strategy and ultimately, whether the company has put in <b>place</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that assist the implementation of the corporate strategy. The assessment of the process area considers the robustness and flexibility of the organization’s new product development process and the organization’s ability to manage its internal processes. In the third area organization is being analyzed, if the structure of the organization allows innovation processes and if the management encourages employees to create and develop new ideas. Concerning the linkages area the model examines the firm’s networking ability and the last major area of the Diamond Model explores the organization’s commitment and ability to learn from its successes and failures and the willingness to train and develop its employees and to spread these learning to the entire organization. The more distinctive these five areas are as a combination the more innovative is a company.|$|E

They may be planned {{to last for}} 1 or 2 years, but 8-10 year plans are very common; {{exceptionally}} long is an offset like Al Yamamah Program, a BAE-UK offset in Saudi Arabia in place since 1987. Clients (sovereign countries) have in <b>place</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to control their implementations, and to certificate milestone accomplishments in their offset programs. An offset supervision authority certifies the advancement in the offset completion in percentages, issuing offset certificates. These certificates may be issued to prime contractors fulfilling their offset agreement, but also to offset fulfillers, that have subcontracted the job from prime contractors and registered as such in the foreign countries. When there are multipliers, such certificates express the percentage of completion in [...] "credit value" [...] ("actual value" [...] X multiplier). Offset fulfillers redeems the offsets certificates through contracts or subcontracts with the prime contractor. More recently, given the importance {{and the growth of}} offset practices around the world, offset fulfillers can “sell” their certificates to prime contractors other than their initial one, {{as long as they have}} national offset commissions authorizations. In this profitable niche of defense industry made by offset specialists, lawyers and companies - there is also a “currency” and a “trade” of offset certificates.|$|E

40|$|To better {{understand}} the processing of complex high-frequency sounds, modulation-detection thresholds were measured for sinusoidal frequency modulation (SFM), quasi-frequency modulation (QFM), sinusoidal amplitude modulation (SAM), and random-phase FM (RPFM). At the lowest modulation frequency (5 Hz) modulation thresholds expressed as AM depth were similar for RPFM, SAM and QFM suggesting the predominance of envelope cues. At the higher modulation frequencies (20 and 40 Hz) thresholds expressed as total frequency excursions were similar for SFM and QFM suggesting a common mechanism, one perhaps based on single-channel FM-to-AM conversion or on a multi-channel <b>place</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The fact that the nominal envelopes of SFM and QFM are different (SFM has a flat envelope), seems to preclude processing based on the envelope of the external stimulus.
