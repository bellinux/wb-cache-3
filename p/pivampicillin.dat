50|$|Clinically used prodrugs {{containing}} pivaloyloxymethyl groups include adefovir dipivoxil, <b>pivampicillin,</b> cefditoren pivoxil, pivmecillinam, and valproate pivoxil. Tenofovir disoproxil {{contains a}} very similar prodrug group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pivampicillin</b> is a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of ampicillin. It is a prodrug, {{which is}} thought to enhance the oral {{bioavailability}} of ampicillin because of its greater lipophilicity {{compared to that of}} ampicillin.|$|E
50|$|Prodrugs that release pivalic acid when {{broken down}} by the body—such as <b>pivampicillin,</b> {{pivmecillinam}} and cefditoren pivoxil—have long been known to deplete levels of carnitine. This is not due to the drug itself, but to pivalate, which is mostly removed from the body by forming a conjugate with carnitine. Although short-term use of these drugs can cause a marked decrease in blood levels of carnitine, {{it is unlikely to}} be of clinical significance; long-term use, however, appears problematic and is not recommended.|$|E
40|$|Studies on <b>pivampicillin</b> {{hydrochloride}} and ampicillin trihydrate, {{administered in}} capsules to healthy volunteers, indicated that <b>pivampicillin</b> was absorbed more efficiently from the gastrointestinal tract than ampicillin. Average peak concentrations of ampicillin in the serum after doses equimolar to 250 mg of ampicillin were 6. 8 μg/ml at 56 min with <b>pivampicillin</b> and 1. 96 μg/ml at 1 h 24 min with ampicillin. The maximal concentration after <b>pivampicillin</b> treatment was also {{higher than that}} recorded when twice the equimolar dose of ampicillin, which averaged 3. 2 μg/ml at 1 h 42 min, was used. The urinary excretion of ampicillin, expressed {{as a percentage of}} the administered dose, averaged 67 to 73 and 25 to 29 % after administration of <b>pivampicillin</b> and ampicillin, respectively. The bioavailability of ampicillin, taken as the area under the serum curve, obtained with <b>pivampicillin</b> at a 250 -mg ampicillin dose level was superior to that obtained with a 500 -mg dose of ampicillin. Comparison of a suspension intended for children, containing the <b>pivampicillin</b> free base with a suspension of ampicillin trihydrate, emphasized the difference recorded for the capsule preparations. Administration of <b>pivampicillin</b> with a meal rich in fat and protein had no depressant effect on the absorption.

40|$|In a {{randomised}} single blind study, <b>pivampicillin</b> {{was compared}} with erythromycin {{in women with}} urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infections. The <b>pivampicillin</b> dosage was 700 mg twice a day and the erythromycin dosage 500 mg twice a day for seven days. Follow up took place on days 7 and 14 {{after the start of}} treatment. All 26 women treated with <b>pivampicillin</b> were culture negative for chlamydiae at the first and second follow up visits. All 23 women who received erythromycin were culture negative at the first follow up visit, but one was culture positive at the second follow up visit. Gastrointestinal side effects were recorded in five patients receiving <b>pivampicillin</b> and in nine receiving erythromycin.

40|$|A 51 {{year old}} female {{developed}} a skeletal muscle myopathy after 3 months of <b>pivampicillin</b> therapy. <b>Pivampicillin</b> can cause carnitine deficiency {{due to the}} pivalic acid side group. Plasma carnitine content and the patients symptoms failed to improve significantly on discontinuing the drug. Oral carnitine replacement therapy was administered for 6 weeks but the patient's plasma carnitine levels responded only slowly to this treatment. It is suggested that <b>pivampicillin</b> inhibits uptake of carnitine from the gut and may {{either directly or indirectly}} depress endogenous carnitine synthesis. In such cases a more aggressive carnitine replacement regime is indicated and <b>pivampicillin</b> should be avoided in patients requiring long-term antibiotic administration...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pivampicillin</b> was {{administered}} as an oral paste to five healthy adult horses, and an oral paste with ampicillin trihydrate {{was administered}} to three horses, <b>Pivampicillin</b> {{was administered to}} both starved and fed horses, ampicillin trihydrate was administered to fed horses only, The dose of <b>pivampicillin</b> was 19. 9 mg/kg, and the dose of ampicillin trihydrate was 17 mg/kg, Both doses are equivalent on a molecular basis to 15 mg/kg ampicillin, Ampicillin concentrations in plasma were determined up to 24 hours after administration, After administration of <b>pivampicillin</b> to starved and fed horses the mean areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCs) were 23. 0 and 19. 3 mu g. h. ml(- 1), respectively, After administration of ampicillintrihydrate to fed horses the mean AUC was 0. 7 mu g. h. ml(- 1). The peak plasma concentrations were 4. 8, 6. 7, and 0. 1 mu g/ml, after administration of <b>pivampicillin</b> to starved and fed horses and of ampicillin trihydrate to fed horses, respectively, There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in peak plasma concentration or AUC between <b>pivampicillin</b> administered to starved or fed horses, It is concluded that <b>pivampicillin</b> administered as an oral paste at a dose of 19. 9 mg/kg gives satisfactory plasma concentrations in both starved and fed horses, whereas ampicillin trihydrate produces negligible plasma concentrations, <b>Pivampicillin</b> binds to feedstuffs at the pH found in the horse's stomach and small intestine. After incubation for 6 h at pH 6, approximately 15 % remains in solution, and after incubation for 3 h at pH 1. 9, approximately 40 % remains in solution, Ampicillin, which binds to feedstuffs to a lesser extent, has a lower bioavailability than <b>pivampicillin,</b> Therefore, binding to feedstuffs {{does not seem to be}} a critical factor in the absorption of aminopenicillins...|$|E
40|$|Bacampicillin, a new oral prodrug {{which in}} vivo is rapidly {{transformed}} to ampicillin, was compared with ampicillin, <b>pivampicillin,</b> and amoxycillin in a randomized cross-over study on 11 healthy volunteers. All drugs were given in oral doses equimolar to 400 mg of bacampicillin (800 μmol). The {{mean of the}} individual peak concentrations in serum was 8. 3 μg/ml for bacampicillin, 7. 1 μg/ml for <b>pivampicillin,</b> 7. 7 μg/ml for amoxycillin, and 3. 7 μg/ml for ampicillin. Furthermore, bacampicillin had a higher absorption rate {{than all the other}} drugs, although there were statistically significant differences only versus ampicillin. The peak serum levels of the individual subjects were more dispersed with ampicillin and amoxycillin, suggesting a more uniform absorption of bacampicillin and <b>pivampicillin.</b> The relative bioavailability of bacampicillin and <b>pivampicillin</b> was comparable, whereas ampicillin was only 2 / 3 that of the others...|$|E

40|$|<b>Piv{{ampicillin}},</b> an ester of ampicillin hydrolyzed after oral administration, {{was given}} to 25 elderly patients suffering from urinary tract infections. Daily dosage was 3 x 700 mg. This treatment was well tolerated and gave good clinical results. Antibiotic concentration in serum, obtained 2 and 6 hr after oral administration of 700 mg of <b>pivampicillin</b> (an amount equivalent to 500 mg of ampicillin) averaged respectively 6. 1 and 1. 5 μg/ml; these levels are two times higher than those produced by ampicillin administered orally at the same dose.

40|$|The {{absorption}} and excretion of equivalent {{doses of}} ampicillin, <b>pivampicillin,</b> and amoxycillin were compared in 10 healthy volunteers after administration of these antibiotics in a randomized triple crossover fashion. As recommended, ampicillin and amoxycillin were administered {{on an empty}} stomach, whereas <b>pivampicillin</b> was given with breakfast. The mean half-life times were nearly identical for all three antibiotics: 60. 9 min for ampicillin; 58. 4 min for pivampicillin; and 62. 2 min for amoxycillin. The absorption of the drugs was evaluated according to the following three criteria: the mean peak serum levels; the “area under the curve”; {{and the percentage of}} recovery in urine. By these criteria, <b>pivampicillin</b> was the best-absorbed drug, with absorption 3. 0 to 3. 6 times higher than that of ampicillin and 1. 2 to 1. 5 times higher than that of amoxycillin, whereas the absorption of amoxycillin was 2. 1 to 2. 9 times higher than that of ampicillin...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 158 volunteers each {{received}} 21 repeated oral doses of 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil (CAE) during four comparative cross-over trials. Pharmacokinetics were studied in 8 volunteers (CAE versus ampicillin), relative bioavailability and tolerance were studied in 100 volunteers (CAE versus pivmecillinam and CAE versus <b>pivampicillin),</b> and tolerance alone was studied in 50 volunteers (CAE versus ampicillin). Overall, urinary recoveries {{of the active}} antibiotics ranked absorption of the drugs in the order least to greatest: pivmecillinam, ampicillin, CAE, and <b>pivampicillin.</b> The pharmacokinetics of CAE and ampicillin did not change after repeated dosing. Peak serum levels of cefuroxime {{were significantly higher than}} those of ampicillin after doses 1 and 21 but the urinary recoveries of both antibiotics were around 35 % of the dose. CAE was as well tolerated as ampicillin but there were smaller numbers of episodes of fluid bowel motions on pivmecillinam and <b>pivampicillin</b> than on CAE, which may have been due to the smaller amounts of active antibiotic in the doses of the pivaloyloxymethyl esters...|$|E
40|$|This single-blind, double-dummy, {{multicentre}} study compared oral azithromycin, administered as tablets, 500 mg once daily for 3 days, versus oral <b>pivampicillin,</b> 700 mg twice daily for 10 days, in adults with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (not needing parenteral antibiotic therapy, hospitalization or oxygen support). Clinical success (cure + improvement) rates were similar {{for both groups}} {{at the end of}} treatment (day 10; azithromycin, 124 of 133 [93 %]; <b>pivampicillin,</b> 79 of 92 [86 %]) and at follow-up (day 52; 98 of 126 [78 %] versus 66 of 81 [81 %]). The treatments produced similar levels of pathogen eradication at the end of treatment (49 of 54 [91 %] versus 32 of 37 [86 %]). Azithromycin-treated patients had significantly reduced chest discomfort at the end of treatment, and a trend towards improved lung function. The two groups were similar with respect to improvements in other clinical symptoms and patient well-being, and to the incidences of adverse events and treatment discontinuations. This oral azithromycin regime is an effective treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, similar in efficacy to the longer <b>pivampicillin</b> regime and may offer superior patient compliance...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of three ampicillins administered orally was {{compared with that}} of amoxicillin. In a random study involving 13 normal subjects, ampicillin tri-hydrate, ampicillin sodium, <b>pivampicillin,</b> and amoxicillin were administered in capsule form to the fasting subjects in dosages equivalent to 500 mg of ampi-cillin trihydrate. The kinetics of concentration of drug in blood were noted for 8 hr, and urinary recovery was determined for 24 hr. Microbiologic bioassay was performed by the agar diffusion test (cup plate method). Of the four antibiotics tested, amoxicillin had the highest average maximal serum level, the largest area under the curve of serum concentration, and the highest average amount elimi-nated in urine. Values for <b>pivampicillin</b> were also significantly higher than those for conventional ampicillin trihydrate. No significant differences were established between ampicillin sodium and ampicillin trihydrate.

40|$|Eight healthy volunteers {{received}} a 1, 000 -mg single oral dose of 2085 P {{which consisted of}} 800 mg of <b>pivampicillin</b> and 200 mg of brobactam. Concentrations of ampicillin and brobactam in plasma, inflammatory fluid, and urine were measured over the subsequent 24 h. <b>Pivampicillin</b> and brobactam were moderately rapidly absorbed. The mean (standard deviation) maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) of ampicillin was 8. 2 (1. 9) micrograms/ml, and that of brobactam was 2. 1 (2. 0) micrograms/ml at mean times of 1. 9 (0. 5) and 2. 3 (0. 8) h, respectively. The elimination half-lives in plasma were 1. 8 (0. 5) and 1. 6 (2. 0) h, respectively. Both agents penetrated the experimentally induced inflammatory fluid, reaching a mean maximum at 3 h. The Cmax of ampicillin was 6. 8 (2. 3) micrograms/ml, and that of brobactam was 1. 0 (0. 4) micrograms/ml. The penetration (derived by comparing the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity for inflammatory fluid with that for plasma) was 97. 3 % (26. 0 %) for ampicillin and 81 % (22. 3 %) for brobactam. The 24 -h urinary recovery was 54. 2 % (16. 6 %) of the administered dose for ampicillin and 40. 2 % (11. 4 %) for brobactam. These data suggest that this combination of beta-lactam and inhibitor should be efficacious in treating infections caused by ampicillin-resistant pathogens...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of ceftriaxone 250 mg given {{as a single}} intramuscular dose to treat genitourinary and pharyngeal gonorrhoea is compared with {{the outcome of the}} Danish standard treatment for uncomplicated genitourinary gonorrhoea, <b>pivampicillin</b> 1. 4 g and probenecid 1 g, both given by mouth. The study comprised 327 patients for whom the diagnosis of gonorrhoea was made by microscopy of a methylene blue stained smear at their first visit to the clinic and for whom the diagnosis was later confirmed by culture of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. One hundred and seventy patients with genitourinary gonorrhoea (18 with and 152 without concomitant pharyngeal infection) were treated with ceftriaxone. One hundred and fifty seven (17 with and 140 without concomitant pharyngeal infection) were treated with <b>pivampicillin.</b> One week after treatment N gonorrhoeae was isolated from none of 18, 1 / 152, (1 %), 11 / 17 (65 %), and 6 / 140 (4 %) patients, respectively. At a second attendance two weeks after treatment no further treatment failure was found. During the study period, a further 52 patients with pharyngeal infection (with or without concomitant genitourinary infection) that was shown by culture only were treated with a single intramuscular injection of 250 mg ceftriaxone. No treatment failure was observed in this group. Only minor adverse drug reactions were seen. Ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection is therefore safe and effective in treating gonorrhoea, including pharyngeal infection...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the absorption mechanism in Caco- 2 and rat intestine models in order to improve the accuracy of prediction of oral absorption of ester prodrugs. <b>Pivampicillin</b> and cefcapene pivoxil hydrochloride (CFPN-PI), ester-type oral antibiotics, were chosen as model ester prodrugs. The level of esterase activity in Caco- 2 cells was lower than that measured in the rat jejunum when p-nitrophenyl acetate was used as a substrate. Almost complete ester hydrolysis occurred before the ester prodrugs reached the basolateral side of the monolayer, and the disappearance of prodrugs was thought to be due to metabolism or transport after addition to the apical side of the monolayer. When <b>pivampicillin</b> and CFPN-PI were used, the amounts of ampicillin and cefcapene (CFPN) produced by hydrolysis of prodrugs were increased because intracellular degradation of prodrugs resulted in intracellular accumulation. On the other hand, when ampicillin or CFPN was used, only a small amount of the drug reached the basolateral side of the monolayers and no intracellular accumulation was observed. The permeability of CFPN-PI, the solubility of which is dependent on the acidity of gastric juice, across a Caco- 2 monolayer or rat intestine, was also investigated by using an in vitro system that mimics the physiological state of the human gastrointestinal tract. The oral absorption of CFPN-PI in humans is predicted to be good either in the Caco- 2 model or in the rat intestine model. It is concluded that our system may be a valuable tool for evaluation of oral absorption of ester prodrugs metabolized during permeation through the intestinal epithelium. Broader evaluation of such a system is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Ampicillin is an {{antibiotic}} commonly administered to horses {{by both the}} intramuscular (i. m.) and the intravenous (i. v.) route. Its physicochemical properties restrict its absorption after oral administration and explain its rapid elimination from the body. To prolong the effects of ampicillin in the horse, {{attempts have been made}} to alter its elimination and absorption rates. The alteration of urinary pH did not change the plasma disposition of the antibiotic but when probenecid was administered concurrently with ampicillin, a significant reduction of total body clearance was achieved. Ampicillin may also be maintained in the equine body, for a prolonged period of time when administered as an i. v. infusion. However, the practical difficulties associated with this route of administration and the limited potential advantage over conventional routes such as i. m. injection restrict its application to the critically ill animal and the perioperative period. When bacampicillin and <b>pivampicillin</b> (two ampicillin prodrugs) were administered to horses, high oral bioavailability was obtained, and the use of prodrugs commands the need for further investigation. The use of ampicillin might be limited in the future as an increase in the number of resistant equine bacterial strains emerge and it may be prudent to restrict its use according to the principles of good clinical pharmacological practice...|$|E
40|$|Seven-day {{courses of}} either {{pivmecillinam}} 200 mg plus <b>pivampicillin</b> 250 mg (Miraxid) {{or a combination}} of tetracycline hydrochloride. chlortetracycline hydrochloride and demeclocycline hydrochloride (Deteclo) 300 mg, both given twice daily, were compared in a multicentre general practice study in 408 patients with symptoms ofupper or lower respiratory tract infection. Patients were stratified into four diagnostic groups: sinusitis, otitis media, throat infections, and acute bronchitis and randomly allocated to treatment within these groups. Assessment at 7 days showed no difference in clinical efficacy between the two treatments where 193 ofthe 208 infections receivingMiraxid (93 %) were rated as either cured or improved compared with 181 ofthe 201 infections treated with Deteclo (90 %). At 7 days, the percentage ofpatients completely free ofsymptoms was the same for both groups (66 %). The mean timefor symptoms to clear was 3 · 9 days in the Miraxid group and 4 · 0 days in the Deteclo group. Side-effects were reported by significantly fewer patients in the Miraxid group (9 · 3 %) than the Deteclo group (17 · 5 %) (p< 0 · 05) and six patients in the latter groupfailed to complete the course of treatment.

40|$|<b>Pivampicillin</b> (PIVA), an acyloxymethylester of ampicillin, {{is thought}} to enhance the oral {{bioavailability}} of ampicillin because of its greater lipophilicity {{compared to that of}} ampicillin. The fate of PIVA in intestinal cells and the exact location of its conversion into ampicillin have, however, never been unambiguously established. Polarized Caco- 2 cells have been used to examine the handling of PIVA and the release of ampicillin from PIVA by the intestinal epithelium. Experiments were limited to 3 h. Cells incubated with PIVA (apical pole) showed a fast accumulation of ampicillin and transport toward the basolateral medium, whereas PIVA itself was only poorly accumulated and transported. Cells incubated with free ampicillin accumulated and transported only minimal amounts of this drug. Release of ampicillin from cells incubated with PIVA was unaffected by PEPT 1 and OCTN 2 inhibitors but was sharply decreased after ATP depletion or addition of bis(4 -nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP; an esterase inhibitor). PIVA incubated with Caco- 2 lysates released free ampicillin, and this release was inhibited by BNPP. Efflux studies showed that the ampicillin that accumulated in cells after incubation with PIVA was preferentially transported out of the cells through the basolateral pole. This efflux was decreased by multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) inhibitors (probenecid, MK- 571) and by ATP depletion. A phthalimidomethylester of ampicillin that resists cellular esterases failed to cause any significant release (cell lysate) or transport (polarized Caco- 2 cells) of ampicillin. These results show that when PIVA i...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although acute {{exacerbations}} {{of chronic}} bronchitis (AECBs) are common, {{there has been}} no metaanalysis that focused on the optimum regimen. Methods: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of first-line antimicrobial agents (ie, amoxicillin, ampicillin, <b>pivampicillin,</b> trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline) and second-line antimicrobial agents (ie, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, macrolides, second-generation or third-generation cephalosporins, and quinolones) for the treatment of patients with AECB, in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance among the microbes responsible for AECB, we performed a metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved through searches of the PubMed and the Cochrane databases. Results: Twelve RCTs were included in the metaanalysis. First-line antibiotics were associated with lower treatment success compared to second-line antibiotics in the clinically evaluable patients (odds ratio [OR], 0. 51; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 34 to 0. 75). There were no differences among the compared regimens regarding mortality (OR, 0. 64; 95 % CI, 0. 25 to 1. 66) or treatment success (OR, 0. 56; 95 % CI, 0. 22 to 1. 43) in microbiologically evaluable patients, or adverse effects in general (OR, 0. 75; 95 % CI, 0. 39 to 1. 45) or diarrhea in particular (OR, 1. 58; 95 % CI, 0. 74 to 3. 35). Conclusions:Compared to first-line antibiotics, second-line antibiotics are more effective, but not less safe, when administered to patients with AECB. The available data did not allow for stratified analyses according to the presence of risk factors for poor outcome, such as increased age, impaired lung function, airway obstruction, and frequency of exacerbations; this fact should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings of this metaanalysis...|$|E
