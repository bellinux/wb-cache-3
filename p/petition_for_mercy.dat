60|$|Of {{course it}} was soon known in the vicarage that Mary Lowther had {{accepted}} the Squire's hand. She had left him standing in the drawing-room;--had left him very abruptly, though she had condescended to kiss his hand. Perhaps in no way could she have made a kinder reply to his <b>petition</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy.</b> In ordinary cases it is probably common for a lady, when she has yielded to a gentleman's entreaties for the gift of herself, to yield also something further for his immediate gratification, and to submit herself to his embrace. In this instance it was impossible that the lady should do so. After the very definite manner {{in which she had}} explained to him her feelings, it {{was out of the question}} that she should stay and toy with him;--that she should bear the pressure of his arm, or return his caresses. But there had come upon her a sharp desire to show her gratitude before she left him,--to show her gratitude, and to prove, by some personal action towards him, that though she had been forced to tell him that she did not love him,--that she did not love him after the fashion in which his love was given to her,--that yet he was dear to her, as our dearest friends are dear. And therefore, when he had stretched out his hand to her in sign of the offer which he was making her, she had raised it to her lips and kissed it.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth, in her palace, {{was in a}} {{state of}} mind {{scarcely}} less distressing than that of the wretched prisoner in his cell. The old conflict was renewed--pride and resentment on the one side, and love which would not be extinguished on the other. If Essex would sue for pardon, she would remit his sentence and allow him to live. Why would he not do it? If he would send her the ring which she had given him for exactly such an emergency, he might be saved. Why did he not send it? The courtiers and statesmen about her urged her to sign the warrant; the peace of the country demanded the execution of the laws in a case of such unquestionable guilt. They told her, too, that Essex wished to die, that he knew that he was hopelessly and irretrievably ruined, and that life, if granted to him, was a boon which would compromise her own safety and confer no benefit on him. Still Elizabeth waited and waited in an agony of suspense, in hopes that the ring would come; the sending of it would be so far an act of submission on his part as would put it in her power to do the rest. Her love could bend her pride, indomitable as it usually was, almost to the whole concession, but it would not give up quite all. It demanded some sacrifice on his part, which sacrifice the sending of the ring would have rendered. The ring did not come, nor any <b>petition</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy,</b> and at length the fatal warrant was signed.|$|E
60|$|The savages {{now knew}} that conquest was sure. Yells and whoopings proclaimed the fierce delight {{with which they}} {{witnessed}} the certainty of their victory. Still there was something portentous in the death-like silence with which the victims within the block awaited their fate. The whole exterior of the building was already wrapped in flames, and yet no show of further resistance, no <b>petition</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy,</b> issued from its bosom. The unnatural and frightful stillness, that reigned within, was gradually communicated to those without. The cries and shouts of triumph ceased, and the crackling of the flames, or the falling of timber in the adjoining buildings, alone disturbed the awful calm. At length a solitary voice was heard in the block. Its tones were deep, solemn, and imploring. The fierce beings who surrounded the glowing pile bent forward to listen, for their quick faculties caught the first sounds that were audible. It was Mark Heathcote pouring out his spirit in prayer. The petition was fervent, but steady, and though uttered in words that were unintelligible to those without, they knew enough of the practices of the Colonists, {{to be aware that}} it was the chief of the Pale-faces holding communion with his God. Partly in awe, and partly in doubt of what might be the consequences of so mysterious an asking, the dark crowd with drew to a little distance, and silently watched the progress of the destruction. They had heard strange sayings {{of the power of the}} Deity of their invaders, and as their victims appeared suddenly to cease using any of the known means of safety, they appeared to expect, perhaps they did expect, some unequivocal manifestation of the power of the Great Spirit of the stranger.|$|E

Though he was unable to effectively support Nayan's rebellion, Kaidu remained a potent threat for the remainder of Kublai Khan's life. Kublai chose not to regard Nayan's Nestorian Christian co-religionists as guilty by association, and refused to allow them to suffer any level of persecution within his lands.|$|R
50|$|Early in {{the next}} year a court formed under John Bradshaw and tried: Norwich, the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Capel, the Earl of Holland and Sir John Owen.

Shortly after his liberation from prison in May 1649 he joined the exiled court of Charles II who employed him in fruitless negotiations with the duke of Lorraine. He became captain of the king's guard at the Restoration, and in consideration of the fortune he had spent or income he had foregone in the king's service a pension of 2000 pounds per year was granted him.|$|R

Bergmann soon moved on to the Oederan subcamp of Flossenbürg where she served {{out the rest of the}} war, after which an East German court found her guilty of murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment. Her trial was held in Neubrandenburg in November 1955. She was accused of cruelty towards prisoners using a whip and to have set a dog on prisoners (killing six of them) amongst other crimes. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Bergmann was still in prison in Hoheneck alongside Ulla Jürß, another female Nazi guard. They both <b>petitioned</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> and were released on probation in May 1991 after serving more than 35 years in prison. Bergmann died in 1996 in Guben, Germany.|$|R

In 1899, Louise Masset was tried for the murder of her young son Manfred, whose body was found in the ladies' lavatory at Dalston Junction railway station. Circumstantial evidence suggested that Louise was the murderer, and the killing was to be rid of a supposed encumbrance due to her wanting to marry a man named Lucas. However, in her claims of innocence, Louise said she had taken Manfred out of the care of one woman to give him to two ladies she met who had an establishment for the care of growing children. The police claimed they made some effort in looking for the two women, but the extent of their investigation is unknown. In any event, Louise Masset was tried and convicted of the murder and, despite a <b>petition</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy,</b> was executed on 9 January 1900.|$|E
5000|$|In one instance, Stansby {{got himself}} into {{much more serious}} trouble. Probably in 1620, Stansby printed a topical {{pamphlet}} for Nathaniel Butter: titled A Plain Demonstration of the Unlawful Succession of Ferdinand II, Because of the Incestuous Marriage of His Parents, the work criticized the 1619 accession of the new Holy Roman Emperor. This {{was one of a}} series of pamphlets Stansby printed on the controversy that sparked the opening of the Thirty Years' War. The title page of the pamphlet on Ferdinand II bore the false claim that it was printed [...] "at the Hague" [...] - [...] but the Stuart authorities were not fooled; first Butter, and then Stansby, were arrested for violating the regime's strict censorship policy, and Stansby's presses were damaged. <b>Petitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> from both Butter and Stansby survive in the extant records; in his, Stansby places all the blame for the affair on Butter.

40|$|Vespers is unmistakably {{inspired}} by liturgy. The title alone simply denotes an evening service of prayer; in this case, {{the text and}} structure are drawn from an Eastern-rite vespers service. On the other hand, I wished to write a work that would stand on its own, performed outside of a liturgical context. These two factors [...] a love for liturgical music {{and a desire to}} write a concert work [...] influenced my choice of Vespers as the service to set. Rather than composing a setting of the Mass or Divine Liturgy, each a central eucharistic celebration, I chose to set a service of a quieter and more contemplative nature. Of a different character from the celebratory eucharistic services, Vespers emphasizes <b>petitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> as well as a sense of quiet assurance. I think of Vespers, then, as primarily a concert work (rather than a liturgical work) reflecting these qualities [...] albeit one that retains most of the form of its liturgical source, and which as a result could feasibly be adapted to use in worship. Vespers is written for mixed choir with soloists and lasts approximately 54 minutes. The work's premiere performance was at Haverford College on April 7, 2014...|$|R
50|$|To Apion my kind lord, {{lover of}} Christ and the poor, all-esteemed and most {{magnificent}} patrician and dux of the Thebaid, from Anoup, your miserable slave upon your estate called Phakra.

Yet when I approached my kind lord and asked for pity in my straits, the servants of my lord refused to do my kind lords bidding. For unless your pity extends to me, my lord, I cannot stay on my holding and serve the interests of the estate. But I beseech and urge your lordship to command that mercy should be shown me because of the disaster that has overtaken me. For I have no other refuge than in the Lord Christ and your eminence. And I will send up unceasing hymns to the Lord Christ for the life of your lordship and that of your most magnificent son, my lord Strategius.|$|E

He would not suffer that these black creatures should lay hands upon a Boer, so he fled to a cave and fought there till he was shot dead. Over his open grave his brethren and friends swore to take vengeance for his murder, and fifty of them raised an insurrection. They were pursued by the Pandours and by burghers more law abiding or more cautious, till Jan Bezuidenhout, the brother of Frederick, was shot also, fighting to the last while his wife and little son loaded the rifles. Then the rest were captured and put upon their trial, and to the rage and horror of all their countrymen the brutal British governor of that day, who was named Somerset, ordered five {{of them to be}} hanged, among them my husband's father and uncle. <b>Petitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> availed nothing, and these five were tied to a beam like Kaffir dogs yonder at Slagter's Nek, they who had shed the blood of no man. Yes, yes, it is true, for Jan, my man, saw it; he saw his father and his uncle hanged like dogs. When they pushed them from the beam four of the ropes broke--perhaps they had been tampered with, I know not--but still the devils who murdered them would show no mercy. Jan ran to his father and cast his arms about him, but they tore him away.|$|R

40|$|In {{early modern}} Sweden, {{intentional}} blasphemy {{was regarded as}} one of the most serious crimes one could commit. Blasphemy was termed “Crimen Laesae Majestatis Divinae” – “a crime against Our Heavenly Majesty” and was subject to the death penalty. From the 1680 ´s it was possible to be pardoned from death sentences already delivered by the courts of appeal by applying to the “Judiciary Inspection”, (Sw. Justitierevisionen) In early modern times the definition of blasphemy was influenced by the medieval scholastic view according to which God was perfect. The sourcematerial for the present thesis are 110 <b>petitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>mercy</b> in cases of blasphemy that came up before the council during the period 1680 - 1789. The cases studied can be divided into the following categories: Blasphemy against God, blasphemy against the sacraments, deliberate assignations wiht the Devil and “other blasphemies”. There was no Church law in Sweden before 1686 and a common law for the whole country did not exist before 1734. The Bible´s ten Commandments where added as an appendix to the already existing medieval laws, reiterated in 1608. An individual found guilty of blasphemy underwent both secular and church punishment. At least nine individuals (we lack information about some cases due to material that has been lost) where not pardoned by the council. The secular punishments included death by beheading or burning at stake, when the sentence was reduced some kind of corporal punishment – running the sauntlet, flogging, imprisonment on a diet of bread and water or a life time of labor. Church punishment was public shaming and meant that the accused had to sit on a special chair in church during the services and publicly ask God and the members of the congregation for forgiveness. This kind of punishment was meted out in Sweden until the late 18 th century. Blasphemy is a complicated act that should be defined according to the norms of the society in which it occurs. There are two processes that have to be taken into considerations when studing the crime of blasphemy in early modern Sweden – the centralization of the government and the unification of the church according to the Lutheran creed. In the early modern society people lived in what has been called a “religious culture”, where religion was self-evident, collective concern. Within this context atheism, in the modern meaning of the word, was supposedly unimaginable. The theoretical framework of the study is inspired by Peter Burke’s theories of the reformation of popular culture. Measurements taken by the elite have usually been regarded as active and aggressive, while popular culture has been regarded a homogeneous passive mass that adjustes itself to demands from above. One of the primary aims of this thesis is to study how verbal statements, actions and attitudes reflected popular conceptions that could either be close to or far distant from the learned ideas of the elite. By dividing popular attitudes discerned in the cases studied into four groups corresponding to a kind of mental strata, a more varied image of popular culture is achieved. Blasphemy in early modern Sweden was a crime committed mainly by men, especially when it comes to expressing ideas about the Devil or attempting to contact him. Very few women were accused of blasphemy; of 117 individuals accused, only nine were women...|$|R
