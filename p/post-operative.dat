5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. <b>Post-operative</b> analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the <b>post-operative</b> or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 2007 West's mother, Donda West died. at age 58. The Los Angeles County coroner's {{office said}} in January 2008 that West {{had died of}} {{coronary}} artery disease and multiple <b>post-operative</b> factors due to or {{as a consequence of}} liposuction and mammoplasty".|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from <b>post-operative</b> radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of <b>post-operative</b> therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in <b>post-operative</b> recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E
25|$|An {{episode of}} BPPV may be {{triggered}} by dehydration, such as that caused by diarrhea. For this reason, it commonly occurs in <b>post-operative</b> patients who have diarrhea induced by <b>post-operative</b> antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|The <b>post-operative</b> {{mortality}} for {{an already}} ruptured AAA has slowly decreased over several decades but remains higher than 40%. However, if the AAA is surgically repaired before rupture, the <b>post-operative</b> mortality rate is substantially lower: approximately 1-6%.|$|E
25|$|Convalescence — <b>Post-operative</b> care {{is minimal}} after a mastopexy procedure; the lifted breasts are {{supported}} with a porous, soft elastic tape, which is removed at 7–10 days <b>post-operative,</b> {{and then is}} reapplied to the mastopexy incisions for an additional 1–2 weeks during convalescence. For comfortable healing of the wounds, the woman wears a surgical brassière, and avoids wearing an underwire brassière until the breast implants have settled into position. The mastopexy outcome is photographed at 2–3 months <b>post-operative.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{overview}} of systematic reviews found insufficient {{evidence to suggest}} that acupuncture is effective for surgical or <b>post-operative</b> pain. For the use of acupuncture for <b>post-operative</b> pain, there was contradictory evidence. A 2014 systematic review found supportive but limited evidence for use of acupuncture for acute <b>post-operative</b> pain after back surgery. A 2014 systematic review found that while the evidence suggested acupuncture could be an effective treatment for postoperative gastroparesis, a firm conclusion could not be reached because the trials examined were of low quality.|$|E

25|$|<b>Post-operative</b> {{pain relief}} {{is subject to}} change. Traditionally, pain relief has been {{provided}} by relatively mild narcotic analgesics such as Acetaminophen with codeine, for milder pain, and stronger narcotic analgesics for more severe pain. Recently (January 2011), the FDA reduced the recommended total 24-hour dose because of concern about liver toxicity from the Acetominophen component. An alternative {{is the use of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, themselves giving rise to concerns that their effect on platelets might increase the risk of <b>post-operative</b> bleeding. In turn, this has renewed interest in techniques other than traditional 'extra-capsular excision' in the hope that <b>post-operative</b> pain might be reduced.|$|E

25|$|A {{single dose}} of the {{corticosteroid}} drug dexamethasone may be given during surgery to prevent <b>post-operative</b> vomiting. A systematic review found that a dose of dexamethasone during surgery can prevent vomiting in {{one out of every}} five children who receives the drug. The review also found that these children return to a normal diet more quickly and have less <b>post-operative</b> pain.|$|E
25|$|Some or all {{of these}} {{disadvantages}} may be attributable to <b>post-operative</b> patellar tendon shortening.|$|E
25|$|In Goodwin v United Kingdom the Court {{ruled that}} a law which still {{classified}} <b>post-operative</b> transsexual persons under their pre-operative sex, violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual persons were unable to marry individuals of their <b>post-operative</b> opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in Rees v United Kingdom. This did not, however, alter the Court's understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.|$|E
25|$|<b>Post-operative</b> pain is minimal, and {{the woman}} is usually able to leave {{hospital}} the same day. No vaginal packing is required, although she might choose to wear a sanitary pad for comfort. The physician informs the woman that the reduced labia are often very swollen during the early <b>post-operative</b> period, because of the edema caused by the anaesthetic solution injected to swell the tissues.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{effects can}} include <b>post-operative</b> changes in appearance, {{difficulty}} eating, {{or loss of}} voice that may require learning alternate methods of speaking.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty heal at 6-weeks <b>post-operative,</b> and fade within several months, {{according to the}} skin type of the woman. Depending upon the daily physical activity the woman might require, the augmentation mammoplasty patient usually resumes her normal life activities at about 1-week <b>post-operative.</b> The woman who underwent submuscular implantation (beneath the pectoralis major muscles) usually has a longer <b>post–operative</b> convalescence, and experiences more pain, because of the healing of the deep-tissue cuts into the chest muscles for the breast augmenation. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about 6 weeks. Moreover, during the initial convalescence, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arms to alleviate pain and discomfort; and, as required, analgesic medication catheters for alleviating pain.|$|E

25|$|<b>Post-operative</b> gastric bypass {{patients}} {{develop a}} lowered tolerance {{for alcoholic beverages}} because their altered digestive tract absorbs alcohol {{at a faster rate}} than people who have not undergone the surgery. It also takes a <b>post-operative</b> patient longer to reach sober levels after consuming alcohol. In a study conducted on 36 <b>post-operative</b> patients and a control group of 36 subjects (who had not undergone surgery), each subject drank a 5 oz. glass of red wine and had the alcohol in their breath measured to evaluate alcohol metabolism. The gastric bypass group had an average peak alcohol breath level at 0.08%, whereas the control group had an average peak alcohol breath level of 0.05%. It took on average 108 minutes for the gastric bypass patients group to return to an alcohol breath of zero, while it took the control group an average of 72 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{morbidity}} rate associated with tonsillectomy is 2% to 4% due to <b>post-operative</b> bleeding; {{the mortality rate}} is 1 in 15,000, due to bleeding, airway obstruction, or anesthesia complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} reduction mammoplasty {{procedure is}} determined by the volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) to be resected (cut and removed) from each breast, and the degree of breast ptosis present: Pseudoptosis (sagging of the inferior pole of the breast; the nipple is at or above the inframammary fold); Grade I: Mild ptosis (the nipple is below the IMF, but above the lower pole of the breast); Grade II: Moderate ptosis (the nipple is below the IMF; yet some lower-pole breast tissue hangs lower than the nipple); Grade III: Severe ptosis (the nipple is far below the IMF; no breast tissue is below the nipple). The full, corrective outcome of the surgical re-establishment of a bodily-proportionate bust becomes evident at 6-months to 1-year <b>post-operative,</b> during which period the reduced and lifted breast tissues settle upon and into the chest. The <b>post-operative</b> convalescence is weeks long, depending upon the corrections performed; and some women might experience painful breast-enlargement during the first <b>post-operative</b> menstruation.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{scars of}} a breast augmentation mammoplasty develop approximately at 6-weeks <b>post-operative,</b> and fade within months. Depending upon the daily-life physical activities required of the woman, the breast augmentation patient usually resumes her normal life at 1-week <b>post-operative.</b> Moreover, women whose breast implants were emplaced beneath the chest muscles (submuscular placement) {{usually have a}} longer, slightly more painful convalescence, because of the healing of the incisions to the chest muscles. Usually, she does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for approximately 6 weeks. During the initial <b>post-operative</b> recovery, the woman is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arm to alleviate pain and discomfort; if required, analgesic indwelling medication catheters can alleviate pain Moreover, significantly improved patient recovery has resulted from refined breast-device implantation techniques (submuscular, subglandular) that allow 95 per cent of women to resume their normal lives at 24-hours post-procedure, without bandages, fluid drains, pain pumps, catheters, medical support brassières, or narcotic pain medication.|$|E

25|$|Early <b>post-operative</b> {{nutrition}} {{is a part}} of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols. These protocols {{also include}} carbohydrate loading in the 24 hours before surgery, but earlier nutritional interventions have not been shown to have a significant impact.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} including granisetron {{appear to be}} effective in controlling <b>post-operative</b> nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if it is more or less effective than other agents such as droperidol, metoclopramide, ondansetron or cyclizine.|$|E
25|$|The {{woman is}} {{instructed}} to resume her normal life activities, and {{to eat a}} light diet, <b>post-operative,</b> {{on the day of}} the breast reduction surgery; to resume washing in a shower at 1-day post-operative; to avoid strenuous physical activity, and to wear a sports brassière; the convalescence regimen is for 3-months <b>post-operative.</b> She is also informed that the wrinkles at the bottom of the vertical limb of the scar usually resolve and fade within 1–6 months post-operative; yet some cases might require surgical revision of the vertical scar. Scheduled follow-up consultations ensure a satisfactory outcome to the breast reduction surgery, and facilitate the early identification and management of medical complications.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who argue}} against a blanket {{moratorium}} on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars {{and that there are}} costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They also point {{to the fact that there}} is an increase in the rate of <b>post-operative</b> periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and <b>post-operative</b> recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} three (3) weeks of <b>post-operative</b> convalescence, the surgeon {{monitors}} the healing of the mastopexy wounds during weekly consultations with the patient. Depending upon the wound-healing progress of the woman, more or fewer follow-up examinations shall follow.|$|E
