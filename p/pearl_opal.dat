50|$|London-based {{sculptor}} Susan Collis uses {{a variety}} of techniques and strategies to investigate issues concerning interpretation, craft, value and labor. Everyday objects are presented etched, splattered and stained with marks of work, wear and tear. At first glance, the marks seem to be the accidental results of normal use, and as such seem meaningless and not worthy of examination. Collis is interested in the shift of perception that takes place upon discovery that they are, in fact, careful, intentional acts, and that the materials used are traditionally valued for their financial or decorative properties. A tired stepladder covered with paint drips from years of use has been simulated by the meticulous inlaying of diamonds, <b>pearls,</b> <b>opals</b> and other prized materials. A bucket catching a drip from the gallery ceiling may not be the result of neglect, rather a complex staging of pumps, water-tanks and false walls to artificially create the scenario. Typically works involve momentous amounts of often hidden labor to create an object that may easily go unnoticed, but is replete with value, be it material or conceptual. Much of Collisâ€™ work can go unnoticed and this visual gamble results in a possible conceptual pay-off that rewards concerted investigation by the viewer.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the gemstones, local streets were named to honor Moonstone Beach in the late 1880s. Beginning just south of the popular beach, streets running East/West feature gemstone names alphabetically such as Agate, Beryl, Carnelian, Diamond, Emerald, Garnet, Jasper, <b>Opal,</b> <b>Pearl,</b> Ruby, Sapphire, and Topaz.|$|R
5000|$|Ozure Isles - The Ozure Isles {{are five}} islands that {{are located in}} Lake Orizon. The islands are small, and built up of {{sparkling}} cliffs, rich with iridescent gems and honeycombed with caves and grottoes. The pebbles of the beaches are actually amethysts, <b>opals,</b> <b>pearls,</b> rubies, turquoises, and especially sapphires, which are so common that they endow the Isles with a dazzling blue light.|$|R

5000|$|On May 21, 2013, West Valley City police {{announced}} that they had closed the active investigation into Susan Powell's disappearance. Shortly after, a hand-written will assumed to {{have been written by}} Susan was found in a safety deposit box. It contained the line: [...] "If I die, it may not be an accident, even if it looks like one," [...] and instructed the reader not to show her husband the will. A video also surfaced of Susan surveying her home and the destruction of some of her property. An excerpt: [...] "And I had necklaces too, wherever those are inaudible got in a rage, as you can see, and broke this, there's studs and <b>pearls</b> and <b>opals</b> in there, broke those and threw all my DVDs and made a mess because he was angry at me about a year or two back," [...] she said.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{types of}} {{cleaning}} can damage some jewelry. For example, some class rings are {{coated with a}} dark pigment, called antiquing, to darken their appearance. A lot of artisan sterling silver jewelry is oxidized to give it an intentionally rustic or industrial look and improper cleaning may remove that oxidation. Some gemstones, such as white topaz, have an overlay to produce certain colors. Ultrasonic cleaning can remove this coating, {{if it is not}} a quality piece. Ultrasonic cleaning is also contraindicated for <b>opals,</b> <b>pearls</b> and amber, and any other gemstone that is porous. Gemstones that are glued in (a common practice with semiprecious stones in non-precious methods and in class rings) should not be placed into an ultrasonic cleaner. An ultrasonic cleaner can cause stones that are loose in their settings to come out. Jewelry should always be examined for overlays and loose stones prior to cleaning with an ultrasonic cleaner or a steam cleaner.|$|R
60|$|From {{his high}} perch, one sees {{before him and}} below him, a wall of dreary mountains, shorn of vegetation, glaring {{fiercely}} in the sun; it fences in a level desert of yellow sand, smooth as velvet and threaded far away with fine lines that stand for roads, and dotted with creeping mites we know are camel-trains and journeying men; right {{in the midst of}} the desert is spread a billowy expanse of green foliage; and nestling in its heart sits the great white city, like an island of <b>pearls</b> and <b>opals</b> gleaming out of a sea of emeralds. This is the picture you see spread far below you, with distance to soften it, the sun to glorify it, strong contrasts to heighten the effects, and over it and about it a drowsing air of repose to spiritualize it and make it seem rather a beautiful estray from the mysterious worlds we visit in dreams than a substantial tenant of our coarse, dull globe. And when you think of the leagues of blighted, blasted, sandy, rocky, sun-burnt, ugly, dreary, infamous country you have ridden over to get here, you think it is the most beautiful, beautiful picture that ever human eyes rested upon in all the broad universe! If I were to go to Damascus again, I would camp on Mahomet's hill about a week, and then go away. There is no need to go inside the walls. The Prophet was wise without knowing it when he decided not to go down into the paradise of Damascus.|$|R
60|$|What {{had caused}} her to smile was a happy memory of the days with Athelwold before their marriage, when one day he came in to her with a leather bag {{in his hand and}} said: Do you, who are so {{beautiful}} yourself, love all beautiful things? And do you love the beauty of gems? And when she replied that she loved gems above all beautiful things, he poured out the contents of his bag in her lap--brilliants, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, <b>opals,</b> <b>pearls</b> in gold setting, in bracelets, necklets, pendants, rings and brooches. And when she gloated over this splendid gift, taking up gem after gem, exclaiming delightedly at its size and colour and lustre, he told her that he once knew a man who maintained that it was a mistake for a beautiful woman to wear gems. Why? she asked, would he have then wholly unadorned? No, he replied, he liked to see them wearing gold, saying that gold makes the most perfect setting for a woman's beauty, just as it does for a precious stone, and its effect is to enhance the beauty it surrounds. But the woman's beauty has its meeting and central point in the eyes, and the light and soul in them illumines the whole face. And in the stone nature simulates the eye, and although without a soul its brilliant light and colour make it the equal of the eye, and therefore when worn as an ornament it competes with the eye, and in effect lessens the beauty it is supposed to enhance. He said that gems should be worn only by women who are not beautiful, who must rely on something extraneous to attract attention, since {{it would be better to}} a homely woman that men should look at her to admire a diamond or sapphire than not to look at her at all. She had laughed and asked him who the man was who had such strange ideas, and he had replied that he had forgotten his name.|$|R
