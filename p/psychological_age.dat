Focusing on a selected set of model attributes related to the tasks of describing, explaining, and modifying intraindividual and interindividual patterns of development and aging (continuity vs. discontinuity of antecedent-consequent relationships, concurrent vs. historical paradigms, time-lag relationships, treatment by history interactions, etc.) a number of questions prototypical of a life-span view of aging are derived. The primary conclusion is that a life-span view of aging redirects conventional thinking about <b>psychological</b> <b>aging</b> as a fixer decrement phenomenon toward a systematic analysis of the aging process in terms of dynamic and interactive man-environment systems and a more variable view of the aging process relative to its form and directionality. Furthermore, it facilitates the conceptualization of prevention efforts aimed at optimizing the aging process in a changing society...|$|R

Nearly all of that research, however, has been cross-sectional, and the few panel studies that exist include only a single aspect of health and measured with older adults. The present study sought to replicate and expand on a recent 2 -wave cross-lagged panel investigation that explored the causal interplay between several dimensions of health and <b>psychological</b> <b>age</b> in middle age and older adults. In the current study employees (N = 409), {{ranging in age from}} 22 to 70, from six manufacturing organizations participated in three surveys approximately 1. 5 years apart, and two clinical health assessments approximately 3 years apart. Using cross-lagged panel path analysis, negative relationships were found between <b>psychological</b> <b>age</b> and four types of health. Chronological age was found to moderate these relationships, with different predictive patterns discovered for older and younger individuals. <b>Psychological</b> <b>age</b> predicted health for older adults, while for younger adults health predicted <b>psychological</b> <b>age.</b> The pattern of the relationship varied for each aspect of health, and also across age groups.

40|$|Extract] Geropsychology is an {{increasing}} field of clinical practice within professional psychology. Due to the rapid increase {{in the proportion of}} older people across countries, a growing number of psychologists work with older adults, their families and caregivers, and aged-care systems concerned. Historically, the origin of the study of the <b>psychological</b> <b>ageing</b> is often credited to A. Quetelet who initiated the first collection of psychological data in examining human development and ageing and published the book On Man and the Development of His Faculties in 1935 (Cook, Herson, & Van Hasselt, 1998). Although afterwards more research had investigated psychological functioning of adults, including older adults, and scholars recognized the need for the scientific study of older people, {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century, most clinicians were unwilling to extend psychological treatment to older individuals. For example, Freud (1905) suggested that psychological treatment of patients over 50 years of age would be ineffective. In the clinical domain, K. Abraham (1927) was regarded as the first psychoanalyst to recognize and express optimism for the psychoanalytic treatment of older individuals. Later in 1929, the first psychotherapeutic program for older adults, the San Francisco Old Age Counseling Center, was founded in the USA. Following this developmental trend, S. L. Pressey (1939), as the first psychologist to publish a book on psychology of ageing, focused on the development of adulthood and ageing. Despite the increasing scholarly interests in older adults, the field of geropsychology remained in its infancy. It was until after World War II the field of psychology and ageing attracted substantial systematic investigation. The books <b>Psychological</b> Aspects of <b>Aging</b> (Anderson, 1956) and Handbook of Aging and the Individual (Birren, 1959) remarked the rapid development of geropsychology. Despite exponential growth of geropsychology, it has been criticized being data rich and theory poor, which indicates the need of theoretical development in contemporary geropsychology (Cook et al., 1998) ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of eight weeks Pilates training on depression treatment among sedentary retired workmen. Materials and Methods: This study was a semi-experimental design in which, thirty non-athletic elderly men were included. In a randomized sampling, the subjects were selected among elderly who referred to the Amir Kabir psychiatry center in Kashan and only those elderly with a registered medical record were eligible to be included in this study. Subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups of experimental and control. Level of Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Questionnaire (BDI-S- 13). The experimental group received 8 weeks of Pilates training while, the controls received no exercise training. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the normal distribution of our data and effectiveness of Pilates training was evaluated using ANOVA with significance level of α= 0. 05. Findings: the mean age of sample was age 62. 96 ± 2. 88. Significant differences were observed in depression score of the experimental group in post-tests (P≤ 0. 001). However, no significant difference was observed in the control group (P≥ 0. 05). Conclusion: In general, eight weeks Pilates training program improved depression among retired workmen.
