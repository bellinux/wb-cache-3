The implications are drawn especially for academic researchers with entrepreneurial pursuits. In addition, specific examples are given of how existing regulatory mechanisms have been inadequate with respect to preventing the intrusion of corporate profit-making over the public welfare. In the context of national and state budgetary shortfalls, it will become that much more attractive for institutions to seek commercial support to realize <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>goals.</b> For this reason, the impact of commercially funded activities deserves much more public policy attention.

Artt. 2449 and 2450 of the Civil Code granted to the State and other public entities the special power to appoint members of the Board of Directors {{and internal}} auditors of a company directly, i. e. without voting such appointment in the shareholders’ meeting. Further more, under art. 2449 e 2450 of the Civil Code, the public sector was empowered to appoint an undeterminate number of directors or internal auditors. Therefore, the special power granted to the public sector was not proportionate {{with the amount of}} share capital owned by the public entity entitled to the appointment.

40|$|Purpose – This article explores {{challenges}} for rural Australian local governments {{during the transition}} to high-speed broadband infrastructure. Despite the National Broadband Network’s promised ubiquitous connectivity, significant access discrepancies remain between rural and urban areas. Methodology – Empirical findings are drawn from a full-day workshop on digital connectivity, which included participants from seven rural local governments in New South Wales, Australia. Thematic analysis of the workshop transcript was undertaken in order to extrapolate recurring nuances of rural digital exclusion. Findings – Rural communities face inequitable prospects for digital inclusion, and authorities confront dual issues of accommodating connected and unconnected citizens. Many areas have no or poor broadband access, and different digital engagement expectations are held by citizens and local governments. Citizens seek interactive opportunities, but rural authorities often lack the necessary resources to offer advanced participatory practices. Research limitations/implications – While this research draws from {{a small sample of}} government officials, their insights are nonetheless heuristically valuable in identifying connectivity issues faced in rural Australia. These issues can guide further research into other regions as well as civic experiences of digital inclusion. Practical/social implications – There is a need to reconceive Australia’s current policy approach to broadband. Greater rural digital inclusion may be achieved by focusing on connectivity as a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>goal,</b> targeting infrastructure developments to suit local contexts, and implementing participatory digital government practices. Originality/value – The actions suggested would help ensure equity of digital inclusion across Australian municipal areas. Without such changes, there is a risk of rural citizens facing further marginalisation through digital exclusion...|$|R

This paper, by contrast, focusses on public interest obligations and citizenship values such as freedom, access, universality, political pluralism and content diversity. Petros Iosifidis distinguishes broadly between public interest priorities as understood in western Europe, and {{in central and eastern}} Europe. After assessing some obvious benefits of digital TV (extra channels, converged communications, enhanced interactivity and mobility), he argues that the public interest outcomes from the introduction of new technologies like the internet and digital TV will depend on how people use them, for new technology is only a vehicle by means of which <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>goals</b> can be achieved. He then considers digital TV penetration data from across Europe, as well as the status of national digital switch-over plans, stressing that northern Europe is much more advanced in this regard than southern and eastern-central Europe. Outlining {{the pros and cons of}} digital switch-over for the public, Dr Iosifidis contends that universality and accessibility can best be ensured by maintaining public service media, which have been—and should continue to be—important conveyors of freely accessible and reliable information. Countries where television has been dominated by state broadcasters should use the new technology and in particular digital switch-over to create independent non-profit channels at both local and national levels, to foster a competitive environment and political pluralism...|$|E

This section is followed by {{an analysis of the}} origins and key elements of the identification and separation principle. Next, the implementation in legislation of Belgium (Flanders region), The Netherlands and the UK, and decisions of media regulators in those countries are explored to assess how the principles are interpreted in practice. Finally, the authors identify the concrete challenges that these formats raise and frame those against the background of European policy developments. Findings – The analysis shows that the current interpretation of the identification and separation principles conflicts with the inherently integrated features of hybrid advertising formats, especially commercial overlays. To remedy this, the authors propose strengthening the identification principle, for instance, by developing cross-media labels and framing this within a co-regulatory framework where advertisers and media service providers take up their responsibility to respect fundamental principles and protect less cognitively skilled consumers, such as children.

Affirming {{the importance of the}} <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>goals</b> of historic preservation, the Court directed inquiry to whether sufficient economic potential remained in the control of the property owner, given reasonable expectations {{at the time of her}} investment in the property.

Ironically, it is this question that very well may have been the Court 2 ̆ 7 s primary concern. This essay looks specifically at how Penn Central protects historic preservation regulation. The constitutional framework created by the decision has fostered a remarkable blossoming of historic preservation as a major tool of urban land use regulation. Preservation could never have played this role without the insulation from constitutional liability provided by the Penn Central Court, likewise, it could not have played this role if property owners had been denied all economic incentives to invest in the renovation and reuse of historic properties.

40|$|As a {{framework}} regulation for innovation markets, the patent system {{needs to be}} tailored to the innovation process, which {{it is supposed to}} serve, and to the competitive environment, within which it must operate. In order to ensure an efficient functionality of the patent system as an innovation policy tool, patent rights ought to be defined, justified and continually reconsidered by reference to their socio-economic benefits and costs. Sovereign states should retain the discretion to adopt a patent system that best suits their technological capabilities as well as their social, cultural and economic needs and priorities, with the proviso that the exercise of such discretion must remain within the boundaries of international law. Taking into account the customary principles of interpretation of international law, this Declaration seeks to shed light on these boundaries. The purpose is to clarify the policy space that the ‘Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights’ (TRIPS Agreement) leaves to national legislators and judicial authorities with regard to the implementation and administration of their patent systems. When the world’s major patent systems first developed into their present form, nation states were able to engage in the regulatory design process under conditions of high sovereign autonomy. Over the past decades, this autonomy has been progressively eroded. Today, states face a legal and institutional regime consisting of multilateral, regional and bilateral agreements, which are becoming increasingly complex and set more and more limits to their regulatory freedom. As a result, the ability of states to maintain a proper balance between the need for protection of knowledge goods in global markets, the freedom to regulate national or regional innovation markets, and the policy space for pursuing diverse <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>goals</b> risks becoming unduly constrained. This Declaration seeks to clarify some of the regulatory options states still retain under international law, in particular the TRIPS Agreement...|$|E
40|$|Co-regulation is a {{regulatory}} strategy {{which consists of}} elements of state regulation and elements of self-regulation.

On the one hand, {{it has been argued that}} the adoption of co-regulatory strategies may provide an answer to the documented shortcomings of traditional legislation in an online environment which is global and decentralised by nature. On the other hand, in comparison to self-regulation, which has often been criticised as being unsatisfactorily enforced or being not transparent or accountable enough, co-regulation might provide better safeguards with regard to the achievement of <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> <b>goals</b> and the protection of fundamental rights (such as the protection of minors, freedom of expression, etc.). This is especially the case with regard to delicate issues, where different interests must be weighed up. Cyberbullying might be such an issue. It is the aim of our contribution to offer an insight into co-regulation and its potential to address cyberbullying. It is important to address cyberbullying from multiple angles, especially when it occurs in specific environments, such as online social networks. The blurring between ‘public’ and ‘private’ in online social networks, the invisibility of audiences and the fact that information in such networks is persistent, replicable, searchable, and visible on a large scale (boyd, 2008) entail that risks, such as cyberbulllying, are significantly more complex compared to equivalent offline risks. Co-regulatory strategies, in which different actors – such as the state, industry, parents and educators – cooperate and in which the use of technology and empowerment mechanisms (such as media literacy and education) can be incorporated, may present a sophisticated manner to deal with this increasingly problematic issue. status: publishe...|$|E
