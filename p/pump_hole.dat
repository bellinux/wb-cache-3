40|$|DoctorPhoto-cathode RF gun, a high-brightness {{electron}} source with {{extremely low}} emittance, is highly required for future light {{sources such as}} X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL). A BNL Gun IV type photocathode RF gun has been fabricated and tested at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL). The gun test stand for the photoinjector consists of the BNL 1. 6 cell photocathode RF gun, a single emittance compensation magnet, and the beam diagnostics. The beam energy has maximum at the laser injection phase around 50 °. The relative energy spreads at the laser injection phase around 50 ° is about 0. 5 % rms. Best normalized transverse rms emittance attained 1. 5 mm mrad at the 0. 1 nC beam charge. A coupling hole between the waveguide and the cavity of a photo-cathode RF gun causes asymmetries in the RF fields at the coupler cell. The dipole and quadruple fields are the dominant sources of the transverse RF emittance growth. In the BNL Gun-III, the dipole field is reduced by adding a symmetric <b>pumping</b> <b>hole</b> at {{the opposite side of}} the waveguide coupling hole. The dipole field can be reduced further by adjusting the size of the <b>pumping</b> <b>hole.</b> However, the quadruple field cannot be suppressed by the single <b>pumping</b> <b>hole.</b> We have designed new RF cavity in which the quadruple field as well as the dipole one is suppressed. In this design, two additional pumping ports are placed at 90 ° positions with respect to the coupling <b>hole</b> and the <b>pumping</b> <b>holes.</b> Beam dynamics simulation for newly designed RF gun shows that the vertical transverse emittance is reduced by about 60 % compared to the old one...|$|R

It is required that longitudinal and transverse emittance be kept small.

In addition the wake fields of the short bunches due to the surface roughness in this very long line can give a large contribution.

Normal incident of the irradiation on the absorbers is possible that the production-yields of photon stimulated desorption as well as the photoelectrons are minimized.

We {{report the}} results of the {{electronic}} structure calculation of a newly discovered member of the YBCO high-Tc family, i. e., Y 3 Ba 5 Cu 8 O 18 (Y 358) with Tc> 100, based on the full-potential linearized augmented plane waves method (FP-LAPW) of density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The evolution of the number of hole carriers in different sites of the CuO 2 planes and CuO chains has been investigated in comparison with the other YBCO family members, i. e., Y 123, Pr 123, Y 124, and Y 247. The results suggest that <b>pumping</b> <b>hole</b> carriers out of the chains toward the planes enhances the transition temperature. The band structure calculations have been performed for Y 358, and the results show similar features with the other family members.

40|$|The beam pipe {{foreseen}} for the LHC {{is rather}} unconventional. To shield the cold bore of the magnets from the synchrotron radiation emitted by protons at 7 TeV, a beam screen (the so called "liner") {{has been introduced}} practically along all the machine. The present design of the liner is a compromise among beam stability issues, vacuum requirements, heat load on the cold bore, electron cloud effects and mechanical constraints. Three main potential sources of beam energy loss in the actual LHC liner are addressed, namely the interaction with the <b>pumping</b> <b>holes,</b> the (sawtooth) surface corrugation {{and the effect of}} an azimuthally inhomogeneous metallic beam pipe modelling the high resistivity of the welding. The losses are estimated through a detailed electromagnetic analysis (by means of standard theories) seeking for analytical expressions of electromagnetic fields and/or coupling impedance. An analytical (or semi-analytical) approach is considered for each problem, to better understand the relevant parameters to be optimised. Whenever possible, the theoretical results are compared to numerical simulations and/or experimental data, sometimes found in literature and sometimes developed ad hoc.

40|$|The amazing {{world of}} natural history made its first impact on me during World War I 1 on the {{tropical}} island of Barbados. My Scottish father had become manager of the British Union Oil Company there. a srnall outfit that evplorcd {{for oil and gas}} on the island and refined crude oil from Venezuela. I had arrived in Barbados in Api-il of 1939, and with the outbreak of war and appearance of German U-boats in the region, my family became trapped on the island. As a result. I spent seven of my foi-mative years in a house in the tropics that had a golf cousse at the back and the emerald Caribbean Sea a short distance in front. This is where i t all began. The golf course became my hunting ground for butterflies and bird and reptile eggs. What a challenge i t was to try to net those elusive butterflies or reach a nest way out on a thin limb. Molluscs were also highly sought after. Sunrise Tellins (Tellirm radiata), which we called "auroras " because of their radiating colors, were a special prize. To capture them, I had to <b>pump</b> <b>holes</b> in the shallow back-reef sand with my feet until I could feel one of these slippery bivalves and dive i t up. When slit open and spread out to dry, they resembled butterflies. About the time I started school, I met the "ultimate collector, " Dr Alfred Senn. the British Union Oil Company's geologist. I used to spend hours after school watching him picking microfossils- mostly foraminifera, I think- out of samples and filing them in endless rows of small vials. This was the Iife for me: 1 decided then and there to become an oil company geologist. When the war ended, my father, convinced that an 1 1 -year old who was spending all his spare time in trees or in the sea was simply not taking life seriously enough, decided to ship me off to boarding school in Scotland. There I was expected to develop character and apply myself to more serious studies. So in 1946, still set on becoming an oil company geologist, I headed for the land of chilblains.
