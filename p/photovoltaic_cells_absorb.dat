The method {{is based on}} sustaining {{a difference in the}} chemical potential for electron populations above and below an energy gap and let this difference drive a current through an electric circuit. The difference in chemical potential originates from an imbalance in the excitation and de-excitation of electrons across the energy gap. The method has similarities to thermophotovoltaics and conventional photovoltaics. While <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cells</b> <b>absorb</b> thermal radiation from a body with higher temperature than the cell itself, thermoradiative cells are hot during operation and emit a net outflow of photons to colder surroundings. A thermoradiative cell with an energy gap of 0. 25 eV at a temperature of 500 K in surroundings at 300 K is found to have a theoretical efficiency limit of 33. 2 %. For a high-temperature thermoradiative cell with an energy gap of 0. 4 eV, a theoretical efficiency close to 50 % is found while the cell produces 1000 W/m 2 has a temperature of 1000 K and is placed in surroundings with a temperature of 300 K. Some aspects related to the practical implementation of the concept are discussed and some challenges are addressed. It is, for example, obvious that there is an upper boundary for the temperature under which solid state devices can work properly over time.

30|$|Most of the {{investigations}} on TPV systems focus on increasing conversion’s efficiency and power density. For such purpose, the spectral control of thermal radiation from an emitter to a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> is important. One of the effective approaches for the spectral control {{is to use}} a filter that control photons selectively from an emitter to a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> The filter in a TPV system plays its role in the following two aspects: (1) recycling thermal radiation, i.e. reflecting photons whose wavelengths are above the band gap wavelength of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> back to the emitter. This action helps to maintain a high temperature level of the emitter and reduce the cooling load of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> (2) transmitting photons selectively, i.e. selecting the photons from an emitter whose wavelengths are below the band gap wavelength of a <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell</b> to penetrate the filter and reach the cell. These photons can be absorbed and stimulate electrons out of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>cell.</b> The need to develop suitable filter stimulated investigation to improve the conversion’s efficiency of TPV systems.
