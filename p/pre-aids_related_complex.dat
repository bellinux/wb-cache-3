40|$|Local {{vibrational}} modes(LVMs) in tenths of InP samples reveal clearly {{existence of}} <b>complexes</b> <b>related</b> to hydrogen. <b>Complexes</b> of vacancy at indium site with {{one to four}} hydrogen atom(s) and isolated hydrogen or hydrogen dimers and complexes of hydrogen with various impurities and intrinsic defects are investigated by FTIR.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{differential}} cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid {{in patients who}} were serologically positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was studied in 30 patients with classified into four groups according to the severity of illness: (1) seven subjects with the AIDS <b>related</b> <b>complex</b> without clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary infection; (2) eight patients with the AIDS <b>related</b> <b>complex</b> and pulmonary tuberculosis; (3) eight patients with AIDS and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; and (4) seven patients with AIDS, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and severe respiratory failure. All four groups had a similar percentage of lymphocytes, significantly {{higher than that of}} a control group of 15 healthy volunteers. A significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils was observed in groups 2, 3, and 4. The lavage fluid differential cell count does not therefore appear to help in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infections in HIV positive patients. The abnormal percentage of lymphocytes observed in some patients with the AIDS <b>related</b> <b>complex</b> without clinical evidence of pulmonary infection suggests that lung injury may exist before clinical or radiological abnormalities develop. This might be related to an immunological mechanism or might be caused by an undetected subclinical infection...|$|R

New characterizations for some particular classes of complex Cartan spaces are pointed out, e. g. Landsberg-Cartan, strongly Berwald-Cartan and others. We introduce the Cartan-Randers spaces which offer examples of Berwald-Cartan and strongly Berwald-Cartan spaces. Then, we investigate the complex geodesic curves of a complex Cartan space, using the image by Legendre transformation (L- duality) of complex geodesic curves of a complex Finsler space. Assuming the weakly Kähler condition for a complex Cartan space, we establish that its complex geodesic curves derive from Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Also, by L- duality, we introduce the corespondent notion of the projectively <b>related</b> <b>complex</b> Finsler metrics, on the complex Cartan spaces.
