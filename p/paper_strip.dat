25|$|Ticker tape is a {{means of}} {{transmitting}} stock price information over telegraph lines. It consists of a <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> which ran through a machine called a stock ticker, which printed abbreviated company symbols followed by price and volume information.

40|$|A lot of HCI {{work has}} been done {{focusing}} on Air Traffic Controllers (ATC). Specifically, artifacts such as the flight progress strip have been studied in depth with varying results. In this project, I have done a user study to investigate further the bridge between digital data accessed by controllers and the static data that is printed and annotated on flight strips. My primary point of focus has been the behavior of controllers in high traffic periods as opposed to average to low traffic loads. With the continued call to eliminate <b>paper</b> <b>strips</b> from control towers, this study seeks to verify the usefulness of <b>paper</b> <b>strips.</b> The study shows that a combination of <b>paper</b> <b>strips</b> and digital strips is what controllers prefer. While the controllers want to use digital strips because of the significant functionality obtained from them, <b>paper</b> <b>strips</b> are still maintained as a backup interface because of their inherent reliability...|$|R

25|$|The {{printing}} telegraph is {{a derivative}} of the electrical telegraph which links two 28-key piano-style keyboards by electrical wire representing {{a letter of}} the alphabet and when pressed causing the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. The receiver would then receive the instantly readable text of the message on a <b>paper</b> <b>strip.</b> This {{is in contrast to}} the electrical telegraphs that used Morse Code 'dots' and 'dashes' which needed to be converted into readable text. After 1850, the printing telegraph was in common use, namely along the United States east coast and in France. The printing telegraph was invented in 1846 by Royal Earl House of Rockland, Vermont.|$|E
25|$|The zoetrope {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as its predecessor, the phenakistoscope, but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time.

The drum, on a spindle base, is spun. The faster the drum is spun, the smoother the animation appears.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a Möbius strip can be created by taking a <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> and giving it a half-twist, and then joining {{the ends of the}} strip to form a loop. However, the Möbius strip is not a surface of only one exact size and shape, such as the half-twisted <b>paper</b> <b>strip</b> {{depicted}} in the illustration. [...] Rather, mathematicians refer to the closed Möbius band as any surface that is homeomorphic to this strip. [...] Its boundary is a simple closed curve, i.e., homeomorphic to a circle. This allows for a very wide variety of geometric versions of the Möbius band as surfaces each having a definite size and shape. [...] For example, any rectangle can be glued to itself (by identifying one edge with the opposite edge after a reversal of orientation) to make a Möbius band. [...] Some of these can be smoothly modeled in [...] Euclidean space, and others cannot.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Ozone and {{formaldehyde}} {{were compared}} as poultry hatchery disinfectants in a poultry setter, and evaluated for effectiveness. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Proteus spp. were inoculated onto open petri plates and exposed to ozone or onto filter <b>paper</b> <b>strips</b> and exposed to ozone or formaldehyde in a poultry setter. Ozone (1. 41 to 1. 68 % by weight) resulted in significant bacterial reductions of> 4 logio {{on the open}} plates and> 3 logio on filter <b>paper</b> <b>strips,</b> whereas formaldehyde (triple strength) resulted in> 7 logio reduction on filter <b>paper</b> <b>strips.</b> Ozone was similarly lethal to organisms on filter <b>paper</b> <b>strips</b> at 90 % relative humidity (RH) and 13. 9 C, and at 50 % RH and 37. 7 C.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{specific}} screening method for patients {{at risk of}} inherited disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism is desirable because symptoms are varied and nonspecific. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a rapid and specific method for screening with use of liquid urine samples or urine-soaked filter <b>paper</b> <b>strips.</b> Reverse-phase HPLC was combined with electrospray ionization (ESI), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and detection performed by multiple reaction monitoring. Transitions and instrument settings were established for 17 purines or pyrimidines. Stable-isotope-labeled reference compounds were used as internal standards when available. Total analysis time of this method was 15 min, approximately one-third that of conventional HPLC with ultraviolet detection. Recoveries were 96 - 107 % in urine with added analyte, with two exceptions (hypoxanthine, 64 %; xanthine, 79 %), and 89 - 110 % in urine-soaked filter <b>paper</b> <b>strips,</b> with three exceptions (hypoxanthine, 65 %; xanthine, 77 %; 5 -hydroxymethyluracil, 80 %). The expected abnormalities were easily found in samples from patients with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, molybdenum cofactor deficiency, adenylosuccinase deficiency, or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency.
