40|$|Along with counterfeiting, {{theft of}} {{medicines}} {{is emerging as}} the new frontier of <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>crime.</b> In Italy between 2006 and 2013 one hospital out of ten has registered thefts of pharmaceuticals, suffering, on average, an economic loss of about 330 thousands euro each episode. This report represents the first study on this booming but almost unknown criminal phenomenon. In particular it carries out: • An exploration of the background behind pharmaceutical theft and of the drivers that influence the demand and the supply of stolen medicines (Chapter 1); • An analysis, based on cases reported by media, of thefts of medicines from Italian hospitals between 2006 and 2013 (Chapter 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{crimes are}} hardly {{committed}} by individuals but carefully organised by group of associates and affiliates loosely connected {{to each other}} with a single or small group of individuals coordinating the overall actions. A common starting point in understanding the structural organisation of criminal groups is to identify the criminals and their associates. Situations arise in many criminal datasets where there is no direct connection among the criminals. In this paper, we investigate ties and community structure in crime data {{in order to understand the}} operations of both traditional and cyber criminals, as well as to predict the existence of organised criminal networks. Our contributions are twofold: we propose a bipartite network model for inferring hidden ties between actors who initiated an illegal interaction and objects affected by the interaction, we then validate the method in two case studies on <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>crime</b> and underground forum data using standard network algorithms for structural and community analysis. The vertex level metrics and community analysis results obtained indicate the significance of our work in understanding the operations and structure of organised criminal networks which were not immediately obvious in the data. Identifying these groups and mapping their relationship to one another is essential in making more effective disruption strategies in the future. Comment: 8 page...|$|E

40|$|The falsification of {{medicinal}} products represents a significant public health threat and has rapidly {{turned into a}} global criminal phenomenon. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>crimes</b> are considered an emerging category of transnational organised crime and have progressively become cyber-enabled crimes. The international community {{has called for a}} stronger and more effective response, but the international legal framework has long remained substantially inadequate at both European and international levels. Against this background, 1 January 2016 marked a significant milestone in the fight against falsified medicines with the entry into force of the Council of Europe MEDICRIME Convention. The Convention is the first binding European criminal law instrument to oblige States Parties to criminalise the falsification of medical products and similar offences posing serious threats to public health. It represents a landmark tool which will pave the way for harmonised criminal legislation and enhanced international cooperation in criminal matters at pan-European level and beyond...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} possible {{links between the}} advent and diffusion {{of a number of}} new psychiatric <b>pharmaceutical</b> therapies and <b>crime</b> rates. We describe recent trends in crime and review the evidence showing mental illness as a clear risk factor both for criminal behavior and victimization. We then briefly summarize the development of a number of new pharmaceutical therapies for the treatment of mental illness which diffused during the “great American crime decline. ” We examine limited international data, as well as more detailed American data to assess the relationship between crime rates and rates of prescriptions of the main categories of psychotropic drugs, while controlling for other factors which may explain trends in crime rates. We find that increases in prescriptions for psychiatric drugs are associated with decreases in violent crime, with the largest impacts associated with new generation antidepressants and stimulants used to treat ADHD. ...|$|R
