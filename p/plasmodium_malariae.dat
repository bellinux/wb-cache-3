5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae.</b> These organisms typically enter the body through {{direct contact with the}} skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E

25|$|Plasmodium {{was first}} {{identified}} when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran described parasites {{in the blood}} of malaria patients in 1880. He named the parasite Oscillaria malariae. The fact that several species may be involved in causing different forms of malaria was first recognized by Camillo Golgi in 1886. Soon thereafter, Giovanni Batista Grassi and Raimondo Filetti named the parasites causing two different types of human malaria Plasmodium vivax and <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae.</b> In 1897, William Welch identified and named Plasmodium falciparum. This was followed by the recognition of the other two species of Plasmodium which infect humans: Plasmodium ovale (1922) and Plasmodium knowlesi (identified in long-tailed macaques in 1931; in humans in 1965). The contribution of insect hosts to the Plasmodium life cycle was described in 1897 by Ronald Ross and in 1899 by Giovanni Batista Grassi, Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli.|$|E

500|$|In 1885, Ettore Marchiafava, Angelo Celli and Camillo Golgi {{studied the}} {{reproduction}} cycles in human blood (Golgi cycles). Golgi observed that all parasites {{present in the}} blood divided almost simultaneously at regular intervals and that division coincided with attacks of fever. In 1886 Golgi described the morphological differences that are still used to distinguish two malaria parasite species Plasmodium vivax and <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae.</b> Shortly after this Sakharov in 1889 and Marchiafava & Celli in 1890 independently identified Plasmodium falciparum as a species distinct from P. vivax and P. malariae. In 1890, Grassi and Feletti reviewed the available information and named both P. malariae and P. vivax (although within the genus Haemamoeba.) By 1890, Laveran's germ was generally accepted, but most of his initial ideas had been discarded {{in favor of the}} taxonomic work and clinical pathology of the Italian school. Marchiafava and Celli called the new microorganism Plasmodium. H. vivax was soon renamed Plasmodium vivax. In 1892, Marchiafava and Bignami proved that the multiple forms seen by Laveran were from a single species. This species was eventually named P. falciparum. Laveran was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine [...] "in recognition of his work on the role played by protozoa in causing diseases".|$|E

40|$|Objective Despite {{the declining}} trend of malaria {{incidence}} {{over the last}} decade, <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum <b>malaria</b> has increased in China {{both in terms of}} the number of case and geographical coverage. Thus, to improve the control intervention, we examined the change in the risk of both Plasmodium vivax and <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum <b>malaria</b> across China during 2005 – 2014. Methods We applied logistic regression model to understand change in the risk of Plasmodium vivax and <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum <b>malaria</b> in each county across the study period, and linear regression model to examine annual change in longitude and latitude of affected areas. Results The risk of <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum <b>malaria</b> significantly increased with latitude and longitude, indicating that the incidence rate of <b>Plasmodium</b> falciparum <b>malaria</b> increased in the northern and eastern, or decreased in south and western China. Similarly, latitude and longitude of counties with Plasmodium falciparum significantly associated with year, showing annual increase in P. falciparum affected counties within the north and east. For Plasmodium vivax, the risk increased with latitude and longitude, but the longitude significantly decreased, and no significant change in latitude. Conclusion The risk of both Plasmodium falciparum and <b>Plasmodium</b> vivax <b>malaria</b> increased in the northern and eastern China, and was more noticeable for P. falciparum. An underlying cause of the increased malaria risk needs further investigation...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to this discovery, Golgi discovered a tendon sensory organ {{that bears his name}} (Golgi receptor). He studied the life cycle of Plasmodium and related the timing of tertian and quartan fevers seen in malaria with the life cycle of the organisms now named Plasmodium vivax and <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae,</b> respectively. Using his staining technique, Golgi identified the intracellular reticular apparatus in 1898 which bears his name, the Golgi apparatus.|$|E
50|$|Parasites use {{a variety}} of methods to infect hosts. For example, the Acanthamoeba enters the body when the {{environment}} is not hostile, and Strongyloides stercoralis enters the body when a host steps on infected ground while barefoot. Many parasites enter the food of their hosts and wait to be eaten. <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae</b> uses a mosquito host to transmit malaria, and Loa loa parasites use deer flies to enter hosts.|$|E

50|$|Similar to {{the other}} human-infecting Plasmodium parasites, <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae</b> has {{distinct}} developmental cycles in the Anopheles mosquito and in the human host. The mosquito serves as the definitive host and the human host is the intermediate. When the Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected individual, gametocytes are ingested from the infected person. A process known as exflagellation of the microgametocyte soon ensues and up to eight mobile microgametes are formed.|$|E
5000|$|Plasmodium knowlesi {{parasite}} replicates and completes its blood stage {{cycle in}} 24-hour cycles resulting in fairly high loads of parasite densities {{in a very}} short period of time. This makes it a potentially very severe disease if it remains untreated. Life cycle: merozoite → trophozoites → schizont → merozoite. These stages of Plasmodium knowlesi are microscopically indistinguishable from <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae</b> and the early trophozoites are identical to those of Plasmodium falciparum [...]|$|E
5000|$|<b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae</b> and P. knowlesi (which is {{the most}} common cause of malaria in South-east Asia) look very similar under the microscope. However, P. knowlesi parasitemia {{increases}} very fast and causes more severe disease than P. malariae, so it is important to identify and treat infections quickly. Therefore, modern methods such as PCR (see [...] "Molecular methods" [...] below) or monoclonal antibody panels that can distinguish between the two should be used in this part of the world.|$|E

50|$|Infants {{born with}} malaria can be {{infected}} {{with a variety}} of species; Plasmodium vivax, <b>Plasmodium</b> <b>malariae,</b> Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium falciparum.
