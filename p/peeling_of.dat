5|$|The {{recovery}} phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream. This usually lasts {{two to three}} days. The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> the skin. During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures. A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.|$|E
25|$|Common {{symptoms}} of mercury poisoning include peripheral neuropathy, presenting as paresthesia or itching, burning, pain, {{or even a}} sensation that resembles small insects crawling on or under the skin (formication); skin discoloration (pink cheeks, fingertips and toes); swelling; and desquamation (shedding or <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> skin).|$|E
25|$|Exfoliative toxins are exotoxins {{implicated in}} the disease staphylococcal scalded skin {{syndrome}} (SSSS), which occurs most commonly in infants and young children.

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the bioactive components (total phenolics, vitamin C and flavonoid), antioxidant properties (FRAP, and hydroxyl, DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging abilities) and inhibition of Fe 2 + -induced lipid peroxidation <b>of</b> the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> mango fruit stored at refrigeration temperature and room temperature. The <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> mango fruit stored at room temperature had significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) higher contents of total phenolic (13. 61 mg GAE/g), vitamin C (12. 98 mg AAE/g), total flavonoid (4. 49 mg QE/g) and non-flavonoid (9. 12 mg Qe/g) than the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> freshly harvested mango fruit and the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> mango fruit stored at refrigeration temperature. In consonance with the bioactive components, the <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> mango fruit stored at room temperature had a higher FRAP, and hydroxyl, DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging abilities than the others. The <b>peel</b> <b>of</b> mango fruit stored at room temperature showed stronger inhibition of Fe 2 + induced lipid peroxidation by exhibiting the least IC 50 (1. 44 mg/ml in brain), (1. 43 mg/ml in pancreas) and (1. 88 mg/ml in kidney). Thus freshly harvested, matured, edible and just ripe mango fruit (Sheri Mango) could be stored at room temperature and be consumed with the peel. </p...|$|R

Symptoms include nausea {{and loss of}} appetite as well as damage to bone marrow, lymph nodes and the spleen. Generally, these symptoms become more severe and noticeable in the 1000 to 3000mSv bracket with recovery probable, but not assured. New and more serious symptoms appear above 3000mSv such as <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> the skin, hemorrhaging and sterility with death if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|Food uses {{of sodium}} {{hydroxide}} include washing or chemical <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> fruits and vegetables, chocolate and cocoa processing, caramel coloring production, poultry scalding, soft drink processing, and thickening ice cream. Olives are often soaked in sodium hydroxide for softening; Pretzels and German lye rolls are glazed with a sodium hydroxide solution before baking {{to make them}} crisp. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining food grade sodium hydroxide in small quantities for home use, sodium carbonate is often used in place of sodium hydroxide.|$|E
25|$|The swollen glands or {{lymph nodes}} can persist {{for up to}} a week and the fever rarely rises above 38°C (100.4°F). The rash of German measles is {{typically}} pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer's sign occurs in 20% of cases, and is characterized by small, red papules on the area of the soft palate.|$|E

25|$|Cutaneous {{radiation}} syndrome (CRS) {{refers to the}} skin symptoms of radiation exposure. Within {{a few hours after}} irradiation, a transient and inconsistent redness (associated with itching) can occur. Then, a latent phase may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, blistering, and ulceration of the irradiated site are visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; however, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged sebaceous and sweat glands, atrophy, fibrosis (mostly Keloids), decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or necrosis of the exposed tissue. Notably, as seen at Chernobyl, when skin is irradiated with high energy beta particles, moist desquamation (<b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> skin) and similar early effects can heal, only to be followed by the collapse of the dermal vascular system after two months, resulting in the loss of the full thickness of the exposed skin. This effect had been demonstrated previously with pig skin using high energy beta sources at the Churchill Hospital Research Institute, in Oxford.|$|E

Common adverse drug reactions associated with topical formulationsfound in over 10% of peopleinclude: dryness, burning, itching, scaliness, or <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> skin (lotion, solution); erythema (foam, lotion, solution); oiliness (gel, lotion).

500|$|There is a {{pegylated}} (polyethylene glycol coated) liposome-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, sold as Doxil. It {{was developed}} to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer that causes lesions to grow under the skin, in {{the lining of the}} mouth, nose and throat, or in other organs. The polyethylene glycol coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome. [...] Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. [...] The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful. [...] In clinical testing at 50mg/m2 dosing every 4 weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin. [...] This form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.|$|E

2500|$|Apples {{historically}} were {{an important}} crop. Bourdélots are apple dumplings, {{but the most}} typical speciality is black butter (lé nièr beurre), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices (especially liquorice). Although called butter, it does not contain any milk. It is traditional to hold black butter nights (séthées d'nièr beurre) in autumn. These are still an important traditional social occasion in country areas; the stirring must be maintained around the clock. [...] The complete process of making black butter, including the <b>peeling</b> <b>of</b> the apples, the stirring of the mixture in a large cauldron throughout the night, the camaraderie and the jarring up was recently recorded by the filmmaker D. Rusowsky for a 48-minute documentary to {{capture the essence of}} this ancient recipe and reveal the spirit of one on Jersey’s best kept secrets: its people. Reviving the tradition benefits not only people and communities but creates a fertile social environment supporting the conservation of traditional orchards, which are highly endangered.|$|E
