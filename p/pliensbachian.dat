5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. The fossils {{were found in the}} siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the <b>Pliensbachian</b> stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{was first}} {{excavated}} from Antarctica's Early Jurassic, Sinemurian to <b>Pliensbachian</b> aged Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, by paleontologist Dr. William Hammer in 1991. It {{was the first}} carnivorous dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica and the first non-avian dinosaur from the continent to be officially named. The sediments in which its fossils were found have been dated at ~194 to 188 million years ago, representing the Early Jurassic Period.|$|E
5|$|Scelidosaurus lived {{during the}} Early Jurassic Period, during the Sinemurian to <b>Pliensbachian</b> stages around 191million years ago. This genus and related genera {{at the time}} lived on the supercontinent Laurasia. Its fossils have been found near Charmouth in Dorset, England, and {{are known for their}} {{excellent}} preservation. Scelidosaurus has been called the earliest complete dinosaur. It is the most completely known dinosaur of the British Isles. Scelidosaurus is currently the only classified dinosaur found in Ireland. Despite this, a modern description is still lacking. After initial finds in the 1850s, comparative anatomist Richard Owen named and described Scelidosaurus in 1859. Only one species, Scelidosaurus harrisonii named by Owen in 1861, is considered valid today, although one other species was proposed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} neotype, other fossils are known of Scelidosaurus. In 1888 Lydekker catalogued {{a large number}} of single bones, largely limb elements, and osteoderms, that had been {{acquired}} by the BMNH from the Norris collection. Owen in 1861 described a second, partial, skeleton of a juvenile animal, that later was added to the collection of Elizabeth Philpot and today is registered in the Lyme Regis Museum as specimen LYMPH 1997.37.4-10. As it was relatively large, Owen speculated, in the context of its presumed marine lifestyle, that Scelidosaurus might have been ovoviviparous. The short prepubis in this specimen convinced scientists that this process did not represent the main pubic body as some had thought, who had been unable to believe that the thin, backward-pointing, pubis with the Ornithischia was homologous to the forward-pointing much larger pubic bone in most reptilian groups. In more recent times, new discoveries have been made at Charmouth, not through commercial quarrying but by the efforts of amateur palaeontologists. In 1968 a second partial juvenile skeleton was described, specimen BMNH R6704, that had already been reported in 1959. Found by geologist James Frederick Jackson (1894-1966) of Charmouth, it is from a slightly younger layer, the Stonebarrow Marl Member dating to the early <b>Pliensbachian,</b> about 190 million years old. In 1985 Simon Barnsley, David Costain and Peter Langham excavated a partial skeleton including a very complete skull and skin impressions, which was sold to the Bristol Museum where it is registered as specimen BRSMG CE12785. Specimen CAMSMX.39256 is part of the collection of the Sedgwick Museum at Cambridge. Several specimens remain undescribed because they are in private collections. These include a two metres (7ft) long skeleton found by David Sole in 2000, perhaps the most complete non-avian dinosaur exemplar ever discovered in the British Isles. All elements of the skeleton are now known. The finds by Sole differ from the neotype in details of the armour and might represent a separate taxon or reflect sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of sediment packages throughout the Northern Carnarvon Basin and Exmouth Plateau varies with location during the Jurassic. By the <b>Pliensbachian,</b> the general beginning {{structure of the}} Northern Carnarvon Basin was formed, creating the Exmouth, Barrow, and Dampier sub-basins along the proximal end of the northwestern Australian margin. Rapid subsidence of the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins ensued the deposition of the Dingo Claystones. These Claystones are thick marine shale deposits separated into two sequence, the Upper and Lower Dingo Claystones. The Lower Dingo sequence cannot {{be found in the}} Exmouth Plateau, because deposition During the Early to Middle Jurassic was restricted to sediments filling in the empty troughs of the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins. As deposition continued through the Middle and Late Jurassic, the troughs of sub-basins filled allowing more of the Dingo sediment overflow into the distal margins of the region. This depositional sequence characterizes the Upper Dingo Claystones, which are found as thick proximal sequences in the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins and thinner distal sequences in the Exmouth Plateau.|$|E
25|$|The Kayenta Formation {{is part of}} the Glen Canyon Group that {{includes}} formations not only in northern Arizona but also parts of southeastern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. It is composed mostly of two facies, one dominated by silty deposition and the other dominated by sandstone. The siltstone facies is found in much of Arizona, while the sandstone facies is present in areas of northern Arizona, southern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. The formation was primarily deposited by rivers, with the silty facies as the slower, more sluggish part of the river system. Kayenta Formation deposition was ended by the encroaching dune field that would become the Navajo Sandstone. A definitive radiometric dating of this formation has not yet been made, and the available stratigraphic correlation has been based on a combination of radiometric dates from vertebrate fossils, magnetostratigraphy and pollen evidence. It has been surmised that the Kayenta Formation was deposited during the Sinemurian and <b>Pliensbachian</b> stages of the Early Jurassic Period or approximately 196 to 183 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|Massospondylus ( [...] from Greek, [...] (massōn, [...] "longer") and [...] (spondylos, [...] "vertebra")) is a genus of sauropodomorph dinosaur {{from the}} Early Jurassic Period (Hettangian to <b>Pliensbachian</b> ages, ca. 200–183million years ago). It was {{described}} by Sir Richard Owen in 1854 from remains discovered in South Africa, and is thus {{one of the first}} dinosaurs to have been named. Fossils have since been found at other locations in South Africa, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe. Material from Arizona's Kayenta Formation, India, and Argentina has been assigned to this genus at various times, but the Arizonan and Argentinian material are now assigned to other genera.|$|E
500|$|All known {{specimens}} of Cryolophosaurus {{have been recovered}} in the Hanson Formation, {{which is one of}} only two major dinosaur-bearing rock formations found on the continent of Antarctica. It was discovered in [...] "tuffaceous" [...] siltstone deposited in the Sinemurian to <b>Pliensbachian</b> stage of the Early Jurassic, approximately 194 to 188 million years ago. This geological formation is part of the Victoria Group of the Transantarctic Mountains, which is approximately [...] above sea level. The high altitude of this site supports the idea that early Jurassic Antarctica had forests populated by a diverse range of species, at least along the coast. The Hanson Formation was deposited in an active volcano−tectonic rift system formed during the breakup of Gondwana.|$|E
2500|$|During the Sinemurian and <b>Pliensbachian</b> {{ages of the}} Early Jurassic, the [...] Kayenta Formation had {{a diverse}} fauna, with the remains of caecilians, frogs, turtles, at least five other taxa of crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs, theropod, sauropodomorph, and ornithischian dinosaurs, and early {{relatives}} of mammals (tritylodontids and morganucodontids).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pliensbachian</b> {{ended with}} the {{extinction}} event called the Toarcian turnover. During the <b>Pliensbachian,</b> the middle part of the Lias was deposited in Europe. The <b>Pliensbachian</b> is roughly coeval with the Charmouthian regional stage of North America.|$|E
