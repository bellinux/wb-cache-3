5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It <b>prefers</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E

5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country <b>prefers</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with {{the country would be}} slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it may persuade Uzbekistan to join in the future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E

Other original drawings have been occasionally given away through the Bitter Films online store through special promotions. Because Hertzfeldt also rarely does signings, his artwork is rare for animation collectors and fans to own.|$|E

25|$|In China, {{due to an}} {{increasing}} need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel. This is probably because China <b>prefers</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be dependent on foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing {{during the first half}} of 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{populate}} the film with many characters, {{as in his}} previous films, here the story focuses on the compelling relationship at its center: the actress and her kidnapper literally struggling for power and desperate for love. The film's title line Tie Me Up! is unexpectedly uttered by the actress as a genuine request. She does not know if she will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, she <b>prefers</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be given a chance. In spite of some dark elements, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! {{can be described as}} a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E
25|$|The show follows {{secret agent}} Angus MacGyver, played by Richard Dean Anderson, {{who works as}} a {{troubleshooter}} for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles and as an agent for a fictional United States government agency, the Department of External Services (DXS). Educated as a scientist in Physics at Western Tech ("Hell Week"), MacGyver served in the U.S. Army Special Forces as a Bomb Team Technician/EOD during the Vietnam War ("Countdown"). Resourceful and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of the physical sciences, he solves complex problems by making things out of ordinary objects, along with his ever-present Swiss Army knife, duct tape, and occasionally matches. He favors non-violent resolutions and <b>prefers</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> handle a gun due to a gun death of one of his friends in his teenage years.|$|E

25|$|Richard Dean Anderson as Angus MacGyver, {{a secret}} agent who <b>prefers</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> carry {{or use a}} firearm, due to a {{childhood}} accident with a revolver {{that resulted in the}} death of a friend. However, MacGyver is willing to use an acquired gun, its parts, or its bullets in non-standard ways, such as a substitute for a wrench. There are three exceptions when he uses a gun for its original intended purpose: in the pilot episode, MacGyver is seen firing an AK-47 on a mission in the opening gambit (7:51 into the episode); he holds two kidnappers at gunpoint in the opening scene of episode 10, season one; and, is seen using a gun in the TV movie Trail to Doomsday. He is often suspicious of militaristic attitudes within the government; he sees the Los Angeles-based Phoenix Foundation, his employer, as an alternative to more conventional (and violent) means of law enforcement.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2011, the {{original}} Ruth Martin, actress Mary Fickett, {{died at age}} 83. The episode on Wednesday September 21, 2011, was dedicated to her. On September 23, 2011, the series finale aired on ABC with open-ended stories. The final week featured Dr. Joe and Ruth Martin relocating to Pine Valley to cover recently arrested David Hayward's hospital duties. The return of Adam Chandler and Brooke English coincided with the revelation that David had somehow resurrected Stuart Chandler. Jackson Montgomery dissolved his relationship with Erica after she admitted that she <b>prefers</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> remarry. Unresolved is JR Chandler's plunge into insanity as he drunkenly aims a gun at a crowd of All My Children regulars during a welcome-home party for Stuart. The screen darkened before revealing the victim, leaving the story open for an eventual continuation with Prospect Park. On April 29, 2013, the revived series moved five {{years into the future}} after {{the original}} series finale on ABC. On November 11, 2013, it was confirmed by some of its actors that the series had once again become cancelled, this time by its online revival team.|$|E
