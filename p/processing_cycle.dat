500|$|The {{engine for}} God of War III {{was from the}} first two installments. Santa Monica senior {{producer}} Steve Caterson said that the development team ported God of War IIs engine to the PlayStation 3 {{and were able to}} quickly play the game. Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content. As the game was being developed, the code department would swap out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system. Feldman said that although they were re-using the engine from God of War II, the core engine for God of War III was brand new. Between the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and the time the game shipped, morphological anti-aliasing (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said [...] "improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate." [...] MLAA is [...] "now a popular edge-detection process that can cost-effectively remove jagged edges from each frame", which helped Santa Monica free up the <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> and [...] "allowed them to add to the spectacle in other ways." [...] Diamand also said that [...] "depth-of-field, motion blur, crepuscular 'god' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed" [...] during that same time period.|$|E

50|$|MVS maximized {{processing}} potential {{by providing}} multiprogramming and multiprocessing capabilities. Like its MVT and OS/VS2 SVS predecessors, MVS supported multiprogramming; program instructions and associated data are scheduled by a control program and given <b>processing</b> <b>cycles.</b> Unlike a single-programming operating system, these systems maximize {{the use of}} the processing potential by dividing <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> among the instructions associated with several different concurrently running programs. This way, the control program does not {{have to wait for the}} I/O operation to complete before proceeding. By executing the instructions for multiple programs, the computer is able to switch back and forth between active and inactive programs.|$|R
50|$|Raw {{data from}} the DAMP ship's sensors was {{delivered}} to the data reduction center for reduction, smoothing, and conversion to forms appropriate to interpretation. Equipment used in this data <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> included a digital tape translator, an IBM 709 computer, an analog computer, various tape and card converters and card punches, analog and digital playback equipment, data plotters, chart and film readers, oscilloscope cameras and oscilloscopes, a photo darkroom, and miscellaneous support equipment.|$|E
50|$|Case based: in case based configurators, the {{knowledge}} necessary for reasoning is stored mainly in cases that record {{a set of}} configurations sold to earlier customers. With the case based approach, one tries to solve the current configuration problem by finding a similar, previously solved problem and adapting it to the new requirements. The basic <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> in a case based configurators is: input customer requirements, retrieve a configuration and adapt {{the case to the}} new situation.|$|E
50|$|The general <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> {{for modern}} {{cryogenic}} processors occurs within a three-day time window, with 24 hours {{to reach the}} optimal bottom temperature for a product, 24 hours to hold at the bottom temperature, and 24 hours to return to room temperature. Depending on the product, some items will be heated in an oven to even higher temperatures. Some processors are capable of providing both the negative and positive extreme temperatures, separate units (a cryogenic processor and a dedicated oven) can sometimes produce better results depending upon the application.|$|E
30|$|The main {{low-power}} techniques {{targeted at}} achieving lower consumed <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> and memory requirements are both described and discussed in Section 2. In this part, we address in analysis how to partition the decoder {{so as to}} provide scalable output.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} engine's control overhead is {{less than}} 10 % of the total <b>processing</b> <b>cycles.</b> Pipelined <b>processing</b> of data is interrupted mainly by CORDIC subroutine in an average of 4820 cycles/symbol. A total of 95 MIPS are supported @ 120 MHz.|$|R
5000|$|Since all the {{above-mentioned}} inefficiencies consumes extra <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> of a processor(which in turns {{the consumption of}} electricity) for a machine than needed, it will increase the overall lifetime power usage(electricity) by a machine which processes Unicode Tamil and might reduce the lifetime of that machine. For example, take a very simple instance of processing a single Tamil character kI (கீ), it has to process both consonant and vowel modifier, which doubles the consumption of <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> of a processor(which in turns the consumption of electricity). If we consider all the machines and servers across the whole world which processes the Unicode Tamil characters, the extra processing power consumption will be huge.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{software}} development, an interceptor pattern is a software design pattern that is used when software systems or frameworks want to offer a way to change, or augment, their usual <b>processing</b> <b>cycle.</b> For example, a (simplified) typical processing sequence for a web-server is to receive a URI from the browser, map it to a file on disk, open the file and send its contents to the browser. Any of these steps could be replaced or changed, e.g. by replacing the way URIs are mapped to filenames, or by inserting a new step which processes the files contents.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, {{following}} the setback of the Israeli Operation Opera {{attack on the}} reactor at Osirak, the Iraqis continued to work on building a full <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> for uranium and plutonium, primarily using Italian equipment. On 5 April 1976, Iraq signed a contract for a radiochemistry laboratory with Italy, {{to be done by}} four Italian firms. Work was completed in 1978. A second contract, signed in 1978, covered a fuel fabrication laboratory, a radioisotope production laboratory, a materials testing laboratory, and a chemical engineering laboratory. While the CIA report was partially redacted, Iraq had some contact with Italy regarding laser enrichment of uranium.|$|E
50|$|Reasonable Server Faces (RSF) is an {{open source}} web {{programming}} framework written in Java, developed at the Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies (CARET) at the University of Cambridge. RSF is built on the Spring framework, and allows views to be templated in pure XHTML, {{as well as other}} XML dialects. RSF takes responsibility for the entire request <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> through HTTP request decoding, maintaining a bean model, invoking actions, directing errors, interpreting results and rendering views. A principal aim of RSF is to facilitate designs where zero server state is held in between requests.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the effect of}} three <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> on the {{physical}} properties of polypropylene (PP) was studied and related to {{the changes in the}} structure (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, morphology) occurring during recycling. In order to simulate both the use and the recycling process of PP in the laboratory, PP pellets were contaminated with three model substances and submitted to three <b>cycles</b> of <b>processing</b> by injection molding. The bars for testing were produced from virgin and recycled polymers. The amount of degradation occurring during the reprocessing was estimated by means of viscosity and gel permeation chromatography measurements. Differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed to investigate the crystallization behavior and the morphology of virgin and recycled PP. In order to obtain information on the structural organization and mobility of the amorphous phase, a dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and measurements of the transport properties were carried out. The results obtained were attributed to the different structural organization of the bars in relation to the number of <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> and contamination. Part of the work was focused on the recyclability of PP for food packaging applications, considering the residual contamination and migrational behavior after repeated <b>processing</b> <b>cycles.</b> In particular, the relationships existing between reprocessing, the residual amounts of contaminants, and the migrational behavior were investigate...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of cheap and {{powerful}} hardware for workstations and networks, a new cluster-based architecture for Time Warp simulations has been envisioned. However, fine-grained Time Warp applications that communicate frequently are not the ideal candidates for such architectures due to their high latency communication costs. Hence, designers of fine-grained Time Warp applications on clusters {{are faced with the}} problem of reducing the high communication latency of the communication subsystem in such architectures. An efficient communication subsystem consumes a lower fraction of the <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> for communication operations and allows the majority of the <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> to be used by the application. This increases the performance of Time Warp applications. This thesis reduces the latency of the communication subsystem by selecting one of the following approaches: (i) reducing network latency by employing a higher performance network hardware (i. e., Fast Ethernet versus Myrine [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|A more {{specialized}} definition of state {{is used in}} some computer programs that operate serially (sequentially) on streams of data, such as parsers, firewalls, communication protocols and encryption programs. Serial programs operate on the incoming data characters or packets sequentially, one at a time. In some of these programs, information about previous data characters or packets received is stored in variables and used to affect the processing of the current character or packet. This is called a [...] "stateful protocol" [...] and the data carried over from the previous <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> is called the [...] "state". In others, the program has no information about the previous data stream and starts [...] "fresh" [...] with each data input; {{this is called a}} [...] "stateless protocol".|$|E
50|$|Soar’s main <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> {{arises from}} the {{interaction}} between procedural memory (its knowledge {{about how to do}} things) and working memory (its representation of the current situation) to support the selection and application of operators. Information in working memory is represented as a symbolic graph structure, rooted in a state. The knowledge in procedural memory is represented as if-then rules (sets of conditions and actions), that are continually matched against the contents of working memory. When the conditions of a rule matches structures in working memory, it fires and performs its actions. This combination of rules and working memory is also called a production system. In contrast to most production systems, in Soar, all rules that match, fire in parallel.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} subsets of this method, including valley impoundments, ring dikes, in-pit impoundments, and specially dug pits. The most common is the valley pond, which {{takes advantage of the}} natural topographical depression in the ground. Large earthen dams may be constructed and then filled with the tailings. Exhausted open pit mines may be refilled with tailings. In all instances, due consideration must be made to contamination of the underlying water table, amongst other issues. Dewatering {{is an important part of}} pond storage, as the tailings are added to the storage facility the water is removed - usually by draining into decant tower structures. The water removed can thus be reused in the <b>processing</b> <b>cycle.</b> Once a storage facility is filled and completed, the surface can be covered with topsoil and revegetation commenced. However, unless a non-permeable capping method is used, water that infiltrates into the storage facility will have to be continually pumped out into the future.|$|E

Moisture from the air of both cabin and greenhouse is processed and reused in both. Wash water from the cabin is processed and reused in the cabin as hygiene water, and urine from the cabin is processed and used in the greenhouse. Spent water from the greenhouse is processed and reused in the greenhouse. Portions of the <b>processing</b> <b>cycles</b> are separated between cabin and greenhouse in order to reduce to a minimum cross contamination of the two habitat systems.

5000|$|The United States Navy {{currently}} operates {{boot camp}} at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at Naval Station Great Lakes, near North Chicago, Illinois. Instead of having Drill Sergeants or Drill Instructors like other {{branches of the}} U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Navy has RDCs (Recruit Division Commanders) that are assigned to each division. Training lasts approximately eight weeks (although some recruits will spend as many as nine weeks in training due to the somewhat complicated <b>processing</b> <b>cycle).</b> Days are counted by a system that lists the week and day that they are on, for example 7-3 for week 7 day 3. The first approximate week is counted P-1, P-2, etc. which denotes {{that it is a}} processing day and does not count as part of their 8-week training period. Recruits are instructed on military drill, basic seamanship, basic shipboard damage control, firefighting, familiarization with the M9 pistol and Mossberg 500 shotgun (the Navy no longer gives instruction on the M16 in boot camp), pass the confidence chamber (tear-gas-filled chamber), PT, and the basic essentials on Navy life. Recruits also attend many classes throughout boot camp on subjects such as Equal Opportunity, Sexual Assault Victim Intervention, Uniform Code of Military Justice, recognition of naval aircraft and vessels, and more. In order for recruits to pass boot camp, they are physically and mentally tested on a 12-hour exercise called Battle Stations which consists of 12 different scenarios involving firefighting, first-aid knowledge, survival at sea, mass casualties, shipboard flood control, bomb detection, and many other skills that they have been learning in the previous 7 weeks. After completion of boot camp, freshly minted Sailors are sent either to various [...] "A" [...] Schools located across the United States—where they begin training to receive their ratings (jobs)—or to apprenticeship training, where they then enter the fleet without a designation.|$|E

40|$|Background: The second <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> {{for adding}} the {{artificial}} teeth to heat-polymerized acrylic resin denture bases {{may result in}} dimensional changes of the denture bases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the dimensional changes of the heat-polymerized acrylic resin denture bases with one and two-cycle processing methods. Materials and Methods: A metal edentulous maxillary arch was used for making 40 stone casts. Maxillary complete dentures were made with heat-polymerized acrylic resins (Meliodent and Acropars) with one and two stage processing methods (n = 10 for each group). Linear dimensional changes in anteroposterior and mediolateral distances and vertical changes in the first molar region were measured following each <b>processing</b> <b>cycle,</b> using a digital caliper. Mean percentage of the dimensional changes were subjected to two-way analysis of variance and Tukey honest significant difference tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Postpolymerization contraction occurred in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions in all studied groups; however, the vertical dimension was increased. Acropars acrylic resin showed the highest dimensional changes and the second <b>processing</b> <b>cycle</b> significantly affected the measured distances (P < 0. 05). Meliodent acrylic resin was not significantly influenced by the processing method. Conclusion: Reheating of the acrylic resin denture bases for the addition of denture teeth result in linear dimensional changes, which can be clinically significant based on the acrylic resin used...|$|E
