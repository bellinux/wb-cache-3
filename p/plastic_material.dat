5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the <b>plastic</b> <b>material</b> is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

40|$|In recent times, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} need for the fabrication of mortar and concrete that can be characterised as sustainable and environmentally friendly.

These <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> take the form of fillers or shredded fibres derived from polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate. The use of <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> presents the following benefits: (i) enhanced mixture quality and (ii) a reduction in the amount of accumulated single-use <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> that negatively impact the environment.

In order to fulfill this goal, the Commission of the European Communities has published 21 Directives during the last 30 years, most of which are related to <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. This review of E. U. Regulations provides the basic rules necessary for testing migration of constituents of <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> such as the migration test conditions (times and temperatures), selection of food simulants, substitute fat test for overall and specific migration, determination of overall and specific migration and migration limits for some monomers and other starting substances. In Arabic Countries, there are no legislations which organize the use of <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. For this reason, the authors suggest that Arab authorities may lay down the necessary legislations for quality control of <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, and to establish the needed laboratories equipped with all modern analytical techniques for the purpose of the determination of overall and specific migration levels from the <b>plastic</b> <b>materials</b> and articles into foodstuffs...|$|R

25|$|The sealing {{materials}} of aluminum electrolytic capacitors {{depend on the}} different styles. For larger screw-terminal and snap-in capacitors the sealing washer is made of a <b>plastic</b> <b>material.</b> Axial electrolytic capacitors usually have a sealing washer made of phenolic resin laminated {{with a layer of}} rubber. Radial electrolytic capacitors use a rubber plug with a very dense structure. All sealing materials must be inert to the chemical parts of the electrolyte and may not contain soluble compounds that could lead to contamination of the electrolyte. To avoid leakage, the electrolyte must not be aggressive to the sealing material.|$|E
25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member {{is less than the}} elastic {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (<b>plastic)</b> <b>material</b> behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E
25|$|Resistive plate {{chambers}} (RPC) {{are fast}} gaseous detectors {{that provide a}} muon trigger system parallel {{with those of the}} DTs and CSCs. RPCs consist of two parallel plates, a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode, both made of a very high resistivity <b>plastic</b> <b>material</b> and separated by a gas volume. When a muon passes through the chamber, electrons are knocked out of gas atoms. These electrons in turn hit other atoms causing an avalanche of electrons. The electrodes are transparent to the signal (the electrons), which are instead picked up by external metallic strips after a small but precise time delay. The pattern of hit strips gives a quick measure of the muon momentum, which is then used by the trigger to make immediate decisions about whether the data are worth keeping. RPCs combine a good spatial resolution with a time resolution of just one nanosecond (one billionth of a second).|$|E

Trapped air in the mould can escape through air vents that are ground into the parting line of the mould, or around ejector pins and slides that are slightly smaller than the holes retaining them. If the trapped air {{is not allowed to}} escape, it is compressed by the pressure of the incoming material and squeezed into the corners of the cavity, where it prevents filling and can also cause other defects. The air can even become so compressed that it ignites and burns the surrounding <b>plastic</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
500|$|Injection {{moulding}} uses a ram or screw-type plunger {{to force}} molten <b>plastic</b> <b>material</b> into a mould cavity; this solidifies into a shape that has conformed to the contour of the mould. It is {{most commonly used}} to process both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, with the volume used of the former being considerably higher. Thermoplastics are prevalent due to characteristics which make them highly suitable for injection moulding, such as {{the ease with which}} they may be recycled, their versatility allowing them to be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, [...] and their ability to soften and flow upon heating. Thermoplastics also have an element of safety over thermosets; if a thermosetting polymer is not ejected from the injection barrel in a timely manner, chemical crosslinking may occur causing the screw and check valves to seize and potentially damaging the injection moulding machine.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{sublimation}} printing, where {{a special}} ink is printed onto the keycap {{surface and the}} application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or [...] "keycaps", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the <b>plastic</b> <b>material</b> that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop <b>plastic</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
