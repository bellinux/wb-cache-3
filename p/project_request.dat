40|$|Abstract- The most {{important}} fact for {{this paper is}} that, {{in addition to the}} common machine industry measuring devices, a manually operated coordinate measuring machine (DEA Beta) was used for the first time. Airfoil controls at the desired sections of the model for wind tunnel testing were performed manually by bringing the machine to the desired X, Y positions and by probe contact in the negative Z direction. The model design required a new generation of machine tools with 3 - 5 axis simultaneous control. The last missing piece was CMM DEA Epsilon 2304. Geometric similarity is the primary requirement defined in the <b>project</b> <b>request</b> for model production. Wind tunnel tests are laboratory tests, so the accuracy requirements of the model design are very high. The aim of the testing is to determine the character and values of the aerodynamic force and moment in the flow around the missile model type M.
