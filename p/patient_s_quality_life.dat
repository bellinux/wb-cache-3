40|$|Introduction Aglossia {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{caused by}} failure of the tongue embryogenesis process (in the fourth to eighth weeks of gestation). The tongue is an organ used in different activities such as sucking, swallowing, chewing, and talking. It is also responsible for shaping palate dental arches (in its absence, they become atrophic). There are few similar cases reported in the literature. Objective To describe a rare case of aglossia and the multidisciplinary professionals working together for 5 years to treat the patient. Resumed Report An 8 -year-old girl with aglossia had an assessment comprising: (1) clinical assessment of the stomatognathic system related to resting posture, tonus, and mobility; (2) orthodontic assessment; (3) surface electromyography of the chewing muscles; (4) swallowing videofluoroscopy. Conclusion The authors confirmed the need of multidisciplinary cooperation to improve the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>life,</b> because agenesia implicates many activities/ functions that depend on the tongue to fully work.

To assess QoL of patients with hereditary neuropathies we performed a prospective multicenter (six centers see affiliations) multidimensional study by using validated clinical, disability, and <b>quality</b> of <b>life</b> measurements. We enrolled 13 patients affected by HNPP: 5 females, 8 males, mean age 41. 2 years (SD 13. 6, range 22 66). We used the most common tool for QoL assessment: the SF- 36. The large diffusion of SF 36 in scientific literature allows the use of the scale as a standard. SF- 36 consists of 36 questions that inquire about the general health status of patients. This questionnaire provides eight specific categories of physical and emotional scores (Physical Functioning-PF, Role-Physical-RP, Bodily Pain-BP, General Health-GH, Vitality-VT, Social Functioning-SF, Role Emotional-RE, Mental Health-MH). Low scores indicate deterioration of the health status. The official Italian version was used; administration to the patients was done in agreement with standardized methodologies. We compared the SF- 36 results of our sample of HNPP patients with those of Italian norms by using the one sample t-test. We observed that <b>Quality</b> of <b>Life</b> in HNPP is not impaired except for a mild deterioration of Physical Function domain, but this does not determine inability to perform daily activity due to physical or mental problems (Role Physical and Role Emotional which evaluate this two aspects are not significantly deteriorated with respect to the Italian norms). We think that QoL is not deteriorated in HNPP patients because deficits are usually focal and transitory. Interestingly, the awareness of being affected by an hereditary neurological disease associated with experienced transitory deficits does not determine deterioration of the mental aspects of QoL. We do believe that we should consider these results in approaching HNPP and we should use them to reassure patients with HNPP, especially at the moment we communicate the diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Management of deep sternal wound {{infection}} (DSWI) in cardiac surgical patients {{still remains}} challenging. A variety of treatment strategies has been described. Aim of this cohort {{study was to}} analyse two different treatment strategies for DSWI: titanium sternal plating system (TSFS) and muscle flap coverage (MFC). Between January 2007 and December 2011, from 3122 patients undergoing cardiac surgery 42 were identified with DSWI and treated {{with one of the}} above mentioned strategies. In-hospital data were collected, follow-up performed by telephone and assessment of <b>Quality</b> of <b>Life</b> (QoL) using the SF- 12 Health Survey Questionnaire. 20 patients with deep sternal wound infection were stabilized with TSFS and 22 patients treated with MFC. Preoperative demographics and risk factors did not reveal any significant differences. Patients treated with TSFS had a significantly shorter operation time (p< 0. 05) and shorter hospitalization (p< 0. 05). A tendency towards lower mortality rate (p = n. s.) and less re-interventions were also noted (plating 0. 6 vs. flap 1. 17 per <b>patient,</b> n. <b>s.).</b> <b>Quality</b> of <b>Life</b> in the TSFS group for the physical-summary-score was significantly elevated compared to the MFC group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|In {{automated}} home care systems (HCSs), sensor technology is employed to monitor patients, thereby aiming {{to reduce the}} workload of healthcare professionals and improving the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>life.</b> A complex event processing (CEP) system {{can be used to}} analyze sensor readings and identify interesting events. CommonSens is a CEP system that is specifically designed for automated HCSs, which simplifies the work of the application programmer by adapting to different environment and sensor configuration. It provides fundamental data models for the environment, sensors and events, which enables the user to identify elements in the home environment and to reuse these elements. However, some required features are not fully implemented, such as support for processing multiple queries simultaneously and a solution for notifying the caregiver when an important event has occurred. Esper is considered the leading open source CEP provider and can be applied to a variety of domains. As Esper is designed in a generalized way, it has to be extended in order for it to be usable as an underlying CEP system for an automated HCS. In this thesis we investigate if Esper {{can be used as a}} CEP system to build an automated HCS by implementing the three fundamental data models of CommonSens with Esper. The resulting system is called EsperSens. To sim- plify the work for the application programmer, by using the query language of CommonSens, we create a translator that takes a CommonSens query and constructs an Esper query. We implement a web application to serve as a user interface for the system so that it can be accessed by multiple devices, e. g., a smartphone or a laptop. To evaluate if EsperSens correctly detects events we performed simula- tions with synthetic workloads. We measure the time Esper needs to process events during these simulations and compare them with the results of run- ning these simulations with CommonSens. Our results show that EsperSens correctly detect events, but runs on average slower than CommonSens. Com- pared to the time measured when delivering a notification over a network, the difference between CommonSens and EsperSens is insignificant. We con- clude that EsperSens satisfies the most crucial requirement of automated HCS, which is to correctly detect events in near real-time and deliver notifi- cations to a healthcare professional...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of evidence-based, {{prospective}} {{studies in}} treatment of nasal polyposis. The correlations between symptoms, polyp scores and computed tomography (CT) scans have not been studied sufficiently. Little, if any, sense of smell is common in nasal inflammatory disease. It is clinically well-known that the <b>quality</b> of <b>life</b> deteriorates when one starts to lose the sense of smell. Aims: I & III. To compare the effects of medical treatment and combined surgical / medical treatment on olfaction, polyp scores and symptoms in patients with nasal polyposis and evaluate CT scans as a method for comparing these effects. II. To compare the effects on olfaction of topical glucocorticoid treatment and placebo given for six months in addition to oral glucocorticoids for 10 days, in patients with anosmia / hyposmia. IV. To study the effects of loss of smell on the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>life</b> and the coping strategies used. Methods: I & III. Thirty-two patients with nasal polyposis were randomized to unilateral endoscopic sinus surgery after pretreatment with oral prednisolone for 10 days and nasal budesonide bilaterally for one month. Postoperatively, they were given nasal steroids (budesonide) bilaterally for one year. During this period, they were assessed with nasal endoscopy, symptom scores and olfactory thresholds. CT-scans of the sinuses, performed before and one year after operation, were evaluated using the Lund staging system. II. The study was randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled. The criterion for inclusion in the blinded phase was an improvement of at least two steps in the butanol odour threshold test, after open treatment for 10 days with oral and nasal corticosteroids. Forty patients were included. Twenty of them were randomized to treatment with fluticasone propionate, 10 to placebo and 10 others served as controls. The topical treatment was continued for 6 months. IV. Seventy-two patients with anosmia (46 %) or hyposmia (54 %) filled in the validated Multi-clinic Smell and Taste Questionnaire, the validated General Well-being Schedule (GWBS) and answered other questions shown to be of good validity. Results: I. The combination of local and oral steroids, improved the sense of smell, but surgery had no additional effect. Symptom scores became significantly better with medical treatment alone and surgery had additional beneficial effects on nasal obstruction and secretions as well as polyp scores. III. From before to one year after surgery, we found a significant improvement in the CT total scores, osteomeatal complex (OMC) and the maxillary sinus scores, on the operated side, but not on the unoperated side. II. The three groups showed a similar improvement in their sense of smell after the initial 10 -day treatment with combined oral and nasal corticosteroids. Patients who continued the local treatment maintained their improvement at the same level during the study whether or not they had been given nasal corticosteroids or placebo. We found {{no significant differences between the}} treatment groups. IV. Several negative effects were common, i. e., risks associated with the loss of smell, interference with daily routines and deterioration in well being. Physical health, financial security, profession, partnership, friendships, emotional stability and leisure also seemed to be negatively affected and GWBS scores showed a reduction in psychological well being. The patients became more aware of the importance of olfaction after its loss, and adopted several types of problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. Conclusions: I. Medical treatment seems to be sufficient for the treatment of most symptoms of nasal polyposis. When hyposmia is the main symptom no additional benefit seems to be gained from surgical treatment. If nasal obstruction is the chief problem after steroid treatment, surgical treatment is indicated. Selection of those who will benefit from surgery should be based on the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> symptoms and not on the physician s polyp score. III. CT of the sinuses shows long-lasting improvement in the total and CT scores of the OMC after combined surgical and corticosteroid treatment, as compared to medical treatment alone. II. In patients with anosmia/hyposmia partly caused by local inflammation, no further improvement in the olfactory threshold is achieved by continuing to use a topical intranasal glucocorticoid after an initial combined topical and systemic glucocorticoid treatment. IV. We found that the loss of smell had substantial adverse effects on the <b>quality</b> of <b>life</b> and that high priority should be given to its diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, a combination of problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies may be suggested to patients who have recently lost their sense of smell...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the global}} cancer {{research}} {{is focused on the}} most prevalent tumors; yet, less common tumor types warrant investigation, since A rare disorder is not necessarily an unimportant one. The present work discusses a rare tumor type, the benign adenomas of the pituitary gland, and presents the advances which, {{during the course of this}} thesis work, contributed to the elucidation of a fraction of their genetic background. Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms of the anterior pituitary lobe, accounting for approximately 15 % of all intracranial tumors. Pituitary adenoma cells hypersecrete the hormones normally produced by the anterior pituitary tissue, such as growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL). Despite their non-metastasizing nature, these adenomas can cause significant morbidity and have to be adequately treated; otherwise, they can compromise the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>life,</b> due to conditions provoked by hormonal hypersecretion, such as acromegaly in the case of GH-secreting adenomas, or due to compressive effects to surrounding tissues. The vast majority of pituitary adenomas arise sporadically, whereas a small subset occur as component of familial endocrine-related tumor syndromes, such as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) and Carney complex (CNC). MEN 1 is caused by germline mutations in the MEN 1 tumor suppressor gene (11 q 13), whereas the majority of CNC cases carry germline mutations in the PRKAR 1 A gene (17 q 24). Pituitary adenomas are also encountered in familial settings outside the context of MEN 1 and CNC, but unlike in the latter syndromes, their genetic background until recently remained elusive. Evidence in previous literature supported the notion that a tumor suppressor gene on 11 q 13, residing very close to but still distinct from MEN 1, causes genetic susceptibility to pituitary tumors. The aim of the study was to identify the genetic cause of a low penetrance form of Pituitary Adenoma Predisposition (PAP) in families from Northern Finland. The present work describes the methodological approach that led to the identification of aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) as the gene causing PAP. Combining chip-based technologies (SNP and gene expression arrays) with traditional gene mapping methods and genealogy data, we showed that germline AIP mutations cause PAP in familial and sporadic settings. PAP patients were diagnosed with mostly adenomas of the GH/PRL-secreting cell lineage. In Finland, two AIP mutations accounted for 16 % of all patients diagnosed with GH-secreting adenomas, and for 40 % of patients being younger than 35 years of age at diagnosis. AIP is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor gene, a notion supported by the nature of the identified mutations (most are truncating) and the biallelic inactivation of AIP in the tumors studied. AIP has been best characterized as a cytoplasmic interaction partner of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), also known as dioxin receptor, but it has other partners as well. The mechanisms that underlie AIP-mediated pituitary tumorigenesis are to date largely unknown and warrant further investigation. Because AIP was identified in the genetically homogeneous Finnish population, it was relevant to examine its contribution to PAP in other, more heterogeneous, populations. Analysis of pituitary adenoma patient series of various ethnic origins and differing clinical settings revealed germline AIP mutations in all cohorts studied, albeit with low frequencies (range 0. 8 - 7. 4 %). Overall, PAP patients were typically diagnosed at a young age (range 8 - 41 years), mainly with GH-secreting adenomas, without strong family history of endocrine disease. Because many PAP patients did not display family history of pituitary adenomas, detection of the condition appeared challenging. AIP immunohistochemistry was tested as a molecular pre-screening tool on mutation-positive versus mutation-negative tumors, and proved to be a potentially useful predictor of PAP. Mutation screening of a large cohort of colorectal, breast, and prostate tumors did not reveal somatic AIP mutations. These tumors, apart from being the most prevalent among men and women worldwide, have been associated with acromegaly, particularly colorectal neoplasia. In this material, AIP did not appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of these common tumor types and other genes seem likely to play a role in such tumorigenesis. Finally, the contribution of AIP in pediatric onset pituitary adenomas was examined in a unique population-based cohort of sporadic pituitary adenoma patients from Italy. Germline AIP mutations may account for a subset of pediatric onset GH-secreting adenomas (in this study one of seven GH-secreting adenoma cases or 14. 3 %), and appear to be enriched among young (≤ 25 years old) patients. In summary, this work reveals a novel tumor susceptibility gene, namely AIP, which causes genetic predisposition to pituitary adenomas, in particular GH-secreting adenomas. Moreover, it provides molecular tools for identification of individuals predisposed for PAP. Further elaborate studies addressing the functional role of AIP in normal and tumor cells will hopefully expand our knowledge on endocrine neoplasia and reveal novel cellular mechanisms of pituitary tumorigenesis, including potential drug targets.
