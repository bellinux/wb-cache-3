50|$|In atomic physics, the {{chemical}} {{potential of the}} electrons in an atom is sometimes {{said to be the}} negative of the atom's electronegativity. Likewise, the process of chemical <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> is sometimes referred to as the process of electronegativity equalization. This connection comes from the Mulliken electronegativity scale. By inserting the energetic definitions of the ionization potential and electron affinity into the Mulliken electronegativity, it is seen that the Mulliken chemical potential is a finite difference approximation of the electronic energy with respect to the number of electrons., i.e.,where IP and EA are the ionization potential and electron affinity of the atom, respectively.|$|E
40|$|IoT is the {{technical}} basis {{to realize the}} CPS (Cyber Physical System) for distribution networks, with which the complex system becomes more intelligent and controllable. Because of the multihop and self-organization characteristics, the large-scale heterogeneous CPS network becomes more difficult to plan. Using topological potential theory, one of typical big data analysis technologies, this paper proposed a novel optimal CPS planning model. Topological <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> is considered as the optimization objective function in heterogeneous CPS network with the constraints of communication requirements, physical infrastructures, and network reliability. An improved binary particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this complex optimal problem. Two IEEE classic examples are adopted in the simulation, and the results show that, compared with benchmark algorithms, our proposed method can provide an effective topology optimization scheme to improve the network reliability and transmitting performance...|$|E

Compared to conventional TE schemes based on partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) detection, filtering based TE schemes are attractive {{due to their}} low computational complexity. In this paper, we focus on soft feedback equalization (SFE) [1]. We modify the generic SFE to deal with jitter noise. Furthermore, novel bidirectional SFE (2 D-SFE) and modified SFE (MSFE) schemes are proposed to improve {{the performance of the}} generic SFE. Simulation results suggest that, for longitudinal channels, SFE and its variants perform competitively with conventional PRML based schemes with a much lower complexity. For perpendicular channels, however, the performance deteriorates. ...|$|R
40|$|Romania {{has been}} {{actively}} reforming its intergovernmental transfer system {{during the last}} years. The new Law on Local Public Finance, which will come into force in January 2007, will involve substantial modifications both to the institutional arrangements and to the formula employed to distribute equalization funds across counties and communes. As with the former transfer mechanism, the new system {{is characterized by a}} high level of complexity and an emphasis on within-county equalization of communes instead of a more desirable nationwide approach. Overall, we argue that the <b>equalization</b> <b>potential</b> of the reformed 2007 system does not improve in any significant way over its predecessor. This report outlines the principles that should shape an efficient equalization transfer system and provides five proposals for reform based the concept of fiscal disparity and a bifurcated distribution scheme. The proposals represent feasible alternatives to improve the <b>equalization</b> <b>potential</b> of the system in place, as shown by the simulation analysis on each of the alternative transfer systems. The paper concludes offering a critical path to reform the Romanian transfer system. Romania, Equalization Transfers, reform...|$|R

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{correlation}} of medium-range order (MRO) structure with glass forming ability (GFA) of Al-based metallic glasses, Al 86 Ni 14 -aYa (a = 2 ∼ 9 at. %) metallic glasses were analyzed by x-ray diffraction in detail and further verified by synchrotron high-energy x-ray diffraction.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a modification approach and first measurements of commercial cylindrical Li-ion cells with multiple local potential probes and an internal temperature sensor. Local potential measurements at low currents show a non-uniform potential distribution along the electrode, {{dominated by the}} open circuit voltage (OCV) of the negative electrode. For higher currents, the overpotential along the current collector becomes dominant and instead of a corrugated potential distribution, a significant current dependent voltage gradient can be detected, indicating a highly non-uniform state of charge (SOC) distribution with increasing distance to the current collecting tab. After the discharge operation, a quick <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> can be witnessed which results in a non-detectable potential difference between the single electrode sections after 12 min, even though the overall cell voltage relaxation has not reached an equilibrium state yet. The presented modification approach combines the advantages of high quality industrial manufactured cells showing uniform coating thicknesses and packing density with the advantages of special tailor made cells for in situ measurements. Due to the low impact of the modification and its long-term stability, highly reproducible measurements can be conducted at different locations of the electrodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{interface}} dipole and {{its role}} in the effective work function (EWF) modulation by Al incorporation are investigated. Our study shows that the interface dipole located at the high-k/SiO 2 interface causes an electrostatic potential difference across the metal/high-k interface, which significantly shifts the band alignment between the metal and high-k, consequently modulating the EWF. The electrochemical <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> and electrostatic potential methods are used to evaluate the interface dipole and its contribution. The calculated EWF modulation agrees with experimental data and can provide insight to the control of EWF in future pMOS technology.

40|$|Turbo {{equalization}} is {{a widely}} known method to cope with {{low signal to noise}} ratio (SNR) channels corrupted by linear intersymbol interference (ISI) (Berrou and Galvieux, 1993; Hagenauer et al., 1997). Recently in this workshop it was reported that also for nonlinear channels a remarkable turbo decoding gain can be achieved (Siegrist et al., 2001). However, the classical turbo equalization relies on code rates at 1 / 3 up to 1 / 2 which makes it quite unattractive for high rate data transmission. Considering the <b>potential</b> of iterative <b>equalization</b> and decoding, we obtain a considerable turbo decoding gain also for high rate codes of less than 7 % redundancy by using punctured convolutional codes and block codes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} laboratory testing {{on the performance}} of wall claddings using direct-applied (DEFS) and exterior insulation finish systems (EIFS) that incorporate water management features into their design and construc-tion. The work presented in this paper is a continuation of earlier work conducted by the Institute for Research in Construction (IRC) of the National Research Council, Canada (NRCC) and the United States Gypsum Company (USG) evaluating the water penetration and moisture performance of barrier EIFS clad walls (Brown et al., 1997). Direct-applied exterior finish systems (DEFS) are exterior wall claddings that use a water durable substrate, typically cement board, mechanically fastened to the wall framing over a sheathing membrane. A cementitious basecoat and textured acrylic synthetic stucco finish is then applied directly over the substrate. Insulation for the DEFS system is in the stud cavity. EIFS systems use a layer of foam insulation applied over the wall substrate, with basecoat and finish applied over the foam. The performance of three water managed wall cladding designs in protecting wood framed construction from water intrusion by wind-driven rain is described. Three different drainage systems were evaluated. Performance measures evaluated in-cluded cladding airtightness, pressure <b>equalization</b> <b>potential,</b> and water drainage under wind-driven rain conditions.

40|$|Open-system density {{functional}} theory may be {{formulated in}} terms of ensemble averages arising from interaction with a bath. The system is allowed to exchange particles with the bath and {{the states in the}} ensemble average are those corresponding to integer numbers of particles. The weights in the ensemble average are typically equated with time-averaged values of the occupation numbers of the various states comprising the open system. As a result, there are two constraints on the occupation numbers: (1) Their sum must be unity so that the ensemble average is a probability function and (2) The sum of the occupation numbers times the number of particles for the associated state must equal the time-averaged number of particles. By solving explicitly the first constraint we arrive at an expression for the energy having a form structurally equivalent to a Gibbs thermodynamic function. From this form follows both chemical <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> and the identification of the functional derivative of the energy for a particular state with respect to its integer-state density as the chemical potential. We highlight a distinction between functional derivatives of the time-averaged and the integer-state energies with respect to integer-state densities. From this we can restate the jump discontinuity behavior of the exchange-correlation functional {{in terms of}} integer-state behavior. Comment: 7 pages, 17 reference...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{formation}} of the F 3 B–NH 3 supermolecule by chemical interaction of its fragment parts, BF 3 and NH 3, and the dynamics of internal rotation about the ‘B–N ’ bond have been studied in terms of parameters provided by the molecular orbital and density functional theories.

The donation process stems from the HOMO of the donor into the LUMO of the acceptor and simultaneously, back donation stems from the HOMO of acceptor into the LUMO of the donor. The density functional computation of chemical activation in the donor and acceptor fragments, associated with the physical process of structural reorganization just prior to the event of chemical reaction, indicates that BF 3 becomes more acidic and NH 3 becomes more basic, compared to their separate equilibrium states. Theoretically it is observed that the chemical reaction event of the {{formation of}} the supermolecule from its fragment parts is in accordance with the chemical <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> principle of the density functional theory and the electronegativity equalization principle of Sanderson.

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the extent to}} which classical polarizable force fields, based either on the chemical <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> principle or on distributed polarizabilities in the framework of the Sum of Interactions Between Fragments Ab initio computed (SIBFA), can reproduce the ab initio polarization energy and the dipole moment of three distinct water oligomers: bifurcated chains, transverse hydrogen-bonded chains, and longitudinal hydrogen-bonded chains of helical shape. To analyze the many-body polarization effect, chains of different size, i. e., from 2 to 12 water monomers, have been considered. Although the dipole moment is a well-defined quantity in both classical polarizable models and quantum mechanical methods, polarization energy can be defined unequivocally only in the former type of approaches. In this study we have used the Kitaura-Morokuma (KM) procedure. Although the KM approach is on the one hand known to overestimate the polarization energy for strongly interacting molecules, on the other hand it can account for the many-body polarization effectively, whereas some other procedures do not. Our data show that, if off-centered lone pair polarizabilities are explicitly represented, classical polarizable force fields can afford a close agreement with the ab initio results, both in terms of polarization energy and in terms of dipole moment. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} the atomic charge is {{extensively}} used to model the electrostatic properties of proteins. Atomic charges are not only {{the basis for the}} electrostatic energy term in biomolecular force fields but are also derived from quantum mechanical computations on protein fragments to get more insight into their electronic structure. Unfortunately there are many atomic charge schemes which lead to significantly different results, and it is not trivial to determine which scheme is most suitable for biomolecular studies. Therefore, we present an extensive methodological benchmark using a selection of atomic charge schemes [Mulliken, natural, restrained electrostatic <b>potential,</b> Hirshfeld-I, electronegativity <b>equalization</b> method (EEM), and split-charge equilibration (SQE) ] applied to two sets of penta-alanine conformers. Our analysis clearly shows that Hirshfeld-I charges offer the best compromise between transferability (robustness with respect to conformational changes) and the ability to reproduce electrostatic properties of the penta-alanine. The benchmark also considers two charge equilibration models (EEM and SQE), which both clearly fail to describe the locally charged moieties in the zwitterionic form of penta-alanine. This issue is analyzed in detail because charge equilibration models are computationally much more attractive than the Hirshfeld-I scheme. Based on the latter analysis, a straightforward extension of the SQE model is proposed, SQE+Q 0, that is suitable to describe biological systems bearing many locally charged functional groups...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{the basics of}} the current theory regarding the behavior of blind fractionally-spaced and/or spatial-diversity equalizers (FSE) adapted via the constant modulus algorithm (CMA). The constant modulus algo-rithm, which {{was developed in the}} late 1970 s and disclosed in the early 1980 s, performs a stochastic gradient descent of a cost function that penalizes the dispersion of the equalizer output from a constant value. The constant modulus (CM) cost function leads to a blind algorithm because evaluation of the CM cost at the receiver does not rely on access to a replica of the transmitted source, as in so-called “trained ” scenarios. The capability for blind start-up makes certain communication systems feasible in circumstances that do not admit training. The analytically conve-nient feature of the fractionally-spaced realization of a linear equalizer is the <b>potential</b> for perfect <b>equalization</b> in the absence of channel noise given a finite impulse response equalizer of time span matching that of the finite impulse response channel. The conditions for perfect equalization coupled with some mild conditions on the source can be used to establish convergence to perfect performance with FSE parameter adaptation by CMA from any equalizer parameter initialization. The FSE-CMA behavior theory presented here merges the taxonomy of the behavior theory of trained adaptive equalization and recent robustness analysis of FSE-CMA with violation of the conditions leading to perfect equalization and global asymptotic optimality of FSE-CMA...|$|R
40|$|Many common {{chemical}} <b>potential</b> <b>equalization</b> (μEq) {{methods are}} known to suffer from a superlinear scaling of the polarizability with increasing molecular size that interferes with model transferability and prevents the straightforward application of these methods to large, biochemically relevant molecules. In the present work, we systematically investigate the origins of this scaling and the mechanisms whereby some existing methods successfully temper the scaling. We demonstrate several types of topological charge constraints distinct from the usual single molecular charge constraint that can successfully achieve linear polarizability scaling in atomic charge based equilibration models. We find the use of recently employed charge conservation constraints tied to small molecular units {{to be an effective}} and practical approach for modulating the polarizability scaling in atomic μEq schemes. We also analyze the scaling behavior of several μEq schemes in the bond representation and derive closed-form expressions for the polarizability scaling in a linear atomic chain model; for a single molecular charge constraint these expressions demonstrate a cubic dependence of the polarizability on molecular size compared with linear scaling obtainable {{in the case of the}} atom-atom charge transfer (AACT) and split-charge equilibration (SQE) schemes. Application of our results to the trans N-alkane series reveals that in certain situations, the AACT and SQE schemes can become unstable due to an indefinite Hessian matrix. Consequently, we discuss sufficient criteria for ensuring stability within these schemes...|$|E
