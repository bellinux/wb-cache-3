5000|$|The {{works of}} Juan de Lugo, {{some of which}} have never been <b>printed,</b> <b>cover</b> nearly the whole field of moral - and dogmatic theology. The first volume, De Incarnatione Domini (Lyons, 1633), of which the short preface is well worth reading {{to get an idea of}} de Lugo's method, came out in 1633. It was {{followed}} by De sacramentis in genere; De Venerabili Eucharistiæ Sacramento et de sacrosancto Missæ sacrificio (Lyons, 1636); De Virtute et Sacramento poenitentiæ, de Suffragiis et Indulgentiis (Lyons, 1638); and De justitia et jure (Lyon, 1642), the work on which de Lugo's fame especially rested. In composition of this important treatise, he was greatly aided by his knowledge of law acquired in his younger days at Salamanca, and it was this work which he dedicated and presented to the pope in person and which may be said to have gained for him a cardinal's hat. De Lugo wrote to other works: De virtuto fidei divinæ (Lyon, 1646), and Responsorum morialum libri sex (Lyon, 1651), published by his former pupil, fellow Jesuit and friend, Cardinal Pietro Sforza Pallavicino. In these six books de Lugo gives, after thorough discussion, the solution of many difficult cases in moral theology; it consists of questions proposed to him for solutions over long years. The seventh volume, [...] "De Deo, de Angelis, de Actibus humanis et de Gratia" [...] (Cologne, 1716), was published over fifty years after the author's death; the idea, as expressed on the title page, was to complete his printed course of lectures. Other works on theology and especially on philosophy: [...] "De Anima", [...] "Philosophia", [...] "Logica", [...] "De Trinitate", [...] "De Visione Dei", etc. are still preserved in manuscripts in the libraries of Madrid, Salamanca, Karlsruhe, Mechlin etc.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the successes}} of the Complete Short Stories of W. Somerset Maugham and the Complete Short Stories of Agatha Christie (which were {{selected}} for the V&A illustration awards 2005) I was commissioned by the Folio Society to illustrate the Complete Novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Because of the rigorous nature of my research, (visiting the V&A, seeing the various versions of films based on Fitzgerald’s work, reading various biographies) I have created a piece of work, which although using traditional techniques is contemporary in its interpretation. Members of the Folio Society, which has members worldwide, will obviously purchase the collection. It is believed I have illustrated the definitive collection of Fitzgerald’s work. This {{is the first time}} a single illustrator has interpreted the complete works of the author. Illustrating fiction requires a thorough understanding of the text. I read each novel several times and make notes of passages, which might be illustrated. The required research is of fashion, time and place. The construction of a plan is necessary to understand the linear narrative. There is a close association with both art director and editor to discuss the selected passages. Each of the four volumes comes in a slipcase. There are two versions of <b>printed</b> <b>cover</b> cloths and 38 b/w illustrations. The volumes were featured in the Folio Society’s catalogue...|$|E
