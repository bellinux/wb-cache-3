5000|$|As {{a result}} of the accident, {{safeguarding}} against counterfeit aircraft <b>parts</b> increased. Peter Friedman, an expert on counterfeit <b>parts,</b> stated in an episode of the television programme Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) that the Partnair accident was the [...] "seminal event" [...] that caused people around the world to recognize the proliferation of counterfeit aircraft <b>parts</b> in <b>parts</b> inventories. The spare aircraft <b>parts</b> industry had little regulation in many places in the world {{at the time of the}} Partnair accident. The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which oversees the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), examined the scope of the spare <b>parts</b> in the United States. The USDOT audited the FAA's inventory and found that only 61% of its <b>parts</b> were indeed genuine. The remaining 39% of fraudulent <b>parts</b> were traced back to a <b>parts</b> broker that was prominent in the aircraft <b>parts</b> industry; however, 95% of the <b>parts</b> in that broker's inventory were counterfeit. Mary Schiavo, the former inspector general of the USDOT, said that American <b>parts</b> brokers had [...] "no regulation whatsoever." [...] Schiavo said that [...] "an individual with a telephone and a fax machine could become a <b>parts</b> broker" [...] and could get his or her <b>parts</b> from [...] "a variety of sources," [...] including junkyards, scrap facilities, older aircraft, aircraft involved in accidents, and illegal <b>parts</b> manufacturers. Counterfeit <b>parts</b> were often less expensive than authentic <b>parts.</b> Friedman said that [...] "bottom line-driven" [...] airlines, including those on the verge of bankruptcy, wanted to cut costs, driving them to acquire false <b>parts.</b>|$|R
