In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system.

50|$|Whereas most lavas {{are rich}} in {{silicate}} minerals, the lava of Ol Doinyo Lengai is a carbonatite. It is rich in the rare sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> nyerereite and gregoryite. Due to this unusual composition, the lava erupts at relatively low temperatures of approximately 510 C. This temperature is so low that the molten lava appears black in sunlight, rather than having the red glow common to most lavas. It is also much more fluid than silicate lavas, often less viscous than water. The sodium and potassium carbonate minerals of the lavas erupted at Ol Doinyo Lengai are unstable at the Earth's surface and susceptible to rapid weathering, quickly turning from black to grey in colour. The resulting volcanic landscape is {{different from any other}} in the world.|$|E
50|$|Salt {{is added}} when making the flour dough to {{strengthen}} gluten structures {{and enhance the}} sheeting properties of dough, and it can make the noodles softer and more elastic. Salt also offers the basic salty flavor of noodles and can cover some of the off-flavor generated by flour and processing. Another function of salt is {{to slow down the}} activities of enzymes, such as proteolytic enzymes, which could interrupt the gluten structures, and microbial growth. Alkaline salt, such as sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> could be added to noodle dough to enhance the yellow color of the product if needed because flavonoid pigments in flour turns yellow at alkaline pH levels, and the increase of pH could also influence the behavior of gluten, which could make noodle dough even tougher and less extensible (for some noodles, such as Japanese ramen, this is wanted). For making fresh noodles, the amount of salt added is 1-3% of flour weight, but for instant noodles, due to the longer shelf life, it requires higher salt content.|$|E

30|$|Alkaline {{reagents}} are preferred, {{especially by}} Cantonese people, for making alkaline noodles [32].

Sodium carbonates, or <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> or the mixture of the two (typically 9 : 1, kansui) {{are the most common}} alkaline salts used in alkaline noodles [43].

The quantity of sodium hydroxide is usually 0.3 – 1.0 % for the partially boiled alkaline noodles. Alkaline–flour interactions are responsible for several effects, including strengthening of the dough texture [44]; reducing the dough development time and dough stability; improvement in both the firmness and chewiness of noodles [45]; retardation of starch gelatinization and increase in starch paste viscosity [44, 46]; inhibition of enzyme activity and enzymatic browning [43, 47]; and also contribution to the bright yellow color, aroma and flavor [47].|$|E

40|$|To avoid {{problems}} related to the discharge of sulfidic spent caustics, a biotechnological process is developed {{for the treatment of}} gases containing both hydrogen sulfide and methanethiol. The process operates at natron-alkaline conditions (> 1 mol L- 1 of sodium- and <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonates</b> and a pH of 8. 5 – 10) to enable the treatment of gases with a high partial CO 2 pressure. In the process, methanethiol reacts with biologically produced sulfur particles to form a complex mixture predominantly consisting of inorganic polysulfides, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS). The effect of these organic sulfur compounds on the biological oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur was studied with natron-alkaliphilic bacteria belonging to the genus Thioalkalivibrio. Biological oxidation rates were reduced by 50 % at 0. 05 mM methanethiol, while for DMDS and DMTS, this was estimated to occur at 1. 5 and 1. 0 mM, respectively. The inhibiting effect of methanethiol on biological sulfide oxidation diminished due to its reaction with biologically produced sulfur particles.

Above the phase transition temperature, the sorbent will be regenerated into anhydrous K 2 CO 3. If the steam pressure PH 2 O is much greater than 1. 0 bar, it is possible to use the K 2 CO 3 · 1. 5 H 2 O sorbent for precombustion CO 2 capture technology.

Very little change in the mechanistic behavior was observed through tafel analysis; instead it is proposed that the observed kinetic effects are a combination of the catalytic role of all metal cations present as well as the intercalation of lithium into the solid graphite electrode. The effect of lithium intercalation is suggested to lead to a change in the graphite surface polarity which affects product gas bubble formation and dislodgement at the solid anode. Increased lithium concentration, and it is assumed intercalation, encourages smaller bubbles to form which are dislodged at a faster rate than surfaces with less lithium intercalation in the ternary electrolyte. A threshold lithium concentration is reached above approximately 65 % where the electrochemical behavior is significantly changed and bubble formation behavior is no longer observed...|$|E

Moreover, the application of multivariate analysis facilitated first the description of the global changes of the coffee brews with or without additives throughout the storage using principal component analysis and second the obtainment of a simple equation only with pH and caffeic acid parameters to discriminate the three types of coffee brews and simplify the analytical process, by means of the stepwise discriminant analysis...|$|E

The impact of several parameters, related to anodic electrode composition (20, 40 and 60 wt. % Co/CeO 2), cell temperature (700 – 800 °C), carrier gas composition (CO 2 /He mixtures), and total feed flow rate (10 – 70 cm 3 /min), was systematically examined.
