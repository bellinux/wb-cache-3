In terms of investments, clean energy outperforms both gas and coal by a 2-1 margin. This <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> {{may be attributed to}} the consistently falling price of renewable energy production. Renewable energy sources hold assertive advantages over fossil fuels because they exist as technologies, not fuels. As time proceeds, renewable energy becomes inevitably more efficient as technology adapts. Technologies for extracting fuels may change, but the fuels remain as constants. Both the solar and wind industries have proven growth over time: Over the last 15 years, the solar industry has doubled seven times and the wind industry has doubled four times. In contrast, the fossil fuel industry has declined over the last 15 years. America's coal industry has lost 75 percent of its value within the past few years.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> on {{the survival of}} patients with AEJ remains controversial (Migliore et al. 2014).

However, DiMusto et al. found that 80  % of patients with positive proximal margin died with distant metastasis, which would not be influenced by more extensive resection (DiMusto and Orringer 2007). They also found that adjuvant therapy for a <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> neither improves prognosis nor reduces local recurrence. Shen et al. also reported that <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> was not an independent prognostic factor for survival (Shen et al. 2006).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the parameters affecting <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> and the impact of <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> on outcomes after breast-conserving therapy in patients with breast cancer. Methods: Characteristics and survival of 705 patients attempted breast-conserving therapy between January 1994 and December 2004 were retrospectively analyzed using x 2 tests, the Kaplan–Meier methods and multivariate analyses. Results: Ninety-five (13. 5 %) showed positive margins at initial resection. Among them, 28 (4. 0 %) had negative margin on the initial frozen section; however, they finally turned out a focally <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> with intraductal carcinoma on the permanent pathology. <b>Positive</b> <b>margin</b> at initial resection was significantly associated with lobular histology (P 0. 001), four or more involved lymph nodes (P 0. 015) and the presence of extensive intraductal component (P, 0. 001). A focally <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> did not influence local (P 0. 250; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 612 – 6. 592) or regional failure (P 0. 756; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 297 – 5. 311). Patients with a focally <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> showed an advanced nodal stage and received a higher dose of irradiation and more systemic therapy. Nodal involvements were the most significant factor for locoregional failure. Conclusions: Although the achievement of negative margins is the best way to reduce local failure, patients with a focally <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> and favorable risk factors such as node nega-tivity and older age could have an option of close follow-up with adequate boost irradiation and adjuvant therapy instead of conversion to total mastectomy.

40|$|PurposeRobotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) offers {{reportedly}} comparable oncologic {{outcomes for}} localized disease compared with open radical retropubic prostatectomy (ORRP). However, the oncologic efficacy of RALP in locally-advanced prostate cancer (PCa) is less clear. We report and compare our experience with RALP and ORRP in men with locally advanced PCa. MethodsPatients with locally advanced PCa (stage T 3 or greater) {{were identified in}} both robotic and open cohorts. Clinicopathologic features including age, clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen, surgical margins, and Gleason score were reviewed. We further examined the incidence of positive surgical margins, {{the effect of the}} surgical learning curve on margins, and the need for adjuvant therapy. ResultsFrom 1997 to 2010, 1, 011 patients underwent RALP and 415 patients were identified who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) across four institutions. 140 patients in the RALP group and 95 in the RRP group had locally advanced PCa on final pathology. The overall robotic <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> rate 47. 1 % compared with 51. 4 % in the RRP group. A trend towards a lower <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> rate was seen after 300 cases in the RALP group, with 66. 7 % <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> rate in the first 300 cases compared with 41. 8 % in the latter 700 cases. In addition, a lower incidence of biochemical recurrence was also noted in the latter cases (30. 6 % vs. 9. 5 %). ConclusionsUp to 2 out of 3 men undergoing RALP for locally-advanced PCa had positive margins during our initial experience. However, with increasing surgeon experience the overall <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> rate decreased significantly and was comparable to the <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> rate for patients with locally advanced disease undergoing ORRP over four academic institutions.

40|$|Purpose In {{contrast}} to other countries, the Dutch breast cancer guideline does not recommend re-excision for focally <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in invasive tumor and does recommend whole-breast irradiation including boost. We investigated whether omitting re-excision {{as compared to}} performing re-excision affects prognosis with a retrospective population-based cohort study. Methods The total cohort included 32, 119 women with primary BCS for T 1 –T 3 breast cancer diagnosed between 2003 and 2008 from the nationwide Netherlands cancer registry. The subcohort included 10, 433 patients in whom the resection margins were registered. Outcome measures were 5 -year ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) rate, 5 -year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and 10 -year overall survival (OS) rate. Results In the total cohort, 25, 878 (80. 6 %) did not have re-excision, 2368 (7. 4 %) had re-excision by BCS, and 3873 (12. 1 %) had re-excision by mastectomy. Five-year IBTR rates were 2. 1, 2. 8, and 2. 9 %, respectively (p = 0. 001). In the subcohort, 7820 (75. 0 %) had negative margins without re-excision, 492 (4. 7 %) had focally <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> without re-excision, 586 (5. 6 %) had focally <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> and underwent re-excision, and 1535 (14. 7 %) had extensively <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> and underwent re-excision. Five-year IBTR rate was 2. 3, 2. 9, 1. 1, and 2. 9 %, respectively (p = 0. 099). Compared to omitting re-excision, performing re-excision for focally <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> was associated with lower risk of IBTR (adjusted HR 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 11 – 0. 82), but not with DFS (adjusted HR 0. 83 95 % CI 0. 59 – 1. 17) nor with OS (adjusted HR 1. 17 95 % CI 0. 87 – 1. 59).

The national guideline states that the rate of <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> should not exceed 30 % in ductal carcinoma in situ and 20 % in invasive cancers. We aimed to determine whether BCS in women with screen-detected breast cancer (SDBC) will have <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> less often compared with women with clinically detected breast cancer (CDBC). Furthermore, the choice of subsequent therapy is studied when <b>margins</b> were <b>positive</b> after initial BCS. Women 50 - 75 years of age who underwent BCS for invasive breast cancer between July 2008 and December 2009 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Data were merged with the National Cancer Screening Program, regions North and East, to identify women with SDBC. The relation to screening history, clinical and pathological factors was evaluated for correlation with margin status using multilevel analysis. Of 1537 women with an invasive breast cancer, 873 (57 %) were diagnosed through the screening programme. SDBCs were significantly smaller (87 vs. 69 % T 1 tumours, i. e. <= 2 cm), more often well differentiated (33 vs. 26 %), preoperatively confirmed (98 vs. 96 %), diagnosed in a nonteaching hospital (60 vs. 66 %) and more often had negative lymph nodes (LNs) (80 vs. 68 %). In 170 out of 1537 women, the resection <b>margins</b> were <b>positive.</b> Multivariable analysis showed that hospital, tumour size, multifocality, positive LNs and absent preoperative confirmation were predictors of <b>positive</b> <b>margins.</b> No difference was found between women with SDBC and CDBC. Of women with <b>positive</b> <b>margins,</b> 90 % underwent additional surgery. Women diagnosed with SDBC do not have a lower risk of having <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> after BCS than women with CDBC. Although <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> may occur in 11 % of women with invasive tumours, well below the percentage recommended by the national guideline, the presence of encouraging factors by SDBC such as a smaller tumour size, unifocality, negative LNs and the presence of preoperative confirmation should not lead to performing a more sparing excision than is considered usual for comparable CDB...|$|R

The current study updates {{the result of}} robotic nasopharyngectomy. Materials and Methods: Prospective cohort of 26 patients who had undergone robotic nasopharyngectomy with or without combined endoscopic resection. Results: There are 26 operations on 24 patients, with 18 male and 6 female. 1 patient received a second operation for resection of positive inferior margin 4 weeks after the initial surgery and 1 patient had local recurrence 18 months after the first robotic nasopharyngectomy. 21 operations were done by pure robotic approach and 5 operations included endoscopic approach to remove the sphenoid floor (bony roof of nasopharynx). Median age of the patients is 55. 5 (range 29 - 85) years. The median operating time is 232 (97 - 574) minutes. 6 patients had <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> with one patient received re-resection of the <b>positive</b> <b>margin.</b> 3 of the remaining 5 patients received another course of radiotherapy for the <b>positive</b> <b>margin.</b> Median follow up of the cohort is 32 (range 2 - 71) months.

Methods: A total of 365 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue diagnosed as clinical Stage I or II, treated by partial glossectomy in the National Cancer Center Hospital East between 1992 and 2006, were studied retrospectively. Results: Pathological findings showed that 13 cases had positive margins in the epithelial layer, 4 (30. 8 %) of whom showed up with local recurrence in 4. 4 years (3. 0 – 5. 0) on average. Lymph node recurrence was not observed and the 5 -year overall survival rate was 76. 2 % in those 13 cases. The treatment for the recurrent cases was an additional partial glossectomy without neck dissection, which resulted in no recurrence and a survival rate of 100 % after an average follow-up of 6. 7 years.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between preoperative assessment of tumor volume and oncologic adequacy of surgical margins was studied retrospectively.

We conducted a pilot study of 25 patients with malignant tumors of the anterolateral cranial base operated on at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Cranial Base Surgery between 1987 and 1988. Preoperative computed tomography assessment of tumor volume was performed in all patients, and correlation between tumor volume, surgical margins, and survival was examined.

40|$|Context: Surgery is {{the main}} form of {{treatment}} for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. Among other factors, treatment success requires that the surgical margins are free of disease, {{to reduce the risk}} of recurrence. Aims: The purpose of this study was to analyze factors that might be associated with <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> in patients diagnosed with DCIS. Settings and Design: A retrospective analysis was performed of hospital databases from the year 2006 to 2014, to identify patients with an initial diagnosis of DCIS made by percutaneous biopsy. Subjects and Methods: Age, the presence of disease symptoms, lesion size on mammogram, and the presence of estrogen receptors, and their relationship to the surgical margins were evaluated in 249 patients. Statistical Analysis Used: Shapiro and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests were used to verify that the data were normally distributed. Chi-squared test was used to verify the independence of the variables. Results: Lesions measuring 1. 55 cm or greater had a relative risk of <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> after conservative surgery of 1. 39 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 1. 02 – 1. 90).

We analyzed {{the incidence of}} and associative factors for <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> in a multi-institutional series of 8, 418 robotic assisted radical prostatectomies. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the records of 8, 418 patients who underwent robotic assisted radical prostatectomy at 7 institutions. Of the patients 323 had missing data on <b>margin</b> status. <b>Positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> were categorized into 4 groups, including apex, bladder neck, posterolateral and multifocal. The records of 6, 169 patients were available for multivariate analysis. The variables entered into the logistic regression models were age, body mass index, preoperative prostate specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, prostate weight and pathological stage. A second model was built to identify predictive factors for <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> in the subset of patients with organ confined disease (pT 2). Results: The overall <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margin</b> rate was 15. 7 % (1, 272 of 8, 095 patients). The <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margin</b> rate for pT 2 and pT 3 disease was 9. 45 % and 37. 2 %, respectively. On multivariate analysis pathological stage (pT 2 vs pT 3 OR 4. 588, p < 0. 001) and preoperative prostate specific antigen (4 or less vs greater than 10 ng/ml OR 2. 918, p < 0. 001) {{were the most important}} independent predictive factors for <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> after robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. Increasing prostate weight was associated with a lower risk of <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> after robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (OR 0. 984, p < 0. 001) and a higher body mass index was associated with a higher risk of <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> (OR 1. 032, p < 0. 001). For organ confined disease preoperative prostate specific antigen was the most important factor that independently correlated with <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> (4 or less vs greater than 10 ng/ml OR 3. 8, p < 0. 001).

For a long time, such patients were not radically prostatectomised. In recent years, however, this viewpoint has changed. Material and Methods. We analysed a single-centre series of 34 patients with suspected locally advanced prostate cancer to establish predictive parameters for lymph node metastasis. All patients underwent radical prostatectomy between 2007 and 2010. Results. Of the 34 patients, 26 % showed pathological stage T 3 a, 59 % pT 3 b, and 15 % pT 4. Median preoperative PSA level was 25 [*]ng/mL, and five patients had had neoadjuvant antihormonal treatment. <b>Positive</b> <b>margins</b> were found in 76 % of patients. Patients without neoadjuvant treatment showed it in 79 %, and after preoperative antihormonal treatment the rate was 60 %. <b>Positive</b> <b>margins</b> were associated with {{lymph node involvement}} in 85 % of cases, complete resection was associated only in 50 % of cases. Conclusions. <b>Positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> play an important predictive role when estimating lymph node involvement in patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma. Neoadjuvant antihormonal therapy is associated with a relevant reduction in the rate of <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> but not with the rate of lymph node metastasis. As such, a combination of antihormonal and surgical treatment should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background We {{hypothesized}} that the method of breast cancer margin assessment {{may be associated with}} different rates of <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> and residual carcinoma. Methods A total of 178 breast cancer specimens were divided into 2 groups (A and B) based on the margin assessment method used. Rates of <b>positive</b> <b>margins,</b> re-excision, and residual carcinoma at re-excision were compared and analyzed statistically. Results At least 1 <b>margin</b> was <b>positive</b> in 64. 7 % in group A and in 65. 2 % in group B. At directed re-excision 54 % in group A and 51 % in group B had residual carcinoma. The lateral <b>margin</b> was <b>positive</b> in 44 % in group A compared with 26 % in group B (P = 3 D. 06). The posterior <b>margin</b> was <b>positive</b> in 19 % in group A and in 51 % in group B (P = 3 D. 001). Conclusions Two different breast cancer specimen margin assessment methods had comparable rates of <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> and residual carcinoma at re-excision. Different patterns of specific margin positivity suggest that the method of margin assessment may alter results...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{identified}} prognostic factors {{relevant to}} clinical outcomes (especially survival) in truncal and retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: These {{results can be}} used to optimize surgical management and select patients most likely to benefit from novel therapeutic strategies in future trials. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of a prospectively compiled database of 183 consecutive patients with truncal and retroperitoneal sarcomas seen at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute between 1970 to 1994. RESULTS: For truncal sarcoma, multivariate analysis showed that high-grade histology was associated with an eightfold increased risk of death compared with low-grade histology (p = 0. 001). In addition to grade, gross <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> of resection (p = 0. 001), microscopic <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> (p = 0. 023), and tumors greater than 5 cm in size (p = 0. 018) were important independent prognostic factors for survival. In this series, postoperative radiation therapy for truncal sarcoma was associated with a 2. 4 -fold decreased risk of death compared with truncal sarcoma patients receiving no adjuvant radiation therapy, having adjusted for the other prognostic factors (p = 0. 030). In contrast, for retroperitoneal sarcoma, multivariate analysis showed that high-grade and intermediate-grade histology were associated with a five- to sixfold increased risk of death compared with low-grade histology (p = 0. 009). In addition to grade, gross <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> of resection (p = 0. 001) and microscopic <b>positive</b> <b>margin</b> (p = 0. 004) were important independent prognostic factors for survival in retroperitoneal sarcoma. Patients who received either preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma had a 4. 6 -fold (p = 0. 002) and 3 -fold (p = 0. 010) increased risk of death, respectively, compared with patients receiving no adjuvant chemotherapy, having adjusted for the other prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The histologic grade and the margin of resection are prognostic for survival in both truncal and retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcoma. Tumor size was an independent prognostic factor for truncal sarcoma, but not for retroperitoneal sarcoma. Postoperative adjuvant radiation was beneficial to overall survival for truncal sarcoma. In this series of patients receiving a heterogeneous mixture of chemotherapeutic regimens-either as preoperative "neoadjuvant" therapy or as postoperative "adjuvant" therapy, there were no beneficial effects on survival compared with nonrandomized patients not receiving chemotherapy...|$|E

40|$|Background: Within 5 years {{following}} radical prostatectomy, between 15 and 60 % {{of patients with}} pT 3 prostate carcinomas show an increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {{as a sign of}} local and/or systemic tumour progression. Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> (RI) aims to reduce residual tumour cells in the prostatic bed, thus possibly reducing the biochemical progression rate. Apart from a large number of retrospective investigations, available results are presented from three randomised studies which have either been published completely (or in abstract form). Results: For pT 3 prostate carcinomas, agreeing data are presented from three randomised studies, which show around a 20 % reduced biochemical progression rate (bNED) after 4 to 5 years. With these data the results of numerous retrospective studies were confirmed. The majority of the authors used total doses of 60 Gy. From one randomised study an increased local control rate was demonstrated as basis for the extended freedom of biochemical progression. The rate of acute and late side effects after three-dimensional (3 -D) planned radiotherapy with 60 Gy is very small and the rate of severe side effects is below 2 %. The data situation for pT 2 prostate carcinomas with <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> is worse. Here, controversial data are presented, which require further investigation. Only retrospective data demonstrated a 25 % advantage for adjuvant RT. Therefore, adjuvant radiotherapy also seems reasonable for pT- 2 carcinomas with <b>positive</b> <b>margins.</b> Conclusions: The effectiveness of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with pT- 3 tumours with <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> with and without undetectable PSA levels with 60 Gy total dose has been demonstrated. A survival advantage has not been shown until now. 3 -D treatment planning remains the standard technique for these patients. For patients with <b>positive</b> <b>margins</b> in organ-limited prostate carcinomas (pT 2 R 1) randomised studies are recommended. It remains unclear whether the adjuvant RT is superior to the radiotherapy for rising PSA levels out of the undetectable range after radical prostatectomy...|$|R
40|$|Objective Histological {{details of}} <b>positive</b> {{surgical}} <b>margins</b> in radical prostatectomy specimens have {{been related to}} outcome after surgery in rare studies recently published. Our objective is to assess whether the status of surgical margins, the extent and the Gleason score of <b>positive</b> <b>margins,</b> {{and the extent of}} the extraprostatic extension are predictive of biochemical recurrence post-radical prostatectomy. Materials and Methods Three hundred sixty-five radical prostatectomy specimens were analyzed. The length of the <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margin</b> and extraprostatic extension and the Gleason score of the margin were recorded. Statistical analyses examined the predictive value of these variables for biochemical recurrence. Results 236 patients were stage pT 2 R 0, 58 pT 2 R 1, 25 pT 3 R 0 and 46 pT 3 R 1. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 11 %, 31 %, 20 % and 45. 7 % of pT 2 R 0, pT 2 R 1, pT 3 R 0 and pT 3 R 1, respectively. The extent of the <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> and the Gleason score of the <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> were not associated with biochemical recurrence in univariate analysis in a mean follow up period of 35. 9 months. In multivariate analyses, only the status of the surgical margins and the global Gleason score were associated with biochemical recurrence, with a risk of recurrence of 3. 1 for <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margins</b> and of 3. 8 for a Gleason score > 7. Conclusion <b>Positive</b> surgical <b>margin</b> and the global Gleason score are significant risk factors for biochemical recurrence post-radical prostatectomy, regardless of the extent of the surgical margin, the extent of the extraprostatic extension, or the local Gleason score of the <b>positive</b> surgical <b>margin</b> or extraprostatic tissue. pT 2 R 1 disease behaves as pT 3 R 0 and should be treated similarly...|$|R
