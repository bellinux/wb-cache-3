40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{important}} topic of human enhancement and tries to focus the question under a new perspective. The international debate is focused around two main theoretical positions: bio-conservatorism and techno-enthusiasm. We seem {{to be forced to}} choose one or another conception {{in order to understand the}} relationship between human beings and technology. The first part of the paper analyzes different authors trying to circumscribe the principal features of each one. We can notice two main paradigms which are incapable to rightly understand the phenomenon we are considering. The relieves emerging in the first part will be suitable to <b>prosecute</b> the <b>analysis</b> in the second part of the work...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} surrounding {{child sexual}} abuse (CSA), which is committed in secret without witnesses or corroborating physical evidence, {{make it difficult to}} <b>prosecute.</b> The <b>analysis</b> and assessment of the cognitive indicia (memory trace) thus becomes the primary documentary evidence on which the judge relies. The forensic interview is the instrument by which the forensic psychologist obtains the cognitive indicia for further analysis and assessment with regards to credibility. The present article warns of the potential interviewer biases and procedural errors that can contaminate the child’s narrative production, and proposes a design for the forensic interview process that aims to facilitate the evaluator’s task and minimize the potential biases. The need is emphasized for the evaluator to have knowledge and specialized training in this technique...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{efficacy}} of a corporate leniency program, a Markov process is constructed which models the stochastic formation and demise of cartels. Cartels are born when given the opportunity and market conditions are right, while cartels die because of internal collapse or they are caught and convicted by the antitrust authority. The likelihood that a cartel, once identified, is convicted depends inversely on the caseload of the antitrust authority due to an implicit resource constraint. The authority also chooses an enforcement policy {{in terms of the}} fraction of non-leniency cases that it <b>prosecutes.</b> Using numerical <b>analysis,</b> the impact of a leniency program on the steady-state cartel rate is investigated. Holding the enforcement policy of the antitrust authority fixed, a leniency program lowers the frequency of cartels. However, the additional caseload provided by the leniency program induces the antitrust authority to prosecute a smaller fraction of cartel cases identified outside of the program. Because of this less aggressive enforcement policy, {{it is possible that the}} cartel rate is higher when there is a leniency program. ...|$|R
40|$|The text {{addresses}} {{the ways in}} which camera surveillance and, primarily, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) is used to support the efficacy of governmental authority. The primary concern {{is the extent to which}} the video image has become integral to the exercise and the legitimization of the use of power and to provide support for State prosecutions and surveillance with particular reference to Canada and the United Kingdom. The thesis begins by introducing a short history of the use of CCTV in government, followed by a selection of example cases that illustrate the use of CCTV in British and Canadian court cases. The text then moves on to a theoretical evaluation of CCTV as a complement of the processes of governing and the establishment of what, in line with Foucault, I call the ‘institutional gaze’. In so doing it will show how the determination of the subject and the observer is also profoundly affected by this form of electronic media. The relationship between the individual and police and security services, the effect that media has on the way that space is perceived and how the camera has become an integral component of carrying out policing and security programs in contemporary life are major themes. McLuhan, Baudrillard, Virilio, Foucault and Derrida, among others, are consulted in order to evaluate the relationship between viewer, subject and space. Overall, the thesis is an evaluation of the experience of media, the determination of its impact and continuing influence on systems of power and the application of these determinations to the routine procedure of policing and <b>prosecuting.</b> The <b>analysis</b> shows how what is typically thought to be a linear and generally inert process of camera surveillance is in fact very complex and demands a nuanced appreciation for the effect media has on our understanding of the world around us...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper studies cartel {{deterrence}} and cartel stability. I use {{the cartel}} decision-making equation {{as a foundation}} to assess aspects of the South African cartel enforcement regime. It shows that cartel deterrence will only be achieved if the expected penalty from collusion exceeds the profits of collusion. The expected penalty is the probability of detection and the actual sanction likely to be imposed upon a cartel being detected and subsequently prosecuted. The probability of detection itself relies on a competition authorities’ procedural efficiency with regards to detecting cartels and other investigative tools such as a leniency policy. The profits of collusion {{are affected by the}} duration and stability of a cartel. The research specifically relies on the collection and analysis of primary data. Firstly, data were collected through a survey of competition attorneys and this is used to make inferences on the probability of detection in South Africa and well as the efficacy of the Competition Commission’s leniency policy. Secondly, data were collected on South African cartels that include data on the duration and other characteristics of each cartel <b>prosecuted.</b> The <b>analysis</b> conducted on the cartels database provides key insights into deterrence, the probability of detection and cartel stability. The results show that a cartel that will ultimately be detected is likely to be active in South Africa for around the same duration as cartels in the USA and Europe (between six and eight years). This suggests that the probability of detection in South Africa may be comparable to these jurisdictions (although they are considered to have a low probability of detection). This study moreover finds that South African cartels exhibit those characteristics that support cartel stability. More than half of the cartels prosecuted by the Commission involved five firms or less. Cartels with a large membership appear to rely on the presence of an industry association. Cartels involving homogenous products moreover appear to last longer than cartels with heterogeneous products. Unsurprisingly, both the results of the survey and the cartels database analysis show the very influential role played by the Commission’s leniency policy in detecting cartels and hence improving cartel deterrence.
