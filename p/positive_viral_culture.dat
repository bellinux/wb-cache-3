40|$|International audienceViral culture (VC), {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) and in vitro antibody production (IVAP) by {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were compared for the early diagnosis of HIV- 1 infection in 46 infants born to HIV- 1 seropositive mothers. The ten children considered infected on the basis of clinical signs and persistence of anti-HIV- 1 antibodies had at least one <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and seven were always positive in both PCR and IVAP tests. PCR and IVAP tests were occasionally negative in three infected children. Among 30 healthy children who became seronegative and were always negative for viral culture, 22 (73. 3 %) were also repeatedly negative in PCR and IVAP. We report 6 cases of children classified as P 2 A at the term of this study but who had lost anti-HIV- 1 antibodies. They presented at least one <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and occasional positive PCR and/or IVAP results. The results indicate that the combination of viral culture, PCR and IVAP tests improves the early diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection...|$|E

One hundred forty-three respiratory specimens from 126 patients were analyzed by RT-PCR-EHA, and the results were compared to those obtained by conventional <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and immunofluorescence (IF) methods. RT-PCR-EHA proved to be positive for 17 of 143 (11. 9 %) specimens, whereas 8 of 143 (5. 6 %) samples were <b>positive</b> by <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and/or IF. Eight samples were positive by both RT-PCR-EHA and conventional methods, while nine samples were RT-PCR-EHA <b>positive</b> and <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and IF negative. Eight of the nine samples with discordant results were then independently tested by a different multiplex RT-PCR assay for influenza virus types A and B, and all eight proved to be positive. In comparison to <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and IF methods, RT-PCR-EHA gave a sensitivity and a specificity of 100 and 93 %, respectively. Since RT-PCR-EHA was able to detect more positive samples, which would otherwise have been missed by routine methods, we suggest that this multiplex RT-PCR-EHA provides a highly sensitive and specific means of diagnostic detection of major respiratory viruses...|$|R

40|$|Background: Working in {{healthcare}} is often considered {{a risk factor}} for influenza; however, this risk has not been quantified. We aimed to systematically review evidence describing the annual incidence of influenza among healthy adults and healthcare workers (HCWs).

40|$|This {{article is}} derived from a letter I sent to {{officials}} at my hospital concerning mandated influenza vaccination, asking them to consider whether vaccination is medically warranted, and whether the mandate is ethically correct. Between 1979 and 2001, on average 36, 000 people {{per year in the}} U. S. died from complications of influenza. Based on the number of hospital beds in acute and chronic care facilities, and spreading that risk evenly across all facilities, one person every three years, on average, would die at our hospital from influenza sequelae. This number is probably a significant overestimate since proof of influenza from positive viral cultures is rarely obtained (in most cases, 1, 000 – 4, 000 samples are submitted before a single <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> is obtained), and deaths from influenza B and other influenza‐like diseases, which would not be prevented by vaccination, may be included in these statistics.

40|$|A direct {{immunofluorescence}} assay (DFA) with a monoclonal antibody from Ortho Diagnostic Systems was compared with conventional cell culture for the rapid detection of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in 140 dermal lesions from 133 patients. A total of 79 (56 %) specimens were positive for VZV: 40 (51 %) by DFA alone, 2 (3 %) by culture only, and 37 (47 %) by both culture and DFA. After discordant analysis, the sensitivities and negative predictive values, respectively, were 97. 5 % (77 of 79) and 96. 8 % (61 of 63) for DFA and 49. 4 % (39 of 79) and 60. 4 % (61 of 101) for <b>viral</b> <b>culture.</b> Of the 39 <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>cultures,</b> VZV was isolated from 38 (97 %) cultures in A 549 cells, 23 (59 %) in primary rhesus monkey kidney cells, and only 16 (41 %) in MRC- 5 cells.

30|$|Variation in {{diagnostic}} {{methods used}} including selecting different specimens, some used serum, while others used urine, saliva, or bronchoalveolar lavage samples, tests were performed {{at different points}} in the ICU stay and testing time and frequency was not standardized in all studies as some left it up to the judgment of the treating team. Recent studies showed that CMV disease typically occurs within the first 2  weeks of critical illness. A study performed by Kalil and Florescu [34] showed that the diagnosis rate of CMV infection increased significantly (from 1 to 21 %) when patients who spent five or more days in the ICU were screened, pointing to a threshold in timing for the window to develop CMV in critical care setting. In a recent systematic review that included 13 studies (nine prospective and four retrospective), the incidence of CMV disease in critically ill patients, defined as the detection of antigenemia, DNAemia, or <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> from blood samples with or without other clinical specimens, ranged from 0 to 36 %. Notably, the reported incidence of the disease was much higher in studies that screened the patients weekly than those that screened only once within the first 4  days of admission to the ICU (6 – 33 vs. 0.8 – 1.2 %), indicating that the disease happens frequently beyond the first 4  days post-admission. Among the studies using PCR detection (which is the most sensitive diagnostic test for CMV), the mean and median times of detection ranged from 4 to 12  days after ICU admission [8].|$|E
40|$|SummaryAimThis study {{assessed}} the infectious etiology of patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (AECOPD) with concomitant pneumonia. MethodsPatients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2 – 3 months post-hospital discharge. ResultsSeventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77. 1 (7. 5) years, with FEV 1 of 41. 5 (20. 8) % predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48. 7 % of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40. 8 % had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8 [11. 3 %]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7 [9. 9 %]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7 [9. 9 %]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9. 0 and 12. 2 % had <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4 [6. 1 %] subjects) and rhinovirus (2 [3. 0 %]). Paired serology was positive in 4. 4 %. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (> 1000 mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50. 0 % vs 18. 2 %, p= 0. 02). ConclusionAn infectious etiology could be established in about half of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. The majority of identifiable causes were bacterial. Patients on high dose ICS might have impaired airway defense as reflected by the higher rate of positive sputum culture...|$|E

A subset of 29 FP were asked to answer a detailed questionnaire concerning their health, use of 2 ̆ 2 safer sex 2 ̆ 2 techniques, and other risk factors for HIV- 1 infection. They also had additional blood drawn for CD 4 cell analysis, <b>viral</b> <b>cultures,</b> nef, gag, and env immunoblots, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to assess the occurrence of 2 ̆ 2 silent 2 ̆ 2 HIV- 1 infection in a high-risk seronegative population.

40|$|A semiquantitative PCR {{technique}} for detecting {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA in plasma was compared with quantitative <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> and p 24 antigen detection in plasma. Ninety-three samples from 20 symptomatic, 10 asymptomatic, and 10 seronegative individuals were tested. For most of the seropositive patients, consecutives samples were examined. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma by the method described by Boom et al. (R. Boom, C. J. A. Sol, M. M. M. Salimans, C. L. Jansen, P. M. E. Wertheim-van Dillen, and J. van der Noordaa, J. Clin. Microbiol. 28 : 495 - 503, 1990). The RNA PCR was the most sensitive method (100 and 74 % sensitivity for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively) and produced less divergent results with the consecutive samples from individual patients compared with the other techniques. All samples <b>positive</b> by <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> or p 24 antigen assay were also positive in the RNA PCR. For {{each of the three}} assays, the number of positive results obtained correlated with the disease stage. The estimated mean number of HIV- 1 RNA copies was significantly higher in symptomatic patients (22, 750 copies per ml) than in asymptomatic patients (1, 820 copies per ml). It was also higher in samples <b>positive</b> for <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> than in culture-negative samples. No close correlation was found between the amount of HIV- 1 RNA and the amount of p 24 antigen or the titer of infectious virus in plasma or between this titer and the level of p 24 antigen.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Congenital {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) {{infection is}} {{a leading cause of}} hearing loss and mental retardation throughout the world. Detection of the CMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a sensitive, rapid, and specific means of identification. Meconium, the stool formed in utero, may be an ideal specimen for CMV detection. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a PCR-based methodology for the detection of CMV in the meconium of neonates. METHODS: Meconium was collected from 10 newborn infants (seven with <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>cultures</b> and three uninfected infants born to CMV-seropositive mothers). For each, DNA was isolated from meconium by organic extraction and attachment to a DNA-binding matrix, and PCR was performed using amplimers specific for the major intermediate early (MIE) and late antigenic (LA) regions of CMV. RESULTS: Gel electrophoresis demonstrated an anticipated PCR product of 250 base pairs (bp) corresponding to the MIE region of CMV in all infected and positive control meconium samples. Furthermore, a single band of 150 bp corresponding to the LA region of CMV was also amplified in several of the infected infants. Conversely, no amplification of these antigenic regions was noted in either uninfected infants born to CMV-seropositive mothers or negative controls.

The commonest form in each population group was aseptic meningitis. <b>Positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>cultures</b> {{were obtained from the}} CSF in 108 cases. The median age of white children with aseptic meningitis, 64 months, was significantly greater than that of coloured children, 45 months (P > 0, 0001), and black children, 26 months (P > 0, 014). The commonest cause of confirmed bacterial meningitis was Neisseria meningitidis (140 cases; 11, 5 %), which continues to affect mainly young coloured children (median age 16, 9 months). Resistance to sulphonamides was found among 21 % of 114 N. meningitidis isolates. Among white children Haemophilus influenzae was responsible for 9 of the 18 cases of confirmed bacterial meningitis. Tuberculosis was responsible for 62 cases of meningitis (5 %) and was a commoner cause of meningitis than either H. influenzae (47 cases) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (34 cases).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} {{clinical practice}} {{for the management of}} recurrent genital herpes in pregnant women in Australia. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A questionnaire to all doctors associated with the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Policies for antenatal herpes screening, circumstances in which delivery by caesarean section was considered appropriate, and the use of aciclovir during pregnancy. The results were analysed by college status, sex, and whether the doctor worked in a public or private facility. RESULTS: 2855 (67. 3 %) obstetricians returned questionnaires. 696 (34. 3 %) stated that their hospital had a policy for managing recurrent genital herpes in pregnancy: 44. 5 % examined the genitalia and 33. 8 % took cultures during pregnancy. Fellows were more likely to examine the genitalia (87 % v 37 %, p < 0. 001), and more likely to perform antenatal <b>viral</b> <b>cultures</b> than members (75 % v 30 %, p < 0. 001). Doctors working at private hospitals {{were significantly more likely to}} take <b>viral</b> <b>cultures</b> than doctors in public hospitals (39 % v 33 % p < 0. 05). Doctors were asked to consider five scenarios and judge whether caesarean section would be appropriate. 96 % considered that a caesarean section was appropriate in women with active herpes at the onset of labour. In the case of a recurrence of genital HSV at the time of presentation with ruptured membranes longer than 4 hours, diplomats (79 %) were significantly more likely to recommend a caesarean section than fellows (64 %), members (63 %), or trainees (49 %) (all p < or = 0. 001). Where there were <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>cultures</b> before the onset of labour fellows (45 %) were more likely than members (29 %) (p = 0. 005), males (62 %) were more likely than females (55 %) (p = 0. 03), and doctors working in private hospitals (69 %) were more likely than those in the public sector (54 %) (p < 0. 001) to recommend caesarean section. CONCLUSION: There is considerable divergence of opinion regarding the appropriate management of recurrent genital herpes in pregnancy. The implementation of management guidelines would provide consistency of care. ...|$|R
40|$|Influenza {{virus is}} of great concern for {{healthcare}} practitioners and scientists due to the high transmissibility, mortality and morbidity. Influenza virus can cause severe viral pneumonia. Several epidemic and pandemic outbreaks {{were found to be}} caused by influenza virus, including H 1 N 1 pandemic in 1918, H 2 N 2 pandemic in 1957, H 3 N 2 pandemic in 1968 and H 1 N 1 pandemic in 2009. Clinical specimens commonly used for detection of influenza virus include nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab and throat swab. The collection procedure would also cause discomfort to patients and pose risks for both patients and healthcare workers. Several groups have studied the use of saliva as an alternative specimen for detection of influenza viruses with molecular methods. However, <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> was not performed in those studies. Therefore, it was unclear whether live virus was present in the saliva. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of nasopharyngeal aspirate and saliva in culturing influenza virus. Saliva and NPA specimens from 82 adult patients were collected from February, 2015 to February, 2016. Among them, 40 participants were female and 42 were male. Fifty of them were aged > 65 years and 32 of them were aged between 18 and 65 years. The result of <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> in this study was similar in both NPA and saliva specimen. The positive rate for NPA was 28 %(23 / 82) and that for saliva was 24 %(20 / 82). <b>Viral</b> <b>culture</b> was <b>positive</b> in NPA only for 11 %(9 / 82) and saliva only for 7 %(6 / 82). The <b>positive</b> rate for <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> would be increased by 26 % if both NPA and saliva specimens were collected for <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> when compared with NPA alone. Gene sequencing showed that one patient had a threonine at amino acid position 160 of the haemagglutinin (HA) protein from the NPA specimen, but a mixed population of threonine and lysine was found at the same position in the saliva specimen of the same patient. The findings in this study suggest that <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> using both saliva and NPA will increase the <b>positive</b> rate of <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> of influenza virus. Furthermore, <b>viral</b> <b>culture</b> from saliva may also identify virus quasispecies that are not present in the NPA. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
40|$|Human {{rhinovirus}} (HRV) {{infections are}} usually self-limited {{but may be}} associated with serious consequences, particularly in those with asthma and chronic respiratory disease. Effective antiviral agents are needed for preventing and treating HRV illnesses. Ruprintrivir (Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) selectively inhibits HRV 3 C protease and shows potent, broad-spectrum anti-HRV activity in vitro. We conducted three double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 202 healthy volunteers to assess the activity of ruprintrivir in experimental HRV infection. Subjects were randomized to receive intranasal ruprintrivir (8 mg) or placebo sprays as prophylaxis (two or five times daily [2 ×/day or 5 ×/day] for 5 days) starting 6 h before infection or as treatment (5 ×/day for 4 days) starting 24 h after infection. Ruprintrivir prophylaxis reduced the proportion of subjects with <b>positive</b> <b>viral</b> <b>cultures</b> (for 5 ×/day dosing groups, 44 % for ruprintrivir treatment group versus 70 % for placebo treatment group [P = 0. 03]; for 2 ×/day dosing groups, 60 % for ruprintrivir group versus 92 % for placebo group [P = 0. 004]) and viral titers but did not decrease the frequency of colds. Ruprintrivir treatment reduced the mean total daily symptom score (2. 2 for ruprintrivir treatment group and 3. 3 for the placebo treatment group [P = 0. 014]) by 33 %. Secondary endpoints, including viral titers, individual symptom scores, and nasal discharge weights, were also reduced by ruprintrivir treatment. Overall, ruprintrivir was well tolerated; blood-tinged mucus and nasal passage irritation were the most common adverse effects reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma and nasal ruprintrivir concentrations revealed intranasal drug residence with minimal systemic absorption.

Even after biomicroscopy, complex laboratory tests, such as <b>viral</b> <b>culture,</b> are necessary to identify the pathogen or its etiology. To contribute to the better understanding of the pathobiology of the adenoviral conjunctivitis, the tear fluids of patients with unilateral acute adenovirus conjunctivitis (UAAC), normal donors (control) and patients with allergic conjunctivitis were analyzed. Tear samples were collected with Schirmer strips from control, allergic conjunctivitis and UAAC patients, diagnosed by clinical signs. UAAC tears were tested <b>positive</b> in <b>viral</b> <b>cultures.</b> After the elution, HA was quantified using an ELISA-like fluorometric assay and the protein profile was determined by SDS-PAGE. A profound increase in the HA tear content in UAAC patients was found when compared to control and ALC. This HA increase in UAAC tears remarkably was not observed in tears from contralateral eyes without clinical signs, nor in allergic conjunctivitis. In addition a distinct profile of UAAC tear proteins was observed in patients with UAAC. The quantification of HA in the tear fluid is a rapid, sensitive and specific test.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory parameters distinguishing viral from nonviral lower respiratory tract infection in elderly patients and to determine the yield of virological diagnostics in elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection. The {{study was conducted in}} a 184 -bed geriatric department in a university hospital during 4 winter months. All consecutive elderly persons admitted with a lower respiratory tract infection were included in the study. Clinical and laboratory parameters, a nasopharyngeal swab, and serological results for respiratory viruses were obtained for all participants. Available blood and sputum cultures were analysed. A total of 165 elderly persons (mean age, 82 +/- 6. 8 years) were hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection. Familial flu-like illness (OR, 4. 25; 95 %CI, 1. 4 - 13), better functionality (OR, 4; 95 %CI, 1. 3 - 14. 15), and leucocyte count < 10 (10) /l (OR, 3; 95 %CI, 1. 3 - 7. 1) were predictive for viral lower respiratory tract infection. Sixty (36. 5 %) definite diagnoses (<b>positive</b> blood <b>culture,</b> <b>viral</b> <b>culture,</b> or serological test) and seven (4. 2 %) probable diagnoses (positive sputum culture) were obtained. An early diagnosis (within 72 h) was possible in 38 (23 %) and a late diagnosis in 29 (17. 6 %) participants. A nasopharyngeal swab contributed in 60. 5 % of the cases to an early diagnosis. <b>Viral</b> <b>culture</b> identified half (22 / 43) of the lower respiratory tract infections caused by influenza but only one of six lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus. In conclusion, a history of flu-like illness in family members and a total leucocyte count within normal limits makes a viral cause more likely in elderly people hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection during winter. <b>Viral</b> <b>culture</b> and rapid antigen detection are insensitive in elderly patients hospitalised with a lower respiratory tract infection. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Influenza viral {{shedding}} studies provide fundamental {{information for}} preventive strategies and modelling exercises. We conducted a prospective household study to investigate viral shedding in seasonal and pandemic influenza between 2007 and 2011 in Berlin and Munich, Germany. Methods: Study physicians recruited index {{patients and their}} household members. Serial nasal specimens were obtained from all household members over at least eight days and tested quantitatively by qRT-PCR for the influenza virus (sub) type of the index patient. A subset of samples was also tested by <b>viral</b> <b>culture.</b> Symptoms were recorded daily. Results: We recruited 122 index patients and 320 household contacts, of which 67 became secondary household cases. Among all 189 influenza cases, 12 were infected with seasonal/prepandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1), 19 with A(H 3 N 2), 60 with influenza B, and 98 with A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09. Nine (14 %) of 65 non-vaccinated secondary cases were asymptomatic/subclinical (0 (0 %) of 21 children, 9 (21 %) of 44 adults; p = 0. 03). Viral load among patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) peaked on illness days 1, 2 or 3 for all (sub) types and declined steadily until days 7 – 9. Clinical symptom scores roughly paralleled viral shedding dynamics.

40|$|Abstract. Methods {{for early}} {{diagnosis}} of pediatric HIV- 1 infection (DNA-polymerase chain reaction [PCR], RNA quantification, <b>viral</b> <b>cultures)</b> are expensive. Most Cambodian infants wait 18 months for HIV serologic tests. We observed that boosted-p 24 -antigen profile assay, with performances similar to <b>viral</b> <b>cultures</b> and costs similar to DNA-PCR, {{is easier to}} perform and could readily be set up in resource-poor settings. HIV prevalence in Cambodia among pregnant women was 1. 7 – 2. 7 % in 2000. 1 Standard methods for the early diagnosis of HIV infection in infants born to HIV-seropositive mothers are DNA-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RNA detection, and <b>viral</b> <b>cultures.</b> 2 DNA-PCR and RNA detection are the preferred standard techniques for early diagnosis. 2 However, certain HIV- 1 variants might not be detected by these tech-niques, although if at least two {{different regions of the}} HIV- 1 genome are targeted, improved sensitivity would be achieved. Non-molecular tests such as <b>viral</b> <b>cultures,</b> another standard technique, would not be affected by these concerns. However...|$|R
