Also a multi-wavelength aethalometer was utilized as a carbonaceous aerosol detector to directly measure the local wood smoke <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> and traffic <b>PM</b> <b>mass.</b> To achieve this, daily PM 2. 5 inorganic ions sodium, ammonium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, nitrate, sulphate, and organic compound levoglucosan were measured {{over a period}} of more than one and half years at four sampling locations. There were: (1) Elms road, University of Birmingham; (2) North Kilworth Mill Observatory Site; (3) Churchill Pumping Station Site; and (4) Budbrooke, Warwick Sampling Site. Correlation analysis, regression analysis, and seasonal variation were examined for those inorganic and organic elements and compounds. The results were used to provide comprehensive spatial and temporal distributions, intra-site and inter-site comparison differentiations. Wood smoke potassium and levoglucosan were used as wood smoke tracer to determine the local resident wood smoke <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations in this thesis. Budbrooke, Warwick Sampling Site for example, a mean value of 62 ng m- 3 wood smoke potassium was measured at winter periods but the mean value of only 17 ng m- 3 was measured during summer periods. This significant difference demonstrated a frequent wood smoke activity in this area during winter periods. Also a multi-wavelength aethalometer was used as wood smoke mass detector to measure the local resident wood smoke <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> and local traffic <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations. These three methods have their unique processes of acquiring the wood smoke mass concentrations, thus the results from these method have considerable variations.

We compared the measured black carbon (BC) mass and the total <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> determined from particle size distributions (PSD) and effective density for a commercial turbofan engine CFM 56 - 7 B 26 / 3. The effective density was then {{used to calculate the}} <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> losses in the sampling system. The effective density was determined using a differential mobility analyzer and a centrifugal particle mass analyzer, and increased from engine idle to take-off by up to 60 %. The determined mass-mobility exponents ranged from 2. 37 to 2. 64. The mean effective density determined by weighting the effective density distributions by PM volume was within 10 % of the unit density (1000 kg/m 3) that is widely assumed in aircraft PM studies. We found ratios close to unity between the <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> determined by the integrated PSD method and the real-time BC mass measurements. The integrated PSD method achieved higher precision at ultra-low PM concentrations at which current mass instruments reach their detection limit. The line loss model predicted ~ 60 % <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> loss at engine idle, decreasing to ~ 27 % at high thrust. Replacing the effective density distributions with unit density lead to comparable estimates that were within 20 % and 5 % at engine idle and high thrust, respectively.

The mass loss was gravimetrically evaluated on collocated filters analyzed both by EDXRF under vacuum condition and by Ion Chromatography. Then, this comparison was repeated with a gaseous mixture of air and Helium (He) instead of evacuating the measurements chamber of the EDXRF spectrometer. It was shown that EDXRF analysis under vacuum medium leads to mass loss of water soluble ions and other volatile constituents of PM 10. The total <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> loss was found not {{to be limited to}} water soluble ionic species, indicating that other volatile components of PM were likely to be lost. The use of a He and air mixture medium considerably reduced the <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> losses.

Methods: PM 2. 5 and PM 10 was sampled at 5 sites: an underground station, a farm, 2 traffic sites and an urban background site. Three a-cellular assays; dithiothreitol (OPDTT), electron spin resonance (OPESR) and ascorbate depletion (OPAA) were used to characterize the OP of PM. Results: The highest OP was observed at the underground, where OP of PM 10 was 30 (OPDTT) to > 600 (OPESR) times higher compared to the urban background when expressed as OP/m(3) and 2 - 40 times when expressed as OP/mu g. For the outdoor sites, samples from the farm showed significantly lower OPESR and OPAA, whereas samples from the continuous traffic site showed the highest OP for all assays. Contrasts in OP between sites were generally larger than for <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> and were lower for OPDTT compared to OPESR and OPAA. Furthermore, OPDTT/mu g was significantly higher in PM 2. 5 compared to PM 10, whereas the reverse was the case for OPESR. OPESR and OPAA were highly correlated with traffic-related PM components (i. e. EC, Fe, Cu, PAHs), whereas OPDTT showed the highest correlation with <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> and OC. Conclusions: Contrasts in OP between sites, differences in size fractions and correlation with PM composition depended on the specific OP assay used, with OPESR and OPAA showing the most similar results.

40|$|AbstractSpatial and {{temporal}} variations in aerosol particulate matter (PM) were investigated for distribution over {{the four seasons}} of chemical constituents and particle size fractions in Faisalabad, Pakistan from June 2012 to April 2013. At nine sampling sites, four <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> size fractions (total suspended particulates [TSP], PM 10, PM 4 and PM 2. 5) were monitored; simultaneously, TSP mass samples were collected on glass fiber filters using a high volume air sampler. TSP samples (144) were subjected to quantitative chemical analyses for determining trace elements (Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn, Cu, Fe) using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and water-soluble cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+, NH 4 +) and anions (Cl–, SO 42 – and NO 3 –) by ion chromatography. The highest <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations were observed at industrial sites, while they were somewhat lower in major road intersections and lowest in the remote background site. It was also observed that <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations were about two to 20 {{times higher than the}} standard limits of the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Coarse particles (TSP, PM 10 and PM 4) were found to be highest during the summer, while relatively fine particles (PM 2. 5) were higher during the winter period. Concentrations of all size fractions were lowest during the monsoon sampling period at all sites. Concentrations of different elements and water-soluble ions also followed the similar temporal pattern as <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> concentrations. The crustal elements Ca, Fe, Mg and Na were the largest contributors to TSP mass while elements of anthropogenic origin (Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu and Zn) had relatively lower concentrations and also showed a high spatial variation. Among the anions, sulfate (SO 42 –) was the predominant species contributing to 50 - 60 % of the total anion concentration. It was found that rainfall, wind speed and relative humidity were the most important meteorological factors affecting PM concentrations.

It {{has been suggested that}} particles from combustion sources are more relevant to human health than are particles from other sources, but the impact of policies directed at reducing PM from combustion processes is usually relatively small when effects are estimated for a reduction in the total mass concentration. Objectives: We evaluated the value of black carbon particles (BCP) as an additional indicator in air quality management. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of health effects of BCP compared with <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> based on data from time-series studies and cohort studies that measured both exposures. We compared the potential health benefits of a hypothetical traffic abatement measure, using near-roadway concentration increments of BCP and PM 2. 5 based on data from prior studies.

Two-pollutant models in time-series studies suggested that the effect of BCP was more robust than the effect of <b>PM</b> <b>mass.</b> The estimated increase in life expectancy associated with a hypothetical traffic abatement measure was four to nine times higher when expressed in BCP compared with an equivalent change in <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass.</b> Conclusion: BCP is a valuable additional air quality indicator to evaluate the health risks of air quality dominated by primary combustion particles...|$|R

40|$|Inter-comparisons of European {{air quality}} models show that {{regional}} transport models, including the EMEP (Co-operative Programme for {{monitoring and evaluation}} of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe) aerosol model, tend to underestimate the observed concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2. 5. Obviously, an accurate representation of the individual aerosol constituents {{is a prerequisite for}} adequate calculation of PM concentrations. On the other hand, available measurements on the chemical characterization of ambient particles reveal that full chemical <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> closure is rarely achieved. The fraction unaccounted for by chemical analysis can comprise as much as 30 - 40 % of gravimetric PM 10 or <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass.</b> The unaccounted <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> can partly be due to non-C atoms in organic aerosols and/or due to sampling and measurement artefacts. Moreover, a part of the unaccounted <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> is likely to consist of water associated with particles. Thus, the gravimetrically measured particle mass does not necessarily represent dry PM 10 and <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass.</b> This is thought {{to be one of the}} reasons for models under-prediction of observed PM, if calculated dry PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations are compared with measurements. The EMEP aerosol model has been used to study to what extent particle-bound water can explain the chemically unidentified <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> in filter-based particle samples. Water content of PM 2. 5 and PM 10 has been estimated with the model for temperature 20 °C and relative humidity 50 %, which are conditions required for equilibration of dust-loaded filters according to the Reference method recommended by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). Model calculations for Europe show that, depending on particle composition, particle-bound water constitutes 20 - 35 % of the annual mean PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations, which is consistent with existing experimental estimates. At two Austrian sites, in Vienna and Streithofen, where daily measurements of <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> and chemical composition are available, calculated PM 2. 5 water content is found to be about 75 - 80 % of the undetermined <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass</b> and there is correlation between them. Furthermore, accounting for aerosol water has improved the agreement between modelled and measured daily PM 2. 5 concentrations, whilst model calculated dry PM 2. 5 concentrations appear to agree quite well with the total identified <b>PM</b> 2. 5 <b>mass.</b> No information on the composition of PM measured at EMEP sites is presently available. Given that PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations are measured at EMEP stations with gravimetric methods they are likely to contain water. We show that the levels of modelled PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations with aerosol water included agree with measurements better than dry PM concentrations. As expected, the spatial correlation has not changed significantly, whereas the temporal correlation of daily PM 10 and PM 2. 5 with monitoring data has slightly improved at most of the EMEP sites. Our results suggest that aerosol water should be accounted for in modelled PM 10 and PM 2. 5 when compared with filter-based gravimetric measurements...|$|R

30|$|The 2  years average PM 2.5 {{fraction}} in the <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> is {{ranging from}} 0.9 to 0.74 in the {{indoor and outdoor}} sampling sites indicating also that particles indoors have a significant outdoor origin. The average <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentration and the PM 1 number concentration indoors were higher than the outdoor levels for all three museums. This finding indicates {{that the presence of}} visitors in the museums and other indoor activities contribute to higher <b>PM</b> 10 <b>mass</b> concentrations also through particle resuspension. In addition, high PM 1 particle number concentration were measured in the Historical Museum of Crete and the Criminology Museum in Athens which are located in urban areas due to the high anthropogenic emissions.|$|R

40|$|Size-resolved {{particulate}} matter (PM) {{samples were collected}} with a 10 -stage Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI) at a sub-urban site (Tung Chung) in Hong Kong for four non-consecutive months representing four seasons from 2011 to 2012. Major chemical components were water-soluble anions (i. e., Cl-, NO 3 -, and SO 4 2 -), cations (i. e., NH 4 +, Na+, K+, and Ca 2 +), organic and elemental carbon and elements. Both chemical mass closure and positive matrix factorization (PMF) were employed to understand the chemical composition, resolve particle size modes, and evaluate the PM sources. Tri-modal size distributions were found for <b>PM</b> <b>mass</b> and major chemical components (e. g., SO 4 2 -, NH 4 +, and OC). Mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMADs) with similar standard deviations (1. 32 <σ< 1. 42) were 0. 4, 0. 7 and 3. 8 μm, consistent with condensation, droplet and coarse modes. A bi-modal distribution peaking at condensation and droplet modes was found for EC, with a single mode peaking at 3. 8 μm for Cl-. Besides secondary SO 4 2 -, carbonaceous aerosol dominated the condensation mode with 27 % by engine exhaust and 18 - 19 % each by residual oil combustion (shipping) and coal/biomass burning. Secondary SO 4 2 - {{is also the most}} dominant component in the droplet mode, accounting for 23 % of <b>PM</b> <b>mass,</b> followed by an industrial source (19 %). Engine exhaust, secondary NO 3 -, and sea salt each accounted for 13 - 15 % of <b>PM</b> <b>mass.</b> Sea salt and soil are the dominated sources in the coarse mode, accounting for ~ 80 % of coarse mass.
