5|$|As <b>porbeagles</b> {{had become}} scarce in the Northeast Atlantic, in the 1960s the Norwegian fishing fleet moved {{west to the}} waters off New England and Newfoundland. A few years later, {{they were joined by}} {{longline}} vessels from the Faroe Islands. Norwegian annual catches rose from 1,900 tons in 1961 to over 9,000 tons in 1965; the catch was largely exported to Italy, where porbeagle (smeriglio) is an extremely popular food fish. Again, the stock collapsed, this time in only six years: by 1970 Norwegian catches had fallen to under 1,000 tons per year, and Faroese catches observed a similar trend. With the population decimated, most fishers moved on or switched to other species. Porbeagle numbers gradually recovered in the ensuing 25 years, to about 30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, Canada established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and became the primary fisher of <b>porbeagles</b> in the region. Between 1994 and 1998, Canadian fishing vessels landed 1,000–2,000 tons per year, which depleted the population to 11–17% of pre-exploitation levels by 2000. Strict regulations and greatly reduced fishing quotas introduced in 2000 have since begun to reverse the stock decline, though recovery of the stock is projected to take decades due to the low productivity of the species. There is evidence that incidental artificial selection caused by heavy fishing has led to a compensatory growth response, i.e. faster growth and earlier maturation.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and <b>porbeagles.</b> Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|Intensive {{fishing for}} the {{porbeagle}} dates back the 1930s, when Norway {{and to a}} lesser extent Denmark began operating longline vessels in the Northeast Atlantic. The Norwegian annual catch rose from 279 tons in 1926 to 3,884 tons in 1933, and peaked at around 6,000 tons in 1947, with the resumption of fishing after World War II. Soon after the stock collapsed: Norwegian annual catches declined steadily to 1,200–1,900 tons from 1953 to 1960, 160–300 tons in the early 1970s, and 10–40 tons in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similarly, Danish annual catches fell from 1,500 tons in the early 1950s to under 100 tons in the 1990s. France and Spain began to target <b>porbeagles</b> in the Northeast Atlantic in the 1970s. French fishers operate mainly in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, and saw a decline from an annual catch of over 1,000 tons in 1979 to 300–400 tons in the late 1990s. Catches by Spanish fishers were highly variable, ranging from negligible to over 4,000 tons per year, which may reflect shifts of fishing effort into historically less-exploited waters. Since 2011, all fishing for the porbeagle has been illegal in waters of the European Union and EU-registered vessels are also prohibited from fishing for the species in international waters. In 2012, similar restriction came into effect in Norway.|$|E
40|$|Despite their notoriety {{and role}} as apex predators, the {{longevity}} of large pelagic sharks such as the <b>porbeagle</b> (Lamna nasus) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) is unknown. Vertebral growth bands provide an accurate indicator of age in young <b>porbeagle,</b> but age validation has never been reported for any large shark species {{past the age of}} sexual maturity. Here, we report the first application of bomb radiocarbon as an age validation method for longlived sharks based on date-specific incorporation of radiocarbon into vertebral growth bands. Our results indicate that <b>porbeagle</b> vertebrae recorded and preserved a bomb radiocarbon pulse in growth bands formed during the 1960 s. Through comparison of radiocarbon assays in young, known-age <b>porbeagle</b> collected in the 1960 s with the corresponding growth bands in old <b>porbeagle</b> collected later, we confirm the validity of <b>porbeagle</b> vertebral growth band counts as accurate annual age indicators to an age of at least 26 years. The radiocarbon signatures of <b>porbeagle</b> vertebral growth bands appear to be temporally and metabolically stable and derived mainly from the radiocarbon content of their prey. Preliminary radiocarbon assays of shortfin mako vertebrae suggest that current methods for determining shortfin mako age are incorrect...|$|R
5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the <b>porbeagle.</b> It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the <b>porbeagle</b> are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the <b>porbeagle,</b> principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The <b>porbeagle</b> continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the <b>porbeagle</b> as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|R

500|$|In {{the western}} North Atlantic, <b>porbeagles</b> feed mainly on pelagic fishes and squid in spring, and on {{groundfishes}} in the fall; this pattern {{corresponds to the}} spring-fall migration of these sharks from deeper to shallower waters, and the most available prey types in those respective habitats. Therefore, the porbeagle {{seems to be an}} opportunistic predator without strong diet specificity. During spring and summer in the Celtic Sea and on the outer Nova Scotian Shelf, <b>porbeagles</b> congregate at tidally induced thermal fronts to feed on fish that have been drawn by high concentrations of zooplankton.

500|$|Seasonal migrations {{have been}} {{observed}} in <b>porbeagles</b> from both hemispheres. In the western North Atlantic, much of the population spends the spring in the deep waters of the Nova Scotia continental shelf, and migrates north a distance of [...] to spend late summer and fall in the shallow waters of the Newfoundland Grand Banks and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

In the eastern North Atlantic, <b>porbeagles</b> are believed to spend spring and summer in shallow continental shelf waters, and disperse northwards to overwinter in deeper waters offshore. Migrating sharks may travel upwards of , though once they reach their destination they tend to remain within a relatively localized area. In the South Pacific, the population shifts north past 30°S latitude into subtropical waters in winter and spring, and retreats south past 35°S latitude in summer, when sharks are frequently sighted off subantarctic islands.|$|E

500|$|At one time, <b>porbeagles</b> were {{regarded}} as nuisances by some commercial fishers because they damaged lighter fishing gear intended for smaller species and stole hooked fish from lines. This shark is highly valued as a game fish by sport fishers in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It fights strongly on hook-and-line, but does not usually jump into the air like the related shortfin mako. Novice anglers often mistake this shark for the mako, which has earned it the affectionate moniker [...] "fako" [...] in New England. The International Game Fish Association keeps records on the porbeagle.|$|E
500|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{has very}} rarely, if ever, bitten swimmers or boats. As of 2009, the International Shark Attack File attributes three bites to this species, one provoked and none fatal, and two on boats.

In another account of a swimmer bitten by a [...] "mackerel shark", the species responsible {{could easily have been}} a misidentified shortfin mako or great white shark. Recently in the North Sea, adult <b>porbeagles</b> have been filmed charging at divers working on oil platforms, sometimes even brushing lightly against them without doing harm.

500|$|The dorsal {{coloration}} is {{a medium}} to dark gray or slate, extending to {{the bases of}} the pectoral fins.

500|$|The {{timing of}} the porbeagle's {{reproductive}} cycle is unusual {{in that it is}} largely similar in both hemispheres, rather than being offset by six months. This suggests that its reproduction is not significantly affected by temperature or day length, perhaps owing to its endothermic physiology. Mating takes place mainly between September and November, though females [...] with fresh mating scars have been reported as late as January off the Shetland Islands. The male bites at the female's pectoral fins, gill region, and flanks while courting and to hold on for copulation. Two mating grounds are known for western North Atlantic <b>porbeagles,</b> one off Newfoundland and the other on Georges Bank in the Gulf of Maine. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. They probably reproduce every year. The litter size is typically four, with two embryos oriented in opposing directions sharing each uterus; on rare occasions a litter may contain as few as one or as many as five pups. The gestation period is 8–9 months.|$|E

There is a single, anomalous record from brackish water, of a juvenile in Mar Chiquita in Argentina. A tracking study off the British Isles has found substantial variation in the short-term movements of this species, both between and within individuals. Vertical movements tended to increase with water depth and corresponding temperature stratification: in shallow, unstratified waters, sharks either showed no pattern in changing depth or made reverse diel movements, spending the day in shallow water and descending at night. In deeper, stratified waters, the sharks performed a regular diel migration, spending the day below the thermocline and rising towards the surface at night.

5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the <b>porbeagle</b> is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic longline fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. <b>Porbeagle</b> catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic longline fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in <b>porbeagle</b> landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|R

500|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the <b>porbeagle</b> was authored by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et methodique des trois règnes de la nature, and based on an earlier 1769 account by Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant.

40|$|The <b>Porbeagle</b> Shark (Lamna nasus) is a {{remarkable}} fast, large shark that has adapted to cold waters in {{the northern and southern}} hemisphere through heat exchangers that keep its body warmer than surrounding waters. Its extensive range includes the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, South Pacific, South Indian, and Antarctic Oceans. Like other sharks, it is part of an ancient lineage stretching back more than 200 million years. Its evolutionary fine-tuning hasn’t protected it, however, from a literal feeding frenzy – by humans on sharks. The <b>Porbeagle</b> has suffered staggering declines as a result of fishing. In the Northeast Atlantic, European fishing fleets decimated this shark’s populations within a few decades, starting in the 1930 s. But what happened in the Northwest Atlantic was the eyeopener.

50|$|Seasonal migrations {{have been}} {{observed}} in <b>porbeagles</b> from both hemispheres. In the western North Atlantic, much of the population spends the spring in the deep waters of the Nova Scotia continental shelf, and migrates north a distance of 500 - 1000 km to spend late summer and fall in the shallow waters of the Newfoundland Grand Banks and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. In December, large mature females migrate south over 2000 km into the Sargasso Sea for pupping, keeping deeper than 600 m {{during the day and}} 200 m at night so as to stay in the cooler waters beneath the Gulf Stream. In the eastern North Atlantic, <b>porbeagles</b> are believed to spend spring and summer in shallow continental shelf waters, and disperse northwards to overwinter in deeper waters offshore.

50|$|Shark meat is a seafood {{consisting}} of the flesh of sharks. Its consumption by humans has been mentioned since fourth century AD literature. Several sharks are fished for human consumption, such as <b>porbeagles,</b> shortfin mako shark, requiem shark, and thresher shark, among others. Shark meat is popular in Asia, where it is often consumed dried, smoked, or salted. Shark meat is consumed regularly in Japan, India, Sri Lanka, areas of Africa and Mexico.
