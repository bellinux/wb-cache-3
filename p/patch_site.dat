40|$|Satellite {{remote sensing}} {{estimates}} of surface chlorophyll, temperature, wind speed, and sea ice cover are {{examined in the}} region of the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX). Our objectives are to place SOFeX into a regional context and highlight regional mesoscale spatial and monthly temporal variability. SOFeX fertilized two patches with iron, one south of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) and one north of the PF but south of the Subantarctic Front (SAF). Satellite-observable phytoplankton blooms developed in both patches. The spring sea ice retreat near the south <b>patch</b> <b>site</b> was delayed in the 2001 – 2002 season, in turn delaying the naturally occurring, modest spring bloom in this region. Ambient surface chlorophyll concentrations for the area surrounding the southern patch during January 2002 are low (mean 0. 26 mg/m 3) compared with climatological January values (0. 42 mg/m 3). Regions east and west at similar latitudes exhibited higher mean chlorophyll concentrations (0. 79 and 0. 74 mg/m 3, respectively). These modest phytoplankton blooms were likely stimulated by melting sea ice via changes in the light-mixing regime and release of iron and were smaller in magnitude than the iron-induced bloom within the SOFeX southern patch (> 3 mg/m 3). Iron inputs from melting ice may drive much of the natural spatial and temporal variability within the seasonal ice zone. Mean chlorophyll concentrations surrounding the SOFeX northern <b>patch</b> <b>site</b> were similar to climatological values during the SOFeX season. The northern patch was stretched into a long, thin filament along the southern boundary of the SAF, likely increasing the mixing/dilution rate with surrounding waters...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{relationships}} between {{movements of the}} meadow brown butterfly (Maniola jurtina) and landscape features were examined at different scales in three hedgerow network landscapes of western France. Of the 4174 and 1474 individuals marked in the three landscapes in 1998 and 1999 respectively, a total of 1057 and 285 were recaptured at least once. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to model the number of butterflies moving between herbaceous patches within the landscape. The model predictors were related to (i) the distance separating the patches, (ii) {{the characteristics of the}} landscape between the patches and (iii) the characteristics of the departure and arrival patches, including the number of individuals marked in each <b>patch.</b> <b>Site</b> effects were tested by fitting separate models on each site and scale effects were tested by varying the extent of the windows in which landscape variables were extracted. The fits yielded models with R 2 values ranging from 0. 22 to 0. 64. Whatever the site, the distance between both patches and the number of individuals marked in the departure patch, exhibited significant and consistent effects on butterfly movements. Mean field size and direction of green network elements (hedges, field margins) were also relevant in some cases...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Randomised double blind placebo controlled parallel group study with one year of follow up. SETTING [...] 30 general practices in 15 English counties. SUBJECTS [...] 600 dependent heavy smokers (> or = 15 cigarettes daily) who were well motivated to give up. INTERVENTIONS [...] Brief general practitioner advice, booklet, and 16 hours per day patch treatment for 18 weeks with brief support and follow up at one, three, six, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Self reported complete abstinence for up to one year with biochemical validation at all follow up points. RESULTS [...] Nicotine patches reduced the severity of craving and adverse mood changes in the first weeks of withdrawal and doubled the rate of initial cessation at week 3 (nicotine group 36 % of patients (144 / 400), placebo group 16. 5 % of patients (33 / 200)) and of continuous abstinence throughout one year (nicotine group 9. 3 % (37), placebo group 5. 0 % (10)). A dose increase at week 1 among patients experiencing difficulty in quitting increased the proportion who achieved abstinence at week 3. There were no adverse systemic effects attributable to nicotine, but the incidence of moderate or severe local irritation or itching at the <b>patch</b> <b>site</b> was 16. 4 % (63 patients), compared with 3. 8 % (seven) with placebo. CONCLUSION [...] Transdermal nicotine patches used as an adjunct to brief advice and support in a general practice setting are an effective aid to long term cessation of smoking in highly dependent smokers...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the {{histology}} of allergic contact dermatitis reactions to potent allergens in guinea pigs and humans have indicated that there is significant tissue infiltration with basophilic leukocytes. In this study we determined whether this histologic finding could be of value in distinguishing weak sensitization reactions from primary irritation, thereby aiding in the predictive identification of weak or moderate contact allergens. Guinea pigs were sensitized by the Buehler test method. Skin reactions were graded 24, 48, and 72 h post-challenge with duplicate <b>patch</b> <b>sites</b> biopsied at the 24 - or 72 -h grading timepoints.

MemoPatch® is an electronic skin patch intended to deliver discreet tactile medication reminder stimuli. This study aimed 1) to evaluate, within an experimental setup, the detectability and acceptability of fifteen continuous bipolar pulse signals; 2) to identify variables, if any, associated with differential perception of the candidate reminder signals; and 3) to collect safety data as reported by subjects or observed by staff. Methods: This was a laboratory experiment involving 147 healthy adult volunteers (55. 1 % female, 98. 0 % Caucasian, with age 41. 8 ± 16. 0 years, body mass index [BMI] 24. 7 ± 4. 4, upper body adiposity 28. 5 %± 8. 3 % body fat, and skin impedance 367. 6 ± 140. 8 Ω) and using an experimental version of the MemoPatch®. Following four training signals administered in fixed order, subjects were exposed to a set of fifteen randomly sequenced signals varying in rise and fall time, width, and current, to be rated in terms of detectability ("too weak", "appropriate", or "too strong") and acceptability. Results: Ratings of "appropriate" were virtually independent of such variables as sex, BMI, upper body adiposity, and skin impedance at the patch location. Five signals were rated as "appropriate" by ≥ 67 % of subjects and acceptable by ≥ 95 % of subjects, virtually independently of the indicators of interest, and were retained as candidate signals for use in next stages of development and commercialization. Nine adverse events, none serious, were observed in six subjects. Conclusion: This study yielded five effective and safe candidate signals for potential use in the MemoPatch® device, all equally considered to be of appropriate detectability and high acceptability, in an experimental context. The signals were independent from, and therefore highly robust relative to, sex, BMI, upper body adiposity, and skin impedance at the <b>patch</b> <b>site,</b> lending additional generalizability to the signals and hence their potential relevance to broad commercial application.

Analysis of pan mutants via acriflavine and high concentration propidium iodide staining showed misoriented divisions but no problems with cell plate completion. PAN 2 and BRK 1 are required for PAN 1 recruitment to SMC <b>patch</b> <b>sites</b> but they are not cell plate localized and observation of PAN 1 -YFP in pan 2 and brk 1 mutants revealed that both are not required for PAN 1 recruitment to the cell plate.

Clonal diversities of differently sized patches of E. atherica were investigated on two lower salt-marsh sites of different age, 25 years and 35 years, respectively.

It is reasoned that different environmental conditions could have resulted in different clonal structures: On an older marsh, the increase of successful seedling recruitment, due to more suitable environmental conditions, leads to an increase in clonal diversity.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cylindrical}} outer {{hair cell}} (OHC) of Corti’s organ drives cochlear amplification by a voltage-dependent {{activation of the}} molecular motor, prestin (SLC 26 a 5), in the cell’s lateral membrane. The voltage-dependent nature of this process leads to the troublesome observation that the membrane resistor-capacitor filter could limit high-frequency acoustic activation of the motor. Based on cable theory, the unique 30  nm width compartment (the extracisternal space, ECS) formed between the cell’s lateral membrane and adjacent subsurface cisternae (SSC) could further limit the influence of receptor currents on lateral membrane voltage. Here, we use dual perforated/whole-cell and loose patch clamp on isolated OHCs to sequentially record currents resulting from excitation at apical, middle, and basal loose <b>patch</b> <b>sites</b> before and after perforated patch rupture. We find that timing of currents is fast and uniform before whole-cell pipette washout, suggesting little voltage attenuation {{along the length of}} the lateral membrane. Prior treatment with salicylate, a disrupter of the SSC, confirms the influence of the SSC on current spread. Finally, a cable model of the OHC, which can match our data, indicates that the SSC poses a minimal barrier to current flow across it, thereby facilitating rapid delivery of voltage excitation to the prestin-embedded lateral membrane...|$|R

However, the primary sites of action {{for each of the}} yeast synaptojanin-like proteins remain unclear. In this study, we show that Sjl 2 is localized to cortical actin <b>patches,</b> <b>sites</b> of endocytosis. Cortical recruitment of Sjl 2 requires the actin patch component Abp 1. Consistent with this, the SH 3 domain-containing protein Abp 1 physically associates with Sjl 2 through its proline-rich domain. Furthermore, abp 1 Δ mutations confer defects resembling loss of SJL 2; sjl 1 Δ abp 1 Δ double-mutant cells exhibit invaginated plasma membranes and impaired endocytosis, findings similar to those for sjl 1 Δ sjl 2 Δ mutant cells. Thus, Abp 1 acts as an adaptor protein in the localization or concentration of Sjl 2 during late stages of endocytic vesicle formation. Overexpression of the Hip 1 -related protein Sla 2 delayed the formation of extended plasma membrane invaginations in sjl 2 ts cells, indicating that Sla 2 may become limiting or misregulated in cells with impaired PI phosphatase activity. Consistent with this, the cortical actin patch protein Sla 2 is mislocalized in sjl 1 Δ sjl 2 Δ mutant cells.

This AR has a sigmoid-like global shape and undergoes transient brightenings in both soft X-rays and transition region (TR) lines. We compute a magneto- hydrostatic model of the AR magnetic field, using as boundary condition the photospheric {{observations of}} SOHO/MDI. The computed large-scale magnetic field lines show that the large- scale sigmoid is formed by two sets of coronal loops. Shorter loops, associated with the core of the SXT emission, coincide with the loops observed in the hotter CDS lines. These loops reveal a gradient of temperature, from 2 MK at the top to 1 MK at the ends. The field lines most closely matching these hot loops extend along the quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) of the computed coronal field. The TR brightenings observed with SOHO/CDS can also be associated with the magnetic field topology, both QSL intersections with the photosphere, and places where separatrices issuing from bald <b>patches</b> (<b>sites</b> where field lines coming from the corona are tangent to the photosphere) intersect the photosphere. There are, furthermore, suggestions that the element abundances measured in the TR may depend on the type of topological structure present. Typically, the TR brightenings associated with QSLs have coronal abundances, while those associated with BP separatrices have abundances closer to photospheric values. We suggest that this difference is due to the location and manner in which magnetic reconnection occurs in two different topological structures...|$|R

Seascape metrics were quantified at multiple spatial scales using a combination of spatial image analysis and in situ surveys at 87 <b>patch</b> reef <b>sites</b> in Glover’s Reef Lagoon, Belize, within and outside a marine reserve enforced since 1998. <b>Patch</b> reef <b>sites</b> were then clustered into classes sharing similar seascape attributes using metrics that correlated significantly to observed variations in both fish and coral communities. When the efficacy of the marine reserve was assessed without including landscape attributes, no reserve effects were detected in the diversity and abundance of fish and coral communities, despite 10 years of management protection. However, grouping sites based on landscape attributes revealed significant reserve effects between site classes. Fish had higher total biomass (1. 56) and commercially important biomass (1. 756) inside the reserve and coral cover was 1. 8 times greater inside the reserve, though direction and degree of response varied by seascape class. Our findings show that the application of a landscape classification approach vastly improves our ability to evaluate the efficacy of marine reserves by controlling for confoundin...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{consequences}} of oxidative stress in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis, we compared the iron level, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, total iron binding capacity, the percentage saturation of iron-binding capacity, the amount of diene conjugates {{as well as the}} amounts of total glutathione, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione, and the oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione ratio in skin homogenate from lesional and nonlesional skin. Lesional skin samples were obtained from positive <b>patch</b> test <b>sites</b> to 5 % NiSO 4 in five subjects, and from chronic contact dermatitis lesions on the hands, which had exacerbated over 3 – 9 wk in six subjects. Contact dermatitis caused at least a 4 -fold increase in the iron level in the lesional skin area compared with the nonlesional skin area (p < 0. 02). The increase in the iron level depended on the duration of contact dermatitis and was accompanied by high unsaturated iron-binding capacity and total iron-binding capacity values in the positive <b>patch</b> test <b>sites</b> (p < 0. 05), and by a high percentage saturation value in the chronic contact dermatitis lesions (p < 0. 05). We found high indices for iron, total iron-binding capacity and diene conjugates in the apparently healthy skin of the patients with persistent contact dermatitis that significantly (p < 0. 05) exceeded the corresponding values in the patients with only patch test reactions. In summary, we have succeeded in providing evidence that generalized oxidative damage of the skin occurs as a consequence of contact dermatitis in a restricted area...|$|R
40|$|Patch clamping, {{the gold}} {{standard}} for ion channel studies, is entirely dependent on formation of a high resistance seal between cell membrane and patching site,known as gigaseal. As this process is laborious and time consuming, there have been many attempts to develop automated high throughput chip-based patch clamping devices. In spite of recent advances, these devices still cannot form gigaseals relying instead on less tight seals that impede their ability to measure the pA ionic currents passing through single ion channels. Progress is presently limited {{due to a lack of}} understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying gigaseal formation. In all forms of patch clamping access to the cell is achieved via a small aperture. Here, we systematically examine the inﬂuence of aperture size, micropipette rim morphology, and surface roughness on gigaseal formation in conventional patch clamping using micro/nanofabrication and modelling techniques. Our results show that smaller aperture sizes lead to improved seal formation within a range of x-y. For aperture sizes out of this range, either bigger or smaller, gigaseal formation is very difﬁcult if not impossible. While in the literature the surface quality of <b>patching</b> <b>sites</b> is only described by average surface roughness, this research reveals that parameters such as: developed interfacial area ratio, valley void volume of the surface, ratio of core void volume to core material volume, and maximum peak to valley distance play more important roles in seal formation. Furthermore,these parameters are size dependent; as a result glass micropipettes with smaller aperture sizes are ﬂatter and have lower water retentionability resulting in better seals. Results of this work support the practical knowledge that pipettes having smaller apertures form better seals...|$|R
