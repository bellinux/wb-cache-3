2500|$|The German {{industrial}} area of Schwarze <b>Pumpe,</b> about [...] {{south of the}} city of Spremberg, is home to the world's first demonstration CCS coal plant, the Schwarze <b>Pumpe</b> power station. The mini pilot plant is run by an Alstom-built oxy-fuel boiler and is also equipped with a flue gas cleaning facility to remove fly ash and sulphur dioxide. The Swedish company Vattenfall AB invested some €70million in the two-year project, which began operation September 9, 2008. The power plant, which is rated at 30 megawatts, is a pilot project to serve as a prototype for future full-scale power plants. 240 tonnes a day of [...] are being trucked [...] where it will be injected into an empty gas field. Germany's BUND group called it a [...] "fig leaf". For each tonne of coal burned, 3.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide is produced. The CCS program at Schwarze <b>Pumpe</b> ended in 2014 due to inviable costs and energy use.|$|E
2500|$|An {{integrated}} pilot-scale CCS {{power plant}} {{was to begin}} operating in September 2008 in the eastern German power plant Schwarze <b>Pumpe</b> run by utility Vattenfall, to test the technological feasibility and economic efficiency. CCS applied to a modern conventional power plant could reduce [...] emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80–90% compared to a plant without CCS. The IPCC estimates that the economic potential of CCS could be between 10% and 55% of the total carbon mitigation effort until year 2100.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{example of}} a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture {{technology}} is Swedish company Vattenfall's Schwarze <b>Pumpe</b> power station located in Spremberg, Germany, built by German firm Siemens, which went on-line in September 2008. The facility captures CO2 and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO2 into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO2 into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered {{not to be a}} final solution for CO2 reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical. In 2014 [...] research and development were discontinued due to high costs making the technology unviable.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} water quality {{variation}} of Fuchou constructed wetland in Monsoon Season. Fuchou constructed wetland locates downstream of Tahan river, a turbitary of Tan Shau River. The wetland is between Fuchou bridge and Chenlin bridge with the area of 15 hectares, in which water coveres 8. 5 hectares. The treatment capacity is 11, 000 CMD and the water source <b>pumpes</b> from Taan channel, which the 90 % of water belongs to house waste water. Four parts is included in this wetland as: open area, densed planting plot Ⅰ, densed planting plot Ⅱ,and ecological pool. The average contents of containments in May, 2007, for BOD 5 concentration from the inflow of 21 mg/l decreases to the outflow of 10 mg/l, with pollutant reduction reaching 52. 4 %; for SS from the. inflow of 38 mg/l increases to the outflow of 46 mg/l, with pollutant reduction of - 21. 2 %; for NH 3 -N from the inflow of 13 mg/l decreases to outflow of 8. 4 mg/l, with pollutant reduction of 35. 4 %; and for TP from the inflow of 1. 7 mg/l decreases to outflow of 0. 91 mg/l, with pollutant reduction of 46. 5 %. The cases in June are from 31 mg/l to 16 mg/l, from 48 mg/l to 40 mg/l, from 6. 9 mg/l to 2. 1 mg/l, and from 1. 1 mg/l to 0. 28 mg/l; for BOD 5, SS, NH 3 -N, and TP, respectively, with the pollutant reductions are 48. 4 %, 16. 7 %, 69. 6 %, and 74. 5 % accordingly. The superior of pollutant reduction in June to the May, indicates significantly the growth effect of the aquatic plants inside wetland while the negative value of SS reduction in May; indicates the inferior temperature environment for aguatic plants. 本研究探討 2006 年 12 月完工的浮洲人工濕地，在 2007 年梅雨期間水質淨化效果變化情形。浮洲人工濕地位於淡水河系大漢溪下游，介於浮洲橋與城林橋之間，基地總面積 13 公頃，水域面積占 8. 5 公頃，設計處理水量 11, 000 CMD，入流來源為土城抽水站抽自大安圳，大安圳約有 90 ％的生活污水。溼地主要分為四部分：開放水域、密植區Ⅰ、密植區Ⅱ及生態池，透過水體及底泥環境中的物理性、化學性及生物性處理機制進行水質淨化。 對平均值而言， 2007 年 5 月生化需氧量（BOD 5 ）流入濃度 21 mg/L，出流濃度降至 10 mg/L，污染去除率為 52. 4 %；懸浮固體物(SS) 流入濃度 38 mg/L，出流濃度反升至 46 mg/L，污染去除率為- 21. 2 %；氨氮（NH 3 -N）流入濃度 13 mg/L，出流濃度降至 8. 4 mg/L，污染去除率為 35. 4 %；總磷酸鹽（TP）流入濃度 1. 7 mg/L，出流濃度降至 0. 91 mg/L，污染去除率為 46. 5 %。 6 月BOD 5 、SS、NH 3 -N及TP分別為 31 mg/L降至 16 mg/L， 48 mg/L降至 40 mg/L， 6. 9 mg/L降至 2. 1 mg/L， 1. 1 mg/L降至 0. 28 mg/L。污染去除率分別為 48. 4 %、 16. 7 %、 69. 6 %及 74. 5 %。 比較前述 5 / 16 與 6 / 21 兩日取樣所得污染去除率雖有差異， 6 / 21 之各項污染移除總量均較 5 / 16 呈正成長。應是水生植生數量增多影響。 5 / 16 SS去除率所以呈負值的原因，應是濕地在 5 月間低溫期植生發育可能未臻成熟或當時該溼地覆水率低所致。目 錄 內容. 頁碼 中文摘要…………………………………………………………Ι 英文摘要…………………………………………………………Ⅱ 目錄………………………………………………………………Ⅲ 表目錄……………………………………………………………Ⅵ 圖目錄……………………………………… [...] . ……………….

50|$|The <b>Pumpe</b> Düse {{design was}} a {{reaction}} to the development of high-pressure common rail fuel injection systems by competitors - an attempt by Volkswagen Group to create an in-house technology of comparable performance that would not require any royalties to be paid. While <b>Pumpe</b> Düse engines had a significantly higher injection pressure than older engines, they are slightly less refined when compared to the very latest common rail and, with the original solenoid-operated unit injectors, were not able to control injection timing as precisely (a major factor in improving emissions). Some current PD TDI engines now use piezoelectric unit injectors, allowing far greater control of injection timing and fuel delivery.|$|E

50|$|While part of East Germany, {{employment}} in Hoyerswerda {{was provided by}} a power plant, glassworks, coal mines, and an army artillery range. With the reunification of Germany and the subsequent demise of a centrally-planned economy, the city lost many jobs as the glassworks and artillery range were closed, and the power plant reduced its payroll. The industries on the secondary sector disappeared nearly completely. It is, however, expected that new houses must be built in Hoyerswerda, because of an anticipated increase in population due to copper mining at Schwarze <b>Pumpe.</b> There is also a thermal power plant planned for Hoyerswerda, because the district heating contract with Schwarze <b>Pumpe</b> will end in 2016.|$|E

The engine management system employed by this engine is the PLD (<b>Pumpe</b> Leitung Duese-German abbr) which incorporates single plug-in pumps for each cylinder supplying fuel under pressure (up to 1,600 bar) to the injection valves. A control unit MR monitors all engine operating conditions via several sensors and varies the injection pressure to suit each operating condition.|$|E

If its early years the company provided town gas produced from lignite, with the beginning of Russian gas deliveries in May 1973 it switched to gas import, transportation and storage. Verbundnetz Gas AG was created as an independent company on 29 June 1990.
