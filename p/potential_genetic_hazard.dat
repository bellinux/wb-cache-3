40|$|The <b>potential</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>hazard</b> of {{pesticides}} to humans {{is of great}} concern, in particular in occupational and environmental settings because of their widespread use for domestic and industrial applications. In the present study the genotoxic potentials of commonly applied pesticides have been evaluated using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). This method was used to quantify the level of DNA damage in lymphocytes of farmers who were occupationally exposed to pesticides. Particularly, we measured the amount of DNA damage in isolated human peripheral lymphocytes from agricultural workers from Spain, Hungary, Poland and Greece in comparison to healthy men from the same areas who had no previous occupational exposure to pesticides. All results indicated {{no statistically significant differences}} in basal DNA damage between our study groups. In addition, exposure of peripheral blood lymphocytes to hydrogen peroxide or γ-irradiation led to a similar degree of additional DNA damage and subsequent repair for all our studied populations. In conclusion the greenhouse workers who participated in this study had no detectable increased DNA damage or alteration in their cellular response to DNA damage from our control populations. ©PHARMAKON-Press...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to gather {{information}} on the <b>potential</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>hazards</b> of existing or proposed energy-generating or -conversion systems, we have begun a correlated analytical and genetic analysis {{of a number of}} technologies. The work is divided into two phases: one deals with known compounds expected to occur in the environment through energy production, conversion, or use; the other deals with actual samples from existing or experimental processes. To approach the problems of coping with and testing large numbers of compounds, we set up a form of the “tier system. ” Operating units utilizing Salmonella, Escherichia coli, yeast, human leukocytes, mammalian cells, and Drosophila have been initiated. Various liquid-liquid extraction methods and column chromatographic separations have been applied to crude products and effluents from oil-shale, coal-liquefaction, and coal-gasification processes. Mutagenicity of the various fractions is assayed by means of reversion of histidine-requiring auxotrophs of Salmonella typhimurium; comparative studies are carried out with the other genetic systems. In order to incorporate metabolic activation of these fractions and compounds, rat liver homogenates (S- 9) are used in the various assays. Results implicate chemicals occurring in the basic (ether-soluble) and the neutral fractions as <b>potential</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>hazards.</b> Chemical constituents of these fractions (identified or predicted) were tested individually for their mutagenic activity...|$|R

We specially designed a multi-gene panel that could simultaneously test known large indels in addition to ordinary variants, and reported the diagnostic yield in patients with intrahepatic cholestasis. The panel contains 61 genes associated with cholestasis and 25 known recurrent large indels. The amplicon library was sequenced on Ion PGM system. Sequencing {{data were analyzed using}} a routine data analysis protocol and an internal program encoded for large indels test simultaneously. The validation phase was performed using 54 patients with known genetic diagnosis, including 5 with large insertions. At implement phase, 141 patients with intrahepatic cholestasis were evaluated. At validation phase, 99. 6 % of the variations identified by Sanger sequencing could be detected by panel sequencing. Following the routine protocol, 99. 8 % of false positives could be filtered and 98. 8 % of retained variations were true positives. Large insertions in the 5 patients with known genetic diagnosis could be correctly detected using the internal program. At implementation phase, 96. 9 % of the retained variations, following the routine protocol, were confirmed to be true. Twenty-nine patients received a <b>potential</b> <b>genetic</b> diagnosis when panel sequencing data were analyzed using the routine protocol. Two additional patients, who were found to harbor large insertions in SLC 25 A 13, obtained a <b>potential</b> <b>genetic</b> diagnosis when sequencing data were further analyzed using the internal program.

40|$|The {{detection}} {{of changes in}} germline mutation rate in human populations remains extremely difficult. Estimating the <b>genetic</b> <b>hazards</b> of radiation and other mutagens in humans therefore depends on extrapolation from experimental systems. Because of the very low frequency of spontaneous mutation at most loci, enormous samples are required to detect increases of mutation rate. A very high rate of spontaneous germline mutation altering the length of minisatellite loci {{has been found in}} human populations and therefore this system might be useful for detecting induced mutations in relatively small samples.

40|$|Estimation of the <b>genetic</b> <b>hazards</b> of {{ionizing}} radiation in men is {{based largely on}} the frequency of transmitted specific-locus mutations induced in mouse spermatogonial stem cells at low radiation dose rates. The publication of new data on this subject has permitted a fresh review of all the information available. The data continue to show no discrepancy from the interpretation that, although mutation frequency decreases markedly as dose rate is decreased from 90 to 0. 8 R/min (1 R = 2. 6 x 10 (- 4) coulombs/kg) {{there seems to be}} no further change below 0. 8 R/min over the range from that dose rate of 0. 0007 R/min. Simple mathematical models are used to compute: (a) a maximum likelihood estimate of the induced mutation frequency at the low dose rates, and (b) a maximum likelihood estimate of the ratio of this to the mutation frequency at high dose rates in the range of 72 to 90 R/min. In the application of these results to the estimation of <b>genetic</b> <b>hazards</b> of radiation in man, the former value can be used to calculate a doubling dose [...] i. e, the dose of radiation that induces a mutation frequency equal to the spontaneous frequency. The doubling dose based on the low-dose-rate data compiled here is 110 R. The ratio of the mutation frequency at low dose rate to that at high dose rate is useful when it becomes necessary to extrapolate from experimental determinations, or from human data, at high dose rates to the expected risk at low dose rates. The ratio derived from the present analysis is 0. 33...|$|R

We then performed quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis on a subset of the candidate genes in blood samples from an independent cohort of 23 Huntington’s disease patients and 23 healthy controls.

40|$|It is a {{difficult}} task to improve animal production by means of genetic selection, if the environment does not allow full expression of the animal’s <b>genetic</b> <b>potential.</b> This concept {{may well be the}} future for animal welfare, because it highlights the need to incorporate traits related to production and robustness, simultaneously, to reach sustainable breeding goals. This review explores the identification of <b>potential</b> <b>genetic</b> markers for robustness within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), since this axis plays a vital role in the stress response.
