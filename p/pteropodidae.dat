25|$|The hammer-headed bat is {{a member}} of the family <b>Pteropodidae.</b> <b>Pteropodidae</b> is divided into two subfamilies, Macroglossinae which {{contains}} six genera, and Pteropodinae containing thirty-six genera including Hypsignathus. The family <b>Pteropodidae</b> is found within the suborder, Megachiroptera. This group is commonly referred to as the megabats or flying foxes.|$|E
25|$|Megabats make up {{the only}} family (<b>Pteropodidae)</b> in order Chiroptera that is not capable of {{laryngeal}} echolocation. Echolocation and flight evolved early in the lineage of chiropterans. Although echolocation was later lost in family <b>Pteropodidae,</b> bats in the genus Rousettus are capable of primitive echolocation through clicking their tongue, and some species {{have been shown to}} create clicks similar to those of echolocating bats using their wings.|$|E

25|$|The large {{flying fox}} (Pteropus vampyrus), {{also known as}} the greater flying fox, Malayan flying fox, Malaysian flying fox, large fruit bat, kalang or kalong, is a {{southeast}} Asian species of megabat in the family <b>Pteropodidae.</b> Like {{the other members of the}} genus Pteropus, or the Old World fruit bats, it feeds exclusively on fruits, nectar and flowers (despite its scientific name). It is noted for being one of the largest bats. As with nearly all other Old World fruit bats, it lacks the ability to echolocate but compensates for it with well-developed eyesight.|$|E
25|$|The bats of New Guinea are a {{very diverse}} group, {{comprising}} six families, and 29 genera. The six families are: <b>Pteropodidae,</b> Emballonuridae, Hipposideridae, Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae and Molossidae. Bats migrated to New Guinea on many different occasions, with many species being shared with Australia, the Sunda Islands and even mainland Asia. The megabats, or Megachiropterans, of New Guinea are highly adapted, and many are endemic to New Guinea and surrounding islands. While most megabats are herbivorous, and eat fruit, nectar and flowers, some species within New Guinea have adapted to also eat insects whilst in flight; an ecological niche usually filled by microbats. Some species also forage on the ground, an adaptation not seen in areas with large predators.|$|E
500|$|The 2011 {{classification}} of bats (which {{does not include}} Nycteridae as a separate family, nor the grouping of the Rhinolophoidea families and <b>Pteropodidae</b> into the Yinpterochiroptera) is: ...|$|E
500|$|Genetic {{evidence}} indicates that megabats originated during the early Eocene and should be placed within the four major lines of microbats. Consequently, two new suborders based on molecular data have been proposed. The new suborder of Yinpterochiroptera includes the <b>Pteropodidae,</b> or megabat family, {{as well as the}} families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Craseonycteridae, Megadermatidae, and Rhinopomatidae The other new suborder, Yangochiroptera, includes all of the remaining families of bats (all of which use laryngeal echolocation), a conclusion supported by a 15-base-pair deletion in BRCA1 and a seven-base-pair deletion in PLCB4 present in all Yangochiroptera and absent in all Yinpterochiroptera. One phylogenomic study [...] showed that the two new proposed suborders were supported by analyses of thousands of genes.|$|E
500|$|The {{molecular}} phylogeny of the Chiroptera is controversial, as {{it points to}} a microbat paraphyly, which implies that some seemingly unlikely transformations occurred. The first is that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in bats, once in Yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids. The second is that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, was subsequently lost in the family <b>Pteropodidae</b> (all megabats), and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus Rousettus. Analyses of the sequence of the [...] "vocalization" [...] gene, FoxP2, were inconclusive as to whether laryngeal echolocation was secondarily lost in the pteropodids or independently gained in the echolocating lineages. However, analyses of the [...] "hearing" [...] gene, Prestin, seemed to favor the idea that echolocation developed independently at least twice, rather than there being a secondary loss in the pteropodids.|$|E

2500|$|Megabats {{constitute}} the suborder Megachiroptera, and its only family <b>Pteropodidae</b> {{of the order}} Chiroptera (bats). They are also called fruit bats, Old World fruit bats, or, especially the genera Acerodon and Pteropus, flying foxes. [...] Megabats are {{not found in the}} Americas, Western Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Australia. Compared to insectivorous bats, fruit bats are relatively large and, with some exceptions, do not navigate by echolocation. They are herbivores and rely on their keen senses of sight and smell to locate food.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{horseshoe}} bats {{have traditionally}} {{been included in the}} suborder Microchiroptera ("microbats"), genetic evidence suggests they and a few other microbat families are more closely related to <b>Pteropodidae,</b> the only family of [...] "megabats" [...] (Megachiroptera). Therefore, <b>Pteropodidae,</b> horseshoe bats, and related families are now placed in a single suborder, called Yinpterochiroptera or Pteropodiformes.|$|E
