40|$|The new {{filling system}} is smooth filling without gas gap. It works well in {{avoiding}} {{the generation of}} defects such as porosity and inclusion. The <b>pouring</b> <b>basin,</b> sprue, runner and {{the gate of the}} bolster casting were designed according to the principle of the new filling system. The filling and solidification process of the bolster casting were also simulated. It was found that the filling process was smooth, and air entrapment and shrinkage were avoided. Finally, a further validation of the new filling system of bolster casting was carried out in a foundry...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on knocking out temperature of CuSn 10, CuSn 5 Zn 5 Pb 5 and AlSi 11 castings vacuum prepared in gypsum moulds. The experimental castings were prepared {{in form of}} rings of diameters ø 30, 20 and 10 mm, width 10 mm and wall thickness g= 0, 6; 0, 8; 1, 0 and 2, 0 mm respectively. Casting temperatures were 1120 and 1200 for bronzes and 700 and 800 oC for silumin. The crack sensitivity of the rings was evaluated. It can be stated, {{on the base of}} the tests, that casting should be knocked out as soon as possible after <b>pouring</b> <b>basin</b> crystallizes. In case of tested castings the limiting dimensions of the rings are diameter ø 30 mm and and thickness g= 0, 8 for CuSn 10. Castings made of CuSn 5 Zn 5 Pb 5 and AlSi 11 do not reveal the crack sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify how the ingate system design {{influences}} the mould filling behaviour of aluminium melts in vertically parted vacuum-sealed moulds, some direct observation experiments have been made. A {{detailed study of}} how the design of each component in the ingate system affects the mould filling behaviour has been made. The effect of different designs on downsprue-runner connections, runners and end-wall of the runners {{as well as the}} effect of wall friction was investigated. The mould filling process was studied through a glass wall and recorded by a video camera. Still images from the videotape are presented and evaluated. The direct observation method {{has been found to be}} a very powerful way to follow the melt behaviour during mould filling. To ensure a good filling of the downsprue the melt level in the <b>pouring</b> <b>basin</b> has to be above a certain level from the time when the stopper is removed and during the whole filling sequence. A perpendicular connection between the downsprue and the runner gives a larger flow loss than a rounded type. Due to the larger flow loss the perpendicular connection results in an earlier filling of the downsprue. A tapered runner results in almost simultaneous filling of the specimens compared to a runner with no tapering. On the other hand the tapered runner gives a more divergent melt front which increase the free melt surfaces in contact with air. An additional pocket at the end of the runner has a beneficial effect on the mould filling. A sharp angled pocket is better than a more rounded type. Decreasing the wall thickness increases the flow loss due to wall friction, and causes more significant heat losses...|$|E
2500|$|The {{finished}} patterns can be hot {{glued to}} pre-made <b>pouring</b> <b>basins,</b> runners, and risers {{to form the}} final pattern. The pattern is then coated with a refractory material. The coated pattern (2) is placed in a flask and packed carefully with green sand (4) or a chemically bonded sand.|$|R
25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made <b>pouring</b> <b>basins,</b> runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|R
50|$|To {{the left}} of the Christogram is a jug of water <b>pouring</b> into a <b>basin,</b> to symbolise {{cleansing}} in a typical Jamaican way, and to the right is a pair of cupped hands, being “at once clasped in prayer and open for service”.|$|R
40|$|During the {{transient}} {{phase of}} filling a casting running system surface turbulence {{can cause the}} entrainment of oxide films into the bulk liquid. Research has shown that these are detrimental to the material’s integrity. Common mechanisms for this entrainment include returning waves, arising during filling of the runner bar, and plunging jets, found when <b>pouring</b> into a <b>basin.</b> One of these, the returning wave, has been studied in greater depth, using real-time X-ray and process modelling techniques alongside the application of physical principals. It has been concluded that when developed, returning waves cannot attain the more stable and less entraining tranquil flow regime desirable in the running system of castings...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, I {{decided to}} examine the {{emergence}} of Homo erectus in the Olduvai Gorge area that occurred about 1.8 million years ago. This {{is one of the}} most interesting and studied transitions in the hominin record, and it represents one of the most profound developments in human evolution as many consider Homo erectus to be the first true member of our own genus (Wood and Collard 1999). Even Wrangham (2009) focuses on the emergence of Homo erectus. He proposes that a population of Australopithecines achieved control of fire and were consistently eating cooked food by about 1.9 million years ago, leading to the emergence of Homo erectus (Wrangham 2009). If Wrangham is correct, and I am correct, then we should expect to see extensive lava flows <b>pouring</b> into internal <b>basins</b> in the Olduvai Gorge region at the time of this transition.|$|R
5000|$|The palaces of Moorish Spain, {{particularly}} the Alhambra in Granada, had famous fountains. The patio of the Sultan {{in the gardens}} of Generalife in Granada (1319) featured spouts of water <b>pouring</b> into a <b>basin,</b> with channels which irrigated orange and myrtle trees. The garden was modified over the centuries - the jets of water which cross the canal today were added in the 19th century.The fountain in the Court of the Lions of the Alhambra, built from 1362 to 1391, is a large vasque mounted on twelve stone statues of lions. Water spouts upward in the vasque and pours from the mouths of the lions, filling four channels dividing the courtyard into quadrants. [...] The basin dates to the 14th century, but the lions spouting water {{are believed to be}} older, dating to the 11th century.|$|R
60|$|Such a busy {{little woman}} as she was! So full of self-importance and {{trying so hard}} not to smile, or seem {{uncertain}} about anything! It was a perfect treat to Tom to see her with her brows knit, and her rosy lips pursed up, kneading away at the crust, rolling it out, cutting it up into strips, lining the basin with it, shaving it off fine round the rim, chopping up the steak into small pieces, raining down pepper and salt upon them, packing them into the <b>basin,</b> <b>pouring</b> in cold water for gravy, and never venturing to steal a look in his direction, lest her gravity should be disturbed; until, at last, the basin being quite full and only wanting the top crust, she clapped her hands all covered with paste and flour, at Tom, and burst out heartily into such a charming little laugh of triumph, that the pudding need have had no other seasoning to commend it to the taste of any reasonable man on earth.|$|R
