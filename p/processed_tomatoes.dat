5000|$|A machine-harvestable {{variety of}} tomato (the [...] "square tomato") was {{developed}} in the 1950s by University of California, Davis's Gordie C. Hanna, which, in combination with the development of a suitable harvester, revolutionized the tomato-growing industry. This type of tomato is grown commercially near plants that process and can tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. They are harvested when ripe and are flavorful when picked. They are harvested 24 hours a day, seven days a week during a 12- to 14-week season, and immediately transported to packing plants, which operate on the same schedule. California is a center of this sort of commercial tomato production and produces {{about a third of the}} <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes</b> produced in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Although not a {{universal}} mutation, many western {{interpretations of the}} dish add tomatoes to the sauce, thinning it slightly, enriching the flavour and deepening the red colour. This is especially common with ready made pour-over cooking sauces, {{such as those of}} the Patak brand, {{to the point where the}} dish may be considered tomato-based. This variation may instead have a similar origin to Tikka masala. Alternatively, this variation may instead be based on the Kashmiri practice of always cooking meat and tomatoes together whenever both are available, a mixture which may then have been used with the other ingredients to create a [...] "Tomatomeat" [...] Rogan Josh whose identity was then simplified in transit. The origin may also simply be a case of corner cutting, using relatively cheaper ingredients such as <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> which wouldn't be as easily noticed in a hot, red sauce, to bulk out an otherwise more expensive dish of lamb, spices and aromatic chilis.|$|E

5000|$|In both Southern and Northern Italy, {{large numbers}} of migrant workers from Africa and Asia produce {{agricultural}} goods within a context of severe social and environmental marginalization, lacking access to clean water, utilities, housing, and wage security while facing exposure to harsh working conditions and harmful pesticides. As of 2015, the Italian Association for Legal Studies on Immigration (ASGI) estimated that there were likely close to 500,000 regular and irregular foreign agricultural workers in Italy, of whom 100,000 {{were believed to be}} at risk of severe marginalization in regards to living conditions and social mobility. [...] According to a report by Amnesty International, there is [...] "a causal link between labour exploitation of migrant workers and the measures adopted by the Italian government with the stated view of controlling and regulating migration flows". The report focused on the Latina and the Caserta areas where {{large numbers of}} workers are of Indian (mostly Punjabi) and African origin respectively, the latter of whom are mostly from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. In Calabria, immigrant fruit pickers for the orange juice industry have been identified as subject to notably exploitative social conditions.While some migrant agricultural workers are paid well and welcomed as economic contributors for helping fill jobs that established Italians are often reluctant to perform, the average wage in Italy for migrant agricultural workers is only 33 dollars a day. In the Latina area alone, 61% of agricultural employers were found by Italian regulatory inspectors to be in contravention of social security and employment laws. In Caserta, migrant agricultural workers partake in the tomato, fruit, dairy, watermelon, and orange industries, often under exploitative or substandard employment conditions. In particular, the fast-growing and lucrative Italian tomato industry, which sources 60 percent of <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes</b> consumed in the UK and half the entire European Union supply, has been identified as a significant source of workplace abuse even though it produced a total export value of 1.5 billion Euros in 2014.

40|$|Several studies {{emphasize}} that agriculture and food {{as a whole}} {{are responsible for the}} increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, as a central actor in the food supply chain, consumers play a very important role as their food behaviour can be highly polluting. However, few studies focus on the environmental impact of consumer behaviour or investigate which action has the greatest consequences. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse consumer practices, from purchase to final waste. Fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes</b> were chosen as examples of general fruit and vegetables, and their environmental impact measured. Four impact categories were adopted: acidification, eutrophication, global warming and human toxicity. Results regarding fresh tomatoes clearly indicate that purchasing has the highest environmental impact for all 4 categories of impacts. Such an impact is mainly due to transport from supermarket to household (generally by car). Also in the case of <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes</b> purchasing is responsible for a great share of the impact, but cooking and end of life phases are also very important, namely for acidification and global warming the former, and human toxicity the latter. If we compare fresh tomatoes with <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> the latter have a greater impact in all 4 categories. GHG emissions at consumer level are 0. 07 kg CO 2 eq for fresh tomatoes and 0. 18 kg CO 2 eq for <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> while human toxicity levels are 25 times higher for the latter. However, if we take into consideration the fact that 6 kg of fresh tomatoes are needed for 1 kg of <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> the results can be seen in a different light.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyFood Science ProgramEdgar Chambers IVThree studies, using {{descriptive}} {{sensory analysis}} with highly trained panelists, {{were conducted to}} better understand the sensory characteristics of fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> A “green” note often has been described as part of tomato flavor and is noted in many fruits, vegetables, grains and processed products. Thus, the first study developed a sensory lexicon for green characteristics in foods. The lexicon, consisting of 17 sensory attributes, was used to characterize sensory properties of 22 chemicals potentially associated with green odor. Green characteristics can be differentiated as green-unripe, green-peapod, green-grassy/leafy, green-viney and green-fruity. Additional attributes that are important in various green characteristics included musty/earthy, pungent, bitter, sweet and floral. Various chemicals were described as green at different concentrations. Green-grassy/leafy was the most common characterizing green attribute of many of the chemicals studied. Changing the concentrations of the chemicals resulted not only in changing the intensity of the attributes, but it also altered the sensory profile of many of the chemicals. A sensory lexicon for describing tomatoes also was developed. A variety of fresh tomatoes, <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> and tomato-based products such as ketchup and pasta sauce were used to create the lexicon. The characteristics of tomatoes can be described using 33 aroma, flavor and texture attributes. Some characteristics were common across all or most fresh and <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> However, reducing the number of attributes may be possible for certain studies because some attributes were appropriate only for fresh or <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> not both. A third study determined the sensory characteristics of five tomato types, including newer and older cultivars that varied in their physical traits and primary use. The impacts of processing on the sensory quality of tomato products were investigated, with juice (minimal processing) and paste (higher level of processing) being made from the cultivars. Fresh tomatoes differed significantly because of cultivar and ripening stage differences. Fresh tomatoes differed considerably from <b>processed</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> A low processing level intensified some key aroma and flavor attributes, but differences in flavor attributed to cultivar became minimal after a higher degree of processing. Textural differences among cultivars after processing were more pronounced than flavor differences...|$|E

The ability to peel perfect tomatoes was significantly affected by exposure of tomatoes to temperatures greater than 100 F, by fruit weight and by pericarp wall thickness. The peelability of a normal population of tomatoes was influenced by tomato weight and width as well as degree-days and exposure to temperatures greater than 90 F.

Analogously, the different processing sites could be discriminated thanks to their characteristic phenolic fingerprint. The greatest differences identified were between conjugated forms of flavonoids, phenylpropanoids and lignans.
