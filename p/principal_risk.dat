The <b>principal</b> <b>risk</b> in reverse factoring is that the supplier gets trapped in a system where he cannot decide which invoices he need paid immediately or not, and therefore he becomes the victim of that system. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a collaborative platform that would permit the supplier to select which invoices they will be paid early, and when they will be paid.|$|E

40|$|In some pure {{moral hazard}} {{situations}} the principal can implement a first-best allocation using an incentive contract constructed {{on the basis}} of a first-best payment scheme. Such a contract relies on the possibility of discriminate actions according to the outcome by imposing a penalty whenever the observed outcome is lower than the admissible ones. The elimination of inefficient behavior depends basically on the outcome function, and we find that the fine is finite in the more interesting cases. The implementation of the first-best solution does not depend on the <b>principal's</b> <b>risk</b> neutrality. Nevertheless, when the <b>principal</b> is <b>risk</b> neutral, the ef f icient contract is dichotomous. Moreover, we prove that the efficient allocation can be reached through such a dichotomous payment scheme if and only if the <b>principal</b> is <b>risk</b> neutral for a certain range of returns. ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the height}} of the Republic's era of provincial {{expansion}} (roughly the 1st and 2nd centuries BCE {{until the end of the}} Republic) the Roman tax farming system was very profitable for the publicani. The right to collect taxes for a particular region would be auctioned every few years for a value that (in theory) approximated the tax available for collection in that region. The payment to Rome was treated as a loan and the publicani would receive interest on their payment at the end of the collection period. In addition, any excess (over their bid) tax collected would be pure profit for the publicani. The <b>principal</b> <b>risk</b> to the publicani was that the tax collected would be less than the sum bid.|$|E

Interest rate risk refers {{to the risk of}} the market value of a bond changing due to changes in the structure or level of interest rates or credit spreads or risk premiums. The credit risk of a high-yield bond refers to the probability and probable loss upon a credit event (i.e., the obligor defaults on scheduled payments or files for bankruptcy, or the bond is restructured), or a credit quality change is issued by a rating agency including Fitch, Moody's, or Standard & Poors.|$|E
5000|$|Some dissociatives {{can have}} CNS {{depressant}} effects, thereby carrying similar risks as opioids, which can slow breathing or heart rate to levels resulting in death (when using very high doses). DXM in higher doses can increase {{heart rate and}} blood pressure and still depress respiration. Inversely, PCP can have more unpredictable effects and has often been classified as a stimulant and a depressant in some texts along with being as a dissociative. While many have reported that they [...] "feel no pain" [...] while under the effects of PCP, DXM and Ketamine, this does not fall under the usual classification of anesthetics in recreational doses (anesthetic doses of DXM may be dangerous). Rather, true to their name, they process pain {{as a kind of}} [...] "far away" [...] sensation; pain, although present, becomes a disembodied experience and there is much less emotion associated with it. As for probably the most common dissociative, nitrous oxide, the <b>principal</b> <b>risk</b> seems to be due to oxygen deprivation. Injury from falling is also a danger, as nitrous oxide may cause sudden loss of consciousness, an effect of oxygen deprivation. Because of the high level of physical activity and relative imperviousness to pain induced by PCP, some deaths have been reported due to the release of myoglobin from ruptured muscle cells. High amounts of myoglobin can induce renal shutdown.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{determine}} the principal death causes in patients with severe preeclampsia/eclampsia and identify related risk factors. METHODS: a case-control study was performed comprising all cases of maternal death (n = 20) in patients with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (n = 2. 541). 80 controls (survivors) were randomly selected. The odds ratio and an estimate of maternal death relative risk were determined, and a multiple logistic regression analysis performed {{to determine}} the adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: the basic causes for death were: acute pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, hemorrhagic shock, pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, sepsis and three cases of undetermined causes of death. The <b>principal</b> <b>risk</b> factors were: age > 25 years old, multiparity, gestational age 110 mmHg, convulsions, chronic systemic arterial hypertension, HELLP syndrome, pulmonary edema, normally inserted abruptio placenta, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the supply chain risk management in the retail industry. The risen in level of risks in the supply chain and the increasing role of retailers in the supply chain have driven this research to be conducted. Four important objectives of this research are: to identify and categorise retail supply chain risks, to present which <b>principal</b> <b>risks</b> have been concerned by most retailers, to build the supply chain risk mitigation framework in the retail supply chain, and to discuss the role of retailers in mitigating supply chain risks. Methods used to achieve the objectives are: reviewing academic literatures, studying 60 UK retailers by collecting data from their annual reports, and use published case studies to gain a deeper insight of a particular topic. Retail supply chain risks have been categorised into three major dimensions: internal process risks, environmental risks, and relationship management <b>risks.</b> Furthermore, <b>principal</b> <b>risks</b> which have been concerned by most retailers will be presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to describe the risk identification within a supply chain of an infrastructure construction project. This research is based on a case study of risk management within a supply chain in the infrastructure construction industry. Data have been collected from an international company emphasising the stage of risk identification. A particular view of risk management has been adopted. More specifically, a way to identify risk within the construction industry has been given. Technical and operational evidences have been revised and organised in order to take a first step in the direction of a systematic treatment. It has highlighted some crucial issues dealing with risk identification, while risk assessment and risk response provide an opportunity for further research.
