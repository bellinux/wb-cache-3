50|$|Two {{trials in}} Northern Nigeria {{combined}} multiple rounds of MDA and insecticide spraying. The first trial, in Kankiya, included 11 rounds of MDA combined with 8 rounds of DDT indoor spraying. The study {{was based on}} computer-aided models that showed that MDA could eradicate malaria {{in the study area}} if combined with an appropriate ‘insecticide attack’. Following MDAs, parasite prevalence dropped from 19% to 1%. The investigators did not consider this a success because parasite prevalence increased again after the interventions were stopped. Entomological indices also showed only a temporary reduction in transmission, which was completely reversed after the control measures ceased. Because the investigators felt that the failure of the trial to interrupt transmission was due to operational inadequacies, they recommended a much larger and more sophisticated evaluation of insecticide spraying combined with MDA. This recommendation helped to launch the Garki project, also in Northern Nigeria, in 1969. In the Garki project, all 164 study villages in the catchment area were sprayed with <b>propoxur,</b> a residual insecticide. In addition, in 60 villages, MDA with sulfalene / pyrimethamine was given at 10-week intervals for two years. In two small village clusters, house spraying was supplemented with larvicide and MDA every two weeks. With biweekly MDA, parasite prevalence fell to 1% in the dry season and to 5% in the rainy season. MDA given every 10 weeks resulted in a parasite prevalence of 2% in the dry season and 28% in the rainy season. Transmission was not interrupted with either MDA regime. The authors concluded that spraying of residual insecticides and MDA did not result in a sustainable interruption of malaria transmission.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effects of diazinon and <b>propoxur</b> on liver and kidneys, following long term exposure of rabbits. Methods: Ten New Zealand white female rabbits were used. The animals were divided into 5 groups, consisting of 2 animals each. Diazinon (groups 1 and 2) and <b>propoxur</b> (groups 3 and 4) were administered at 2 different doses, and group 5 served as the control group. Histopathological lesions in the liver and kidneys, oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage were evaluated. Results: Both pesticides induced focal inflammation and fibrosis in the liver and kidneys. The low dose of <b>propoxur</b> induced a significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), with no difference in reduced glutathione (GSH), while the high dose of <b>propoxur</b> induced an increase in GSH with no change in TAC. For diazinon-exposed animals, the opposite findings were observed. Both diazinon and <b>propoxur</b> induced a statistically significant oxidative DNA damage in the liver and kidneys and a subsequent increase in telomerase activity in these tissues, possibly as a counteracting mechanism. Furthermore, systemic inflammation, as depicted by the dose-dependent increase in telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), was observed in <b>propoxur</b> treated animals.

In vivo studies were performed in rats and human volunteers, applying the test compound to the dorsal {{skin and the}} volar aspect of the forearm, respectively. In vitro experiments were carried out in static diffusion cells using viable full-thickness skin membranes (rat and human), non-viable epidermal membranes (rat and human) and a perfused-pig-ear model. Percutaneous penetration of <b>propoxur</b> in human volunteers was measured by analysis of its metabolite (2 -isopropoxyphenol) in blood and urine; in all other studies radiolabeled <b>propoxur</b> ([ring-U- 14 C]propoxur) was used. In order to allow for direct comparison, experimental conditions were standardized with respect to dose (150 μg <b>propoxur</b> per cm 2), vehicle (60 % aqueous ethanol) and exposure time (4 h). In human volunteers, {{it was found that}} approximately 6 % of the applied dose was excreted via the urine after 24 h, while the potential absorbed dose (amount applied minus amount washed off) was 23 μg/cm 2. In rats these values were 21 % and 88 μg/cm 2, respectively. Data obtained in vitro were almost always higher than those obtained in human volunteers. The most accurate in vitro prediction of the human in vivo percutaneous absorption of <b>propoxur</b> was obtained {{on the basis of the}} potential absorbed dose. The absorbed dose and the maximal flux in viable full-thickness skin membranes correlated reasonably well with the human in vivo situation (maximal overestimation by a factor of 3). Epidermal membranes overestimated the human in vivo data up to a factor of 8, but the species-differences observed in vivo were reflected correctly in this model. The data generated in the perfused-pig-ear model were generally intermediate between viable skin membranes and epidermal membranes. Chemicals/CAS: Insecticides; <b>Propoxur,</b> 114 - 26 -...|$|E
40|$|Recent field {{experiments}} {{demonstrated the}} possibility of using the sterile male method for the control of Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann, the most impor- tant vector of human malaria in Central America. Until now there was no practical method for excluding females from the releases of sterile males. A genetic method was developed for the preferential elimination of females during any of the four life stages. This genetic sexing system utilizes <b>propoxur</b> (o-isopropoxyphenyl methyl- carbamate) susceptibility as a recessive conditional lethal, a T(Y: 2 R) translocation, and an In(2 R) inversion. The <b>propoxur</b> resistance allele (dominant) was linked to the Y chromosome via a radiation-induced translocation, and genetic recombination was suppressed by inversions. In one of the strains produced, 99. 7 percent of the females are eliminated when treated with <b>propoxur,</b> without male loss...|$|E
40|$|Household {{pesticides}} are {{in general}} used continually {{in a closed}} room enabling the occurrence of its accumulation. This accumulation depends on several factors like the pesticide formulation, the route of its exposure into the body and theusers' behaviour. Mostly insecticide exposure comes into human body through inhalation and dermal absorption. Lifetime Average Daily Dose (LADD) of an insecticide is anestimate of the average of daily insecticide concentration exposed on the community in a lifetime. The risk of cancer arising from the accumulation of insecticide in human body can be estimated from this LADD. For <b>propoxur,</b> a risk value less than  1. 10 - 6 is not significant, a value of  1. 10 - 6 - 1. 10 - 4 is marginally significant and a risk value more than 1. 10 - 4 is significant in causing cancer. At present time in Indonesia still lack of evidence based data concerning the risk value of <b>propoxur</b> pesticide. To develop and implement policy {{on the use of}} sprayed <b>propoxur,</b> a study to determine <b>propoxur</b> exposure in household using sprayed insecticide in Jakarta,Bekasi and Depok had been carried out. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although pyrethroid-treated {{materials}} are a promising {{tool for the}} prevention and the control of dengue in the tropics, the development of pyrethroid resistance in the main mosquito vector (Aedes aegypti) may negate their use for personal and/or community protection. In that context, the efficacy of a mixture of a repellent (N,N-diethyl toluamide [DEET]) and a non-pyrethroid insecticide (<b>propoxur)</b> was investigated under laboratory conditions against both pyrethroid-susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes with the knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation. The results showed {{that a combination of}} <b>propoxur</b> and DEET induced a knockdown effect and mortality as high as deltamethrin (a standard pyrethroid) against the susceptible strain, and significantly higher efficacy against the pyrethroid-resistant strain. This could be explained mainly by the existence of a strong synergistic interaction between DEET and <b>propoxur</b> in mosquitoes. This study constitutes a first step towards an alternative strategy for improving mosquito control in areas with pyrethroid resistance...|$|E
40|$|Six {{insecticides}} {{were tested}} on southern pine beetle, Dendroclonus frontalis Zimmerman, to determine effects on established brood {{and ability to}} prevent attacks of Ips engraver beetles. The insecticides were: lindane as a reference; 2 carbamate insecticides, <b>propoxur</b> and carbaryl; and 3 organophosphates, acephate, phosmet, and diazinon. Only lindane significantly reduced established southern pine beetle broods. Phosmet caused high mortality of adult beetles within 24 hours after emergence from treated pines. Lindane, <b>propoxur,</b> and carbaryl were effective in preventing Ips grandicollis Eichoff and I. calligraphus Germar attacks on loblolly pine logs...|$|E
