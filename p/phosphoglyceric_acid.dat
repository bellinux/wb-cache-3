50|$|After WWII at late 1940 at the University of California, Berkeley, {{the details}} of {{photosynthetic}} carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques. The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in {{a fraction of a}} second in light resulted in a 3 carbon molecule called <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 u mole CO2/square metere.sec., with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants having the same photosynthetic capacities that were light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight. These rates were determined in potted plants grown indoors under low light intensity.|$|E

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} alanine are {{produced}} {{in the first few}} seconds of photosynthesis in Portulaca oleracea L. The normal precursor-product relationship (<b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> → pyruvate → alanine) does not appear to operate in this species since labeling in pyruvate precedes that in <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid.</b> Pulse-chase experiments show that the alanine is rapidly metabolized. After a 6 -second pulse of 14 CO 2, the percentage of 11 C in alanine drops more than 30 % in the first 10 seconds of a 12 CO 2 chase period. The percentage of 14 C in the other early-labeled photosynthetic products, aspartate and malate, also decreases during the 12 CO 2 chase. The decrease of label in these compounds is concomitant with an increase in the labeling of sucrose and alanine, which in this case is formed via <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid.</b> Randomization of label within alanine increases gradually throughout the 2 -minute chase...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of labelled phosphate esters in cytoplasm and chloroplasts of leaf cells of Elodea densa has been followed in feeding experiments with radioactive bicarbonate and phosphate {{in the light}} and in the dark. From the kinetic analysis {{of the distribution of}} label between chloroplasts and cytoplasm it is concluded that the incorporation of ^ 14 C into sugar phosphates and <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> proceeds in the light exclusively, or almost exclusively, in the chloroplasts. On theother hand, in the light and in the dark incorporation of ^ 32 P into sugar phosphates, ATP and ADP occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm of the leaf cell. This can only be explained in terms of low permeability of the chloroplast membrane to inorganic phosphate. Due to this a specific activity of inorganic phosphate, which is higher in the cytoplasm than in the chloroplasts, is maintained during the feeding experiments. This results in higher incorporation of ^ 32 P into organic compounds in the cytoplasm, although phosphate turnover is slower there than in the chloroplasts. In consequence, ^ 32 PO_ 4 ^ 3 Θ appears unsuited for many types of in vivo experiments on the phosphate metabolism of photosynthesis. Contrary to other phosphate esters, <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> becomes labelled with ^ 32 P, as with ^ 14 C, in the light predominantly in the chloroplasts. This indicates a light inhibition of <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> formation in the cytoplasm in addition to the inhibition of the citric acid cycle. ATP levels of the cell increase markedly upon illumination and decrease rapidly after darkening. That the response of the ATP/ADP system to light and dark is much faster than that of inorganic phosphate strongly suggests a control of respiration in photosynthesizing cells by the decreased steady state ratio of ADP to ATP rather than by lack of inorganic phosphate...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine (glyphosate) on the {{regulation}} of carbon assimilation, metabolism, and translocation were studied in leaves of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L., Klein E-type multigerm) under a light regimen that began with gradually increasing irradiance as generally occurs on a natural day. Soon after application, glyphosate caused a marked increase in ribulose bisphosphate {{and a decrease in}} <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid.</b> The response is most simply explained by direct inhibition of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity. The extent of inhibition was small, and the carbon assimilation rate did not decrease. As predicted, photosynthesis declined within an hour after glyphosate was applied to leaves under gradually increasing light. Inhibition resulted from a decrease in ribulose bisphosphate due to depletion of carbon from the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle. Photoinhibition, a light-dependent limitation of photosynthetic capacity, appeared to be necessary for marked glyphosate-induced inhibition of photosynthesis. As a result, photosynthesis rate increased with irradiance until it exceeded 400 micromoles per square meter per second but then declined as the light level increased beyond 500 micromoles per square meter per second. Glyphosate changed the allocation of newly fixed carbon between starch and sucrose for export. Changes in the levels of ribulose bisphosphate and <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> produced important effects on {{the regulation of}} carbon assimilation and metabolism...|$|E

To further evaluate this suggestion, stable carbon isotope ratios were determined for leaf and bark tissue of Larix gmelini, L. kaempferi, L. laricina, L. Iyallii, L. occidentalis, and L. sibirica. All δ^(13) C values were more negative than – 22 ‰. Short-term labeling with ^(14) CO_ 2 showed that <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> and other phosphorylated compounds were the first products of photosynthesis in L. sibirica.

With the exception of H. gracilis, and of Lactobacillus cassi which fixed no detectable amounts of carbon dioxide, all these organisms fixed carbon dioxide into amino and organic acids derived from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and into a few other compounds in individual cases (tyrosine, phenylalanine, polysaccharides [probably glucose polymers], acetic acid and butyric acid). The authors concluded that the presence of C{sup 14 } in almost all these compounds could be accounted for by the carboxylation of pyruvate to yield oxalacetic or malic acids, followed by transaminase reactions. In E. gracilis, however, considerable quantities of activity also appeared in phosphorylated compounds in the dark, especially in the sugar monophosphates, <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid,</b> and phosphoenolpyruvic acid. Only with this organisms was a kinetic study performed to determine the identity and degree of labeling of the compounds containing C{sup 14 } after varying periods of time. It was not stated definitely by which route carbon dioxide entered the photosynthetic intermediates, but it was implied that it was incorporated directly into <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid,</b> and that the energy for this process, which in photosynthesis is derived from sunlight, and was provided by respiration or fermentation.

Equivalent amounts of organic acids and C 3 cycle products are present after 8 seconds. Four-carbon acids remain relatively unchanged throughout the first 45 seconds of exposure, while sugars increase in a linear fashion. Enzyme assays indicate that ribulose diphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzymes are present in a ratio of approximately 2 : 1.

By analyzing the rate {{and the distribution of}} labeling in the different fragments, we looked for evidence of differential carbon labeling in the [alpha]-pinene emitted.

In addition, levels of these enzymes in the inferior vena cava were measured. A further {{aim of the research}} project was to compare the enzyme activities of normal and arteriosclerotic tissue portions of the same blood vessels. It is an established fact that the two mutases, PGM and PGAM, are essential enzymes in association with carbohydrate metabolism. PGM catalyzes the inter-conversion of glucose- 1 -phosphate (G-l-P) and glucose- 6 -phosphate (G- 6 -P) in the glycogen pathway and PGAM catalyzes the equilibrium between 3 -phospho-glyceric acid (3 -PGA) and 2 -phosphoglyceric acid (2 -PGA) in the glycolysis system. Al-though the functioning of PMI probably is of minor metabolic significance, it was considered of interest also to measure the activity of this isomerase in human vascular tissue. Since PMI catalyzes the conversion of mannose- 6 -phosphate (M- 6 -P) to fructose- 6 -phosphate (F- 6 -P), it apparently provides tissues with the opportunity to utilize mannose compounds.

CO 2 uptake, ATP production rate (JATP; derived with a low oxygen/chlorophyll fluorescence method), and carbon isotope discrimination were measured on plants under a low light intensity, which is considered to affect C 4 operating efficiency. The light quality treatments did not change the empirical ATP cost of gross CO 2 assimilation (JATP/GA). Using the metabolic model, measured JATP/GA was compared with the predicted ATP demand as metabolic functions were varied between M and BS.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that the}} net photosynthetic rate of a decaploid genotype (I- 16 - 2) of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) was 32 to 41 versus 22 milligrams CO 2 per square decimeter per hour in a hexaploid genotype (V 6 - 802) (Randall, Nelson, Asay Plant Physiol 59 : 38 - 41). The high rate was later correlated with increases in total ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase protein (17 %) and activity (27 %) (Joseph, Randall, Nelson Plant Physiol 68 : 894 - 898). This report characterizes photosynthesis with respect to light saturation and early products of photosynthesis {{in an attempt to}} identify regulatory metabolic site(s) in these two genotypes. Analysis of the early products of photosynthesis indicated that both genotypes fixed CO 2 via the Calvin-Benson cycle with <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> as the initial primary product. Both genotypes had similar 14 C-labeled intermediates. Sucrose was the primary sink of 14 CO 2 assimilation. After 10 min of 14 CO 2 assimilation with attached leaves, sucrose accounted for 89 % (decaploid) and 81 % (hexaploid) of the total 14 C incorporated. In 10 min, this amounted to 1. 3 (decaploid) and 0. 8 (hexaploid) μmol [14 C]sucrose formed g fresh weight− 1 and reflected the observed differences in photosynthetic rates. There was limited labeling of starch (1 %) and fructan (1 %). Results of total nonstructural carbohydrates and Pi analysis also demonstrated sucrose was the predominant carbohydrate in fescue leaves. Quantitative differences in sucrose and Pi between the two genotypes may reflect changes in partitioning and this possibility is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} paid to the elucidation of pathways of carbo-hydrate breakdown differing from that of the well-known Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) scheme. Although it is recognized that the step-wise oxidation of glucose via gluconate with or without preliminary phosphorylation is an im-portant means by which a number of aerobic bacteria obtain their energy (Barron and Friede-mann, 1941; Entner and Doudoroff, 1952; Wood and Schwerdt, 1953) no data are available in this respect concerning Bacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood, a disease of the larvae of the honeybee. The present study was undertaken therefore to determine the manner in which this organism utilizes glucose. Stone and Werkman (1937) obtained small amounts of <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> from glucose dissimilation by Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus mycoides in the presence of sodium flouride. Aeration of the culture favored formation of this ester. Dedonder and Noblesse (1953) concluded that the hexosemonophosphate oxidative path-way was of importance to B. subtilis and Bacillus megaterium on the basis of triphosphopyridine nucleotide reduction by extracts of these two organisms and by the formation of pentoses from hexosephosphate. Gary et al. (1954), working with the Marburg strain of B. subtilis, showed that the nutritional environment of the cells affected the relative activity of the enzymes of the EMP and the hexosemonophosphate (HMP) pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS The following substrates and coenzymes were used: glucose, glucose- 6 -phosphate 3 (G- 6 -P), fructose- 6 -phosphate 3 (F- 6 -P), fructose- 1, 6 -di-phosphate 3 (F- 1, 6 -diP), sodium pyruvate, 6...|$|E

CYANATE WILL COVALENTLY MODIFY THE FREE AMINO GROUPS OF PROTEINS WITH THE FORMATION OF MONOSUBSTITUTED UREA PRODUCTS (PROTEIN CARBAMYLATION) : RNH 2 + HNCO= H 2 NCOHNR. HEMOGLOBIN CARBAMYLATION BY BLOOD UREA IN MAN HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED (FLUCKIGER 1981). IN THIS CONNECTION, IT SEEMED OF INTEREST TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBLE COVALENT MODIFICATION OF RED CELL ENZYMES, AS WELL AS OFRED CELL MEMBRANE PROTEINS, BY UREA-GENERATED CYANATE IN MAN. WITH THIS END IN VIEW, RED CELL OSMOTIC FRAGILITY, AS WELL AS THE ACTIVITY OF RED ACYL PHOSPHATASE WAS DETERMINED IN 55 UREMIC PATIENTS AND IN 55 HEALTHY SUBJECTS. ACYL PHOSPHATES WILL HYDROLYSE 1, 3 -DIPHOSPHOGLYCERATE TO 3 -PHOSPHOGLYCERATE AND INORGANIC PHOSPHATE BY THE ENZYME <b>PHOSPHOGLYCERIC</b> <b>ACID</b> MUTASE. ACCORDINGLY, THE LEVEL OF 2, 3 -DIPHOSPHOGLYCERATE IN THE RED CELLS OF THE SAME SUBJECTS WAS ALSO DETERMINED. BECAUSE CHANGES IN OSMOTIC FRAGILITY ARE LINKED TO THE ATP (ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE) LEVEL IN THE RED CELL, THE CONCENTRATION OF ATP IN THE RED CELLS OF THE SAME SUBJECTS WAS ALSO DETERMINED. RED CELL ACYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHER IN UREMIC PATIENTS THAN IN NORMAL ADULTS. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION OF ACYL PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY TO BLOOD UREA CONCENTRATION WAS ESTABLISHED. RED CELL 2, 3 - DIPHOSPHOGLYCERATE LEVEL IN NORMAL ADULTS.

40|$|The large depot of <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> (PGA) {{which is}} {{accumulated}} within spores of Bacillus megaterium {{is greater than}} 99 % 3 -phosphoglyceric acid (3 -PGA). The 3 -PGA depot is stable in forespores and dormant spores, but is utilized rapidly during spore germination. When spores were germinated in KBr plus NaF, the PGA depot was not utilized, but 13 % of the 3 -PGA was converted to 2 -PGA. These data suggest phosphoglycerate phosphomutase as the enzyme which is regulated to allow 3 -PGA accumulation during sporulation. Young isolated forespores, in which 3 -PGA was normally stable, utilized their 3 -PGA rapidly when incubated with Mn 2 + plus the divalent cation ionophore X- 537 A; Mn 2 + or ionophore alone or Mg 2 + or Ca 2 + plus ionophore was without effect. Young forespores contained significant amounts of Mn 2 +. However, forespore Mn 2 + exchanged slowly with exogenous Mn 2 + and was removed poorly by toluene treatment. This suggests {{that much of the}} forespore Mn 2 + is tightly bound to some forespore component. Since phosphoglycerate phosphomutase from B. megaterium has an absolute and specific requirement for Mn 2 +, these data suggest that the activity of this enzyme in vivo may be regulated to a large degree by the level of free Mn 2 +. Indeed, the activity of this enzyme in forespore or dormant spore extracts was stimulated greater than 25 -fold by Mn 2 +, whereas comparable extracts from cells or germinated spores were stimulated only two- to fourfold...|$|E
40|$|Rhodopseudomonas capsulatus is a nonsulfur purple {{bacteria}} (Athiorhodaceae) which photo-reduces {{carbon dioxide}} with organic hydrogen donors (fatty acids, amino acids, etc.) or mo-lecular hydrogen (Gaffron, 1933; French, 1937; van Niel, 1941) and, {{on the other}} hand, can grow in the dark {{in the presence of}} oxygen, with the same organic substrates as sources of carbon (van Niel, 1944). The fact that a Rhodospirillum, another Athiorhodaceae, oxidizes hydrogen in the dark (Gaffron, 1935) makes it reasonable to as-sume the existence of a similar process in Rhodo-pseudomonas, and the energy set free in the oxidation could be made available for a further asimilation of carbon dioxide. In plants, the main pathway for carbon as-similation is the condensation of carbon dioxide with a C 5 acceptor (ribulose diphosphate) with subsequent formation of <b>phosphoglyceric</b> <b>acid</b> which is a key intermediate in the fixation process (Bassham et al., 1954; Quayle et al., 1954). To drive these dark reactions, "reducing power" generated by the photolysis of water is required (Calvin and Masini, 1952), a reaction which presumably is the single photochemical step in photosynthesis. The extensive application of radioactive carbon (C's) has made possible the development of analytical methods sensitive enough to provide direct information on the initial steps of the C 02 assimilation process (Benson et al., 1950). These methods have now been used in a study of the mechanism of carbon dioxide fixation by R. capsulatus to compare the photoautotrophic and chemoautotrophic mecha-nism of carbon assimilation in purple bacteria which heretofore was unexplored.
