40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{approach}} to real-time view-based object recognition and scene registration. Object recognition is an important sub-task in many applications, as e. g., robotics, retrieval, and surveillance. Scene registration is particularly useful for identifying cam-era views in databases or video sequences. All of these applications re-quire a fast recognition process and the possibility to extend the database with new material, i. e., to update the recognition system online. The method that we propose is based on <b>P-channels,</b> a special kind of information representation which combines advantages of histograms and local linear models. Our approach is motivated by its similarity to information representation in biological systems but its main advantage is its robustness against common distortions as clutter and occlusion. The recognition algorithm extracts a number of basic, intensity invariant image features, encodes them into <b>P-channels,</b> and compares the query <b>P-channels</b> to a set of prototype <b>P-channels</b> in a database. The algorithm is applied in a cross-validation experiment on the COIL database, resulting in nearly ideal ROC curves.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{approach}} to real-time view-based pose recognition and interpolation. Pose recognition is particularly useful for identifying camera views in databases, video sequences, video streams, and live recordings. All of these applications require a fast pose recognition process, in many cases video real-time. It should further be possible to extend the database with new material, i. e., to update the recognition system online. The method that we propose is based on <b>P-channels,</b> a special kind of information representation which combines advantages of histograms and local linear models. Our approach is motivated by its similarity to information representation in biological systems but its main advantage is its robustness against common distortions such as clutter and occlusion. The recognition algorithm consists of three steps: (1) low-level image features for color and local orientation are extracted in each point of the image; (2) these features are encoded into <b>P-channels</b> by combining similar features within local image regions; (3) the query <b>P-channels</b> are compared to a set of prototype <b>P-channels</b> in a database using a least-squares approach. The algorithm is applied in two scene registration experiments with fisheye camera data, one for pose interpolation from synthetic images and one for finding the nearest view in a set of real images. The method compares favorable to SIFT-based methods, in particular concerning interpolation. The method can be used for initializing pose-tracking systems, either when starting the tracking or when the tracking has failed and the system needs to re-initialize. Due to its real-time performance, the method can also be embedded directly into the tracking system, allowing a sensor fusion unit choosing dynamically between the frame-by-frame tracking and the pose recognition.

25|$|Each of {{the block}} III Ranger {{spacecraft}} had six cameras on board. The cameras were fundamentally the same with differences in exposure times, fields of view, lenses, and scan rates. The camera system was divided into two channels, P (partial) and F (full). Each channel was self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters. The F-channel had two cameras: the wide-angle A-camera and the narrow angle B-camera. The <b>P-channel</b> had four cameras: P1 and P2 (narrow angle) and P3 and P4 (wide angle). The final F-channel image was taken between 2.5 and 5 seconds before impact (altitude about 5km) and the last <b>P-channel</b> image 0.2 to 0.4 seconds before impact (altitude about 600 m).

25|$|When a {{negative}} gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, {{it creates a}} <b>p-channel</b> at {{the surface of the}} n region, analogous to the n-channel case, but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the threshold value ({{a negative}} voltage for the <b>p-channel)</b> is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a silicon on insulator (SOI) device in which a buried oxide (BOX) is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and a BOX region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel (UTC) region with the source and drain regions formed on either side thereof in and/or above the thin semiconductor layer. Alternatively, the device may comprise a semiconductor on insulator (SEMOI) device in which semiconductors other than silicon are employed. Many alternative semiconductor materials may be employed.

30|$|A {{large-scale}} {{array of}} complementary inverters made of single-crystal TIPS-PEN and C 60 organic nanowires was prepared on a 2 -inch Si wafer {{as shown in}} Figure  2 (a).

The low-field high electron mobility for narrow bandgap III-V semiconductors such as InAs and InSb and high hole mobility for Ge and GaSb make them possible {{to operate at}} low drain and gate bias voltages thus with low power dissipation. To enable high-mobility channel materials for logic applications, the oxide/semiconductor interface quality is essential. ^ In this thesis, I mainly focus on the interface studies of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al 2 O 3 as gate dielectric on narrow bandgap materials such as InSb and InAs, for n-channels and GaSb and Ge for <b>p-channels.</b> By using multi-frequency capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) approaches, we can determine the Dit (Interface Trap Density) vs energy level within the semiconductor bandgap.
