40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the technical success and clinical complication rate of a cannulated pancreatic duct with guidewire for biliary access. METHODS: During a five-year study period, {{a total of}} 2843 patients were included in this retrospective analysis. Initial biliary cannulation method consisted of single-guidewire technique (SGT) for up to 5 attempts, followed by double-guidewire technique (DGT) when repeated unintentional pancreatic duct cannulation had taken place. <b>Pre-cut</b> papillotomy technique was reserved for when DGT had failed or no pancreatic duct cannulation had been previously achieved. Main outcome measurements were defined as biliary cannulation success and post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) complication rate. RESULTS: SGT (92. 3 % success rate) was characterized by statistically significant enhanced patient outcome compared to either the DGT (43. 8 %, P < 0. 001), <b>pre-cut</b> failed DGT (73 %, P < 0. 001) or <b>pre-cut</b> as first step method (80. 6 %, P = 0. 002). <b>Pre-cut</b> as first step method offered a statistically significantly more favorable outcome compared to the DGT (P < 0. 001). The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis {{did not differ in}} a statistically significant manner between either method (SGT: 5. 3 %, DGT: 6. 1 %, <b>Pre-cut</b> failed DGT: 7. 9 %, <b>Pre-cut</b> as first step: 7. 5 %) or with patients&#x 2019; gender. CONCLUSION: Although DGT success rate proved not to be superior to SGT or <b>pre-cut</b> papillotomy, it is considered highly satisfactory in terms of safety {{in order to avoid the}} risk of a <b>pre-cut</b> when biliary therapy is necessary in difficult-to-cannulate cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} shelterwood cutting on the {{abundance}} of Jordan's salamander (Plethodon Jordan!) in western North Carolina were examined during 1997 and 1998. Terrestrial salamander assemblages were sampled before, immediately after, and one year after timber harvest on control and treatment plots to estimate abundance. We also sur-veyed salamanders immediately after the harvest along transects radiating out from cut plots to determine whether cutting triggered salamander emigration from disturbed plots. Both before and after timber harvest, the site was strongly dominated by Jordan's sala-mander. No significant effects of initial shelterwood cutting on Jordan's salamander abun-dance were apparent after timber harvest. Abundance of this species decreased from <b>pre-cutting</b> to post-cutting sampling on both control and treatment plots, which likely reflected the drought that characterized both post-cutting sampling periods, but not <b>pre-cutting</b> sampling. No emigration of salamanders from the cut plots was detected after timber har-vest These findings suggest that at a stand scale, shelterwood harvests may pose less of a short-term threat to salamander populations than clearcutting, but more study is necessary to assess broad-scale tradeoffs between harvest yield and biological impacts associated with alternative timber harvest methods.

40|$|Packet {{classification}} is a {{vital and}} complicated task as the processing of packets should be done at a specified line speed. In order to classify a packet as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. Hence the matching of packets should be much faster and simpler for quick processing and classification. A hardware accelerator or a classifier has been proposed here using {{a modified version of}} the HyperCuts packet classification algorithm. A new <b>pre-cutting</b> process has been implemented to reduce the memory size to fit in an FPGA. This classifier can classify packets with high speed and with a power consumption factor of less than 3 W. This methodology removes the need for floating point division to be performed by replacing the region compaction scheme of HyperCuts by <b>pre-cutting,</b> while classifying the packets and concentrates on classifying the packets at the core of the network.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the energy absorbing behaviour of axially splitting square metal tubes. Tubes 50 mm square with a variable thickness were pushed slowly against rigid pyramid shaped dies, which had various semi-angles. By <b>pre-cutting</b> 5 mm long slits at the four corners, the tube splits along the corners and curls outward with a certain radius at a constant force. In this energy dissipating system, there are three components: tearing energy, plastic deformation energy and frictional energy. Theoretical analysis of the three energy components is presented. Curl radius is also studied in detail. Good agreement between experiments and theory is obtained. The results show that tubes which both split and curl may be used as efficient, long stroke energy absorbing devices. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in techniques of therapeutic endoscopy for stomach neoplasms are rapidly achieved. One {{of the major}} topics in this fi eld is endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). ESD is a new endoscopic technique using cutting devices to remove the tumor by the following three steps: injecting fl uid into the submucosa to elevate the tumor from the muscle layer, <b>pre-cutting</b> the surrounding mucosa of the tumor, and dissecting the connective tissue of the submucosa beneath the tumor. So the tumors are resectable in an en bloc fashion, regardless of the size, shape, coexisting ulcer, and location. Indication for ESD is strictly confined by two aspects: the possibility of nodal metastases and technical difficulty, which depends on the operators. Although long-term outcome data are still lacking, short-term outcomes of ESD are extremely favourable and laparotomy with gastrectomy is replaced with ESD {{in some parts of}} therapeutic strategy for early gastric cancer...|$|E
40|$|Cutting-induced {{plasticity}} {{can have}} a significant effect on the measurement accuracy of the contour method. The present study examines the benefit of a double-embedded cutting configuration that relies on self-restraint of the specimen, relative to conventional edge-crack cutting configurations. A series of finite element analyses are used to simulate the planar sectioning performed during double-embedded and conventional edge-crack contour cutting configurations. The results of numerical analyses are first compared to measured results to validate the cutting simulations. The simulations are then used to compare the efficacy of different cutting configurations by predicting the deviation of the residual stress profile from an original (<b>pre-cutting)</b> reference stress field, and the extent of cutting-induced plasticity. Comparisons reveal that while the double-embedded cutting configuration produces the most accurate residual stress measurements, the highest levels of plastic flow are generated in this process. This cutting-induced plastic deformation is, however, largely confined to small ligaments formed as a consequence of the sample sectioning process, and as such it does not significantly affect the back-calculated residual stress field...|$|E
40|$|Redesigning {{buildings}} {{to improve their}} space efficiency and allow changes in use is  often essential during their service lives to comply with shifts in living standards and functional demands. This may require {{the introduction of new}} openings in elements e. g. walls, which inevitably reduces their structural performance, and hence necessitates repair or strengthening. Here the authors report an experimental investigation of the effectiveness of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) -based strengthening for restoring the axial capacity of a solid reinforced concrete wall after cutting openings. Nine half-scale specimens, designed to represent typical wall panels in residential buildings with and without door-type openings, were tested to failure. FRP-confinement and mechanical anchorages increased the axial capacity of walls with small and large openings (which had 25 % and 50 % reductions in cross-sectional area, respectively) by 34 - 50 % and 13 - 27 %, to 85 - 94. 8 % and 56. 5 - 63. 4 % of their <b>pre-cutting</b> capacity, respectively.

40|$|The latest {{generation}} of aircrafts, {{which are often}} in large parts made from fibre-forced-plastics, are prone due to common lightning strikes. Therefore, an extra treatment of the fuselage is {{necessary in order to}} prevent any damage. A special high conductive material (Lightning Strike Protection (LSP) material) is applied to the outermost layer of the fuselage. Currently, for double curved parts of the fuselage, this happens to be a very cost-intensive manual process. We have developed an automated solution for standard industrial robot which reduces the necessary manpower, speeds up the lay-up quantity and improves the process reproducibility. Our approach aims not only the draping process of the LSP material due to the constructed lay-up head but also the generation of the robot paths and optimised cuts of the material regarding to the curvature of the mould. The cuts are produced during the draping process directly from the material reel. Therefore our solution shortens the process chain by eliminating the <b>pre-cutting</b> of the material and allows to lay-up wider cuts and better utilisation of the material. The lay-up process itself is very precise, less stressful to the material and compliant to the manufacturing specifications...|$|E
40|$|Packet {{classification}} {{is used by}} {{networking equipment}} to sort packets into flows by comparing their headers {{to a list of}} rules, with packets placed in the flow determined by the matched rule. A flow is used to decide a packet's priority {{and the manner in which}} it is processed.

The contribution of this paper is a hardware accelerator that can classify up to 433 million packets per second when using rulesets containing tens of thousands of rules with a peak power consumption of only 9. 03 W when using a Stratix III field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The hardware accelerator uses a modified version of the HyperCuts packet classification algorithm, with a new <b>pre-cutting</b> process used to reduce the amount of memory needed to save the search structure for large rulesets so that it is small enough to fit in the on-chip memory of an FPGA.

Here, we describe in detail preparation, handling and optical mapping of trans-membrane potential and intracellular free calcium concentration transients (CaT) in ventricular tissue slices from guinea pigs and rabbits. Slices cut in the epicardium-tangential plane contained well-aligned in-slice myocardial cell strands ('fibres') in sub-epicardial and mid-myocardial sections. Cut with a high-precision slow-advancing microtome at a thickness of 350 to 400 μm, tissue slices preserved essential AP properties of the <b>pre-cutting</b> Langendorff perfused heart. We identified {{the need for a}} post-cutting recovery period of 36 min (guinea pig) and 63 min (rabbit) to reach 97. 5 % of final steady-state values for action potential (AP) duration (APD) (identified by exponential fitting). There {{was no significant difference between}} the post-cutting recovery dynamics in slices obtained using 2, 3 -butanedione 2 -monoxime or blebistatin as electro-mechanical uncouplers during the cutting process. The rapid increase in APD after cutting was mainly caused by the exposure to ice-cold solution during the slicing procedure, not by tissue injury, differences in uncouplers, or pH-buffers (bicarbonate; HEPES) used. To characterise intrinsic patterns of CaT, AP, and conduction, a combination of multi-point and field stimulation should be used to avoid misinterpretations based on source-sink effects. In summary: we describe in detail the preparation, mapping, and data analysis approaches for reproducible cardiac tissue slice-based investigations into AP and CaT dynamics...|$|E
