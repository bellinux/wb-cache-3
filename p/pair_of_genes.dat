40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we propose}} a new greedy {{clustering}} algorithm to identify groups <b>of</b> related <b>genes.</b> Clustering algorithms analyze genes {{in order to}} group those with similar behavior. Instead, our approach groups <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> that present similar positive and/or negative inter-actions. Our approach presents some interesting properties. For instance, the user can specify how the range <b>of</b> each <b>gene</b> {{is going to be}} segmented (labels). Some of these will mean expressed or inhibited (depending on the gradation). From all the label combinations a function transforms each <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> labels into another one, that identifies the type of interac-tion. From these <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> and their interactions we build clusters in a greedy, iterative fashion, as two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> will be similar if they have the same amount of relevant interactions. Initial two–genes clusters grow iteratively based on their neighborhood until the set of clusters does not change. The algorithm allows the researcher to modify all the cri-teria: discretization mapping function, gene–gene mapping function and filtering function, and provides much flexibility to obtain clusters based on the level of precision needed. The performance of our approach is experimentally tested on the yeast dataset. The final number of clusters is low and genes within show a significant level of cohesion, as it is shown graphically in the experiments. ...|$|R

In first step, a co-expression measure is selected and a similarity score is calculated for each <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> using this measure. Then, a threshold is determined and gene pairs which have a similarity score higher than the selected threshold are considered to have significant co-expression relationship and are connected by an edge in the network.|$|E

Each copy of the gene also contains a 10.8 kb region that may be amplified; this region includes five exons that encode an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain. This gene contains three copies of the 10.8 kb repeat.

This promoter is regulated by NF-Y is a sequence specific transcription factor and has long been considered an activator of genes since it contains particular properties suitable to regulate bidirectional promotor with the CCAAT box sequence. This bidirectional promotors couple expression of 2 genes (protein coding) involved in the same biochemical process to allow a synchronized temporal or environmental control. The 2 genes SKA2 and PRR11 are vital for accelerated growth and motility of lung cancer cells and have prognostic value for patients. Along with SKA2, PRR11 also {{plays a major role in}} regulating cell cycle progression but from the late S phase to mitosis. Thus, having vital roles to play in cell cycle progression at different stages, SKA2 and PRR11 may co-ordinately regulate lung cancer proliferation by deregulation of cell cycle progression.Since the transcription of SKA2 gene produces the protein coding mRNA SKA2 along with 2 other introns miRNA301a and miRNAA454, hence the function of the gene is not limited to production of a protein. These introns participate in tumorigenesis since miRNA301a regulates PTEN, NKRF, SMAD4 and PIAS3 and miRNAA454 targets SMAD4 playing an oncogenic role in human colon cancer.|$|E
40|$|Modern genomewide {{association}} {{studies are}} characterized by the problem of “missing heritability. ” Epistasis, or genetic interaction, has been suggested as a {{possible explanation for the}} relatively small contribution of single significant associations to the fraction of variance explained. Of particular concern to investigators of genetic interactions is how to best represent and define epistasis. Previous studies have found that the use of different quantitative definitions for genetic interaction can lead to different conclusions when constructing genetic interaction networks and when addressing evolutionary questions. We suggest that instead, multiple representations of epistasis, or epistatic “subtypes,” may be valid within a given system. Selecting among these epistatic subtypes may provide additional insight into the biological and functional relationships among <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes.</b> In this study, we propose maximum-likelihood and model selection methods in a hypothesis-testing framework to choose epistatic subtypes that best represent functional relationships for <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> on the basis of fitness data from both single and double mutants in haploid systems.
