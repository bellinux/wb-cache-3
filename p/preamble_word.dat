On July 20, at eleven o’clock, by a majority of 175 to 93, the Lords once more excluded from the <b>preamble</b> the <b>words</b> that the Commons had placed and replaced there, in order to declare the policy of parliament on matters ecclesiastical in Ireland. This involved a meaning which Mr. Gladstone declared that no power on earth could induce the Commons to accept. The crisis was of unsurpassed anxiety for the prime minister.

The general reasons {{this doctrine}} was rejected include that the Federal Constitution and the Constitution of India have many differences, especially regarding {{the presence of a}} <b>Preamble.</b> Next, the <b>wording</b> of the Federal Constitution, that is in Article 159 concerning amendments to the Constitution, is such that the Article only prescribes procedures for the passing of the amendments in the Parliament. There is no provision regarding directives to state policies.|$|R

They consisted of setting sheets in a codebook. which were distributed to all users of a network, and were changed regularly. The message key was transmitted in an indicator as part of the message <b>preamble.</b> The <b>word</b> key was also used at Bletchley Park to describe the network that used the same Enigma setting sheets. Initially these were recorded using coloured pencils and were given the names red, light blue etc., and later the names of birds such as kestrel. During World War II the settings for most networks lasted for 24 hours, although towards the end of the war, some were changed more frequently. [...] The sheets had columns specifying, for each day of the month, the rotors to be used and their positions, the ring positions and the plugboard connections. For security, the dates were in reverse chronological order down the page, so that each row could be cut off and destroyed when it was finished with.|$|R
40|$|This {{creative}} and original book {{is designed for}} use in three ways. It can supplement a traditional Secured Transactions text with skills training exercises, {{be used as the}} text for a 1 -credit drafting workshop added on to a doctrinal commercial law class, and also as the text for a 2 or 3 credit contract drafting course. The ten user-friendly exercises are modular so that professors can assign one or two exercises a semester to gradually make their classes comply with ABA requirements for transition to practice credits as well as formative and summative assessments. Students work in teams to negotiate and draft core documents that memorialize a secured transaction, starting with a promissory note, and continuing on to a financing statement and security agreement. In a 2 or 3 -credit drafting course or workshop, students could also negotiate and draft a personal guaranty, perfect a security interest in a delivery truck and fixtures, balance ethical requirements of client confidentiality with truthfulness, and compile a portfolio of the documents with a cover letter to the client. Each exercise requires only fifteen to thirty minutes of class time and one to two hours on homework assignments that have students identify the anatomical parts of a contract (<b>preamble,</b> recitals, <b>words</b> of agreement, etc.), fill in a template promissory note with the parties 2 ̆ 7 names, principal amount, interest rate, and signature blocks, and edit a template security agreement to conform it to the terms of the students 2 ̆ 7 negotiated agreement. Each drafting exercise contains a template that students edit, and the text includes instructions for negotiation exercises. [URL]...|$|R

In the naturalistic study of very-long-term emory, {{young adults who}} as children were frequent viewers of on educational televised song about the <b>Preamble</b> recalled the <b>words</b> of the text better than did infrequent viewers. In the experimental study, young adults who were repeatedly exposed to this televised song demonstrated better short- and long-term recall of the Preamble text than did those who saw a verbal presentation of the same televised vignette, but recall was comparable for students who saw either the verbal or the song vignette only once. Songs are discussed as a presentational form that students can use to represent, rehearse, and retrieve verbal content over extended periods of time. Before written language was easily available to the public, bards sang tales of their culture as they traveled from place to place. Preliterate societies relied on songs and poems to convey information, perhaps because the rhythmic structure that characterizes these forms of communication are easier to remember than i...|$|R
