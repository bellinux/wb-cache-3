50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2011 Primetime {{also started}} working with Top Rank showing Manny Pacquiao vs Juan Manuel Márquez for their third battle. <b>Primetime</b> <b>continued</b> their {{relationship}} with Top Rank by showing the Manny Pacquiao vs Timothy Bradley on 9 June 2012. Primetime broadcast the comeback fight of Ricky Hatton on 24 November 2012, providing the UK broadcast {{as well as providing}} the world feed of the event. Primetime previously broadcast live Polish Ekstraklasa football matches in a deal with Sports Tonight Live.|$|R
50|$|Fillmore! premiered on ABC's ABC Kids {{programming}} {{block on}} September 14, 2002. The show continued to {{air on the}} block through the next two seasons. In February 2003, Disney Channel added the series to their lineup, beginning with a two-hour marathon in <b>primetime.</b> Reruns <b>continued</b> until September 2, 2003, when the series (along with The Legend of Tarzan and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command) was pre-empted {{in favor of a}} 90-minute showing of Recess.|$|R
50|$|While the Flintstones {{live in a}} {{world with}} {{machines}} powered by birds and dinosaurs, the Jetsons {{live in a world}} with elaborate robotic contraptions, aliens, holograms, and whimsical inventions. The original series comprised 24 episodes and aired on Sunday nights on ABC beginning September 23, 1962, with <b>primetime</b> reruns <b>continuing</b> through September 22, 1963. It debuted as the first program broadcast in color on ABC-TV. (Only a handful of ABC-TV stations were capable of broadcasting in color in the early 1960s.) In contrast, The Flintstones, while always produced in color, was broadcast in black-and-white for its first two seasons.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 2007, {{the event}} was shown live on SPEED, {{as part of a}} new {{exclusive}} Fox network package. In addition, the race would be rerun in primetime to reach a larger audience. Starting in 2014, the race itself was moved to <b>primetime</b> under-the-lights, and <b>continued</b> to be shown live as part of the Fox package.|$|R
50|$|Content {{from the}} American E! network started to air {{throughout}} the system's daytime, late night, and weekend schedule upon its re-branding on September 7, 2007; {{this was to}} include Canadian-produced series aired on E! channels internationally, although the extent of this was unclear. E! programming had previously aired on Star! until the launch of E! in Canada. As {{a result of this}} change, E! programming was not available in all areas where it could be seen previously, although E! stations were generally available on digital cable, as well as both of Canada's satellite providers. <b>Primetime</b> programming <b>continued</b> to be sourced primarily from the major U.S. broadcast networks.|$|R
50|$|On February 5, 2015, ESPN {{announced}} Davis {{signed a}} multi-year {{contract with the}} network through 2021 that included taking over as host of the College GameDay football road show in 2015 for Chris Fowler, who had hosted the show since 1990. The deal also sees Davis discontinue his ESPN College Football Thursday <b>Primetime</b> duties but <b>continue</b> his weekly basketball play-by-play role.|$|R
50|$|Fashions on the 60th <b>Primetime</b> Emmy Awards <b>continued</b> {{the trend}} for bold colours and one-shoulder designs {{seen at the}} Oscars, with trends for metallic, lace and feature necklines (either plunging, sweetheart, or jewel-embellished) also {{observed}} by InStyle. Whilst reported on at the time, few of the looks received in-depth coverage, and InStyle did not choose any dresses from the event for their Top 100 dresses of the decade.|$|R
50|$|WKBW-TV's then-owner Granite Broadcasting {{filed for}} {{bankruptcy}} in 2006; as a result, the station {{group as a whole}} was hit hard by financial difficulties. Longtime anchors have either been dismissed or seen significant pay cuts. The station still produces less news content during the week than its competitors (24½ hours, compared to 36 for WGRZ/WUTV and up to 40 for WIVB-TV/WNLO), is {{the only one in the}} market that does not produce a 10:00 p.m. newscast, nor does it produce a weekend morning newscast (there was talk of a weekend morning newscast), while the other two stations in the market have both. From September to November 2008, no Saturday newscasts were produced and the station again suspended its Saturday 6:00pm newscast in 2010 and 2011 (though its late newscast now airs after college football). From 2005 to 2012, the station only employed two meteorologists compared to WIVB-TV's four and WGRZ's five (WKBW-TV used general assignment reporters on weekend weather forecasts during this time) and only two sports anchors compared to WGRZ's four (WIVB-TV also currently has just two sports reporters). The station also relied more on photojournalists than its competitors, and as a result, it has fewer general assignment reporters. As the Great Recession set in at the start of 2008, ABC primetime and syndicated early prime programming was often pre-empted with paid programming to make up lost revenue. This has been reduced through the years as the station recovered, though some low-profile timeslots in <b>primetime</b> <b>continue</b> to carry charitable organization programming from Operation Smile, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Billy Graham Crusades. Since January 31, 2008, union employees at that station who work as producers, engineers, reporters, photographers and assignment desk editors, had been working without a contract. Talks were ongoing between NABET Local 25 and the management at WKBW-TV, though recent contract offers have been rejected. The two sides, after significant acrimony and a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board, came to an agreement on March 4, 2011. Upon WKBW-TV general manager Bill Ransom's retirement, his replacement, Mike Nurse, made a concerted effort to reverse the damage done during Ransom's tenure, boosting the weather staff to four meteorologists (all of which are natives to Western New York), revamping the morning show with new hosts and a new name and moving to a three-man sports department. Scripps further increased the staff to five meteorologists and again revamped the news department largely with familiar names in Buffalo television.|$|R
50|$|On February 10, 2014, WZRB {{became an}} Ion Television affiliate, carry the network's {{programming}} {{for the majority}} of its broadcast day, resulting in the removal of WZRB's syndicated programming inventory in the process. For the first month of its tenure as an Ion O&O, CW programming - including <b>primetime</b> shows - <b>continued</b> to air on the station as a secondary affiliation, pre-empting one hour of Ion's daytime lineup and the first two hours of its primetime schedule (although the Vortexx children's block on Saturday mornings, was aired one hour earlier than the network's recommended timeslot nationwide, at 6:00 a.m. in order to accommodate Ion programming that started at 11:00 a.m.). This was a departure from the standard Ion programming structure (in which stations carry only Ion programming with limited to no local content and no acquired programming outside of that offered by the network); as a result, it marked the first time since 2008, the end of a two-year period in which Ion Media Networks ran MyNetworkTV programming on select i/Ion owned-and-operated stations, that the company had carried another network's programming on its stations. This arrangement proved to be only temporary, as existing MyNetworkTV affiliate WKTC took the CW affiliation on March 17, 2014, resulting in WZRB beginning to carry the entire Ion Television schedule.|$|R
5000|$|KSNB aired {{programming}} from Antenna TV in {{the interim}} on channels 4.1 and 4.2 from the new licensed facilities near York, {{as well as on}} its digital K18CD-D and analog KWAZ-LP translators in Lincoln. The affiliation agreement with Antenna TV was exclusively intended for the station's second digital subchannel, but was carried on the primary digital channel as well while the station ownership changed hands. On April 1, 2013, the station took the MyNetworkTV affiliation previously held by the second digital subchannels of both KOLN and KGIN under the moniker [...] "10/11 Central Nebraska." [...] It also resumed a general entertainment programming schedule and introduced increased local programming, including the expected addition of local high school sports coverage. The second digital subchannel eventually began to also carry the same programming as the main channel, replacing Antenna TV. On September 2, 2013, KSNB became an affiliate of MeTV; the network provided the majority of channel 4's schedule, with local and modern syndicated programming (including <b>primetime</b> MyNetworkTV programming) <b>continuing</b> during the evening hours. Soon after KSNB returned to the air full-time, it was added to all cable systems on the Lincoln side of the market as part of the retransmission consent compensation for carrying KOLN.|$|R
50|$|An early {{variant of}} the game show, the panel game, survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like What's My Line?, I've Got A Secret and To Tell The Truth, panels of celebrities would {{interview}} a guest {{in an effort to}} determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived “low budget” nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television (where the lower budgets were tolerated) in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as Match Game and Hollywood Squares. In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made {{in the wake of the}} scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in <b>primetime</b> and have <b>continued</b> to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nation's top stand-up comedians on shows such as Have I Got News for You, Would I Lie to You?, Mock the Week, QI and 8 Out of 10 Cats, all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.|$|R
