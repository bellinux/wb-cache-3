Discipline requires knowledge, skill, sensitivity and self-confidence; like any art, {{it is something that}} one will acquire through training and experience; it becomes easier with practice. Many people confuse discipline with classroom management; discipline is one dimension of classroom management and classroom management is a general term. Discipline can also have a positive influence on both the individual and classroom environment. Utilizing disciplinary actions can be an opportunity to reflect and learn about consequences, instill collective values, and encourage behavior that is acceptable for the classroom. Recognition of the diversity of values within communities can increase understanding and tolerance of different disciplinary techniques. Promoting <b>positive</b> <b>correction</b> of questionable behavior within the classroom dynamic, as opposed to out-of-class punishments like detention, suspension, or expulsion, can encourage learning and discourage future misbehavior. Learning to own one’s bad behavior can also contribute to positive growth in social emotional learning.|$|E

The main data set was {{the comparison between}} the measured seismogram and the synthetic one, not the travel time data. The synthetic seismogram was calculated with the GEMINI method.

Three methods are considered; wavelet, blind source separation (BSS), and multivariate singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) -based correction. These are applied to data sets containing mixtures of artifacts. Metrics are devised to measure the performance of each method.

Here, this analysis, previously applied to recordings from small ensembles, is developed further by considering a model of a large ensemble, in which correlations among the signal and noise components of neuronal ring are small in absolute value and entirely random in origin. Even such small random correlations are shown to lead to large possible synergy or redundancy, whenever the time window for extracting information from neuronal ring extends to the order of the mean interspike interval. In addition, a sample of recordings from rat barrel cortex illustrates the mean time window at which such `corrections' dominate when correlations are, as often in the real brain, neither random nor small.
