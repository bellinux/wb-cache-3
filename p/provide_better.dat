This study was a quasi-experimental research with 3 x 3 factorial design. The population {{of this research was}} the seventh-year-students of State Junior High Schools of Madiun Municipality in the school year of 2012 / 2013 with the students of SMPN 4 Madiun, SMPN 6 Madiun, and SMPN 10 Madiun as the sample. The research instrument used was mathematics learning achievement test and questionnaire of multiple intelligence. The hypothesis test used was unbalanced two way analysis of variances. The test on the hypothesis revealed that: (1) learning model of Jigsaw with contextual approach <b>provided</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than conventional and Numbered Heads Together learning model, while learning model of Numbered Heads Together <b>provided</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than conventional learning model, (2) {{there was no difference in}} mathematics learning achievement between students with linguistic, logical-mathematics and interpersonal intelligence, (3) in each multiple intelligence, learning model of Jigsaw type with contextual approach <b>provided</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than conventional and Numbered Heads Together learning model, while learning model of Numbered Heads Together <b>provided</b> <b>better</b> mathematics learning achievement than conventional learning model, and in each learning model, there was no difference in mathematics learning achievement between students with linguistic, logical-mathematics and interpersonal intelligence...|$|R

5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to <b>provide</b> <b>better</b> symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies.

Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E

Proposed extensions to the A4174 ring road, which would pass along the southern part of Knowle West, have been claimed to reduce delays across the Greater Bristol area by 6%, and lead to a 9% increase in public transport use.

5|$|The nine-story building, {{built in}} 1977, {{was named for}} a federal judge and housed fourteenfederal agencies, {{including}} the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front—which was expected to shatter under {{the impact of the}} blast—and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would <b>provide</b> <b>better</b> photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe {{came with}} an {{alternative}} proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower costs than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, that it would <b>provide</b> <b>better</b> services to rural areas and thus keep up their population. The regional airports were built in groups, and the first four were built in Namsos and Helgeland.|$|E

Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time.

5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to <b>provide</b> <b>better</b> support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's Transformation Plan, the 3rd Brigade, 75th Division was redesignated as the 166th Aviation Brigade, {{under the}} command of Division West of the First Army. Its mission would be to train and {{mobilize}} aviation units of the Army's reserve and national guard components. It was to be the only brigade under the First Army that specialized in training for Army aviation units. It was activated 1 December 2006 as a reserve unit at Fort Riley. The brigade became a partner organization of the 1st Infantry Division, which was stationed at Fort Riley and could <b>provide</b> <b>better</b> support than the headquarters of First Army Division West, which was headquartered at Fort Carson, Colorado and maintained units all over the western United States. The brigade received a shoulder sleeve insignia on 13 June 2007, but it has not been authorized for wear due to First Army policy requiring its units to wear its SSI.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose {{holes in}} trees, {{fissures}} in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds {{such as the}} hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and <b>provide</b> <b>better</b> protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats {{rather than in the}} middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by raccoons (Procyon lotor). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated pellets are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as jackdaws (Corvus monedula) nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.|$|E
