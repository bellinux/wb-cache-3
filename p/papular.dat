500|$|... 1890: Scottish {{dermatologist}} John James Pringle, {{working in}} London, described a 25-year-old woman with subnormal intelligence, rough lesions {{on the arms}} and legs, and a <b>papular</b> facial rash. Pringle brought attention to five previous reports, two of which were unpublished. Pringle's adenoma sebaceum would become a common eponym for the facial rash.|$|E
500|$|Life expectancies may {{be up to}} 20–25 years. [...] Parapoxvirus is common, though rarely fatal; Infection causes <b>papular</b> and nodular lesions. There {{have been}} {{epidemics}} of contagious pustular dermatitis. [...] Bacteria such as E.coli and Lyme borreliosis are common, and Toxoplasma gondii has been reported.

500|$|Symptoms {{outside of}} the liver are present in 1–10% of HBV-infected people and include serum-sickness–like syndrome, acute necrotizing {{vasculitis}} (polyarteritis nodosa), membranous glomerulonephritis, and <b>papular</b> acrodermatitis of childhood (Gianotti–Crosti syndrome). The serum-sickness–like syndrome occurs {{in the setting of}} acute , often preceding the onset of jaundice. The clinical features are fever, skin rash, and polyarteritis. The symptoms often subside shortly after the onset of jaundice but can persist throughout the duration of acute [...] About 30–50% of people with acute necrotizing vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa) are HBV carriers. HBV-associated nephropathy has been described in adults but is more common in children. Membranous glomerulonephritis is the most common form. Other immune-mediated hematological disorders, such as essential mixed cryoglobulinemia and aplastic anemia have been described as part of the extrahepatic manifestations of HBV infection, but their association is not as well-defined; therefore, they probably should not be considered etiologically linked to HBV.|$|E
2500|$|Lichenoid keratoses (also {{known as}} [...] "Benign lichenoid keratosis," [...] and [...] "Solitary lichen planus") is a {{cutaneous}} condition characterized by brown to red scaling maculopapules, found on sun-exposed skin of extremities.

2500|$|Keratosis lichenoides chronica (also {{known as}} [...] "Nekam's disease") {{is a rare}} {{dermatosis}} characterized by violaceous <b>papular</b> and nodular lesions, often arranged in a linear or reticulate pattern on the dorsal hands and feet, extremities, and buttock, and some cases manifest by sorrheic dermatitis-like eruption on the scalp and face; also palmo plantar keratosis has been reported.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{potential}} {{reaction is}} an itchy, <b>papular</b> rash {{that results from}} cercariae penetrating the skin, often in a person's first infection. The round bumps are usually one to three centimeters across. Because people living in affected areas have often been repeatedly exposed, acute reactions are more common in tourists and migrants. The rash can occur between the first few hours and a week after exposure and lasts for several days. A similar, more severe reaction called [...] "swimmer's itch" [...] reaction can also be caused by cercariae from animal trematodes that often infect birds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Papular</b> mucinosis (also {{known as}} [...] "Scleromyxedema," [...] "Generalized lichen myxedematosus," [...] and [...] "Sclerodermoid lichen myxedematosus") {{is a rare}} skin disease.

Frequently, all three forms are regarded as <b>papular</b> mucinosis. However, some authors restrict it to only mild cases. Another form, acral persistent <b>papular</b> mucinosis {{is regarded as a}} separate entity.|$|E

5000|$|Gianotti-Crosti {{syndrome}} ( [...] ), {{also known}} as infantile <b>papular</b> acrodermatitis, <b>papular</b> acrodermatitis of childhood, and papulovesicular acrolocated syndrome, is a reaction of the skin to a viral infection. Hepatitis B virus and Epstein-Barr virus are the most frequently reported pathogens.
