Excited delirium is associated with sudden death (usually via cardiac or respiratory arrest) particularly following the use of <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures,</b> including police restraint and Tasers. Excited delirium most commonly arises in male subjects {{with a history of}} serious mental illness and/or acute or chronic drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine.

40|$|The {{control of}} Ambrosia artemisiifolia by {{chemical}} and mechanical means was studied {{in a single}} year EU Project which was conducted in 2009. Results of pot and field trials from Germany are presented. Florasulam, Mesotrione and Mecoprop-P applied before BBCH 14 of Ambrosia artemisiifolia were effective control agents. Only the none-selective herbicide Glyphosat provided a high control when applied at later BBCH stages. Overall mean efficacy rates between 79 % and 100 % were achieved. Both <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures,</b> cutting and hoeing, did not result in satisfying control results. The effect of physical weed control was tested on gravel, in grassland and in maize. Even a repeated mechanical control did not increase the efficacy which was assessed in terms of dry matter reduction. None of the <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> was able to stop the growth of A. artemisiifolia plants and their seed production. Ambrosia is not very competitive as trials in spring barley demonstrated. At decreasing crop densities and competition higher dose rates of Mecoprop-P were needed to achieve the same control level. Under crop-free conditions the efficacy of the highest tested dosage (1200 g ha- 1 Mecoprop-P) was 84 %. However, at a crop density of 300 plants/m² the herbicide application could not significantly reduce the biomass of A. artemisiifolia. The results highlight the importance of preventative measures of good agricultural practice as e. g. crop rotation and dense competitive crop stands. In the long run, these measures are crucial for a long-term successful control of A. artemisiifolia in agricultural fields...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Regulatory {{compliance}} {{in international}} trade can be enhanced by facilitating electronic exchange of trade documents to in-crease the supply chain visibility. Crucial for acceptance of the supply chain visibility concept is trust in {{the reliability of the}} data. This depends on both the integrity of information (no data is altered illicitly) and in-tegrity of the flow of goods (no goods are unknowingly added or taken away). The challenge is to determine how these concepts of integrity are interconnected. In this paper, we discuss <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> to ensure integrity of supply chain information and the related goods flow. Such controls consist of three components. First, only trusted traders take part. Second, technical <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> ensure internal consistency of the information system, i. e., the system maintains integrity constraints based on a model of the transactions taking place. Third, <b>physical</b> and organizational <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> mitigate the risk that events in the real world do not correspond to the reported transactions. The usefulness and adequacy of the approach is illustrated with two case studies: the use of electronic seals in the Smart-CM project, and the use of biomet-rics for authentication in the E-Link project at Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the last}} decade, {{there have been}} many {{destructive}} floods {{in various parts of the}} world. Despite the extensive investment in flood control works, neither flood occurrences nor damages are decreasing. A possible consequence of climate change is an increased frequency of extreme meteorological events that may cause floods. Discussion is offered of some recent large floods in the world and of the experiences in combating floods in Japan. Floods change over time as societies change. There is no single universal remedy against floods and site-specific local efforts are necessary. It is essential to undertake damage mitigation measures together with <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> for flood management in an integrated approach, using a mixture of structural and non-structural means. A more disaster conscious society needs to be built with better preparedness and safe-fail (safe in failure) rather than, unrealistic, fail-safe (safe from failure) design of flood defences.

40|$|ABSTRACT Since the 1930 s {{there has}} been {{worldwide}} concern {{about the effects of}} land degradation. After the problems experienced in the Dust Bowl in the USA, much attention was paid to soil and water conservation in both developed and developing countries. Initially Governments have stimulated the establishment of <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures,</b> such as terraces and check dams, and reforestation. This was achieved through top-down regulations, and Forestry Departments were often in charge of the implementation. Subsequently the measures were implemented through more specialised agencies, and later with incentives, such as food aid. In some cases farmers were mobilised to work together on the establishment of the measures. Because of the low success rate of this top-down approach with line interventions, it was realised that a more participatory approach had to be followed. And the emphasis then shifted to area interventions such as cover crops, mulching and composting. In some countries voluntary ways of collaboration between farmers were developed. More recently Conservation Agriculture has been promoted, focusing on less soil disturbance, continuous land cover and crop rotations. This paper analyses whether and to what extent countries have followed such general trends in their soil and water conservation policies, since the 1990 s often referred to as sustainable land management, or whether countries have also followed their own specific strategies. A historical (1960 - 2010) and comparative analysis of the development of these sustainable land management policies and practices is made in five selected countries (Indonesia, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Spain and Bolivia). Keywords: soil and water conservation, sustainable land management, policies, approaches, practice...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the {{spatial distribution of}} stored product insects captured biweekly using foodbaited cage traps in a large rice storage and processing facility, {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Monitoring started in August 2009 and will be carried out for 1 year, the first 5 months of sampling being presented in this study. From end of August 2009 until the end of December 2009, a total of 9893 insects were captured in the 99 cage traps. The most abundant species were: Carpophilus spp. (76 %), Typhaea stercorea (8. 6 %), Ahasverus advena (5. 5 %), Tribolium castaneum (2. 3 %), Sitophilus oryzae (2 %), Sitophilus zeamais (1. 5 %), Ephestia spp. (1. 2 %), Cryptolestes ferrugineus (1 %), Rhyzopertha dominica (0. 64 %), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (0. 6 %), Anthicus floralis (0. 4 %), Lasioderma serricorne (0. 25 %). The first two species, which make up for 84. 6 % of the insects collected, are not considered pests in stored grain, rather are attracted by moldy material present in residues or even in the bait material. The other insects, including primary and secondary species, comprised about 15 % of the total trapped. The spatial distribution of the most important species infesting rice grain and of the total insect number was analyzed using Surfer 6. 04 (Golden software, Golden, CO, USA) and contour maps were constructed to target areas for sanitation. Except for trap 66, located by the rice hulk storage box, the spatial distribution we observed using the contour maps showed that the greatest number of insects was mostly captured in cages placed in the receiving area, around the dryers, as well as outside of the structure where grain residues frequently accumulate. As indicated on the maps for total number of insects, a few isolated infested spots were detected. The parboiled rice area had the least amount of insects, except for trap 61, placed outside the structure. The population of primary and the most important secondary insect species, as well as the overall number of insects, decreased after sanitation and <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> were applied. Our observations confirm that insect monitoring is an essential tool for targeting and evaluating the control measures adopted in the quality program of rice storage and processing facilities...|$|E

Because they assign {{the right of way}} to the various traffic movements, traffic signals exert a profound influence on traffic flow. Traffic control signals, when properly located and operated, usually have {{one or more of the}} following advantages: 1. They can provide for the orderly movement of traffic. 2. Where proper <b>physical</b> layouts and <b>control</b> <b>measures</b> are used, they can increase the traffic handling capacity of the intersection. 3.

Under favorable conditions, they can be coordinated to provide for continuous or nearly continuous movement of traffic, at a definite speed, along a given route. 5. They can be used to interrupt heavy traffic at intervals to permit other traffic, vehicular or pedestrian, to cross. Even though warranted, if not properly placed, operated, or maintained, the following can result: • Excessive delay may be caused. • Disobedience of the signal indication is encouraged. • The use of less adequate routes may be induced in an attempt to avoid the signal. • Crash frequency (especially the rearBend type) can be significantly increased...|$|R
