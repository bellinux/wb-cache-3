25|$|The {{choice of}} the kernel {{function}} K is not crucial {{to the accuracy of}} kernel density estimators, so we use the standard multivariate normal kernel throughout: , where H plays the role of the covariance matrix. On the other hand, the {{choice of the}} bandwidth matrix H {{is the single most important}} factor affecting its accuracy since it controls the amount and orientation of smoothing induced. That the bandwidth matrix also induces an orientation is a basic difference between multivariate kernel density estimation from its univariate analogue since orientation is not defined for 1D kernels. This leads to the choice of the <b>parametrisation</b> of this bandwidth matrix. The three main <b>parametrisation</b> classes (in increasing order of complexity) are S, the class of positive scalars times the identity matrix; D, diagonal matrices with positive entries on the main diagonal; and F, symmetric positive definite matrices. The S class kernels have the same amount of smoothing applied in all coordinate directions, D kernels allow different amounts of smoothing in each of the coordinates, and F kernels allow arbitrary amounts and orientation of the smoothing. Historically S and D kernels are the most widespread due to computational reasons, but research indicates that important gains in accuracy can be obtained using the more general F class kernels.|$|E

The data sample was collected during the 1996 and 1997 running periods with an integrated luminosity of 38. 7 pb- 1 allowing for a precise measurement of differential cross sections in a kinematic regime unreachable for experiments at current e+e- colliders. For the determination of these differential cross sections, both jets were required to have a transverse energy larger than 11 GeV with at least one having more than 14 GeV. Differential hadron cross sections were extracted for these dijet events using separate resolved and direct enhanced subsamples. The cross sections have been compared to NLO QCD calculations using several different <b>parametrisations</b> of the photon structure functions within these calculations.

The predictions of this model are then compared with DVCS cross sections from H 1 and ZEUS, and a related observable, the skewing factor, defined as the following ratio imaginary amplitudes: R≡ImA(γ∗+p→γ+p) |t= 0 /ImA(γ∗+p→γ∗+p) |t= 0. It is an interesting quantity including both the non-forward kinematics and the non-diagonal effects.

40|$|International audienceTropospheric NO 2 column retrievals {{from the}} Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) {{satellite}} spectrometer {{are used to}} quantify the source strength and 3 D distribution of lightning produced nitrogen oxides (NO x =NO 2 +NO 2). A sharp increase of NO 2 is observed at convective cloud tops with increasing cloud top height, consistent with a power-law behaviour with power 5 ± 2. Convective production of clouds with the same cloud height are found to produce NO 2 with a ratio 1. 6 / 1 for continents compared to oceans. This relation between cloud properties and NO 2 is used to construct a 10 : 30 local time global lightning NO 2 production map for 1997. An extensive statistical comparison is conducted to investigate the capability of the TM 3 chemistry transport model to reproduce observed patterns of lightning NO 2 in time and space. This comparison uses the averaging kernel to relate modelled profiles of NO 2 to observed NO 2 columns. It exploits a masking scheme to minimise the interference of other NO x sources on the observed total columns. Simulations are performed with two lightning <b>parametrisations,</b> one relating convective preciptation (CP scheme) to lightning flash distributions, and the other relating the fifth power of the cloud top height (H 5 scheme) to lightning distributions. The satellite-retrieved NO 2 fields show significant correlations with the simulated lightning contribution to the NO 2 concentrations for both <b>parametrisations.</b> Over tropical continents modelled lightning NO 2 shows remarkable quantitative agreement with observations. Over the oceans however, the two model lightning <b>parametrisations</b> overestimate the retrieved NO 2 attributed to lightning. Possible explanations for these overestimations are discussed. The ratio between satellite-retrieved NO 2 and modelled lightning NO 2 is used to rescale the original modelled lightning NO x production.
