These hazardous compounds might be not only from polymer degradation but also from additives and print ink. To confirm what are emitted from them, melting experiments were conducted (150, 200 and 250 °C, in air or N 2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from samples were trapped by Tenax/Carboxen adsorption tubes and analyzed by TD-GC/MS. In the present study, virgin polymers such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and reproduced plastic were tested. As a result, higher temperature caused more emission of VOCs. Moreover, less VOCs and less oxygenated organic compounds which {{were said to be}} hazardous to human and the cause of bad odor were emitted in N 2 atmosphere than in air.

40|$|In actual {{hot runner}} {{systems for the}} {{injection}} moulding process, the control of polymers in gate is passive, {{which means that the}} melt temperature distribution and associated flow conductance is governed by a balance of heat convection by the flowing melt with heat conduction from the hot melt to the cold mould. This paper examines the rheological and thermal behaviour of a PA 66 during freeze-off and melt flow activation. Numerical simulations were carried out according to the Finite Volume Method as implemented in the Ansys CFX® code. Rheological and thermal data were obtained from a careful material characterization conducted on a capillary rheometer and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The analyses indicated that relatively small changes in melt temperature and injection pressure can substantially increase the flow conductance and dynamically control both the gate freezing and the onset of melt flow in the subsequent cycle. Therefore, simple gate thermal actuators were designed and numerically implemented to active control the <b>plastic</b> <b>melt</b> flow. This numerical approach can be used to design and optimize the active control of hot runners gate when the use of mechanical actuation (i. e. valve gates) is not suitable due to excessive cost, critical maintenance or miniaturization of the entire system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, penalty {{finite element}} method {{is applied to the}} {{simulation}} of three-dimensional incompressible viscous steady flow, and the program is coded for analysis of three-dimensional flow process of <b>plastic</b> <b>melt</b> in extrusion die. Slit die is typical in polymer extrusion process, and the relevant part is used widely. Because the flow law is different for various polymers with different rheological character even in the same die, the polymer flow in slit die is simulated for Newtonian fluid and power-law fluid by the program and ANSYS, respectively. Flow laws of two kinds of fluid are compared, and the result shows that the non-uniform velocity distribution in outlet is caused by the non-Newtonian effect of material. The penalty factor is important for the penalty finite element model, which decides the precision and efficiency to a great extent. The proper penalty value is decided by some factors, for example, the character of the whole equations and geometric model. Numerical solution with change of penalty value and viscosity is analyzed, and the result shows that the penalty value should be suited with viscosity in special range for penalty finite element model. The experiment has been developed, and the velocity distribution in outlet of slit die is measured. The result of finite element analysis is consistent with experimental result basically, and the reason of result divergence of the two ways is analyzed. The results show that the given model is suited for the polymer extrusion process, and the advice of the selection of penalty value is instructional for penalty element model...|$|E
40|$|The Using of {{lightweight}} structures {{is a big}} {{trend for}} reducing fuel consumption and CO² emissions especially in the transport sector. Metal plastic hybrid structures are an efficient solution to use the best material at every place. The current states of the art for the manufacturing of metal plastic composites are three technologies: the insert technology, the outsert technology and the metal plastic hybrid technology. In all technologies the metal parts were produced separately from the plastic parts. The injection moulding process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining. This process chains are very long. At the Fraunhofer IWU new process combinations are under development. The aim {{is a combination of}} metal forming and injection moulding in one die and one process. One part should be produced with every stroke of the press. In a first step deep drawing, injection molding and media based forming with the <b>plastic</b> <b>melt</b> have been successfully merged in one tool and one process. It was possible to integrate the injection moulding process in a deep drawing machine. In the next step hydroforming with gas and injection molding could be combined successfully. For this process combination the hydroforming process is integrated in an injection moulding press. Different surface structures of the metal pipes, such as sandblasting, knurling and laser structuring, were systematically tested regarding to their properties as an adhesion promoter. The goal is to establish a purely mechanical connection between the hydroformed metal component and the injection moulded component from glass fibre reinforced plastic instead of the previously often used chemical bonding agents, such as Vestamelt.

Beside the implementation of lightweight materials such as Ultra-High Strength Steel, Aluminum, Magnesium or Fiber Reinforced Polymers there is an upcoming request of Hybrid Materials. Metal Plastic Hybrid Structures are an efficient solution to use the right material at the right place in design space. State of the art regarding production technologies for hybrid structures is that metal components are produced separately in conventional forming processes. These parts are engaged in the molding die and the core injection molding process is only responsible for shaping plastic ingredient and joining. Such process chains are complex and extensive. The paper shows a new approach of the process combination of conventionally metal forming technologies and the {{application of}} the fluid plastic from molding process as a forming media in the meaning of hydroforming. By this the aim is a process combination of metal forming and injection molding in one die and one process step to produce high complex hybrid metal-plastic components in an high efficient way.

The machinability of rubber and other soft materials improves by using a very low temperature coolant, such as liquid carbon dioxide. The low temperatures chill the material prior to cutting so that it cannot deform or stick to the cutting edge. This means less wear on the tools and easier machining.|$|R
