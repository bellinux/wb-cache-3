Such a source is potentially important in spectroscopy, display technologies, and medical applications. In the experiments, a 2 -cm-long Cr 4 +:forsterite crystal was placed in an astigmatically compensated x-cavity which was end-pumped by a 1064 -nm Nd:YAG laser. The crystal which had a small-signal pump absorption of 68 % was maintained at 20 degreesC. An intracavity Brewster-cut SF 10 prism was used to tune {{the output of the}} laser.

Non-linear frequency conversion achieved by quasi-phase-matched interaction remains an attractive route for realising efficient coherent blue-green light sources. Such quasi-phase-matching requires precise control of periodic domain inversion, with periods that can be as small as ~ 2 Âµm for first order conversion via second harmonic generation (SHG) from the near I. R. into the blue spectral region Application of an electric field greater than the crystal's coercive field is the most widely employed route for fabrication of periodically inverted domain structures for non-linear quasi-phase matched interactions. It is experimentally very difficult to achieve such high aspect ratios in bulk poled material of typical thickness ~ 500 Âµm. The high coercive fields required for domain inversion, together with the inherent non-uniformities and defects present in commercially available materials, restrict the routine applicability of electric field <b>poling</b> to <b>periods</b> of the order of > 4 - 5 Âµm in samples of this thickness. To circumvent this problem wafers can be thinned to ~ 100 - 150 Âµm to achieve such small domain periods, but this pre-treatment is both undesirable, expensive and for waveguide applications, unnecessary. Several other techniques such as controlled spontaneous backswitching, and the use of multiple short current pulses, have also been successfully used to generate periods of the order of 2. 2 - 3. 0 Âµm in bulk and waveguide geometries respectively. However fabrication of such poled crystals with very small periods particularly of sub-micron scales remains an elusive goal. Achieving large uniform periodically poled areas is difficult: we however have achieved periods of 1 Âµm by our technique which relies on over-poling the sample, thereby achieving the apparently undesirable effect of domain spreading and merging beneath the lithographically patterned photoresist layer. This technique results in superficial or surface domain inversion, which can be used in conjunction with a waveguide geometry for higher conversion efficiencies in non-linear interactions.

40|$|The centrosymmetry of {{amorphous}} silica {{can be broken}} through the technique of thermal poling, whereby the application of an electric field at elevated temperatures introduces an effective second-order nonlinearity. Quasi-phase-matching is realised through periodic ultra-violet erasure of the uniformly induced nonlinearity. A truly all-fibre laser system operating in the visible was envisioned to replace the crystalline frequency doublers currently employed. Despite the lower second-order-nonlinearity in poled silica fibres, the longer interaction length for comparable acceptance bandwidths, the higher damage threshold and straightforward integration makes them a very attractive substitute. In this thesis, the routes taken to induce the maximum possible nonlinearity and the optimisation of the quasi-phase-matching technique to achieve the highest possible normalised conversion efficiency are reported. Periodic ultra-violet erasure for quasi-phase-matching allows scalability to longer interaction lengths {{in comparison to the}} photolithography technique previously employed. Further circular twin-hole fibres can be used instead of D-shaped fibres. A greater than 16 times improvement in the normalised conversion efficiency over previous results was obtained through the enhancement of key parameters of interaction length, stability and reproducibility. An average conversion efficiency of ~ 15 % was demonstrated in a ~ 32 cm long periodically poled fibre using a fibre laser source with just ~ 200 W of peak power.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} novel domain engineering {{techniques in}} lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) crystals by using focused laser light irradiation to path {{the way to}} sub-micron domain periods for applications {{in the field of}} photonics and phononics. A new technique for tailoring of ferroelectric surface domains is introduced on the non-polar cuts of LiNbO 3 by scanning a focused ultraviolet (UV) laser beam (&lambda; = 244 nm) across the surface, using a scheme of writing and partially erasing the previously written domains. Domain periods down to 4 &mu;m are realised, where the domain depth profile is &# 039;half-crescent-shaped&# 039;. Reduction of laser induced surface damage is achieved by coating the LiNbO 3 crystal surface with a Cr layer, thereby combining the direct laser writing technique with a diffusion process to accomplish domain inversion. Bulk domain patterns with a period of down to 3 &mu;m are obtained in MgO-doped LiNbO 3 crystals by combining laser induced poling inhibition with a sequence of electric field poling steps. The uniformity of the bulk domains is confirmed by nonlinear optical conversion of laser light with a wavelength of 1550 nm into 775 nm. Sub-micron surface domain patterns are achieved by patterned Cr and visible laser light irradiation (&lambda; = 532 nm). This allows for the generation of 2 D <b>poling</b> patterns with <b>periods</b> down to 100 nm.

40|$|Suspended {{inorganic}} particles (such as sands) strongly scatter incident {{acoustic pressure}} waves at MHz frequencies, with the amplitude of the backscattered pressure being {{related to the}} mass concentration and nominal size of the particles in suspension. Over the past two decades, this physical premise {{has led to the}} development of transducer based Acoustic Backscatter Systems (ABS), usually designed to collect profile measurements at centimetric resolution over a metre or so of the near-bed region when implemented in sediment transport studies (Thorne and Hanes, 2002). Modern ABSs typically operate (simultaneously) at multiple frequencies, to enable derivation of the nominal particle radius (a 0) from ratios of the backscattering form function at the different frequencies (Thorne and Hardcastle, 1997). The backscattering form function represents the backscattering characteristics of a given particle relative to its geometrical size, and is often expressed in terms of a parameter, x, where x = 2 Ïa 0 /Î» (Thorne and Meral, 2007), with Î» the acoustic wavelength in water. In order to relate backscatter data derived from an ABS to particle concentration and size, the ABS requires calibration to determine the system constant at each of its measuring frequencies. An ABS system constant represents the electronic response of the ABS, its transmit and receive sensitivity, and the beam pattern of the acoustic transducer (Betteridge et al, 2007). In this way, a three frequency ABS will thus have three system constants, with one system constant for each of its component transducers. Whilst an ABS system constant is specific to a given ABS-transducer assemblage, it is independent of the concentration and size of the suspended particle populations the ABS is used to probe. By measuring the backscattered signal from suspensions of particles with known backscattering characteristics (such as glass spheres), over a number of different concentrations and sizes, ABS system constants can be determined and their size and concentration independency confirmed. In addition, comparison of system constants obtained before and after field deployments enables any calibration change during the deployment period to be discerned. In order to replace a number of aging systems, a new generation of three frequency ABSs was developed and constructed at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (<b>POL)</b> over the <b>period</b> 2003 â 2005, and are hitherto referred to as ABS- 1, 2 and 3. To date, these ABSs have mainly been deployed in the Dee estuary experiments and at Sea Palling during LEACOAST 2. ABS- 2 failed during its first deployment at Sea Palling (March 2006), due to leakage of its O-ring seals, and was subsequently replaced by a commercial 4 frequency AQUAscat ABS (AQUAtec Group Ltd.) in the next (October 2006) deployment. During recovery of the AQUAscat (January 2007), two of its cable connectors were damaged, and the instrument was returned to the manufacturer for repair and upgrade to twisted pair cables. In addition, also due to a damaged connector, the original 4 MHz transducer for ABS- 1 (serial number 110) was replaced with the 4 MHz transducer from the failed ABS- 2 (serial number 111), immediately prior to the October 2006 LEACOAST 2 deployment.

In addition, a <b>poling</b> <b>period</b> of the nonlinear crystal has been calculated for observing type- 0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion (ooo-synchronism) at the liquid helium temperature under pumping at the wavelength of Î»p = 532 nm and emission of the signal field at the wavelength of Î»s = 794 nm, which corresponds to the resonant absorption line of Tm 3 + doped ions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceParametric downconversion in {{submicronic}} periodically poled (PP) quadratic materials {{allows for}} the generation of signal and idler waves in opposite directions. The distributed feedback mechanism enables a backward mirrorless optical parametric oscillator (BMOPO), which has been experimentally realized using a periodically poled KTiOPO(PPKTP) crystal with 800 nm periodicity. A remarkable spectral property of the BMOPO is that the bandwidth of the forward co-propagating wave {{is comparable to the}} pump bandwidth, whereas that of the backward wave is typically several orders of magnitude narrower. In the backward idler configuration realized in PPKTP the backward idler exhibits a coherence gain of two orders of magnitude. In this paper we will consider the backward signal configuration, where the effect of coherence enhancement of the backward signal wave is especially pronounced for exact group velocity matching of the co-propagating pump and idler waves. Thisquasi-phase-matched (QPM) scheme requires a 335 nm scale poling periodicity which may be achieved in GaN waveguides, combining e-beam lithography and epitaxy. However, during the lithography step necessary to obtain the PP material, stitching faults may occur. The BMOPO device is then formed by a sequence of 200 microns long PP elements stuck together. We assume that the stitching faults do not exceed half of the <b>poling</b> <b>period</b> in order to prevent the parametric reverse process. The original three-wave QPM model with the explicit periodicity of the nonlinear parametric coupling is necessary for taking into account the periodicity faults in the junctions. Thanks to the High Performance Computing facility available at Nice University, we analyse the parametric downconversion efficiency and the coherence gain of the backward signal versus the stochastic pump bandwidth in a large pump bandwidth range. We show that if the stitching faults do not exceed a quarter of the <b>poling</b> <b>period,</b> i. e. less than 80 nm, which is technically feasible, the efficiency is comparable to the BMOPO in the perfect PP material. In any case, for an incoherent pump of broad spectral bandwidth we obtain a coherence gain of almost three orders of magnitude...|$|E
40|$|Optical waveguides {{made from}} {{periodically}} poled materials provide high confinement {{of light and}} enable the generation of new wavelengths via quasi-phase-matching, making them a key platform for nonlinear optics and photonics. However, such devices are not typically employed for high-harmonic generation. Here, using 200 -fs, 10 -nJ-level pulses of 4100 nm light at 1 MHz, we generate high harmonics up to the 13 th harmonic (315 nm) in a chirped, periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. Total conversion efficiencies into the visible [...] ultraviolet region are as high as 10 percent. We find that the output spectrum depends on the waveguide <b>poling</b> <b>period,</b> indicating that quasi-phase-matching plays a significant role. In the future, such periodically poled waveguides may enable compact sources of ultrashort pulses at high repetition rates and provide new methods of probing the electronic structure of solid-state materials.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{is the product}} of a seminar {{entitled}} "Cambodian economy and society after the marketization its economy: an examination of three facets of economic development" which was held at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies (CSEAS), Kyoto University, in March 2010. Cambodia is well known as a country that experienced extreme social disruption in the 1970 s, especially during the <b>Pol</b> Pot <b>period</b> of 1975 - 79. After the international isolation of the 1980 s, the Cambodian government turned its policy toward the marketization of its economy in the 1989 constitution. With the national elections and birth of the new state in 1993, the country accelerated the pace of market integration. The seminar examined the various aspects of economic development of the country in recent years by inviting three researchers coming from different standpoints and interests. After an introductory note on the workshop's background (Dr. Kobayashi Satoru), this publication consists of five chapters written by the three speakers and two commentators in the seminar. Chapter 1 (Dr. Ngov Penghuy) examines the directions of the government's structural reform implemented after the national election in 1993, pointing out that the Cambodian government envisioned large-scale foreign capital as a driver of economic development from the outset of the marketization process. The chapter also describes the process of marketization from a macroeconomic perspective, paying special attention to the expansion of garment industry and its role in driving economic growth since the middle of the 1990 s. Chapter 2 (Mr. Shibanuma Akira) examines the reality of more autonomous economic development in the country. Using a theory of development economics that focuses on the growth of domestic entrepreneurs, the author analyses the recent increase of small-scale garment factories run by families with some insights from preliminary research in Phnom Penh. The discussion is noteworthy because it examines the possibility of the spontaneous growth of Cambodian economy in an era of marketization. Chapter 3 (Ms. Kono Satoko) offers readers the third perspective on economic development: that is, social investment from foreign private companies into the local Cambodian businesses. According to the author, social investment aims for not only economic profits but also the realization of social goods such as poverty reduction and empowerment of woman. This perspective is quite important in Cambodia because it will facilitate more independent economic development, not relying on directly on the development aid schemes that dominate the economic development of donors and NGOs. Finally, the author describes her own experience in establishing a social investment company in Japan to respond to the needs of Cambodian social entrepreneur. Chapters 4 and 5 consist of the commentary following the previous three topics. Firstly, in Chapter 4, Dr. Yagura Kenjiro reviews the current situation of the Cambodian economy and concludes that the introduction of foreign capital is a practical policy approach to the development of Cambodian economy. At the same time, however, he emphasizes the need to promote a diversified manufacturing industry and suggests the importance of preparing the institutional environment for such entrepreneurs by, for example, reforming the domestic financing system. Finally, Chapter 5 (Mr. Yamada Hiroshi) adds analysis of political initiatives in the economic development of Cambodia. After reviewing the political process in the country after 1993 and studying the policy platform of the ii Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in 2003 and 2008, the author concludes that the CPP turned its attention from the stabilization of political rule at the national level towards national economic development in the beginning of the 2000 s. The author also analyzes the characteristics of economic policy of the CPP in recent years and points out that the party is consciously drawing private business groups into party politics through such actions as nominating key businessperson to run for seats in the Senate. In other words, the CPP is currently seeking a way of directing and controlling economic development without showing the direct extent of its political control on the processes. According to the author, the party is steadily consolidating its influence and control of administrative procedures and domestic business groups, taking care to not oppose global standards associated with progress creating the institutions for democratic governance and a market economy...|$|R

Automated tuning of the pump laser, etalon and crystal temperature {{results in a}} continuous wavelength coverage up to 450 cm(- 1) per <b>poling</b> <b>period</b> at < 5 x 10 (- 4) cm(- 1) upercript stop resolution. The versatility of the optical parametric oscillator as a coherent light source in trace-gas detection is demonstrated with photoacoustic and cavity ring-down spectroscopy. A 17 -cm(- 1) -wide CO 2 spectrum at 2. 8 mu m and multi-component gas mixtures of methane, ethane and water in human breath were measured using photoacoustics. Methane (at 3. 2 mu m) and ethane (at 3. 3 mu m) were detected using cavity ring-down spectroscopy with detection limits of 0. 16 and 0. 07 parts per billion by volume, respectively.

40|$|International audienceThe {{demand for}} highly coupled high quality {{acoustic}} wave devices for radio-frequency (RF) signal processing based on passive devices has generated a strong innovative activity, yielding {{the investigation of}} new excitation principles and waveguide structures. Periodically poled transducers (PPTs) have been recently investigated [E. Courjon et al., J. Appl. Phys. 102, 114107 (2007) ], {{as an alternative to}} classical interdigital transducers (IDTs) for the excitation and detection of guided acoustic waves. PPTs have two principal advantages compared to IDTs: the robustness of the excitation versus defects or surface contamination and the possibility to excite waves exhibiting a wavelength equal to the <b>poling</b> <b>period.</b> Here a new acoustic resonator concept is suggested, allowing high frequency operation with a simplified package. The idea consists of using a waveguide based on a PPT fabricated on a ferroelectric single-crystal substrate such as lithium niobate or tantalate inserted between two single-crystal substrates allowing the guidance of elastic waves without losses. The concept analysis points out optimum configurations of the structure allowing the excitation of elastic waves compatible with RF applications...|$|E
