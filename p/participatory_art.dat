He published a clarifying 3rd Bridge diagram related to this subject in 2012 (and a more elaborate version of this diagram in 2017). Besides his output as an inventor and noise musician, he starts to focus on music education, and <b>participatory</b> <b>art.</b> At first Landman started giving musicological lectures at venues, festivals and music related educational institutes. Landman published the essay 3rd Bridge Helix - From Experimental Punk to Ancient Chinese Music & the Universal Physical Laws of Consonance in which he clarifies the relation between this prepared guitar technique and the consonant values present in non-Western scales, especially the musical scale used on the Ancient Chinese musical instrument the guqin. He published an extensive 8 chapter guide on how to prepare a guitar, that was later transformed to the book Nice Noise.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{a growing}} {{evidence}} base {{for the use of}} <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> for the purposes of health promotion. In recent years, recovery approaches in mental healthcare have become commonplace in English speaking countries amongst others. There are few studies that bring together these two fields of practice. Aims: The two aims of this study were (a) to investigate the validity of the CHIME framework (Leamy et al, 2011) for characterising the experience of <b>Participatory</b> <b>Arts</b> and (b) to use the CHIME framework to investigate the relationship between <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> and mental health recovery. Method: The study employed a two-phase methodology: a rapid review of relevant literature followed by secondary analysis of qualitative data collected from 38 people who use mental health service who took part in <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> activities designed to improve mental health. Results: Each of the recovery processes identified by CHIME are present in the qualitative research literature {{as well as in the}} data of the secondary analysis. Conclusions: <b>Participatory</b> <b>arts</b> activities produce outcomes which support recovery, specifically including enhancing connectedness and improving hope. They can be recommended to people living with mental health problems...|$|R

P 027 Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{systematic}} {{review of the}} efficacy <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> interventions on cognition, mood, and wellbeing in older adults with or without dementia. This study aims to provide insight on {{the potential benefits of}} different art forms on multiple mental health outcome domains to inform future application and intervention design. Design: Systematic review on randomized controlled trials and quasi-experiments of the effects of <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> on cognitive, mood, or psychological well-being in older adults (defined as age > 60 yeas) with or without dementia. Method: We searched PsycINFO, PubMed, SpringerLink, JSTORE, Frontier, SAGE, Taylor and Francis, and Science Direct and identified 1, 087 papers. A total of 20 studies were fulfilling our criteria were included in the analysis. Results: A wide range of <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> forms have been studied with different intervention design and outcome measurements. Dance appeared to improve attention and reaction. Theatre arts may benefit language-related word recall, reaction, and problem solving. Music showed an impact on memory and reaction. <b>Participatory</b> <b>arts</b> in general appeared to improve mood, although their effects on general psychological wellbeing is less robust. Conclusion: <b>Participatory</b> <b>arts</b> improve mood in older adults with or without dementia. Different art forms may have different cognitive benefits, possibly delivered through different mechanisms of change. These findings can be further developed into research studies and practices of targeted <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> interventions...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{commissioned}} to provide a foundation for a quality framework for the <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> in Scotland, rationalising, synthesising and condensing learning {{from the body of}} knowledge extant in the fields of arts, culture and education (and emerging from the Artworks programme), which can inform the development of a guidance toolkit at a later stage. There is currently no commonly used reference point for quality in participatory settings, to aid staff within Creative Scotland and the sector for funding this work or planning organisational developments. Once this is developed it will feed into a new framework and guidance on Quality for the arts in Scotland, based on solid foundations of knowledge and best practice. Creative Scotland’s focus on quality in <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> settings represents a significant development. <b>Participatory</b> <b>arts</b> are becoming more prevalent and subject to greater demand (Kay 2012), which is evidenced by recent reporting by the Institute for Research in the Social Science (IRISS) that social care employers are reliant on commissioning artists to deliver activities with people who use services (Pattoni 2013). A number of investigations have found gaps in recognition and support for <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> and a lack of a framework for strengthening practice and capturing outcomes (Schwarz 2014, Lowe 2011, Siedel et al 2010, Lord et al 2012). Creative Scotland is {{in a unique position to}} facilitate developments in this sector in the interests of managing quality in its funded activities. Through its development of a new quality framework for <b>participatory</b> <b>arts,</b> Creative Scotland can lead the way in a new, informed understanding of quality and how best to foster it...|$|R

40|$|The {{proportion}} of students studying {{in higher education}} institutions who are experiencing mental health needs and social isolation is increasing. Innovative ways to improve wellbeing and social inclusion are urgently required, as the growing demands on student counselling services exceed capacity. Previous research {{in a variety of}} different populations has shown that <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> projects may have beneﬁcial effects on general wellbeing. Therefore the aim of this pilot study was to ascertain whether such a course could be feasibly developed within a university setting, and whether there was any preliminary indication that this could be useful for students who wish to beneﬁt from increased wellbeing and/ or social inclusion. In collaboration with student services, a twelve-week <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> course was advertised across the university.

40|$|In this article, we seek {{to merge}} an insider with an {{outsider}} perspective on <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> projects, by engaging with the ethnographic turn in arts and promoting {{the idea of a}} ‘researcher template’ (Goodley 1999) as a way of enabling reflexivity in practice-led inquiries. Situated at the intersection between artistic, educational and academic work, this template allows us to address and reflect upon the complexities and vicissitudes emerging from an interpretative study of the Ghent-based <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> project, rocsa singers. While revealing the roles of the diverse protagonists within this practice, we highlight three main challenges and tensions: (1) nurturing and supporting diversity; (2) the thin line between directing and going along; and (3) the need to go public. We argue that <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> practices form a tempting field to move beyond dominant interpretations and well-known (art) strategies and forms. ‘Having one foot in and one foot out’ invites us to become aware of this potential, to grasp the continuous and subtle interplay between contextualisation, diversity and responsibility, and to forge new connections between life-worlds and system pressures and priorities...|$|R

40|$|The {{priorities}} many {{nursing homes}} give to physical care often supersede consideration for leisure arrangements and resources with {{the effect that}} the range of activities and engagement opportunities for residents are limited. An inactive lifestyle in nursing homes can compromise the residents’ quality of life and their psychosocial wellness through boredom, diminished morale and reinforced dependency. A low level of engagement also exposes residents to a greater risk of developing cognitive impairment and accentuates feelings of loneliness and isolation. Given the demographic trend of an ageing population together with a growing demand for nursing homes in Singapore, this research addresses the current lack of research on lifestyles of nursing home residents and arrangements to promote their personal well-being. 	In this thesis, I investigate the effect of a <b>participatory</b> visual <b>arts</b> programme on the personal well-being of residents in a Singapore nursing home. The study explores the ways in which well-being is afforded through <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> activities and the role an artist can take in relation to human caring. To facilitate evaluation and reflection on my arts-health practice, I brought my arts-health practice into a novel dialogue methodologically with the action-research case study approach of social science. I refer to this hybrid approach as ‘critical arts-health practice’. 	The empirical data of the study prompted exploration of the link between vitality and <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> activities. <b>Participatory</b> <b>arts</b> activities are found to revitalise the sensory, physical, cognitive, emotional, social capacities of older adults and promote self-actualisation. Drawing on Gilles Deleuze’s assemblage theory, I conceptualised the Arts-Health assemblage as a way of understanding the processes through which <b>participatory</b> <b>arts</b> activities contribute to the participants’ well-being, as both dynamic and as involving multiple interrelated elements. I argue that the broad concerns of arts-health practice can be defined as combining individualised attention to the participant, well-being outcome, and ensuring the quality of the environment and activities for <b>participatory</b> <b>arts.</b> I argue that attentiveness to these dimensions will promote a more effective and caring arts-health practice. Lastly, the central importance of these dimensions within an arts-health practice emphasises that the arts-health practitioner is first and foremost a caring artist. ...|$|R
