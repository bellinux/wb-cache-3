50|$|Shallow trench {{isolation}} (STI), a process used to fabricate semiconductor devices, {{is a technique}} used to enhance the isolation between devices and active areas. Moreover, STI has {{a higher degree of}} planarity making it essential in photolithographic applications, depth of focus budget by decreasing minimum line width. To planarize shallow trenches, a common method should be used such as the combination of resist etching-back (REB) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). This process comes in a sequence pattern as follows. First, the isolation trench pattern is transferred to the silicon wafer. Oxide is deposited on the wafer in the shape of trenches. A <b>photo</b> <b>mask,</b> composed of silicon nitride, is patterned on the top of this sacrificial oxide. A second layer is added to the wafer to create a planar surface. After that, the silicon is thermally oxidized, so the oxide grows in regions where there is no Si3N4 and the growth is between 0.5 and 1.0 µm thick. Since the oxidizing species such as water or oxygen are unable to diffuse through the mask, the nitride prevents the oxidation. Next, the etching process is used to etch the wafer and leave a small amount of oxide in the active areas. In the end, CMP is used to polish the SiO2 overburden with an oxide on the active area.|$|E

40|$|Semiconductor {{fabrication}} process begins with photolithography. Preparing a <b>photo</b> <b>mask</b> {{is the key}} process step in photolithography. The <b>photo</b> <b>mask</b> was fabricated by inscribing patterns directly onto a soda lime glass {{with the help of}} a laser beam, as it is easily controllable. Laser writer LW 405 -A was used for preparing the mask in this study. Exposure wavelength of 405 nm was used, with which 1. 2 mu m feature size can be written in direct write-mode over the soda lime glass plate. The advantage of using the fabricated mask is that it can be used to design back contacts for thin film Photovoltaic (PV) solar cells. To investigate the process capability of LW 405 -A, same pattern with different line widths was written on soda lime glass samples at different writing speeds. The pattern was inscribed without proximity effect and stitching errors, which was characterized using optical microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). It was proven that writing speed of a mask-writer is decided according to the intended feature size and line width. As the writing speed increases, the edges of the patterns become rougher due to uneven scattering of the laser beam. From the fabricated mask, the solar cell can be developed embedding both the contacts at the bottom layer, to increase the absorption of solar radiation on the top surface effectively by increasing light absorption area...|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} very small {{distances}} {{is essential for}} many applications and alignment procedures {{in the field of}} micro technology, e. g. micro lithography for MEMS or micro optics, where proximity lithography is often used for cost effective mass fabrication. Also in proximity lithography the requirements, especially for resolution, are increasing permanently. Recently new techniques have been developed to get sub-micron resolution even for larger distances between mask and substrate. But then also the proximity distance has to be controlled with sub-micron accuracy. A passive and an active sensor concept have been developed based on triangulation using diffractive structures. The required sensing patterns are implemented directly in the <b>photo</b> <b>mask.</b> In the passive gap alignment the distance can be reconstructed from the resist pattern obtained {{as a result of a}} lithographic step in which the diffractive sensor structure is exposed in the Mask-Aligner. In the active configuration the proximity gap can be controlled already during the alignment procedure prior to the lithographic exposure. A collimated laser beam irradiates a diffractive structure in the <b>photo</b> <b>mask,</b> which deflects the beam which will be reflected from the resist coated substrate towards the mask. A second mask structure, which is placed in a defined lateral distance to the first one, acts then as a ruler for the distance between mask and wafer and can be observed through the alignment microscope or a camera module. The design and fabrication of the diffractive structures, the measurement results for the full-wafer proximity distance distribution according to the passive method, as well as the realization of an active sensor module for mask aligners are presented in this paper...|$|E

Samples with this new surface structure show superior performance over random upright pyramids especially in the long wavelength range due to their optimised path length enhancement factor.

In this paper, we proposed a novel variation of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) model, which is a binary PSO model with adaptable inertia weight and mutation mechanism. It is converted to be able to solve the model of binary decision variables. Moreover, it improves some weaknesses, including a propensity for obstruction near the optimal solution regions that hardly improve solution quality by fine tuning. In order to compare effectiveness, the traditional PSO, genetic algorithm, and the proposed PSO in this study are compared by the practical production planning problem in the TFT Array process. Based on the results of the experiments, it can be concluded that the proposed PSO is more effective than the other approaches in terms of superiority of solution and required CPU time.
