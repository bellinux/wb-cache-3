5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by <b>Paul</b> <b>Krugman</b> in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, <b>Paul</b> <b>Krugman,</b> Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
5|$|European {{banks are}} {{estimated}} to have incurred losses approaching €1 trillion between {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This has prompted some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and <b>Paul</b> <b>Krugman</b> to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, <b>Paul</b> <b>Krugman</b> used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

3000|$|... “What we {{want from}} a {{monetary}} system isn’t {{to make people}} holding money rich; {{we want it to}} facilitate transactions and make {{the economy as a whole}} rich.” <b>Paul</b> R. <b>Krugman</b> (2011) said. He refer Bitcoin as “Golden block chain”, but he also concerned that, fixed supply will push Bitcoin price to a higher place, causing hoarding, deflation and economic depression. Therefore, analyses how Bitcoin price influenced by economic factors can be very helpful to understanding Bitcoin better. In this paper, we decide to analysis what factors influence Bitcoin price. People always compare Bitcoin to Gold as they both have limited number and can used as a purchase method. We choose some factors which may influence gold price and add gold price in our model so that we could analysis whether gold price have influence on Bitcoin’s price.|$|R

40|$|Beginning with Wilfred J.

In contrast, anecdotal accounts, especially from developing countries, often stress the importance of gaining access to high-quality inputs on the import market. 1 In purely theoretical discussions, the need to distinguish between the number of inputs and the quality of those inputs can be avoided by treating different qualities of a given good as distinct varieties (see e. g. Paul Romer, 1994). But in empirical work one inherits the product categories and units of measurement in the data, and typically one must specify whether the greater-availability-of-inputs mechanism is expected to operate through {{an increase in the number}} of input categories or through an increase in the quality of inputs within categories.

40|$|What do trade negotiators {{negotiate}} about? Most of {{the theoretical}} literature on trade agreements {{can be seen as}} answering this question {{from the perspective of the}} terms-of-trade theory, which holds that trade agreements are useful to governments as a means of escape from a terms-of-trade-driven prisoner’s dilemma. 1 However, little empirical evidence exists to shed light on the relevance of this theory, and none of the evidence results from an investigation that confronts the central predictions of the terms-of-trade theory directly with the data. The purpose of this paper is to provide such an investigation. Any theory of trade agreements must identify a means by which the negotiating governments can enjoy mutual gains from the agreement. From the perspective of the terms-of-trade theory, these mutual gains are made possible by the elimination of inefficiencies that arise at the international level. These inefficiencies in turn can be traced to the international cost-shifting that occurs when foreign exporters pay part of the cost of a tariff hike by accepting lower exporter (“world”) prices, thereby 1 The commitment theory has established a potential role for trade agreements that is distinct from the terms-of-trade theory—trade agreements can help governments make commitments to the private sector—but until recently (see, for example, Giovanni Maggi and Andres Rodriguez-Clare 2007) the commitment theory has not been devel-oped much beyond this basic contribution. There is also the commonly held view, expressed most fully by <b>Paul</b> R. <b>Krugman</b> (1997), that the motives and behaviors of trade negotiators cannot be understood in terms of economics...|$|R

It has been standard in this literature to model input varieties as symmetric, differentiated horizontally but not vertically. In contrast, anecdotal accounts, especially from developing countries, often stress the importance of gaining access to high-quality inputs on the import market. In theoretical discussions, the need to distinguish between the number of inputs and the quality of those inputs can be avoided by treating different qualities of a good as distinct varieties (see, e. g., Paul Romer 1994) or by redefining units of measurement. But in empirical work, one inherits the product categories and units in the data, and typically one must specify whether the availability-of-inputs mechanism is expected to operate through {{an increase in the number}} of input categories or through an increase in the quality of inputs within categories. Because of data constraints—in particular because of a lack of information on input and output prices in standard plant-level datasets—it has been difficult to investigate the role of input-quality differences, and recent empirical work, notably by Christian Broda, Joshua Greenfield, and David Weinstein (2006) and Pinelopi K. Goldberg et al. (2008), has tended to focus more on changes in the number of input categories than on quality differences within those categories. In this short paper, we draw on rich product level information from the Colombian manufacturing census to present a new set of facts about importing plants and input prices. The dataset is unique in that it contains detailed, representative, consistently measured information on the unit values of all inputs and outputs of plants. For the 1982 – 1988 period, the dataset also contains unit values separately for domestic and imported purchases of each input. As we discuss in more detail below, we interpret the new facts as suggesting that Colombian plants purchase higher-quality inputs on the import market than on the domestic market, within narrow product categories. Our empirical work has been guided in part by a theoretical framework from a related paper, Kugler and Verhoogen (2008). In that paper, we hypothesize a complementarity between input quality and plant productivity in generating output quality, and extend the model of Marc J. Melitz (2003) to accommodate it. The model predicts that, in equilibrium, more-productive plants are larger, use higher-quality inputs, produce higher-quality outputs, and are more likely to enter the export market than less-productive plants in the same industry. Using the Colombian plant census, we show that the cross-sectional correlations between a number of observable variables—output prices, input prices, plant size, and export status—as well as differences in those correlations across sectors,—are consistent with our theoretical framework and difficult to reconcile with alternative models that impose symmetry of either inputs or outputs. The distinctive aspect of the current paper is the focus on the distinction between imported and domestic inputs...|$|R
