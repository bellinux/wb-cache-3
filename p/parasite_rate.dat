40|$|Abstract. Kinshasa, {{the capital}} of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has been a {{perennial}} malarious area and has grown almost 14 times from 380, 000 people in 1960 to 5, 293, 000 in 2003. The most complete information on malaria prevalence in Kinshasa was first acquired in 1981 − 1983. Blood smears were obtained from 25, 135 children (ages 5 − 15 years) from 245 schools in 16 of 24 zones. The mean Plasmodium falciparum <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> was 17 %; the <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> was similar for both sexes and was higher (P < 0. 001) in older students. The <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> varied from 4 % (urban zone) to 46 % (peri-urban zone). An infant survey confirmed malaria transmission. During the Roll Back Malaria situational analysis in 2000, malaria prevalence was reassessed by the National Malaria Control Program and its partners in schools from selected health zones. A mean <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> of 34 % was found among school children 5 − 9 years old. The <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> varied from 14 % (central urban zone) to 65 % (peri urban zone). Plasmodium falciparum was not the only species found, but accounted for more than 97 % of the infections. Malaria incidence may have increased in Kinshasa during the last two decades due to difficulties in provision of control and prevention measures. Along with deployment of insec-ticide-treated bed nets and improved patient management, currently ongoing, other measures that could impact the disease are being considered, including vector control, water management, and proper urban planning...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} cross-sectional {{survey was}} undertaken in two populations, urban and rural, in southern Ghana {{to assess the}} impact of urbanization on the prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and antibodies. At the same time, a survey of antimalarial practices was conducted on sample populations in the two communities. The results showed a low <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> (1. 6 %) and correspondingly low titres of malaria antibodies in a significant proportion of the urban community, particularly in children less than 10 years old. This was associated with widespread use in the urban community of antimalarial drugs, particularly chloroquine, as prophylaxis. The <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> in the rural community was 22 %, and 97 % of the sample population over 1 year of age had antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum. These results demonstrate that a substantial proportion of urban children are growing up with little exposure to malaria, even in a region considered endemic for malaria. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally malaria {{epidemiology}} {{has focused}} on factors such as <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> and vector dynamics without specific reference to disease. There are limited comprehensive data on malaria as a life-threatening event in African children. We have identified, through hospital surveillance, 581 episodes of severe malaria in residents of a defined area on the Kenya coast {{over a period of}} 3 years. This represents an absolute minimum risk of developing severe malaria by the fifth birthday of 1 in 15. The presentation of severe malaria showed marked seasonality, but the timing and magnitude of these fluctuations varied considerably between years. A satellite navigational system was used to define the exact location of the home of each severe malaria case. Space-time clustering of severe malaria was evident in this community. Seasonal peaks in incidence of severe malaria may comprise discrete mini-epidemics. In contrast, <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> in the community varied little {{during the course of the}} surveillance. The monitoring of disease, as opposed to parasitization, in children may result in more effective targeting of intervention resources...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn several {{reciprocal}} cross-infection experiments parasites {{were found}} to be significantly more adapted to their local host populations than to hosts from distant populations. We developed a metapopulation model, taking explicit account of both population densities and gene frequencies, to determine the influence of ecological and genetical parameters on the local adaptation of the parasites and on the spatial distribution of resistance and virulence genes. Our results point to the predominant effect of ecological parameters such as <b>parasite</b> growth <b>rate</b> and host and <b>parasite</b> migration <b>rates</b> on coevolutionary outcomes. In particular, the parasites {{are more likely to be}} adapted to their local host population than to allopatric hosts when the <b>parasite</b> migration <b>rate</b> is larger than the host migration rate. The opposite should be observed whenever hosts migrate more than parasites...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{efficacy}} of vaccines aimed at inhibiting {{the growth of}} malaria parasites in the blood can be assessed by comparing {{the growth rate of}} parasitaemia in the blood of subjects treated with a test vaccine compared to controls. In studies using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM), a type of controlled human malaria infection, <b>parasite</b> growth <b>rate</b> has been measured using models with the intercept on the y-axis fixed to the inoculum size. A set of statistical models was evaluated to determine an optimal methodology to estimate <b>parasite</b> growth <b>rate</b> in IBSM studies. Methods: <b>Parasite</b> growth <b>rates</b> were estimated using data from 40 subjects published in three IBSM studies. Data was fitted using 12 statistical models: log-linear, sine-wave with the period either fixed to 48 h or not fixed; these models were fitted with the intercept either fixed to the inoculum size or not fixed. All models were fitted by individual, and overall by study using a mixed effects model with a random effect for the individual. Results: Log-linear models and sine-wave models, with the period fixed or not fixed, resulted in similar <b>parasite</b> growth <b>rate</b> estimates (within 0. 05 log parasites per mL/day). Average <b>parasite</b> growth <b>rate</b> estimates for models fitted by individual with the intercept fixed to the inoculum size were substantially lower by an average of 0. 17 log parasites per mL/day (range 0. 06 - 0. 24) compared with non-fixed intercept models. Variability of <b>parasite</b> growth <b>rate</b> estimates across the three studies analysed was substantially higher (3. 5 times) for fixed-intercept models compared with non-fixed intercept models. The same tendency was observed in models fitted overall by study. Modelling data by individual or overall by study had minimal effect on parasite growth estimates. Conclusions: The analyses presented in this report confirm that fixing the intercept to the inoculum size influences parasite growth estimates. The most appropriate statistical model to estimate the growth <b>rate</b> of blood-stage <b>parasites</b> in IBSM studies appears to be a log-linear model fitted by individual and with the intercept estimated in the log-linear regression. Future studies should use this model to estimate <b>parasite</b> growth <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{hypothesis}} is that hemoglobin-based metrics are useful tools for estimating malaria endemicity and for monitoring malaria control strategies. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare population hemoglobin mean and anemia prevalence to established indicators of malaria endemicity, including parasite rates, rates of enlarged spleens in children, and records of (presumptive) malaria diagnosis among populations living with different levels of malaria transmission. Methodology/Principal Findings: Convenience sample, multisite cross-sectional household surveys conducted in Papua New Guinea. Correlations (r 2) between population Hb mean and anemia prevalence and altitude, <b>parasite</b> <b>rate,</b> and spleen rate were investigated in children ages 2 to 10 years, and in the general population; 21, 664 individuals from 156 different communities were surveyed. Altitude ranged from 5 to 2120 meters. In young children, correlations between altitude and <b>parasite</b> <b>rate,</b> population Hb mean, anemia prevalence, and spleen rate were high (r 2 : 20. 77, 0. 73, 20. 81, and 20. 68; p, 0. 001). In the general population, correlations between altitude and population Hb mean and anemia prevalence were 0. 83 and 0. 85, respectively. Among young children, <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> correlated highly with anemia prevalence, population Hb mean, and spleen rate (r 2 : 0. 81, 20. 81, and 0. 86; p, 0. 001). Population Hb mean (corrected for direct altitude effects) increased with altitude, from 10. 5 g/dl at, 500 m to 12. 8 g/dl at. 1500 m (p, 0. 001).

40|$|A {{field survey}} was {{undertaken}} on the malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> and the spleen rate in some {{rural areas of}} the Philippines {{during the period from}} November, 1969, till March, 1971. The subject areas were Wawa, north from Manila; Sonlon, north from Davao; and Maruyogon, Mainit, Quezon and the Iwahig Penal Colony in Palawan Island. Persons subjected to the survey were residents, prisoners (colonists) in the penal colony and in some areas, primary school children. The spleen rate was examined by manual palpation in children under 12 years. Results obtained were summarized as follows: 1) The <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> was 2. 5 % (8 / 320) at Wawa, 0. 5 % (1 / 217) at Sonlon, 4. 0 % (16 / 401) at Maruyogon, 15. 4 % (10 / 65) at Mainit, 26. 7 % (8 / 30) in the native tribe and 5. 7 % (2 / 35) in settlers, and 7. 1 % (21 / 181) in school children at Quezon. 2) The spleen rate was 4. 0 % (7 / 177) at Maruyogon, 40. 9 % (18 / 44) at Mainit and 15. 2 % (34 / 224) at Quezon. 3) In the Iwahig Penal Colony, colonists in the Montible and Central Subcolonies were employed for the parasite examination. The <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> in the Montible was 12. 1 %(62 / 521). A significant difference in <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> was shown between the central district (6. 7 %) and the outskirts (16. 3 %) of the Montible Subcolony. Newcomers into the Orientation Unit of the Montible demonstrated 13. 6 % (9 / 66) in parasite detection and this fact would imply the high frequency of a new infection to colonists during the stay of the first 6 months. At the Mangahan (Agronomy) Unit of the Central Subcolony, 10. 7 %(3 / 28) in <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> was obtained. 4) The parasite species and the proportion observed in this survey were; P. falciparum 84. 8 %, P. vivax 13. 9 %, and P. malariae 1. 2 %. 1969 年 11 月より 1971 年 3 月の間に,フィリピンの農山村地域で,マラリア原虫率および脾腫率の野外調査を実施した. 対象地はマニラ北方約 60 Kmのワワ,ミンダナオ島ダヴァオ北東約 110 Kmのソンロン,およびパラワン島のマルヨゴン,マイニット,ケソンおよびイワヒグ囚人部落で,対象人は一般住民,囚人部落では収容中の徒刑囚,またある地域では学童であった. 脾腫率は 12 才以下の小人を対象に触診によって検査した. 得られた成績を総括すると次の如くであった. 1) 原虫率は,ワワ 2. 5 %(8 / 320),ソンロン 0. 5 %(1 / 217),マルヨゴン 4. 0 %(16 / 401),マイニット 15. 4 %(10 / 65),たゞし,この地域の原住部族民では 26. 7 %(8 / 30),移住者 5. 7 %(2 / 35),ケソン中央小学校児童 7. 1 %(21 / 181) であった. 2) 脾腫率は,マルヨゴン 4. 0 %(7 / 177),マイニット 40. 9 %(18 / 44),ケソン 15. 2 %(34 / 224) の結果を得た. 3) イワヒグ囚人部落ではモンテブレおよびセントラルの両サブコロニーの囚人を対象とした. モンテブレサブコロニーでは, 12. 1 %(63 / 521) の原虫率をえたが,このサブコロニーの中央地区居住者の原虫率, 6. 7 %と周辺地区居住者のそれ, 16. 3 %との間には,明らかに有意差が認められた. 同サブコロニーのオリエンテイション分団への新入囚人では,原虫検出率が 13. 6 %(9 / 66) であった. この事は新入者の初期 6 ケ月間の滞在期間中におけるマラリア感染の頻度を物語るものと思われた. セントラルサブコロニーのマンガハン(耕作) 分団での原虫率は 10. 7 %(3 / 28) であった. 4) 検出した原虫種は,熱帯熱原虫がもっとも多く 84. 8 %,三日熱原虫は 13. 9 %,四日熱原虫は 1. 2 %であった...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rapid antigen assays {{provide an}} {{effective}} {{tool for the}} detection of malaria in symptomatic patients. However, the efficacy of these devices for detecting asymptomatic malaria, where parasite levels are normally signifi-cantly lower than in symptomatic patients, is less well established. We evaluated the efficacy of a new combined Plasmodium falciparum-Plasmodim vivax immunochromatographic test (ICT Malaria Pf/Pv) in a cross-sectional malaria survey of the village of Ban Kong Mong Tha, Kanchanaburi Provice, Thailand, from August to December 2000. A total of 1, 976 bleeds were made from 559 individuals {{over the course of the}} study. Blinded microscopy of thick and thin blood films was used as the gold standard; all discordant and 10 % of concordant results were cross-checked. Of 1, 976 ICT Malaria Pf/Pv dipsticks tested, 98. 3 % (n 1, 943) performed as expected, as evidenced by the appearance of the control line. The ICT Malaria Pf/Pv test was both sensitive (100. 0 %) and specific (99. 7 %) for the diagnosis of falciparum malaria with parasitemias of 500 trophozoites/L; however, only 15. 9 % (13 / 82) of infected individuals had parasitemia rates this high. When P. falciparum parasitemia rates were < 500 /L, the sensitivity of the diagnosis was only 23. 3 %, with a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 76. 2 and 97. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{allocation of}} financial resources for malaria control using appropriate combinations of interventions requires accurate {{information on the}} geographic distribution of malaria risk. An evidence-based description of the global range of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and its endemicity has not been assembled in almost 40 y. This paper aims to define the global geographic distribution of P. falciparum malaria in 2007 {{and to provide a}} preliminary description of its transmission intensity within this range. The global spatial distribution of P. falciparum malaria was generated using nationally reported case-incidence data, medical intelligence, and biological rules of transmission exclusion, using temperature and aridity limits informed by the bionomics of dominant Anopheles vector species. A total of 4, 278 spatially unique cross-sectional survey estimates of P. falciparum <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> were assembled. Extractions from a population surface showed that 2. 37 billion people lived in areas at any risk of P. falciparum transmission in 2007. Globally, almost 1 billion people lived under unstable, or extremely low, malaria risk. Almost all P. falciparum <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> above 50 % were reported in Africa in a latitude band consistent with the distribution of Anopheles gambiae s. s. Conditions of low parasite prevalence were also common in Africa, however. Outside of Africa, P. falciparum malaria prevalence is largely hypoendemic (less than 10 %), with the median below 5 % in the areas surveyed. This new map is a plausible representation of the current extent of P. falciparum risk and the most contemporary summary of the population at risk of P. falciparum malaria within these limits. For 1 billion people at risk of unstable malaria transmission, elimination is epidemiologically feasible, and large areas of Africa are more amenable to control than appreciated previously. The release of this information in the public domain will help focus future resources for P. falciparum malaria control and elimination...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) are an {{important}} tool for malaria control. ITNs are effective because they work on several parts of the mosquito feeding cycle, including both adult killing and repelling effects. Methods Using an elaborated description of the classic feeding cycle model, simple formulas have been derived to describe how ITNs change mosquito behaviour {{and the intensity of}} malaria transmission, as summarized by vectorial capacity and EIR. The predicted changes are illustrated {{as a function of the}} frequency of ITN use for four different vector populations using parameter estimates from the literature. Results The model demonstrates that ITNs simultaneously reduce mosquitoes' lifespans, lengthen the feeding cycle, and by discouraging human biting divert more bites onto non-human hosts. ITNs can substantially reduce vectorial capacity through small changes to all of these quantities. The total reductions in vectorial capacity differ, moreover, depending on baseline behavior in the absence of ITNs. Reductions in lifespan and vectorial capacity are strongest for vector species with high baseline survival. Anthropophilic and zoophilic species are affected differently by ITNs; the feeding cycle is lengthened more for anthrophilic species, and the proportion of bites that are diverted onto non-human hosts is higher for zoophilic species. Conclusion This model suggests that the efficacy of ITNs should be measured as a total reduction in transmission intensity, and that the quantitative effects will differ by species and by transmission intensity. At very high rates of ITN use, ITNs can generate large reductions in transmission intensity that could provide very large reductions in transmission intensity, and effective malaria control in some areas, especially when used in combination with other control measures. At high EIR, ITNs will probably not substantially reduce the <b>parasite</b> <b>rate,</b> but when transmission intensity is low, reductions in vectorial capacity combine with reductions in the <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> to generate very large reductions in EIR. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{longitudinal study}} of malaria incidence {{was carried out in}} randomly selected samples of the population in the villages of Bu Phram and Tablan, north-east Thailand. During the 10 -month study period 46 % of the 252 persons followed up experienced a falciparum parasitaemia, and 23 % a vivax parasitaemia. The peak of the cases occurred during a 10 -week period from late May to the end of July, with transmission apparently continuing, at lower levels, throughout the remainder of the study period. Falciparum infection rates were higher for residents of Bu Pham; vivax infection rates were the same in both villages. Certain indices declined with age in Bu Phram but not in Tablan residents. <b>Parasite</b> <b>rates</b> were higher for males than for females. Age-specific rates did not vary predictably.

40|$|Background: The {{efficient}} {{allocation of}} financial resources for malaria control using appropriate combinations of interventions requires accurate {{information on the}} geographic distribution of malaria risk. An evidence-based description of the global range of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and its endemicity has not been assembled in almost 40 y. This paper aims to define the global geographic distribution of P. falciparum malaria in 2007 {{and to provide a}} preliminary description of its transmission intensity within this range. Methods and Findings: The global spatial distribution of P. falciparum malaria was generated using nationally reported case-incidence data, medical intelligence, and biological rules of transmission exclusion, using temperature and aridity limits informed by the bionomics of dominant Anopheles vector species. A total of 4, 278 spatially unique cross-sectional survey estimates of P. falciparum <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> were assembled. Extractions from a population surface showed that 2. 37 billion people lived in areas at any risk of P. falciparum transmission in 2007. Globally, almost 1 billion people lived under unstable, or extremely low, malaria risk. Almost all P. falciparum <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> above 50 % were reported in Africa in a latitude band consistent with the distribution of Anopheles gambiae s. s. Conditions of low parasite prevalence were also common in Africa, however. Outside of Africa, P. falciparum malaria prevalence is largely hypoendemic (less than 10 %), with the median below 5 % in the areas surveyed. Conclusions: This new map is a plausible representation of the current extent of P. falciparum risk and the most contemporary summary of the population at risk of P. falciparum malaria within these limits. For 1 billion people at risk of unstable malaria transmission, elimination is epidemiologically feasible, and large areas of Africa are more amenable to control than appreciated previously. The release of this information in the public domain will help focus future resources for P. falciparum malaria control and elimination. © 2008 Guerra et al...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the anti-mosquito and antimalarial potentialities of placebo-treated versus permethrin-impregnated bed nets in north-western Guinea Bissau. Baseline, pre-intervention entomological and parasitological {{data were collected}} {{during the rainy season}} of 1990 and bed nets were distributed shortly before the rainy season of 1991. Pairs of 3 ethnically different villages were investigated. The villages in each pair were at least 2 km apart but belonged to the same ethnic group in an ecologically similar area. After one year permethrin-treated bed nets were provided to all people in one village of each pair and placebo-treated bed nets to the other villages. About 98 % of mosquitoes caught in bedrooms belonged to Anopheles gambiae and A. melas, which we consider to be the main malaria vectors in the study villages. Mean Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate in A. gambiae (9. 6 %) and A. melas (12. 4 %) was highest during October-November. The Plasmodium index in children 2 - 9 years old in the 6 villages, {{at the end of the}} rainy season 1990, ranged between 44 % and 79 %. Of these, 98 % were identified as P. falciparum, 1 % as P. malariae and 1 % as mixed infections of these species. Significant reductions of Anopheles indoor resting densities and malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> in humans were recorded in villages which had received permethrin-treated nets, but not in the control villages. The mean number of P. falciparum-infective mosquito bites received indoors in untreated villages during the rainy season was estimated to be about 4 per child and 20 per adult. This inoculation rate was reduced by at least 78 % by the use of permethrin-impregnated bed nets. The malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> and proportions of people experiencing 'disease with fever' decreased significantly in villages provided with permethrin-treated nets but not in the control villages. Impregnated nets may be an important tool to reduce disease and death due to malaria in Guinea Bissau...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{transmission}} in Equatorial Guinea and its space-time variability {{has been}} widely studied, {{but there is not}} much information about the transmission of malaria on the small island of Annobon. In 2004, two transversal studies were carried out to establish the malaria transmission pattern on Annobon and analyse the circulating Plasmodium falciparum allelic forms. Methods A blood sample was taken from the selected children in order to determine Plasmodium infection by microscopical examination and by semi-nested multiplex PCR. The diversity of P. falciparum circulating alleles was studied {{on the basis of the}} genes encoding for the merozoite surface proteins, MSP- 1 and MSP- 2 of P. falciparum. Results The crude <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> was 17 % during the dry season and 60 % during the rainy season. The percentage of children sleeping under a bed net was over 80 % in the two surveys. During the rainy season, 33. 3 % of the children surveyed were anaemic at the time of the study. No association was found between the crude <b>parasite</b> <b>rate,</b> the use of bed nets and gender, and anaemia. However, children between five and nine years of age were five times less at risk of being anaemic than those aged less than one year. A total of 28 populations of the three allelic families of the msp- 1 gene were identified and 39 of the msp- 2 gene. The variability of circulating allelic populations is significantly higher in the rainy than in the dry season, although the multiplicity of infections is similar in both, 2. 2 and 1. 9 respectively. Conclusion Based on the high degree of geographical isolation of the Annobon population and the apparent marked seasonality of the transmission, it is feasible to believe that malaria can be well controlled from this small African island. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Impact {{of indoor}} {{residual}} spraying of DDT on malaria transmission andvector density was evaluated in six villages of Shergarh PHC, Bareilly district, Uttar Pradesh under theoperational condition of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) from July 2001 to March 2002 (one transmission season only). Methods: Two rounds of DDT (50 % WDP) spraying @ 1 g/m 2 were done {{both in the}} experimental andcontrol villages by the state health authorities. The spraying in experimental villages was supervisedby Malaria Research Centre (MRC) whereas the district health authorities supervised the operation incontrol villages. Mass blood surveys were made three times— before the first round, in between thefirst and second rounds and after {{the second round of}} spraying. The blood smears were examined bythe trained microscopists of MRC, Haldwani. From the above examinations epidemiological indicatorssuch as slide positivity rate (SPR), slide falciparum rate (SFR) and infant <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> (IPR) werecalculated. All malaria positive cases were given radical treatment as per NVBDCP schedule. Entomological parameters such as per man hour mosquito density, parity rate, gonotrophic conditionand adult susceptibility status of Anopheles culicifacies to diagnostic dosages of DDT (4 %) weremonitored as per the standard techniques. Results: A total of 988. 5 kg of DDT was consumed during two rounds of spray. The house coveragevaried from 87 to 95. 3 %. Parasitological evaluation revealed significant reduction in malaria cases (p < 0. 0005) and infant <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> declined from 2. 9 to 0 %. Entomological observations revealedconsiderable reduction in the density of malaria vector An. culicifacies despite of its 21. 4 % mortalityagainst DDT test papers. Interpretation & conclusion: The overall results of the study revealed that DDT is still a viableinsecticide in indoor residual spraying owing to its effectivity in well supervised spray operation andhigh excitorepellencyfactor...|$|E
40|$|Background: Current {{understanding}} of the spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution of Plasmodium vivax is far less developed than that for P. falciparum, representing a barrier to rational strategies for control and elimination. Here we present the first systematic effort to map the global endemicity of this hitherto neglected parasite. Methodology and Findings: We first updated to the year 2010 our earlier estimate of the geographical limits of P. vivax transmission. Within areas of stable transmission, an assembly of 9, 970 geopositioned P. vivax <b>parasite</b> <b>rate</b> (PvPR) surveys collected from 1985 to 2010 were used with a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach to estimate endemicity age-standardised to the 1 – 99 year age range (PvPR 1 – 99) within every 565 km resolution grid square. The model incorporated data on Duffy negative phenotype frequency to suppress endemicity predictions, particularly in Africa...|$|E
40|$|Predicting how {{elevated}} temperatures from {{climate change}} alter host-parasite interactions requires understandings of how warming affects host susceptibility and parasite virulence. Here, {{the effect of}} elevated water temperature and parasite exposure level was tested on parasite prevalence, abundance and burden, and on fish growth, using Pomphorhynchus laevis and its fish host Squalius cephalus. At 60 days post-exposure, prevalence was higher at the elevated temperature (22 °C) than ambient temperature (18 °C), with infections achieved at considerably lower levels of exposure. Whilst parasite number was significantly higher in infected fish at 22 °C, both mean parasite weight and parasite burden was significantly higher at 18 °C. There were, however, no significant relationships between fish growth <b>rate</b> and temperature, <b>parasite</b> exposure, and the infection parameters. Thus, whilst elevated temperature significantly influenced <b>parasite</b> infection <b>rates,</b> it also impacted <b>parasite</b> development <b>rates,</b> suggesting warming could have complex implications for parasite dynamics and host resistance...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{possibility}} that domestic cattle kept in house courtyards might protect residents against malaria through zooprophylaxis. Prevalence of malaria was conducted from December 1995 to November, 1996 in human population of distract Karak (NWFP). The analysis showed that the overall incidence was higher (11. 81 %) among the population which reared cattle than among those which did not (6. 53 %). The overall incidence of the disease was higher in autumn in cattle keeping population. However, comparison of prevalence of both species of Plasmodium (P. vivax & P. falciparum) revealed {{a positive correlation between}} <b>parasite</b> <b>rates</b> and the proportion of families owing cattle. This finding supports the prediction of the Sota-Mogi theoretical model that domestic animals can enhance rather than reduce malaria transmission when vectors are zoophilic. It can be concluded that alongwith other factors, cattle also play some role in spreading of the disease...|$|R
