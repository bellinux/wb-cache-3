5000|$|Chicago Pneumatic is a {{brand name}} in the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> {{industry}} with a history traced back to 1889. John W. Duntley had in mind the idea of sourcing and selling construction tools [...] "that weren’t yet available". In 1894, he established the Chicago <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tool</b> Company, with an office in Chicago. The first plant to begin manufacturing product specifically for CP was the Boyer Machine Shop in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1901, Duntley met steel magnate Charles M. Schwab, who invested heavily in the company. On December 28, the company was incorporated and the first single-valve pneumatic hammer was patented.|$|E

50|$|An {{air pump}} is a device for pushing air. Examples include a bicycle pump, pumps {{that are used}} to aerate an {{aquarium}} or a pond via an airstone; a gas compressor used to power a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool,</b> air horn or pipe organ; a bellows used to encourage a fire; a vacuum cleaner and a vacuum pump.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> {{is first}} {{thought to have}} been used for rock {{drilling}} in 1844. Many quarries used hand held tools that required the driller to suspend himself from a rope over the quarry face in order to place the drill hole in the required position. This system used small diameter holes and was not only terribly inefficient, but very dangerous due to flying rock {{as a result of the}} inaccuracy of the drilled borehole.|$|E

50|$|Electric powered tools come in {{a variety}} of sizes from about 12 lbs - 65 lbs. They require an {{external}} power source, but do not require a compressor. Although in the past these tools did not have the power of an air or pneumatic hammer, this is changing with newer brushless-motor tools coming close to the power of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> and in some cases even matching it. Electric powered tools are useful for locations where access to a compressor is limited or impractical, such as inside a building, in a crowded construction site, or in a remote location and it is not come under earth moving equipment or tool.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to know some general specification technical terms used in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools</b> while it is also related to how to choose a good air compressor and if the tool can meet your job requirement so that an air tool can be used properly, respectively, Free Speed (rpm), Air Pressure(psi/bar), Air Consumption(cfm/scfm or m3/min), Horse Power(hp), spindle size...etc. Depending on different type of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tools,</b> there are different specification values that you need to pay attention to.|$|R

5000|$|The {{principles}} {{illustrated by}} the successful use of hydropneumatic suspension are now used in {{a broad range of}} applications, such as aircraft oleo struts and gas filled automobile shock absorbers, first patented in the U.S. in 1934 by Cleveland <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tool</b> Co. This type of suspension for automobiles was inspired by the pneumatic suspension used for aircraft landing gear, which was also partly filled with oil for lubrication and to prevent gas leakage, as patented in 1933 by the same company. Other modifications followed, with design changes such as the 1960 [...] "Double stage oleo-pneumatic shock absorber" [...] patented by Peter Fullam John and Stephan Gyurik.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool,</b> air tool, air-powered tool or pneumatic-powered tool {{is a type}} {{of power}} tool, driven by {{compressed}} air, supplied by an air compressor. Pneumatic tools can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (...) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. Pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain than their electric power tool equivalents, and have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. General grade pneumatic tools with short life span are commonly cheaper and are also called disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade pneumatic tools with long life span are more expensive. In general, pneumatic tools are cheaper than the equivalent electric-powered tools.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, {{the station}} was {{electrified}} and the lamp was replaced with a 1000 watt electric bulb, and the incandescent oil vapor lamp was moved to Au Sable Point Lighthouse in Northern Michigan. Split Rock was outfitted with a fog signal housed in a building next to the light tower. The original signal {{was a pair of}} sirens driven by two Franklin [...] gasoline-driven air compressors manufactured by Chicago <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tool</b> Company. In 1932 the gasoline engines were replaced with diesel engines. The steam sirens were replaced with a Type F-2-T diaphone (be-you) type signal in 1936. The station and the fog signal were electrified four years later, but discontinued in 1961.|$|E

5000|$|A cleco, also spelled generically cleko, is a {{fastener}} {{developed by the}} Cleveland <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Tool</b> Company. [...] Widely used in the manufacture and repair of aluminum-skinned aircraft, {{it is used to}} temporarily fasten sheets of material together, or to pieces such as stifeners, before the pieces are permanently joined. Clecos are installed in holes predrilled through the workpieces (usually holes intended for permanent fasteners installed later). They expand {{on the far side of}} the workpieces and then draw and clamp them together while maintaining the desired alignment and preventing distortion of the pieces. Clecos should fit snugly in their holes to prevent shifting of the workpieces and maintain the alignment of fastener holes which do not have Clecos in them. They are blind fasteners; so they can be installed in assemblies where the worker does not have access to the other side. If permanent fasteners are installed in Cleco holes, a Cleco will be removed when its hole is needed. If the workpieces are bonded or welded, then the Cleco holes may need to be filled later.|$|E
40|$|A {{simulated}} drywall plastering {{task was}} used in this study to evaluate the potential health and safety benefits of using a pneumatic drywall finishing system. The plastering task was performed in a controlled job setting. Muscular exertion while performing the plastering task was measured using electromyography (EMG). Usability questionnaires were given to all participants. Mixed findings were observed for the EMG dependent variables. Significant reduction in the number and duration of muscular rest and static load level were observed for the left forearm flexor muscles when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> However, significant increase in the median and peak load level were observed in the right forearm flexor muscle when working with the Apla-Tech <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The usability questionnaire indicated {{that a majority of the}} workers preferred the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool.</b> The use of ladders and rolling scaffolds was reduced when working with the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> because the tool allowed all workers to reach higher corners and ceiling height. Based on the EMG measures, tool preference and reduction of risk of traumatic slips and falls indicate that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> is an effective tool for applying compound onto drywall joints. Further studies in the field setting to verify the effectiveness of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>tool</b> should be conducted...|$|E
