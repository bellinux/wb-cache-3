40|$|Background: Management {{strategies}} for women carrying BRCA 1 and 2 mutations are becoming clearer and <b>predictive</b> <b>testing</b> for a known family mutation is commonly undertaken. Implications for {{men are not}} as clear and they participate less frequently. Patients and methods: Twenty-six men from 10 extended families underwent <b>predictive</b> <b>testing.</b> Their motivation, reaction and outcome were studied. Subjects had appropriate pre- and post-test counselling. Informed consent was obtained before <b>predictive</b> <b>testing</b> for known deleterious mutations. DNA analysis followed standard procedures. Results: Eighteen tested positive and eight negative. Four had adverse psychological reactions and three reneged on their commitments to impart results. The spouse of another man had an adverse psychological reaction to the disclosure of his positive result.

Results First-degree relatives were aware of their susceptibility to RA, but were unsure of the extent of their risk. When considering their future risk, some relatives were concerned about the potential impact that RA would have on their lives. Relatives were concerned that knowing their actual risk would increase their anxiety and would affect decisions about their future. Also, relatives were concerned about the levels of uncertainty associated with <b>predictive</b> <b>testing.</b> Those in favour of knowing their future risk felt that they would need additional support to understand the risk information and cope with the emotional impact of this information. Conclusions Identifying individuals at risk of RA may allow targeted interventions to reduce the risk and consequence of future disease; however, relatives have concerns about <b>predictive</b> <b>testing</b> and risk information. The development of strategies to quantify and communicate risk needs to take these views into account and incorporate approaches to mitigate concerns and minimise the psychological impact of risk information...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} part of the twentieth century, {{predictive}} medicine has gained currency as an important ideal in biomedical research and health care. Research in the genetic and molecular basis of disease suggested that the insights gained might be used to develop tests that predict the future health state of asymptomatic individuals.

The focus is on genetics- and genomics-based <b>predictive</b> <b>testing</b> of individuals for health purposes, but many issues are pertinent for nongenetic <b>predictive</b> <b>testing</b> as well.

The <b>predictive</b> <b>test</b> for Huntington disease (HD) has allowed those at risk to {{determine}} gene status prior to symptoms. The purpose {{of this research was}} to understand the motivation and the anticipated reactions of those requesting the test. Forty persons at 50 % risk for HD and 31 companions participated in a structured personal interview as part of the <b>predictive</b> <b>test</b> protocol. Reasons for taking the test centered on the reduction of anxiety and uncertainty associated with being at risk and enhanced planning and decision making. Participants also believed that taking the test would produce more positive than negative outcomes. With a favorable result, most anticipated a reduction of anxiety, a more normal future, and relief knowing their children would be at a very low risk. Most also cited benefits as more likely than consequences with an unfavorable result. Making the most of life, easier planning, and reduced uncertainty were rated as more likely than any of the adverse impacts, including short-term depression and becoming frightened. Almost all participants (95 %) said they would rather learn that they have the HD gene than remain at 50 % risk.
