30|$|The {{diffusion}} {{length of the}} magnetic field into the subsurface (skin depth) {{is dependent on the}} conductivity of the local region and the time <b>period</b> (<b>frequency)</b> over which the change of the magnetic field occurs. The vertical distribution of the resistivity within the Earth’s crust, and the period considered, determine the size of the induced electric field. Deeper layers are more significant at long periods, while shallow layers have a stronger influence at short periods.
