5|$|In 1997 a <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence}} of a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E

5|$|Fairley {{joined the}} Australian Army Medical Corps with {{the rank of}} captain on 1 August 1915 and was posted to Royal Melbourne Hospital as a {{resident}} medical officer. He investigated an epidemic of meningitis that was occurring in local Army camps, and his first published <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> an analysis of this disease, documenting fifty cases. In 1916, he co-authored a monograph published by the Federal government detailing 644 cases, of which 338 (52%) were fatal, this being before the invention of antibiotic drugs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Dalton orally {{presented}} his first list of relative atomic weights {{for a number}} of substances. This <b>paper</b> <b>was</b> published in 1805, but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures. The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance Thomas Thomson, in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, A System of Chemistry. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, 1808 and 1810.|$|E
