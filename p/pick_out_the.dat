5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it {{was connected to the}} Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a double-blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos to the witness does not know which photo is of the suspect.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} Defender {{projects}} were several studies {{based on the}} concept that a re-entering nuclear warhead would cause unique physical signatures while still in the upper atmosphere. It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects radar waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Stó:lō girls {{went through}} puberty rites {{at the time}} of their first menstruation.

Women would bring her fir boughs and instruct her to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> needles one at a time, but this was the only work she would be allowed to do; other women would feed and wash the girl until her first menstrual period was over. This custom was practiced widely, at least until youth were sent to residential schools.|$|E

Known throughout the textile industry as the Keighley dobby, it has since been copied, modified and manufactured {{in a variety of}} different forms. Hattersley also invented, in 1868, the skip box: a development of the circular or revolving box. This allowed the shuttle box to bypass or skip the next compartment along and <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> shuttle of the following one.|$|E
25|$|Informally put, the axiom {{of choice}} says that given any {{collection}} of bins, each containing at least one object, {{it is possible to}} make a selection of exactly one object from each bin. In many cases such a selection can be made without invoking the {{axiom of choice}}; this is in particular the case if the number of bins is finite, or if a selection rule is available: a distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one object in each bin. To give an informal example, for any (even infinite) collection of pairs of shoes, one can <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection, but for an infinite collection of pairs of socks (assumed to have no distinguishing features), such a selection can be obtained only by invoking the axiom of choice.|$|E
25|$|His {{method of}} work {{typically}} entailed careful {{preparation for the}} shoot, with the lighting and studio props (of which he used many) arranged in advance. His instructions to models are remembered as being brief and to the point. His published work uses lighting to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> subject; he frequently used four spotlights, often one of them pointing down from the ceiling. Only rarely do his photos include shadows falling on {{the background of the}} set. Horst rarely, if ever, used filters. While most of his work is in black & white, much of his color photography includes largely monochromatic settings to set off a colorful fashion. Horst's color photography did include documentation of society interior design, well noted in the volume Horst Interiors. He photographed a number of interiors designed by Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade of Denning & Fourcade and often visited their homes on Manhattan and Long Island. After making the photograph, Horst generally left it up to others to develop, print, crop, and edit his work.|$|E

500|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} filming {{days were}} spent shooting {{the scenes of}} McGarrett and Danny assaulting Hesse's freighter. The fight scene between McGarrett and Hesse were shot with the portraying actors. Stunt doubles were on hand, but the production staff found they were not needed in the fight scenes until both characters fell into a boat below or the sea. The first [...] "Book 'em, Danno" [...] line was filmed several times as the staff wanted to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> right version. Some of the last scenes to be shot were the cold open scenes. Three days were spent on those scenes, and were filmed at Kualoa Ranch. In one scene of the episode, McGarrett goes to the garage of his father's house and unravels a Mercury Marquis. The car was in fact used on the original show and was on loan to the production staff by its owner, who was the stand-in for Jack Lord, who played the original McGarrett.|$|E
500|$|A breaker boy was a coal-mining {{worker in}} the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to {{separate}} impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys. The use of breaker boys began around 1866. For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> impurities, and then let the coal pass {{on to the next}} breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into [...] "clean" [...] coal bins.|$|E

[...] Crowley, after giving them his blood, disappears but tells them Castiel can help them kill Dick. [...] Castiel refuses to help as he doesn't want to fight and after he disappears to retrieve a board game, Meg explains that since Castiel had the Leviathans within him, he is able to tell them apart even in their human forms and can <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> real Dick Roman. [...] Castiel watches as Sam and Dean burn Bobby's flask and put him at rest and later takes Dean to where he has stored the Impala and agrees to help. [...] Castiel, Sam and Dean infiltrate Sucrocorp thanks to a distraction from Meg and he and Dean confront Dick Roman in the labs. [...] Dick throws Castiel across the room when he tries to attack, but after Dean fails to kill Dick, Castiel holds his head in place from behind allowing Dean to stab Dick through the neck with the weapon, killing him. As a result of this, Castiel and Dean are sucked into Purgatory with Dick's soul and after letting Dean know this and that {{they are more likely to}} die than get out, Castiel disappears, leaving Dean alone.|$|E

2500|$|The use of accidentals {{in medieval}} and renaissance music differs {{significantly}} from modern practice. Medieval notation used two accidental signs, the [...] "b molle" [...] (...) and the [...] "b durum" [...] (...) [...] While the former was identical in {{form to the}} modern flat sign (...) , the latter could be written in forms that resemble either the modern sharp (...) or the modern natural (...) , but these functions were not distinguished from {{each other as they}} are today. The b molle served to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lower of two alternative semitone steps for a given note (e.g., a B as opposed to a B), while the b durum served to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> higher one (e.g., B as opposed to B, but also F as opposed to F, etc.). The meanings of both signs thus overlaps with that of the natural sign today. Until the 16th century, only the flat signs regularly occurred as key signatures {{at the beginning of a}} staff (one or at most two flats). Both forms of accidentals could occur as temporary accidentals elsewhere; however, in practice they were often not written but left to the performer to infer according to the rules of counterpoint and musica ficta.|$|E

[...] Politely asking to borrow the manager's note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed them up, then extended the seven bills together, adding, [...] "Here, let's see you <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> colored one".

2500|$|However, it {{was found}} that the P-70 was not very {{successful}} in actual combat interception of Japanese fighters at night. [...] It was issued P-38H Lightnings stock day fighters with no radar or any other equipment for finding the enemy at night. The Lightning pilots would wait until the enemy was over a target and, hopefully, illuminated by the defender's searchlights. They would then try to <b>pick</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> outline of the enemy aircraft and intercept. This method had its dangers since the P-38 was subjecting itself to antiaircraft fire from defenders as well as gunners aboard the Japanese bombers. The squadron received the P-61 Black Widow to replace the P-38s/P-70s in June 1944.
