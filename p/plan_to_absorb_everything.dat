Being a multipotentialite is our destiny. We have many paths and we pursue all of them, either sequentially or simultaneously (or both).Multipotentialites thrive on learning, exploring, and mastering new skills. We are excellent at bringing disparate ideas together in creative ways. This makes us incredible innovators and problem solvers.When it comes to new interests that emerge, our insatiable curiosity leads us <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>everything</b> we can get our hands on.

5000|$|Hitherto Charles had {{aimed at}} {{supporting}} the weaker Slavonic power against the stronger; {{but now that}} Russia seemed about to disappear from among the nations of Europe, Swedish statesmen naturally sought some compensation for the expenses of the war before Poland had had time <b>to</b> <b>absorb</b> <b>everything.</b> A beginning {{was made by the}} siege and capture of County of Kexholm in Russian Finland March 2, 1611; and on July 16, Great Novgorod was occupied and a convention concluded with the magistrates of that wealthy city whereby Charles IX's second son Philip was to be recognized as tsar, unless in the meantime, relief came to Great Novgorod from Moscow. But now, when everything depended on a concentration of forces, Charles's imprudent assumption of the title of [...] "King of the Lapps of Nordland" [...] which people properly belonged to the Danish Crown, involved him in another war with Denmark, a war known in Scandinavian history as the Kalmar War because the Swedish fortress of Kalmar was the chief theatre of hostilities. Thus the Swedish forces were diverted from their real objective and transferred to another field where even victory would have been comparatively unprofitable. But it was disaster, not victory, which Charles IX of Sweden reaped from this foolhardy enterprise.|$|R

The US is urging the Iraqi government to rapidly integrate the Sunni fighters into the national Shia-led security forces. Some experts warn there are similarities between the awakening councils and armed groups in past conflicts that were used for short-term military gains but ended up being roadblocks for state building.

Kakuju mystically sealed the valley and isolated the village to prevent these wandering, imperfect dolls to escape and harm anyone. Eager to become truly human and please Kakuju, Utsugi joined up with Naraku and his incarnations in order to summon Kururugi to the past.
