5000|$|The {{area around}} the {{community}} was settled in the 1880s, with ranching and sugar beet cultivation as the primary industries. In 1903, the town was platted by F.C. Grable and promoted by his brother Sherman. It was named [...] "Waverly" [...] after the Walter Scott novels by a <b>post</b> <b>clerk</b> in the early 20th century. Most of the platted development did not occur, however, and the town remained very small in size. In the early 20th century, it was incorporated for a time as the Town of Waverly and governed by a board of trustees. At its height, the town had several stores, a church, and post office, {{as well as the}} school, built in 1918. The girls basketball team won state championships in 1939 and 1940. In 1960, the school district was consolidated with the larger nearby Poudre School District, and the school became an elementary school. The elementary school was closed in 1992, and for the next 12 years, the building was used as a teen program center by the school district. In 2004, the school district moved the programs to Fort Collins and the building was sold to a private non-profit organization. Most recently, the building serves as an alternative teen learning center by Turning Point, the meeting place for the Ridin' for the Brand Cowboy Church, and occasionally as a community hall.|$|E

40|$|The design, {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} an experimental translation system that aims to aid transactions between a deaf person and a <b>clerk</b> in a <b>Post</b> Office is described. The system uses a speech recognizer to recognize speech from the <b>Post</b> Office <b>clerk</b> and then synthesizes the recognized phrase in British Sign language (BSL) using a specially developed avatar. The main objective in developing this prototype system was to determine how useful {{it would be to}} a customer whose first language was BSL and to discover what areas of the system required more research and development to make it more effective. The system was evaluated by six pre-lingually profoundly deaf people and three <b>Post</b> Office <b>clerks.</b> Deaf users and <b>Post</b> Office <b>clerks</b> were supportive of the system, but the former group required a higher quality of signing from the avatar and the latter a system that was less constrained in the phrases it could recognize: both these areas are being addressed in the next phase of the development...|$|R
