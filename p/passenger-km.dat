50|$|While {{the former}} Soviet Union got a late (and slow) start with rail {{electrification}} in the 1930s it eventually became the {{world leader in}} electrification {{in terms of the}} volume of traffic under the wires. During its last 30 years the Soviet Union hauled about as much rail freight as all the other countries in the world combined and in the end, over 60% of this was by electric locomotives. Electrification was cost effective due to the very high density of traffic and was at times projected to yield at least a 10% return on electrification investment (to replace diesel traction). By 1990, the electrification was about half 3 kV DC and half 25 kV AC 50 Hz and 70% of rail <b>passenger-km</b> was by electric railways.|$|E
50|$|Since privatisation, {{the number}} of {{national}} rail journeys had increased by 117% by 2014 (see graph in the introduction) and {{the number of}} <b>passenger-km</b> had more than doubled. There is controversy as to {{how much of this is}} due to privatisation, and how much is due to other factors such as rising fuel prices, road congestion, low unemployment, and in particular, GDP growth. Critics of privatisation such as the RMT union have pointed out that passenger numbers started rising 18 months before the privatisation process began, as the economy started recovering from the recession of the early 1990s. However this increase has kept going during the entire duration of privatisation, with passenger numbers growing much faster than comparable European countries such as France or Germany.|$|E

30|$|It is well {{recognized}} that the design of optimal fares for transport firms depends on the goals {{that are to be}} maximised, e.g. [1].

However, firms and transport authorities may also maximize other goals than profit and consumer surplus (e.g. [5, 6]).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} urban {{passenger}} transport eco-efficiency, {{which can be}} defined as the production of maximum benefits to society while minimising environmental impacts from urban transport’s inputs of energy and materials. Researchers have intensively studied transport’s varied environmental impacts, particularly through Life Cycle Assessment; this paper argues that primary transport energy per capita is presently the best measure of impact. Although transport’s societal benefits have generally been regarded as self-evident, access to out-of-home activities, not <b>passenger-km,</b> should be considered as the fundamental useful output of an urban transport system, since transport is a derived demand. We argue that access levels are roughly similar in all high-income OECD cities, so that these cities can be ranked on transport eco-efficiency simply on the basis of per capita primary transport energy...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{interurban}} passenger transport model with modal competition, where modes {{are perceived as}} differentiated products, and capture all major externalities. Our objective is to establish whether alternative regulatory regimes, which may involve road tolls, {{may lead to a}} traffic allocation, user welfare, and total welfare that may be closer to the social optimum. An empirical application to interurban Spanish travel is undertaken. We find that the private regime yields the lowest total welfare level: 12. 6 % below the social optimum level. Optimum pricing requires a toll on car transport of 5. 1 cents of per <b>passenger-km,</b> and a price decrease of all other modes, relative to the current regime. Finally, the social optimum without toll regime attains the welfare level closest to the social optimum, though it implies a reallocation of welfare from firms to users and higher environmental costs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} environmental costs {{in a set}} of 36 European airline markets. Cost are calculated for noise, air pollution and accident risk using data on aircraft emissions, exposure-response parameters and economic valuation of environmental goods. The 'medium value' cost estimate is 0. 0201 ECU per <b>passenger-km.</b> This result suggests that environmental costs represent only a small fraction (2. 5 %) of the internal cost of aviation as measured by the average ticket price. Noise costs are the dominant environmental cost at some 75 % of the cost total. The medium estimates are sensitive to changes in the various assumptions in the pathways: a low and high estimate are three times lower and five times higher, respectively, than the medium estimate. The study further suggests that there are environmental economies of scale in air transport and that Chapter 2 aircraft are about a factor four more environmentally costly than Chapter 3 aircraft. ...|$|E
40|$|Passenger and freight {{transport}} continuously {{in terms of}} <b>passenger-km</b> and ton-km continuously grew in the last decades in EU 27, only interrupted by the economic crisis. The contribution of transport to total GHG emissions in 2007 reached a share of 20 %. Facing fossil fuel scarcity in the coming decades, these developments demonstrate the responsibility of actors in the transport sector to stop this trend. Policy-makers reacted by setting CO 2 targets for passenger car and light duty vehicle fleets in EU 27 until 2015 and 2020. Manufacturers already offer a range of efficient ICE vehicles, but even the 2020 targets can hardly be achieved by only selling vehicles with ICE. Alternative fuel technologies for passenger cars need to be pushed. The question to be raised is how to accelerate the diffusion of alternative fuel technologies efficiently. The paper at hand analyses the potential and suitable incentives to accelerate the diffusion of alternative fuel technologies with the integrated assessment model ASTRA.
