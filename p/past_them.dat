5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains a number of software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough to get <b>past</b> <b>them.</b> There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some glitches and lowers the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping <b>past</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|When Grace (Debra Messing) and {{her boyfriend}} Leo (Harry Connick Jr.) take a walk around Central Park, they notice a tent and a van parked nearby, after a bride and groom ran <b>past</b> <b>them.</b> Eager {{to know what is}} happening, Grace stops by the van, sees Katie Couric, and asks her what is going on. Katie tells Grace that The Today Show is having massive {{televised}} weddings in the park for ratings sweeps week. When Katie asks Grace and Leo if they would like to get married, Leo says yes, but Grace believes he is being sarcastic, only later realizing that he is serious. Leo explains to Grace that because they originally met in a park, they should also get married in a park. Leo proposes and Grace accepts, despite that the two have only known each other for two months.|$|E
5|$|While Philip's fleet was {{wintering}} in Bargylia, {{the combined}} Pergamese and Rhodian fleet blockaded the harbour. The {{situation in the}} Macedonian camp became so grave that the Macedonians were close to surrendering. The dire situation was alleviated somewhat by supplies sent by Zeuxis. Philip, however, managed to get out by trickery. He sent an Egyptian deserter to Attalus and the Rhodians {{to say that he}} was preparing to attack the allies the next day. Upon hearing the news, Attalus and the Rhodians started preparing the fleet for the oncoming attack. While the allies were making their preparations, Philip slipped <b>past</b> <b>them</b> by night with his fleet, leaving numerous campfires burning to give the appearance that he remained in his camp.|$|E
5|$|Murat and Kellermann {{immediately}} {{pounced on}} the supporting Liechtenstein Dragoons who were {{too slow to}} respond and routed them as well. The fleeing Austrian horsemen crashed {{into the ranks of}} Pilatti's rattled troopers and carried them away. As the mob of terrified cavalry stampeded <b>past</b> <b>them,</b> the exhausted Austrian infantry of the main body lost heart, provoking a wild rush to the rear. The gun teams fled, pursued by French cavalry, while their whole infantry line advanced westward. The second grenadier brigade under GM Karl Philippi von Weidenfeld and some unpanicked cavalry delayed Boudet’s advance long enough for O’Reilly’s cavalry to return, and together with Frimont, they mounted a last defense around Marengo village as night fell, allowing the Austrian centre to reach safety behind the Bormida. Ott with the Austrian left failed to intervene and found his retreat through Castel Ceriolo blocked by French troops advancing northwest from the centre, but managed to fight {{his way back to the}} Bormida bridgehead.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May {{the brigade}} became the corps reserve and at noon {{were ordered to}} assist the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade in their attack on El Haud. The {{regiment}} crossed the bridge and started forward, through artillery fire, first walking then increasing their pace to a canter, until they reached cover. But then they were ordered back and {{had to return to}} Umm Es Shert, so they headed back through the shellfire until they reached the village. They remained there overnight until ordered forward to support the 4th Light Horse Brigade defending the road from the Ed Damieh ford to Es Salt, which was the only route back {{for the rest of the}} force attacking Es Salt. For the next day the regiment held a defensive position along the road, and then moved, dismounted, into the mountains to help the Australian Mounted Division extricate themselves. On 3 May, once the Australians had moved <b>past</b> <b>them,</b> the regiment walked back down the track behind them, shelled by Turkish artillery. They then moved into the lines held by the infantry until the other forces had reached safety, before forming the rearguard back to Ghoraniyeh, arriving at 16:00 on 5 May.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April, Bader {{informed}} Roatta of {{the need}} to take action immediately to relieve the besieged Croatian garrison at Rogatica, and by 20 April was advising his superiors that the joint German-Italian operation had miscarried due to Italian inaction. In the wake of Francetić's offensive, the Germans pre-emptively moved to clear the area north of the demarcation line before the formal start of the operation. This advance towards the Drina from 20–30 April, coordinated with NDH forces, was the first phase of Operation Trio (Trio I). The 718th Infantry Division advanced from assembly areas in Sarajevo, Olovo and Tuzla, with the aim of relieving Rogatica and clearing the surrounding area of Partisans. The fighting became very confused, with the Chetniks, who were under attack from the Black Legion, avoiding the German units, who went <b>past</b> <b>them</b> to attack the Partisans. The Partisan main force avoided fighting the Black Legion, instead attacking the Chetniks from the rear while they were engaged against Francetić's troops. The Italian 5th Alpine Division Pusteria utilised Chetnik troops from the Sandžak as auxiliaries during their advance on Čajniče which coincided with the German-NDH advance towards the Drina. Rogatica was relieved without fighting on 27 April, and the combined force reached the Drina three days later.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{began at}} {{daylight}} on 27 March; the 8th Squadron {{moved across the}} plain to Kusr, where their progress was stopped by heavy Turkish small arms fire. The squadron formed a defensive line, while the 1st Squadron moved <b>past</b> <b>them</b> {{on the right and}} captured a small hill. Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire grew heavier all day, and another attempt by the 8th Squadron to move forward at 16:00 also failed. At 19:25 the Turks counter-attacked the 1st Squadron, but were forced to retire. That night patrols were sent to reconnoitre the Turkish positions, so they could be more easily attacked the next day. At dawn on 28 March the entire division tried another attack. The 1st Squadron managed to capture a small trench, but without their artillery support they were unable to move any further forward in the face of heavy Turkish machine-gun fire. All that day and night they managed to hold onto what they had won, waiting for reinforcement to continue the attack.|$|E

5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went <b>past</b> <b>them,</b> and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|The main access {{route to}} Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley {{formed in the}} {{mountains}} by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu {{to the west and}} with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. <b>Past</b> <b>them,</b> at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a last line of defense.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} British {{landings}} early on 9September, Scanzano {{was attacked by}} American B-26 Marauders from the 17th and 310th Bombardment Groups. Then, just as the Allied flotilla approached Taranto, the Italian battleships Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio and three cruisers were observed leaving the harbour. The flotilla went to action stations, but the Italian ships just sailed <b>past</b> <b>them</b> en route to Malta to surrender {{in accordance with the}} agreement between the Allies and the Italian government. At 15:00, the flotilla reached the minefield guarding the entrance to Taranto. The destroyer HMS Javelin negotiated the minefield and entered the harbour. Two hours later, Javelin returned with an Italian harbour pilot on board. HMS Penelope and USS Boise were guided safely into the harbour and alongside the jetty, where they disembarked the troops they were carrying, while the other ships in the flotilla remained outside the port and used small ship's boats to take their soldiers ashore. The port's facilities were all in working order and were soon unloading the ships.|$|E

5|$|At 12:15, {{with the}} 47th Battalion having {{given way to}} the German onslaught and {{withdrawing}} <b>past</b> <b>them</b> up towards the high ground, the two forward companies of the 48th on the embankment began to withdraw, leaving the northern-most company in its posts around the gully near the Albert–Amiens road. Soon after, the northern company was forced to withdraw its posts on the southern side of the gully. When he heard of the withdrawal, Leane sent forward his second-in-command to establish the line that the battalion would now attempt to hold. By 13:30, the 48th was still holding its left flanking posts near the Albert–Amiens road, {{but the rest of}} the battalion had withdrawn to Pioneer Trench on the high ground. The left flank posts were not withdrawn until about 15:30. At this point, a counterattack was ordered, involving the 49th Battalion of the 13th Brigade, which had been in reserve, with all but the far left flank of the 12th Brigade conforming with its advance. Sinclair-Maclagan wanted to use four available tanks to support the attack, but this was refused by the brigade commanders. Deayton surmises that this rejection of the tanks was at the urging of Leane, who had taken such a negative view of them at Bullecourt. Sinclair-Maclagan then argued that the objective of both brigades must be to retake the railway line, but this was opposed by Gellibrand, supported up by Leane, whose opinion he still valued highly. They argued that the 12th Brigade should only aim to retake the former support line partway down the hill. Sinclair-Maclagan's view prevailed, possibly as he was acting in accordance with direction from higher headquarters. Despite this, Leane, as the commander of the forward troops of the 12th Brigade, once again displayed his strong independent streak, disobeying those orders and directing the troops' main effort towards recapturing the support trenches.|$|E
