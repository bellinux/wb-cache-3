These knaves think vastly more of their own privileges than of the good of the State, or even of the safety of the town. Here, as in Ghent, the people are divided into sections and parties, who, when there is no one else to quarrel with, are ever ready to fly at each other's throats. Each of these leaders of guilds and <b>presidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>chambers</b> considers himself a little god, and it is quite enough if anyone else expresses an opinion for the majority to take up at once the opposite view." ...|$|E
60|$|Such was {{the state}} of things when the only man whom the {{democracy}} would listen to and obey fell by the assassin's knife, and his death and the obstinate stupidity of the burghers of Antwerp sealed {{the fate of the}} city. Sainte Aldegonde had hailed the arrival of Elizabeth's envoy, and consulted with him as to the steps to be taken for the defence of the city. He himself did not believe in the possibility of the river being stopped. It was nearly half a mile in width and sixty feet in depth, with a tidal rise and fall of eleven feet. Ned agreed with the governor or burgomaster -- for this was Saint Aldegonde's title -- that the work of blocking this river seemed impossible, but his reliance upon the opinion of the prince was so great that he did what he could towards persuading the populace to permit the plans to be carried out. But Elizabeth had so often disappointed the people of the Netherlands that her envoy possessed no authority, and the magistrates, with whom were the ward masters, the deans of all the guilds, the <b>presidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>chambers</b> and heads of colleges, squabbled and quarrelled among themselves, and nothing was done.|$|E

However, in early 1994, the eighth plan {{had not yet}} been announced, mainly because the successive changes of government in 1993 forced ministers to focus on short-term issues.

50|$|Doumer, who {{was sent}} by French {{government}} to administer Indochina in 1897, {{made a series of}} reforms that would last till the collapse of French authority in Indochina. First, he gave greater political autonomy to Cambodian monarch and limited the executive authority of resident-general in return for Cambodian recognition of French land titles and opening of its economy.

As founder of ITPA, Jules-Edouard Lucas appointed Henri Bocher as director and Tony Ballu - a farmer based in Epernay who used innovative methods involving agricultural machinery - as his deputy, and made the farm in Gournay-sur-Marne available {{for use by the}} school. In 1923, Lucas became secretary of the Seine-et-Oise Departmental Agricultural Office, and in 1927 he was elected {{as a member of the}} Seine-et-Oise Chamber of Agriculture. He was immediately elected President of the Chamber and sat alongside his peers at the first meeting of the <b>Presidents</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chambers</b> of Agriculture in October 1927, organized by Joseph Faure. At this meeting he remained silent, but at the following session on March 22, 1928, he spoke at length in favor of an [...] "organized secretariat", [...] "which would be responsible for both documentation and implementation", and which would have sufficient resources to carry out its work effectively. This would become the Assemblée permanente des Chambres d'agriculture (APCA), and the new Board of Directors elected Lucas as secretary the very same day, on March 22, 1928.|$|E
