However, today's high rates of inflation, coupled with regulatory lag, have resulted in profit erosion which impacts adversely on the utility's ability to attract new investor capital. One possible {{solution to this problem}} is the two-way automatic revenue <b>adjustment</b> <b>clause,</b> coupled with an incentive to higher efficiency. Several automatic revenue <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses,</b> proposed or in operation, are reviewed by the author, with emphasis on the "cost and efficiency <b>adjustment</b> <b>clause.</b> " If a utility maintains its total productivity {{at the level of the}} prior period, this <b>adjustment</b> <b>clause</b> permits half the increase in unit costs to be recovered automatically; the other half may be passed on to the extent the company is able to increase its productivity.

This Note advocates for all state public utility commissions regulating natural gas distribution companies to reform purchased gas <b>adjustment</b> <b>clause</b> design in order to incentivize local gas distribution companies to reduce lost and unaccounted for gas. This Note also argues that the method used by the New York State Public Service Commission, limiting gas cost recovery to the historical average of actual lost gas, most closely aligns with the statutory purposes underlying laws that prohibit unjust and unreasonable rates, while avoiding Constitutional takings concerns...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of fuel adjustment mechanisms for the economic efficiency of the U. S., focusing on fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses</b> (FAC) for electricity rates. Fuel adjustment mechanisms used in electricity and natural gas pricing are formulae that provide for automatic adjustments in output prices in response {{to changes in the}} factor prices of boiler fuels and wellhead gas, respectively. Fuel adjustment mechanisms were first utilized in the U. S. during World War I to enable the regulatory process to function in response to the rapid increase in coal prices. A central feature of an FAC is that it acts directly on the output price without a specific consideration of its effect on the rate of return earned by the firm once the adjustment has been made. One of the principal arguments against fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses</b> is that they dampen incentives for the choice of the least-cost fuel supply. Fuel adjustment mechanisms can lead to inefficiency both with respect to the choice by utility of a technology and its selection of fuel supply sources. The fuel supply decision poses an efficiency problem primarily in conjunction with decreasing returns to scale, since a firm with non-decreasing returns to scale and an output price at least as great as marginal cost will choose the fuel supply source that is anticipated to have the smallest factor price increase. When there is an incentive to purchase the inefficient fuel, the collection lag can be extended to induce efficiency. This extension, however, affects the choice of technology by reducing both the technically efficient fuel-capital ratio and the ratio preferred by the firm. Fuel <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses</b> thus pose a complex efficiency problem, which can be compensated for but not eliminated by the design of the adjustment formula. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the cost of highway {{construction}} is affected by the cost of crude oil. While this relationship is highly visible for construction items such as asphalt cement (a by-product in the process of refining oil), the effects of the crude oil prices on the cost of other construction items, such as concrete cement or construction operations are less direct, but equally important. For unit-based contracts without price <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses,</b> this relationship is of a particular significance. In fact, an increase in price of fuel could result in substantial losses, as contractors are not protected. Hence, to hedge against this risk, contractors are likely to incorporate a premium in bid prices to manage project risks. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the evidence of this behaviour. New evidence shows that the expected change in oil prices (the difference between future and spot price) and the implied volatility in the oil market affect the price of bid items for contracts without price <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses.</b> Such results allow for more effective implementation of risk management on project- and programme-level basis.

The result are follows. The <b>production</b> <b>adjustment</b> and the shipment adjustment according to the usage are worked by the producer group. 　Of them, the latter is tried to maximize the revenues in the market of the mandarin orange to be eaten raw. Therefore, it is requested to keep planned quantities in the market of the mandarin orange to be eaten raw but is not in the market of it for processing. By calculating the constant imperfect competitive (λr＝ 0. 2) for years, it becomes evident that the shipment adjustment operates quasi effectively because of such an adjustment method. Meanwhile the market price falls below the marginal cost recently in the market for processing, so the imperfect competitive is calculated as minus. In fact, it becomes evident that the mandarin orange is dumped to keep the revenue in the market to be eaten raw. For this reason, it is suggested to tighten the <b>production</b> <b>adjustment</b> and to decrease the mandarin orange for processing...|$|R

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that macro-economic conditions, such as prices of commodities (e. g. oil, cement and steel) affect the cost of construction projects. In a volatile market environment, highway agencies often pass such risk to contractors using fixed-price contracts. In turn, the contractors respond by adding premiums in bid prices. If the contractors overprice the risk, the price of fixed-price contract could exceed {{the price of the}} contract with <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses.</b> Consequently, highway agencies have the opportunity to design a contract that not only reduces the future risk of exposure, but also reduces the initial contract price. The main goal of this dissertation is to investigate the impact of commodity price risk on construction cost and the optimal risk hedging of such risks using price <b>adjustment</b> <b>clauses.</b> More specifically, the objective of the dissertation is to develop models that can help highway agencies manage commodity price risks. In this dissertation, a weighted least square regression model is used to estimate the risk premium; both univariate and vector time series models are estimated and applied to simulate changes in commodity prices over time, including the effect of correlation; while the genetic algorithm is used as a solution approach to a multi-objective optimization formulation. The data set used in this dissertation consists of TxDOT bidding data, market-based data including New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) future options data, and Engineering News-Record (ENR) material cost index data. The results of this dissertation suggest that the optimal risk mitigation actions are conditional on owners' risk preferences, correlation among the prices of commodities, and volatility of the market...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} devoted to the {{comparative}} static analysis and econometric estimation of farm household decisions under both standard and agricultural taxes. Accounting for labor market constraints a non-separable model is constructed implying increasing per-unit costs of accessing labor markets. To control for tax-induced adjustments related to labor market imperfections we compare the results to those derived from a separable approach, assuming perfect labor markets. Theoretical results suggest that most tax-induced responses are ambivalent mainly caused by shadow prices effects. Further, tax-induced effects differ between the two model versions. In particular standard taxes may imply <b>production</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the case of non-separability. Thus, income and value-added taxes are no more necessarily superior to agricultural taxes.

40|$|Firms {{respond to}} {{fluctuations}} in demand by changing their inventories and {{their levels of}} production. The relative magnitudes of the inventory and production responses {{have important implications for}} the overall cyclical behavior of the economy. Government policies that affect the costs of holding inventories and the costs of the temporary layoffs that accompany reductions in the level of output can therefore have significant effects on the magnitude of aggregate fluctuations. The current paper presents new econometric evidence on the nature of inventory adjustments and then examines how changes in inventory behavior affect the overall business cycle. The analysis in this paper was motivated by our discovery that the parameter estimates of the traditional productional adjustment model are not consistent with the observed magnitudes of inventory change and the production. We have shown here that this <b>production</b> <b>adjustment</b> model is a special case of a more general two-speed adjustment process in which both production and inventory targets adjust slowly. Our estimates of the two-speed model clearly reject the <b>production</b> <b>adjustment</b> model in favor of the target adjustment model in which the inventory target adjusts slowly to changes in sales but production adjusts rapidly to changes in the desired inventory. Our analysis of the spectral properties of a simple macroeconomic model show that the <b>production</b> <b>adjustment</b> model and the target adjustment model can imply quite different cyclical behavior of the economy as a whole. Depending on the autocorrelation of the disturbance, government policies that reduce the speed with which production responds to changes in desired inventories and that place greater reliance on inventory adjustment may stabilize national income. Further analysis of these questions with more realistic models would clearly be desirable. ...|$|R

The supply function is modeled with a local linear trend and a strictly exogenous autoregressive distributed lag price. The seasonality in the data is adjusted by a structural time-series model. In the 1970 - 1997 period, there were major dairy policy changes in Japan: a <b>production</b> <b>adjustment,</b> related penalties, and two-tier pricing. Hokkaido is the region that mainly provides the supply of raw milk for milk products, while Tofuken is the region that mainly produces drinking milk.

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{negotiation}} of accounting rules in the purchase price <b>adjustment</b> <b>clause</b> of corporate acquisition agreements. Purchase price adjustments make the deal value contingent on the target's closing working capital or net worth. Some purchase price adjustments use "rigid" accounting and specify which measurement rules {{will be used to}} prepare the closing-date balance sheet. Many more use "flexible" accounting and require only GAAP compliance. I provide evidence that hidden action and adverse selection problems determine whether the buyer and seller use rigid or flexible accounting. I also provide evidence that this choice is associated with other features of the contract related to purchase price adjustment flexibility and to the prospect of hold-up. Estimates of the effect of rigid accounting on finalized purchase price adjustments are consistent with implications of the adverse selection and hold-up problems. by Derek Christopher Johnson.

40|$|Increasing {{demands to}} {{harvesting}} production and quality require improved management practices. This study’s {{purpose was to}} analyze the impact of industrial context on procurement, management, and development of harvesting services. Using interviews, functions were modeled at two forest owners associations (FOAs) with outsourced harvesting services. One FOA had its own sawmills, requiring frequent harvesting <b>production</b> <b>adjustments</b> to meet varying volume demand in the short-term. The long-term uncertainty was however low because of good visibility of future demand (> 6 months). The other FOA did not own mills and produced wood according to fixed six-month delivery contracts. This meant few short-term <b>production</b> <b>adjustments,</b> but long-term uncertainty due to low visibility of future demand. Demand uncertainty resulted in corresponding needs for harvesting capacity flexibility. This could have been met by a corresponding proportion of short-term contracts for capacity. In this study, however, a large proportion (> 90 %) of long-term contracts was found, motivated by a perceived contractor shortage. It was also noted that although contractor investment cycles (4 – 6 years) matched the FOAs’ strategic horizons (3 – 5 years), contractors’ investment plans were not considered in the FOAs’ strategic planning. The study concludes with a characterization of different FOA contexts and their corresponding needs for capacity flexibility...|$|R

40|$|As of 1997, private adjustable-rate loan {{contracts}} must {{be provided}} with a clause governing interest rate changes which meets {{the requirements of the}} Consumer Protection Act. This legal stipulation is of particular importance for private loans granted by banks and for loans to individuals. More than two-thirds of all private loans granted by Austrian banks provide for variable interest rates and are thus subject to fluctuation mechanisms which need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. Most of the private adjustable-rate loans granted by banks since 1997 include an interest rate <b>adjustment</b> <b>clause</b> according to which any change in the interest rate needs {{to be based on the}} arithmetic mean from the Vienna Interbank Offered Rate for three-month funds or (as of the start of Monetary Union) the Euro Interbank Offered Rate for three-month funds and the secondary market yield for federal bonds. Empirical evidence obtained from simple correlation and regression analyses supports the assumption that the standard rate covenant fully complies with the relevant criteria of the Consumer Protection Act ("factual justification" or "independence from the entrepreneur's will"). The change of the average obtained from the two interest indicators reflects to a high degree the development of average refinancing costs by the Austrian banks since the mid 1990 s (for database reasons, a comparison with the period before 1995 is not possible). An attractive and relatively simple theoretical approach to justifying the standard rate clause is provided by interpreting it as a rule for sharing macroeconomically caused interest rate risks. Assuming approximately risk-neutral banks, this adjustment mechanism warrants that the non-diversifiable macroeconomic risk of a change in the interest rate is optimally spread between approximately risk-neutral borrowers and investors. In the given context of the model, an optimal situation for all players involved is obtained when banks on balance carry no risk, whereas the borrower and investor share the macro-economic risk of a change in the interest rate at equal parts. Near-risk-neutral banks carry the macroeconomic risk of a change in the interest rate (at 50 percent) only when the borrower and investor belong to different risk preference categories (e. g., the borrower is averse to risk and the investor is more or less risk-neutral, or vice versa).
