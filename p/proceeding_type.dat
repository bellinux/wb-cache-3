These are sound and, in {{the case}} of distributive analysis frameworks, complete wrt. appropriate natural semantics on abstract properties. Applications include certification of analyses and "optimization" of functional correctness proofs alongside programs.

The rules of the type system are derivable in the Hoare logic for the abstract property semantics and those in turn in the Hoare logic for the transition trace semantics. This reduction of the burden of trusting the certification vehicle can be compared to foundational proof-carrying code, where general-purpose program logics are preferred to special-purpose type systems and universal logic to program logics.
