While there were no paintings of the two images to sell, and Hogarth did not sell the plates in his lifetime, variations and rare impressions existed and fetched decent prices when offered at auction. The first (proof) and second states of Beer Street were issued {{with the image of}} the Frenchman being lifted by the blacksmith, this was substituted in 1759 by the more commonly seen third state in which the Frenchman was replaced by the <b>pavior</b> or drayman fondling the housemaid, and a wall added behind the sign-painter. Prints in the first state sold at George Baker's sale in 1825 for £2.10s, but a unique proof of Gin Lane with many variations, particularly a blank area under the roof of Kilman's, sold for £15.15s. at the same sale. Other minor variations on Gin Lane exist – the second state gives the falling child an older face, perhaps in an attempt to diminish the horror, but these too were widely available and thus inexpensive. Copies of the originals by other engravers, such as Ernst Ludwig Riepenhausen, Samuel Davenport and Henry Adlard were also in wide circulation in the 19th century.|$|E

One evening I went to a political meeting in the Park--for you must know, I was in those days a great patriot. As bad luck would have it, there was trouble near, between a gentleman who had been drinking wine, and a <b>pavior</b> who was sober. The <b>pavior</b> chewed tobacco, and the gentleman said it was beastly in him, and pushed him, wanting to have his place. The <b>pavior</b> chewed on and pushed back. Well, the gentleman carried a sword-cane, and presently the <b>pavior</b> was down--skewered." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{it was a}} fact. A {{woman who}} had missed these things could still be useful--more useful than a man in certain respects. She thumped like a <b>pavior</b> through the {{settling}} ashes at the secret thrill of it. The rain was damping the fire, but she could feel--it was too dark to see--that her work was done. There was a dull red glow {{at the bottom of}} the destructor, not enough to char the wooden lid if she slipped it half over against the driving wet. This arranged, she leaned on the poker and waited, while an increasing rapture laid hold on her. She ceased to think. She gave herself up to feel. Her long pleasure was broken by a sound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life. She leaned forward and listened, smiling. There could be no mistake. She closed her eyes and drank it in. Once it ceased abruptly.|$|E
60|$|I do not {{remember}} that I ever examined the rooms of an American without finding books or magazines in them. I do not speak here of the houses of my friends, as of course the same remark would apply as strongly in England; but of the houses of persons presumed to earn their bread by the labor of their hands. The opportunity for such examination does not come daily; but when {{it has been in}} my power I have made it, and have always found signs of education. Men and women of the classes to which I allude talk of reading and writing as of arts belonging to them as a matter of course, quite as much as are the arts of eating and drinking. A porter or a farmer's servant in the States is not proud of reading and writing. It is to him quite a matter of course. The coachmen on their boxes and the boots as they set in the halls of the hotels have newspapers constantly in their hands. The young women have them also, and the children. The fact comes home to one at every turn, and at every hour, that the people are an educated people. The whole of this question between North and South is as well understood by the servants as by their masters, is discussed as vehemently by the private soldiers as by the officers. The politics of the country and the nature of its Constitution are familiar to every laborer. The very wording of the Declaration of Independence is in the memory of every lad of sixteen. Boys and girls of a younger age than that know why Slidell and Mason were arrested, and will tell you why they should have been given up, or why they should have been held in durance. The question of the war with England is debated by every native <b>pavior</b> and hodman of New York.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Quantitative palynological and palynofacies {{analyses}} {{allow the}} Lower Jurassic succession of the Dorset coast (Wessex Basin, southern England, UK) {{to be placed}} within a genetic sequence stratigraphic framework. The multifaceted approach employed utilizes various palynological criteria adopted from previous publications (e. g. both relative and absolute particle abundance data, allochthonous versus autochthonous palynomorphs ratios, phytoclast type, etc.), and suggests new parameters which may be studied in this context (e. g. ratios of acritarch spine length). Interpretation of palynofacies trends within the studied succession enables th identification of eight genetic sequences informally described as Genetic Stratigraphic Sequences I-VIII.
