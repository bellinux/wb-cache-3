In its <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> structure, it is a forerunner of Fisher's exact test. After some historical remarks, a self-contained probabilistic derivation (based on the duality between the negative and <b>positive</b> <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distributions)</b> of Liebermeister's procedure is given.

2500|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the fact that there is more than one noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution.</b> Wallenius' noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> is obtained if balls are sampled one by one in such a way that there is competition between the balls. Fisher's noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> is obtained if the balls are sampled simultaneously or independently of each other. Unfortunately, both distributions are known in the literature as [...] "the" [...] noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution.</b> It is important to be specific about which distribution is meant when using this name.|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a general non-central <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution,</b> which models biased sampling without replacement. Our distribution is constructed from the combined order statistics of two samples: one of independent and identically distributed random variables with absolutely continuous distribution F {{and the other}} of independent and identically distributed random variables with absolutely continuous distribution G. The distribution depends on F and G only through F○G(− 1) (F composed with the quantile function of G), and the standard <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> and Wallenius’ non-central <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> arise as special cases.

25|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, Fisher's noncentral <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> is a generalization of the <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> where sampling probabilities are modified by weight factors.

5000|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the negative <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> describes probabilities for when sampling from a finite population without replacement {{in which each}} sample can be classified into two mutually exclusive categories like Pass/Fail, Male/Female or Employed/Unemployed. As random selections are made from the population, each subsequent draw decreases the population causing the probability of success to change with each draw. Unlike the standard <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution,</b> which describes {{the number of successes}} in a fixed sample size, in the negative <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution,</b> samples are drawn until [...] failures have been found, and the distribution describes the probability of finding [...] successes in such a sample. In other words, the negative <b>hypergeometric</b> <b>distribution</b> describes the likelihood of [...] successes in a sample with exactly [...] failures.|$|R
