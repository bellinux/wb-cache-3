50|$|Planar double-gate {{transistors}} employ conventional <b>planar</b> (<b>layer</b> by layer) {{manufacturing processes}} to create double-gate devices, avoiding more stringent lithography requirements associated with non-planar, vertical transistor structures. In planar double-gate transistors the drain-source channel is sandwiched between two independently fabricated gate/gate-oxide stacks. The primary challenge in fabricating such structures is achieving satisfactory self-alignment between {{the upper and}} lower gates.|$|E

50|$|The atomic {{structure}} of delafossite and the delafossite group {{consists of a}} sheet of linearly coordinated A cations stacked between edge-shared octahedral layers (BO6). In the delafossite {{atomic structure}} there are two alternating planar layers. The two layers consist of one layer triangular-patterned A cations and a layer of edge-sharing BO6 octahedra compacted {{with respect to the}} c-axis. The delafossite structure can have two polytypes according to the orientation of the <b>planar</b> <b>layer</b> stacking. Hexagonal 2H types that have a space group of P63/mmc are formed when two A layers are stacked with each layer rotated 180° in relation to one another. Alternatively, when the layers are stacked each layer in the same direction in relation to one another, it makes a rhombohedral 3R type with a space group of Rm.|$|E

In other words, this {{analysis}} definitely demonstrates that direct impingement, in the case of PVD techniques, has a minor role in the axial growth because it contributes to a maximum NW height corresponding to the thickness of the <b>planar</b> <b>layer</b> only. NWs should not be visible outside the <b>planar</b> <b>layer</b> if direct impingement were the only mechanism for the axial growth. On the contrary, it is demonstrated that adatoms diffusion has a relevant role in the axial growth. The measured length outside the 2 D film is due to this mechanism only.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} {{deformation}} in a partially molten mantle through detailed petrostructural analysis of plagioclase lherzolites from the northwestern {{part of the}} central Lanzo massif. These peridotites display a pervasive anastomosed network of millimetre to centimetre-scale plagioclase-rich bands, which grades locally into a <b>planar</b> <b>layering</b> marked by an intercalation of plagioclase-rich and olivine-rich layers up to tens of centimetres wide. Both the anastomosed and the <b>planar</b> <b>layering</b> are subparallel to the deformation fabric, characterized by a foliation defined by the shape-preferred orientation of olivine and by crystal preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene. This parallelism, the coexistence of microstructural evidence for melt-rock reactions and for deformation by dislocation creep, and the predominance of axial-[010] olivine CPO patterns, characterized by [010] axes clustered normal to the layering, indicate that deformation and the reactive melt percolation that formed the layering were coeval. Strong heterogeneity in mineral composition in the <b>planar</b> <b>layering</b> domains, with Fe-enrichment in olivine and spinel and highly variable Ti content in spinel in cm-scale plagioclase-rich bands, implies that the latter interacted with higher melt volumes. High Ti contents in pyroxenes and spinel in the anastomosed layering domains point to changes in melt composition, hinting to less effective melt transport. We propose therefore that the <b>planar</b> <b>layering</b> records melt segregation in layers parallel to the shear plane, whereas the anastomosed layering results from melt alignment along grain boundaries subparallel to the shear plane, without segregation. Finite strain in the different layers cannot be quantified, but comparison of the present observations with data from experiments and from other mantle outcrops displaying shear-controlled melt organization suggests that {{the transition from the}} anastomosed to the <b>planar</b> <b>layering</b> might record an increase in finite strain, that is, strain localization associated with variations in the instantaneous melt fraction...|$|R

These slabs feature the same composition as the mineral itself and are a half of a unit thick in the 100 direction. These are connected to adjacent slabs solely by hydrogen bonding. The edges of each slab are bounded by near-planar layers of anions. The slabs themselves are composed of three <b>planar</b> <b>layers</b> of cations. There are also three <b>planar</b> <b>layers</b> of cations parallel {{to the edges of}} the slabs. This indicates that each slab consists of three layers of polyhedra. The c-glide symmetry relates {{the top and bottom of}} the slab which means the slab may be broken into two unique sheets of polyhedra.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory model loading tests and numerical studies carried out on square footings supported on geosynthetic reinforced sand beds. The relative performance of different forms of geosynthetic reinforcement (i. e. geocell, <b>planar</b> <b>layers</b> and randomly distributed mesh elements) in foundation beds is compared; using same quantity of reinforcement in each test. A biaxial geogrid and a geonet are used for reinforcing the sand beds. Geonet is used in two forms of reinforcement, viz. <b>Planar</b> <b>layers</b> and geocell, while the biaxial geogrid was used in three forms of reinforcement, viz. <b>planar</b> <b>layers,</b> geocell and randomly distributed mesh elements. Laboratory load tests on unreinforced and reinforced footings are simulated in a numerical model and the results are analyzed to understand the distribution of displacements and stresses below the footing better. Both the experimental and numerical studies demonstrated that the geocell is the most advantageous form of soil reinforcement technique of those investigated, provided there is no rupture of the material during loading. Geogrid used in the form of randomly distributed mesh elements is found to be inferior to the other two forms. Some significant observations on the difference in reinforcement mechanism for different forms of reinforcement are presented in this paper...|$|R
