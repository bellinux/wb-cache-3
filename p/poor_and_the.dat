30|$|Some notable {{insights}} can {{be obtained}} from the results. We observe that in the two wage distributions the elected legal retirement age under the Downsian criterion is higher than that under the Right-wing criterion. The reason is the larger redistribution associated with the Downsian criterion. It is also worth noting the comparison between the optimal retirement ages of <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> richest individuals under the two political criteria. In both wage distributions, the larger the redistribution is, the closer to the elected retirement age the optimal retirement ages of <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> richest individuals will be <b>and,</b> consequently, <b>the</b> lesser the disutility imposed by the mandatory retirement will be.|$|R

5|$|After {{overturning}} a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 {{in a friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup.

Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line.

Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79.

5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several establishments for London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.|$|E

5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the <b>poor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for the poor. In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E

5|$|John Preston Hippisley {{inherited}} {{the house in}} 1956 {{on the death of}} his father Richard John Bayntun Hippisley and in order to settle the liability for inheritance tax he sold Ston Easton.

In 1958 a Preservation Order was obtained to stop the building being demolished and adding to the growing trend of destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain. Restoration was undertaken by William Rees-Mogg who bought the building in 1964. Peter Smedley bought it from Rees-Mogg in 1977 or 1978 and carried out further restoration and converted it into a hotel. Notoriously he allowed the BBC to film his Dignitas assisted suicide.

The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct {{in the twentieth}} century, with a population low of 450, and the North Pacific grey whale population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Small whales, such as belugas, are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> animals often die {{within a few months}} of capture.
