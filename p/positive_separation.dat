30|$|The {{high-resolution}} azimuthal resistivity laterolog {{response in}} a fractured formation was numerically simulated using a three-dimensional finite element method. Simulation {{results show that}} the azimuthal resistivity is determined by fracture dipping as well as dipping direction, while the amplitude differences between deep and shallow laterolog resistivities are mainly controlled by the former. A linear relationship exists between the corrected apparent conductivities and fracture aperture. With the same fracture aperture, the deep and shallow laterolog resistivities present small values with negative separations for low-angle fractures, while azimuthal resistivities have large variations with <b>positive</b> <b>separations</b> for high-angle fractures that intersect the borehole. For dipping fractures, the variation of the azimuthal resistivity becomes larger when the fracture aperture increases. In addition, for high-angle fractures far from the borehole, a negative separation between the deep and shallow resistivities exists when fracture aperture is large as well as high resistivity contrast exists between bedrock and fracture fluid. The decreasing amplitude of dual laterolog resistivity can indicate the aperture of low-angle fractures, and the variation of the deep azimuthal resistivity can give information of the aperture of high-angle fractures and their position relative to the borehole.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare and evaluate Bayesian and deterministic methods of <b>positive</b> source <b>separation</b> of young star spectra. In the Bayesian approach, the proposed Bayesian <b>Positive</b> Source <b>Separation</b> (BPSS) method uses Gamma priors to enforce non-negativity in the source signals and mixing coefficients and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, modified by suggesting simpler proposal distributions and randomly initializing the MCMC to correctly separate spectra. In the deterministic approach, two Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) algorithms, the multiplicative update rule algorithm and an alternating least squares algorithm, are used to separate the star spectra into sources. The BPSS and NNMF algorithms are applied to the field of Astrophysics by applying the source separation techniques to T Tauri star spectra, resulting in a successful decomposition of the spectra into their sources. These methods are for the first time being applied and evaluated in optical spectroscopy. The results show that, while both methods perform well, BPSS outperforms NNMF. The NNMF and BPSS algorithms improve upon the current methodology used in Astrophysics iu two important ways. First, they permit the identification of additional components of the spectra in addition to the photosphere and boundary layer which can be modeled with current methods. Second, by applying a statistical algorithm, the modeling of T Tauri stars becomes less subjective. These methods may be further extrapolated to model spectra from other types of stars or astrophysical phenomena...|$|R

In the range of negative values of the separation ratio, a (continuous or discontinuous) transition from an oscillatory to a stationary onset of convection occurs beyond a certain viscosity contrast, and for large values of the viscosity ratio, the oscillatory onset of convection is suppressed...|$|E

This problem is motivated by a variety of applications, such as ultrasound and radar. This paper shows that the recovery error of a tractable convex optimization problem is proportional to the noise level. Additionally, the estimated delays are clustered around the true delays. This holds provided that the pulse meets a few mild localization properties and that a separation condition holds. If the amplitudes are known to be <b>positive,</b> the <b>separation</b> is unnecessary.

For small temperature differences, only the concentration field is destabilizing and the convective motions are organized in a square pattern. We study {{the evolution of the}} wavevector and the amplitude of the square pattern. For larger temperature differences both fields are destabilizing and we investigate the competition between the square pattern, reminiscent of the concentration field, and the roll pattern associated with the temperature field.

The deformation of the streamlines is explained by means of the Darcy equation which is used to describe the transport of momentum. In addition to the properties of the rolls, their stability against arbitrary infinitesimal perturbations is investigated. We compute stability balloons for the pure fluid case as well as for a wide parameter range of Lewis numbers and separation ratios which are typical for binary gas and fluid mixtures. The stability regions of rolls are found to be restricted by a crossroll, a zigzag and a new type of oscillatory instability mechanism, which can be related to the crossroll mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Photosynthesis {{first step}} {{mechanism}} concerns the sunlight absorption and both negative and <b>positive</b> charges <b>separation.</b> Recent and important photosynthesis literature claims that this mechanism is quantum mechanics controlled, however without presenting qualitative or quantitative scientifically based mechanism. The present accepted and old-fashioned photosynthesis mechanism model suffers from few drawbacks {{and an important}} issue {{is the absence of}} driving force for negative and <b>positive</b> charges <b>separation.</b> This article presents a new qualitative model for this first step mechanism in natural catalytic systems such as photosynthesis in green leaves. The model uses a concept of semiconductor band gap engineering, such as the staggered energy band gap line-up in semiconductors. To explain the primary mechanism in natural photosynthesis the proposal is the following: incident light is absorbed inside the leaves causing charges separation. The only energetic configuration that allows charges separation under illumination is the staggered one between two materials or molecules. We explain why (e-, h+) interacting charges can be separated by using an energy staggered configuration, under illumination. Following this model, the green light of plants can be seen as related to the spent energy for charges separation. Green colour being mostly an emission and not a reflection as currently presented. The arguments mentioned below show why we cannot explain the photosynthesis first step mechanism, based on the presently accepted model, and therefore the alternative model is presented. Comment: In my opinion we can, finally, start to explain the most important physical mechanism on Earth (the first step for the photosynthesis process: sun light absorption and both (e- h+) charges separation), by using the energy staggered configuration between molecules...|$|R
