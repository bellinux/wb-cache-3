40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in 2006 to investigate the effects of deep rotary cultivation on sugar beet growth. The background to the experiment was a 2005 study showing potentially higher yield, higher cleanness and higher sugar con tent when primary tillage was carried out to 35 cm depth with a rotary cultivator. On four field sites in Skåne (L:a Isie, Ädelholm, Stävie and Vragerup), five different treatments were compared: mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> to 20 cm; mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> to 20 cm + rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the autumn to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; and mouldboard ploughing in the spring to 20 cm. The rotary cultivator used in the treatments is manufactured by a Dutch company, Imants. The implement cultivates the soil with spade tines fitted on arms that are mounted on a horizontal rotating PTO-driven axle. Beet plants were inspected and yield determined in the experiment, and three soil parameters were examined: penetration resistance, water infiltration and infiltration of blue dye. Root shape was also examined. The site at Stävie was not harvested due to poor beet establishment. At the other sites, the highest yield was found when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. Pooling of the results from the three harvested sites showed that the yield was significantly higher (+ 4 %) and the sugar content was also significantly higher (+ 0. 3 %) when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn compared with conventional mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn.</b> The penetration resistance tended to be lower and the water infiltration rate higher when soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. The amount of blue colour covering the soil was also higher. The conclusion is that deep rotary cultivation has good biological potential. However this study was unable to determine the reasons behind this potential...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experiment}} studying the effects of vinasse (an alcohol industry waste) recycling in agriculture are reported in this work. Vinasse was applied in a durum wheat crop by a trailed vinasse sprayer system compacting about 10 % of the field. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Central Greece, on two soils (a clay and a silty clay loam) with three levels of vinasse rate (one fully covering N requirements of the crop, one covering half the N requirements, the rest covered by chemical fertilizers and a control without vinasse and use only of chemical fertilizers) and three times of application (Summer, Autumn before ploughing and Autumn before drilling). The middle strip of the plots was compacted by three passes of the tractor-trailed vinasse sprayer producing the compacted treatment. During the experiment, the physical and chemical properties of the soil were measured as well as the plant growth and yield. It was found that the compacted plots had higher dry bulk density and soil strength, while vinasse rate and time of application effects were not significant. An increase in N, exchangeable Na +, K + and available Mn was caused by vinasse application. Compaction had a significant effect on plant growth, while vinasse rate and time of application effects were not significant. Yields were affected by weather conditions. In the compacted plots, the yields were generally lower but in the wet years they were also significant. Yields were higher at higher vinasse rates and lower for the application before <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn,</b> indicating an adverse effect of that treatment. The combined analysis of the yields for the four years showed a significant adverse effect of compaction in the clay soil, while in the silty clay loam the effect was not significant. Vinasse application significantly increased yields, while an adverse effect was observed for the applications before ploughing. The work proved the beneficial effects of vinasse recycling as a substitute for chemical fertilizers and the feasibility of using of a spraying system, which compacts only the 10 % of the field, to reduce any adverse economic effect of soil compaction on the crop. © 1999 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|E

40|$|During {{a three-year}} period studies of {{nitrogen}} dynamics, the utilization ratio of nitrogen by crops, and the leaching of nitrogen by tile drainage water in sandy soil <b>in</b> south-western Sweden. <b>The</b> field was divided into ten separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 0. 16 hectare. The amount of drainage water from each plot was measured and water samples were collected twice a month and weekly during flood periods. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus an potassium. The fertilizer regimes were: Unfertilized, commercial fertilizer according to general recommendations (90 - 110 kg/ha), liquid manure (pig slurry) in spring or autumn (90 - 110 tot. N kg/ha) supplemented with commercial fertilizer applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring (45 - 55 N kg/ha) and treatments with double amount of liquid manure applied in spring or autumn also supplemented with commersial fertilizer. all treatments were grown with and without a catch crop exept <b>the</b> treatments with <b>autumn</b> application of mature that are {{required by law to}} be followed by a green cover during the winter. During the first two years, Ialian ryegrass, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year perennial ryegrass wass grown as catch crop. The ryegrass was undersown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main crop. The grop rotation was: Oat (1989), spring wheat (1990) an barley (1991). The treatments with ryegrass were <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring whereas the other treatments were <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> after stubble cultivation following harvest. The catch crop reduced the spring leaching substially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single dose treatments with only commersial fertilizer and in th combined system with both manure and commercial fertilizer. The reduction was as high as 74 and 78 %, respectively, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment with a double dose of pig slurry the reduction stopped at 50 %. When pig slurry was applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn,</b> <b>the</b> losses were doubled compared to spring application <b>in</b> spite of <b>the</b> catch crop. The unfertilized treatment (8 years) without a cac crop had 50 % less leaching compared with treatments with springapplied normal doses of fertilizers without a catch crop. <b>The</b> yield <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unfertilized treatment was only 34 % of <b>the</b> yield <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment with a normal dose of commercial fertilicer. The treatment with a singel dose of manure and half a dose of commercial fertilizer, bothe appliedin the spring, gave 7 % higher yield but a more lodged stand compared with the treatment with a single dose of commercial fertilize. The last two treatments had the best nitrogen utilization ration (82 % of applied N was taken away by the grain yield). A double dose of manure lowered both the yield and the nitrogen utilization ratio indipendent of time of application. The main reason for this was higher lodging tendency and higher leaching values. The cath crop lowered the yield (7 - 24 %) both in 1989 and 1990 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment with spring-applied fertilizers. Also the fertilizer utilization ration was lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> catch crop treatments. But <b>in</b> 1991 <b>the</b> diffferences were smaller. The main reason for this seems to be a delivery by mineralization from organic nitrogen from earlier ploughed-in catch crops. Important reasons for <b>the</b> drop <b>in</b> yield <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatments with a catch crop seem to be competition with the main crop and large deficiency of mineral nitrogen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early spring compared with treatments without a catch crop. Any net immobilization of nitrogen following the ploughing-in of cath crop could not be verified. At the time of yellow ripeness for the cereals, the intersown ryegrass had taken up 7 - 14 N kg/ha <b>in</b> <b>the</b> standing crop (above ground) and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of November 11 - 90 N kg/ha, most <b>in</b> treatments were <b>the</b> nitrogen supply was good, such as in treatments with autumn application of manure or <b>in</b> treatments where <b>the</b> frequent use of manure had enlargeed the mineralization capacity of <b>the</b> soil. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> <b>the</b> dry matter content of the catch crop varied between 800 - 2700 kg d. w. per hectare. From last autumn to early spring the N content of ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amount of mineral nitrogen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil (0 - 90 cm) from the time of yellow ripeness to late <b>autumn</b> exept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization capacity of <b>the</b> soil. <b>In</b> late <b>autumn</b> <b>the</b> dry matter content of the ryegrass changed only very little. The catch crops decreased the amounts of mineral nitrogen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil 80 - 90 cm) from the time of wellow ripeness to late <b>autumn</b> exept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatments with autumn-applied manure. In treatments without a catch crop, the nitrogen mineralization increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storage of mineral nitrogen throughout <b>the</b> <b>autumn,</b> leading to a higher leaching during the following winter compared with treatments with a catch crop. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> treatments with a catch crop, the mineral nitrogen storage continued to be fairly small until the time of spring ploughing. During the time from spring ploughing with a catch crop than in corresponding treatments without a catch crop. Yearly application of manure enlarged the delivery of mineral nitrogen from the soil compared with to treatments without manure. The delivery was also lowered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment without any fertilizer application. Calculations show that a frequent manure addition gave an enlarged nitrogen leachong magnitude, as well as increased ammoniavolatilization and denitrification. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> autumn-ploughed treatments without a catch crop, the net mineralization of nitrogen from the time of yellow ripeness to early spring was higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatments with catch crop and spring ploughing. However, during the growing season, the minratlization was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatments with a catch crop and spring ploughing. Thus, it seems as if anutumn ploughing stimulates the mineral N-mobilization during winter. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> treatments with a spring ploughed catch crop, the net mineralization during growing season is enlarged. The amounths of nitrogen mineralization also increased during the years, suggesting an additional influence of several years durration given by the ryegrass residues. The combination of a cath crop and spring ploughing therefore seems to both diminish leaching losses though retention of nitrogen in plants and plant residues, and futher offer a possibility to govern nitrogen prosesses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil <b>in</b> such a way that nitrogen ta a greater extent will released when it can be utilized by the crop...|$|R
40|$|During {{a seven-year}} period (1993 - 1999) studies {{were made on}} the effct on soil {{nitrogen}} dynamics, utilization ration of nitrogen in crops and leaching losses by different soil tillage times, application of pig slurry and undersown perennial ryegrass as a catch crop. The experimental field was situated on a loamy sand soil in Västergötland, <b>in</b> western Sweden. <b>The</b> field was divided into eight separate tile-drained plots, each with an area of 840 m². The amount of drainage water was measured and water samples were collected twice a month. The water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Soil samples were taken periodically from the 0 - 90 cm soil layer for analysis of mineral nitrogen. Plant material was sampled in late summer, late sutumn and early spring to measure plant growth and nutrient in crops, weeds and plat residues. The crop sequence was: oats (1993 and 1994), spring barley (1995), potatoes (1996), oats (1997) and spring barley (1998). The fertilizer regimes were commercial fertilizer according to normal reccommendations (90 kg N/ha) or half the dose of commercial fertilizer (45 kg N/ha) supplemented with pig slurry (on average, 94 kg tot-N/ha) applied before sowing in spring. Treatments with catch crop were <b>ploughed</b> either <b>in</b> April-May or in early November, whereas other treatments without a catch crop were stubble cultivated in August-September and plouged in November, or only plouged <b>in</b> April-May. <b>The</b> catch crop didn't impact negatively on the yield; instead incorporation if catch crop material seemes {{to increase the amount}} of nitrogen available for the next crop, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. Further, the catch crop reduced nitrogen leaching during the cold seasons to half when the catch crop was left to grow until spring <b>ploughing.</b> <b>In</b> late <b>autumn,</b> <b>the</b> amount of nitrogen in catch crop, including other green vegetation, was 15 - 17 kg N/ha, which were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same range as the decrease of nitrogen leaching in treatments with spring ploughing and an undersown ryegrass. When tillage was delayed from early autumn to spring (without a catch crop), nitrogen leaching decreased with 25 %, due to lower mineralization during autumn and winter. <b>Ploughing</b> <b>in</b> spring did not result in increased nitrogen delivery from the soil during growing season, compared with tillage in early autumn. When pig slurry was used, nitrogen leaching increased somewhat, compared with treatments with commercial fertilizer nitrogen, due to increased nitrogen mineralization. The amount of plant available soil nitrogen during the growing season was also larger in treatments with pig slurry applications. Balances of nitrogen were positive in all treatments, especially in treatments with catch crop and spring ploughing. By spring ploughing and using a catch crop it seems to be possible to manipulate the mineralization to be lower wintertime and increse during the growing season. This seemed to conserve nitrogen in soil organic matter...|$|R
