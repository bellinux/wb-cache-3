40|$|Received 〈reception date〉; {{accepted}} 〈acception date〉) In {{this paper}} we investigate gravitational instability of shocked gas layers using linear analysis. An unperturbed {{state is a}} self-gravitating isothermal layer which grows with time by the accretion of gas through shock fronts due to a cloud-cloud collision. Since the unperturbed state is not static, and cannot be described by a self-similar solution, we numerically solved the perturbation equations and directly integrated them over time. We took account {{of the distribution of}} physical quantities across the thickness. Linearized Rankine-Hugoniot relations were imposed at shock fronts as boundary conditions. The following results are found from our unsteady linear analysis: the perturbation initially evolves in oscillatory mode, and begins to grow at a certain epoch. The wavenumber of the fastest growing mode is given by k = 2 √ 2 πGρEM/cs, where ρE, cs and M are the density of <b>parent</b> <b>clouds,</b> the sound velocity and the Mach number of the collision velocity, respectively. For this mode, the transition epoch from oscillatory to growing mode is given by tg = 1. 2 / √ 2 πGρEM. The epoch at which the fastest growing mode becomes nonlinear is given by 2. 4 δ − 0. 1 0 / √ 2 πGρEM, where δ 0 is the initial amplitude of the perturbation of the column density. As an application of our linear analysis, we investigate criteria for collision-induced fragmentation.

40|$|AbstractRegions {{of massive}} star {{formation}} offer {{some of the}} best and most easily-observed examples of radiation hydrodynamics. Boundaries where fully-ionized H II regions transition to neutral/molecular photodissociation regions (PDRs) are of particular interest because marked temperature and density contrasts across the boundaries lead to evaporative flows and fluid dynamical instabilities that can evolve into spectacular pillar-like structures. When detached from their <b>parent</b> <b>clouds,</b> pillars become ionized globules that often harbor one or more young stars. H 2 molecules at the interface between a PDR and an H II region absorb ultraviolet light from massive stars, and the resulting fluoresced infrared emission lines are an ideal way to trace this boundary independent of obscuring dust. This paper presents H 2 images of four regions of massive star formation that illustrate different types of PDR boundaries. The Ara OB 1 star formation region contains a striking long wall that has several wavy structures which are present in H 2, but the emission is not particularly bright because the ambient UV fluxes are relatively low. In contrast, the Carina star formation region shows strong H 2 fluorescence both along curved walls and at the edges of spectacular pillars that in some cases have become detached from their <b>parent</b> <b>clouds.</b> The less-spectacular but more well-known Eagle Nebula has two regions that have strong fluorescence in addition to its pillars. While somewhat older than the other regions, Cyg OB 2 has the highest number of massive stars of the regions surveyed and contains many isolated, fluoresced globules that have head–tail morphologies which point towards the sources of ionizing radiation. These images provide a collection of potential astrophysical analogs that may relate to ablated interfaces observed in laser experiments of radiation hydrodynamics...|$|R

40|$|Using recent dust {{continuum}} data, we {{generate the}} intrinsic ellipticity distribution of dense, starless molecular cloud cores. Under {{the hypothesis that}} the cores are all either oblate or prolate randomly-oriented spheroids, we show that a satisfactory fit to observations can be obtained with a gaussian prolate distribution having a mean intrinsic axis ratio of 0. 54. Further, we show that correlations exist between the apparent axis ratio and both the peak intensity and total flux density of emission from the cores, the sign of which again favours the prolate hypothesis. The latter result shows that the mass of a given core depends on its intrinsic ellipticity. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to find the best-fit power law of this dependence.
