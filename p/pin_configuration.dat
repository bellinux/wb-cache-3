2500|$|Following {{the lead}} {{set by the}} lamp {{manufacturers}} in standardising lamp bases, a conference of the plug and receptacle manufacturers, including Hubbell, was arranged {{with a view to}} agreeing a standard configuration. It was a time of great expansion in the use of electrical appliances such as fans, heaters, and cookers, as well as portable devices such as hair curlers and irons, and the public wanted interchangeability. Hubbell's parallel <b>pin</b> <b>configuration</b> was preferred, but Hubbell [...] "rebelled against standardization", and refused to agree, asserting that it had common law rights in the dimensions of its line. The other conference members pressed on regardless, and agreed to standardize on Hubbell's parallel flat <b>pin</b> <b>configuration</b> and dimensions. Hubbell's court action only served to confirm the legality of their activities, to the great benefit of the US public.|$|E

2500|$|The {{report of}} the court {{proceedings}} includes {{a comprehensive review of}} the development of the art in the US prior to 1919, based on evidence presented to the Court. Separable plugs had been available {{for more than a decade}} prior to Hubbell's 1904 design. [...] The earliest presented to the court was the [...] "Weston", (US patent 480,900 issued August 16, 1892, for which Hubbell had taken out a licence), another (unidentified) type following in 1897. Plugs per se with parallel flat pins, such as the [...] "Fort Wayne" [...] design were in common use by 1886, and flush receptacles, such as the [...] "Bryant Electrical Company" [...] design, by 1902. Hubbell had introduced its own parallel flat <b>pin</b> <b>configuration</b> in 1912. In 1915 there were [...] "...from 15 to 20 different types of blades and from 15 to 30 different types of receptacles. The line of each was not interchangeable with competing lines. ..." [...] The existence of both [...] "tandem" [...] and parallel pin configurations had led to the introduction in 1914 of some receptacles having both configurations of slots and others having [...] "T" [...] slots. By 1915, Hubbell had sold about 13 million receptacles and plug bases/caps with tandem slots/pins, and about 1.25 million with parallel slots/pins, most of which were then still in active use, meaning that Hubbell's configurations were by far the most widely used.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a Josephson junction system installed with a finite length inhomogeneity, either of micro-resistor or micro-resonator type. The {{system can be}} modelled by a sine-Gordon equation with a piecewise-constant function to represent the varying Josephson tunneling critical current. The existence of pinned fluxons depends {{on the length of}} the inhomogeneity, the variation in the Josephson tunneling critical current and the applied bias current. We establish that a system may either not be able to sustain a pinned fluxon, or - for instance by varying the length of the inhomogeneity - may exhibit various different types of pinned fluxons. Our stability analysis shows that changes of stability can only occur at critical points of the length of the inhomogeneity {{as a function of the}} (Hamiltonian) energy density inside the inhomogeneity - a relation we determine explicitly. In combination with continuation arguments and Sturm-Liouville theory, we determine the stability of all constructed pinned fluxons. It follows that if a given system is able to sustain at least one pinned fluxon, a microresistor has exactly one pinned fluxon, i. e. the system selects one unique <b>pinned</b> stable <b>pinned</b> <b>configuration,</b> and a microresonator has at least one stable <b>pinned</b> <b>configuration.</b> Moreover, it is shown that both for micro-resistors and micro-resonators this stable <b>pinned</b> <b>configuration</b> may be non-monotonic - something which is not possible in the homogeneous case. Finally, it is shown that results in the literature on localised inhomogeneities can be recovered as limits of our results on micro-resonators. © 2011 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
2500|$|The earthed {{consumer}} plug {{has several}} claimants to its invention. A 1911 book {{dealing with the}} electrical products of A. P. Lundberg & Sons of London describes the [...] "Tripin" [...] earthed plug available in 2.5 amp and 5 amp models. The <b>pin</b> <b>configuration</b> of the [...] "Tripin" [...] appears virtually identical to modern BS 546 plugs. In her 1914 book Electric cooking, heating, cleaning, etc. Maud Lucas Lancaster mentions an earthed iron-clad plug and socket by the English firm of Reyrolle and Co. The earliest American patent application for an earthed plug appears to be 11 January 1915 by George P. Knapp, {{on behalf of the}} Harvey Hubbell company. This patent covers the use of an earthing pin which extends further than the other two contacts to ensure that it is engaged first. Knapp's design was obsoleted in the US before the modern NEMA designations, but is still used in some other countries including China, Argentina and Australia. The configuration of the socket was not operable with existing two-contact unearthed plugs. Other earthed sockets that are widely used in the US today are operable with unearthed plugs. [...] It is sometimes claimed (e.g., in Illumin) that the modern American version of the earthed plug, was invented by Philip F. Labre who was issued a US patent for an earthed socket and plug in 1928. However, Labre's design is no more similar to the modern version than Knapp's earlier design.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} our current study are in {{agreement}} with other studies assessing the effect of pin size on fracture stability. A biomechanical study by Srikumaran et al. comparing the stability of 1.6 - and 2.8 -mm <b>pins</b> in various <b>configurations</b> concluded that large <b>pins</b> in any <b>configuration</b> provided more stable reduction in sagittal extension bending than small pins [19]. However, our study differs from theirs in several important ways. First, the use of 2.8 -mm pins is not clinically relevant, as pins larger than 1.6 or 2.0  mm are rarely used {{for this type of}} fracture fixation. Second, we specifically chose to use a model of torsional resistance to rotational displacement similar to the methods described by Zionts et al. in their landmark paper on the torsional strength of <b>pin</b> <b>configurations</b> [14]. According to Zionts et al., torsional loading simulates the loading that occurs clinically when the portion of the arm distal to the SCH fracture is internally rotated. Similarly, a biomechanical study by Gottschalk et al. comparing 1.6 - and 2.0 -mm pins found that a larger pin construct provides improved resistance to rotational stress; however, they only assessed lateral <b>pin</b> <b>configurations</b> [20]. Finally, in a separate study, Srikumaran et al. retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of pediatric patients treated for Gartland type III SCH fractures and found that patients treated with large pins were more likely to maintain sagittal alignment at final follow-up [18].|$|R

40|$|We present {{modeling}} and {{analysis for the}} static behavior and collapse instabilities of doubly-clamped and cantilever microbeams subjected to capillary forces. These forces can be {{as a result of}} a volume of liquid trapped underneath the microbeam during the rinsing and drying process in fabrication. The model considers the microbeam as a continuous medium, the capillary force as a nonlinear function of displacement, and accounts for the mid-plane stretching and geometric nonlinearities. The capillary force is assumed to be distributed over a specific length underneath the microbeam. The Galerkin procedure is used to derive a reduced-order model consisting of a set of nonlinear algebraic and differential equations that describe the microbeams static and dynamic behaviors. We study the collapse instability, which brings the microbeam from its unstuck configuration to touch the substrate and gets stuck in the so-called <b>pinned</b> <b>configuration.</b> We calculate the pull-in length that distinguishes the free from the <b>pinned</b> <b>configurations</b> as a function of the beam thickness and gap width for both microbeams. Comparisons are made with analytical results reported in the literature based on the Ritz method for linear and nonlinear beam models. The instability problem, which brings the microbeam from a <b>pinned</b> to adhered <b>configuration</b> is also investigated. For this case, we use a shooting technique to solve the boundary-value problem governing the deflection of the microbeams. The critical microbeam length for this second instability is also calculated...|$|R
40|$|Annealing short {{very low}} {{magnetostriction}} amorphous ribbons in the demagnetized state {{results in a}} Perminvar-like reentrant hysteresis loop due to domain wall stabilization by the induced anisotropy. After a hard saturation, the loop changes to that of an unprocessed ribbon. In this investigation, ribbons are annealed in the demagnetized state with one wall along the ribbon middle. This wall becomes pinned during the heat treatment. Reentrant reversal occurs when reverse domains are nucleated at the ribbon edge with a threshold field larger than the demagnetizing field, this wall does not annihilate when it meets the pinned wall but leaves a line of reverse domains stabilized by ripple in the anisotropy. These domains enable a regular smooth reversal for the demagnetization process until the ribbon returns to the <b>pinned</b> <b>configuration.</b> The regular loop appears when the ribbon has been completely saturated by a large field. Mobile walls are nucleated {{on both sides of}} the pinned wall so that the ribbon does not return to the <b>pinned</b> <b>configuration.</b> Reversal now follows the usual demagnetization curve over the entire cycle. Kerr magnetooptical domain and domain wall observations are used in this investigation.

40|$|Aim : {{several studies}} have shown that supracondylar {{fractures}} could be treated with two or three lateral pins. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the stability of lateral pinning with two or three pins with two pins bridged with a small non-invasive device, which would allow the operator to use only two pins instead of three. Methods : fifteen synthetic humerus were cut at the level of the center of the olecranon fossea to simulate supracondylar fractures. All the samples were fixed with parallel pins (Kirschner, diameter 1. 6 mm) with lateral entry. Three different <b>pins</b> <b>configurations</b> were tested : two pins, two bridged pins and three pins. Each sample was tested in internal and external rotations using a MTS 809 axial / torsional Test System to measure the torsional stiffness and the torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees. A statistical analysis using the Student Law was performed. Results : <b>configurations</b> with two <b>pins,</b> bridged with the non-invasive device or not, had identical mechanical properties. The <b>configurations</b> with three <b>pins</b> demonstrated the following change in mechanical properties, respectively over two pins and over two bridged pins : an increase in internal torsional stiffness of 21. 2 % and 25. 3 %, an increase in external torsional stiffness of 15 % and 6. 8 %; concerning the maximum torque needed to reach an angle of 10 degrees, the increase for internal rotation was 15. 1 % and 16. 4 % and the increase for external rotation was 12. 4 % and 13. 3 %. The bridging device did not provide an increase in mechanical properties, which could have avoided the use of a third pin. However, this study showed that the third pin increased all four mechanical properties measured, increase that is needed to fix unstable reduced supracondylar fracture. Our samples showed a statistically significant result (P< 0. 05) for the torsional stiffness in external rotation between two and three pins. No statistical difference was made between two <b>pins</b> <b>configurations.</b> Clinical relevance : the opportunity to bridge two <b>pins</b> <b>configuration</b> with a small non-invasive device to reach a mechanical stability equivalent to a <b>configuration</b> with three <b>pins</b> would avoid one invasive pinning procedure and its iatrogenic complications...|$|R
