The findings are based on in-depth interviews with 44 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> claimed <b>CA</b> or had an underlying entitlement to it, in three areas of the UK in summer 2013. The {{aim of the research}} was to better understand the following research questions: • How is CA viewed in terms of the household budget, and does this vary by type of household? • How do recipients use CA and what would be the impact of non-receipt? • How does the use of CA vary depending on who is being cared for and where? • What led to the decision to claim CA? • Has receipt of CA had different impacts at different times of the caring career? • What impact has caring had on labour market participation...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Psychology, 2009 This study {{explored}} Extraversion personality {{differences among}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer dogs, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer cats, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer both, and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer neither. Participants were 120 {{students from the}} Psychology Department Participation Pool at Humboldt State University. Personality was evaluated using the NEO-PI-R Extraversion Scale. Also, participants were given a list of personality trait adjectives and asked to assign them to either <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer dogs or <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer cats. Results showed significant differences in Extraversion among the pet preference groups. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> preferred dogs scored higher than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> preferred cats on the overall domain of Extraversion and the facets Excitement-Seeking and Gregariousness. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> preferred dogs also scored higher than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> preferred both on Extraversion and the facets Warmth, Excitement-Seeking, and Gregariousness. Results also showed {{that there are certain}} personality traits that people tend to assign to those who prefer dogs vs. those who prefer cats. The top personality traits chosen for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer dogs were Sociable, Friendly, Excitement-Seeking and High-Spirited. The top personality traits chosen for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer cats were Quiet, Shy, and Independent. All of the traits predominantly chosen for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer dogs were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring higher in Extraversion. All of the traits predominantly chosen for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> prefer cats were traits used as general descriptors of those measuring lower in Extraversion...|$|R
