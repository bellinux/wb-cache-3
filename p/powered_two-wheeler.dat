50|$|According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, {{sales of}} motor scooters in the United States {{have more than}} doubled since 2000. The {{motorcycle}} industry as a whole has seen 13 years of consecutive growth. According to council figures, 42,000 scooters were sold in 2000. By 2004, that number increased to 97,000. Scooter sales in 2008 in the United States were up 41% on 2007, and represented 9% of all <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> sales. However, falling oil prices after a boom in 2008, led to a decrease in US scooter sales in 2009 of 59% against 2008, compared with a 41% fall for all powered two-wheelers, while the scooter's contribution to total US <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> sales in 2009 fell to 6%. After a two-year slump, scooter sales in the US rebounded {{in the first quarter of}} 2011, once again as a result of higher fuel prices.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> has {{experienced}} extraordinary growth in Europe, notably in densely population areas (CARE, 2012). Nevertheless, the powered two wheelers ‘crash risk is still very poorly documented. It is mainly {{due to a lack}} of available accurate exposure data about this road user category and its subcategories. Thus, powered two wheelers ‘accident risk is generally overall and roughly studied. Based on data held by the Police, a case-control study was conducted. The cases comprised 110 <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> riders and 157 motorists involved in injury crashes occurred on nine arterial streets in the Marseille metropolitan area (France) from 1 st January 2011 to 31 st December 2011. The controls were <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> riders and motorists who passed the crash sites at the same time of day and same day of week as when the crashes occurred. These controls were collected during periodic roadside surveys. Per kilometer travelled, <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> have significantly greater chance of being involved in a crash than motorists (odds ratio 3. 81, 95 % confidence interval 2. 97 to 4. 89). Concerning the risk of being injured, <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> riders are 22. 3 times (95 %confidence interval 13. 7 to 36. 3) more likely to be injured compared to motorists. Significant differences are found in these risks between mopeds and light motorcycles and heavy motorcycles riders. This study quantifies both the crash risk and risk of injury for different categories of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> (mopeds, light motorcycles and heavy motorcycles) and confirms that the over-representation of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> in accidents statistics in large metropolitan areas seems more due to their extreme vulnerability rather than their over-implication in collisions...|$|R

40|$|Since {{motorcycles}} {{are one of}} {{the main}} sources of noise in urban environments, the use of electric <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> may contribute to the improvement of soundscapes in Smart Cities. However, quiet vehicles can lead to an increased risk of accident for pedestrians and other drivers. In order to assess the noise generated by <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> and their detectability, five different low capacity motorcycles were measured in a pass-by noise test. The measurements were performed at different speeds using a linear microphone array and a dummy head. The sound directivity radiated by the moving sources was studied with a microphone array. To establish the detectability of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers,</b> thirty-seven subjects participated in an auditory test consisting on a virtual road-crossing scenario. The subjects had to detect the approaching of a vehicle at 20 km/h. The results showed a significant reduction in the sound pressure level emitted by electric motorcycles at low-speed, as well as a notable increase in sound directivity with velocity. The reaction time obtained for the detection of electric <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> was higher compared to the traditional propulsion ones.

40|$|Context: Authorizing <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> {{drivers to}} drive in lanes {{reserved}} to buses is a measure that is sometimes mentioned to improve mobility conditions for these users. But what effect would this measure have on {{the safety of the}}se users and on the safety of the other users with whom they share the traffic space? Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} contribute elements to help answer this question. More precisely, the objective is to estimate the risk of having an accident per kilometer driven by <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers who drive in bus lanes and to compare this risk with that of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers who drive in general traffic lanes. Method: Using the bodily injury accidents recorded by the police over two years on thirteen roads in the city of Marseille and a campaign of periodical observations of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> traffic, we estimated the risk per kilometer driven by <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers who drive in bus lanes and compared it with that of drivers who do not drive in them. Results: The results show that the risk for <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers who drive in bus lanes of being involved in a bodily injury accident is significantly higher than the risk run by drivers who drive in general traffic lanes. For the thirteen roads studied, it is on average 3, 25 times higher (95 % CI: 2, 03; 5, 21). Conclusion: In the current situation, <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers who drive in bus lanes are less safe than those who drive in general traffic lanes. The analysis of police reports suggests that part of this increased risk comes from collisions between automobile drivers turning right and powered two-wheelers driving in the bus lane who continue straight ahead...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The risk of {{collision}} between pedestrians and powered two-wheelers {{is poorly}} understood today. Other than the study by Paulozzi (2005) which showed that, per kilometer covered in towns, the risk for <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers to fatally injure a pedestrian is 2. 02 times (95 % CI: 1. 23; 3. 30) greater than the risk for automobile drivers, no other scientific studies have dealt with this question {{as far as we}} know. The objective of this research is to determine the risk for <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers of hitting and injuring a pedestrian per kilometer driven in towns and to compare this risk with that run by four-wheeled vehicle drivers. Method: Using the bodily injury accidents recorded by the police on nine roads in the city of Marseille in 2011 and a campaign of observations of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> traffic, we estimated the risk per kilometer driven by <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers of hitting a pedestrian and compared it with the risk run by four-wheeled vehicle drivers. Results: The results show that the risk for <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers of hitting and injuring a pedestrian is significantly higher than the risk run by four-wheeled vehicle drivers. On the nine roads studied, it is on average 3. 33 times higher (95 % CI: 1. 63; 6. 78). Taking four more years into account made it possible to consolidate these results and to tighten the confidence interval. Conclusion: There does indeed seem to be problems in the interactions between pedestrians and <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> users in urban traffic. These interaction problems lead to a higher risk of hitting and injuring a pedestrian for <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> drivers than for four-wheeled vehicle drivers. The analysis of the police reports suggests that part of this increased risk comes from filtering maneuvers by powered two-wheelers. Practical Applications effective: Possible countermeasures deal with the urban street layout. Measures consisting in reducing the width and the number of traffic lanes to a strict minimum and installing medians or pedestrian islands, could be an effective way for the prevention of urban accidents between pedestrians and powered two-wheelers...|$|E

40|$|The {{safety of}} <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> in the Netherlands : some topical points of {{attention}} in the limelight. Riders and passengers of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> {{are among the most}} vulnerable road users. In relation to the distance travelled the number of casualties among riders of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> is greater than for other modes of transport. Although a trend towards fewer fatalities may be observed, the number of serious road injuries does not decline at all or only slightly. There are many different categories of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers.</b> In traffic it is difficult to distinguish between the types, which is contrary to the Sustainable Safety principle of predictability (Wegman & Aarts, 2005). For example, there is no clear distinction between mopeds and light mopeds; this is especially the case for the scooter-type models. Vehicles that look practically the same, may be a motorcycle, a moped or a light moped. At the exterior the only distinguishing feature is the licence plate, but this is only visible from behind. The fact that <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> from different categories look the same could encourage a helmet not always being worn as the mandatory helmet use is not the same for all categories. Vehicles that look extremely different, e. g. a scooter-type moped and a (powered) quad may, on the other hand, be part of the same category of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers.</b> This report gives an overview of the various <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers,</b> discusses a number of road safety issues, and explores the ways to correct these. The issues were mainly selected based on their topicality in the Netherlands (e. g. political concern about the increasing numbers of microcars and moped riders who do not have a licence) and the availability of data. This resulted in the following research questions: 1. Do motorcyclists have a higher risk in springtime? 2. Is the microcar becoming increasingly popular, especially among young road users, and does this present a road safety problem? 3. Is the light moped becoming more popular and what is the road safety effect? 4. Has the number of moped riders without a licence been increasing since the practical riding test was introduced? While this report was being written, it became apparent that the available information about crashes, size of the vehicle fleet, and mobility — for the category <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> in particular — is far from ideal. The availability {{and the quality of the}} data are discussed in an appendix and we indicate what can and what cannot be concluded on the basis of this data. These restrictions are allowed for in the results that are presented below...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the crash risk per kilometer travelled by powered two wheeler riders filtering through traffic on urban roads. Methods: Using the traffic injury crashes recorded by the police over a period of three years on fourteen sections of urban roads in the city of Marseille, France and a campaign of observations of powered two-wheelers, the crash risk per kilometer travelled by powered two-wheelers filtering was estimated and compared to the risk of powered two-wheelers that did not filter. Results: The results show that the risk of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> riders being involved in injury crashes while filtering is significantly higher than the risk for riders who do not filter. For the fourteen sections studied, it is 3. 94 times greater (95 % CI: 2. 63; 5. 89). This excess risk occurred for all <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> categories. Furthermore, no space appears to be safer than the others for filtering. Riders filtering forward along the axis of the carriageway, along bus lanes or between traffic lanes (lane-splitting) all have a crash risk greater than the risk of those who do not filter. Conclusions: All measures limiting the practice of filtering by powered two-wheelers on urban roads would probably contribute to improving the safety of their users...|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} decade European {{accidentology}} data, divided per mode of transport, have shown the increasing relevance of safety for Vulnerable Road User (VRU).

The European Community has promoted and co-financed several research projects to promote {{the development and implementation of}} viable technical solutions to reduce fatalities and mitigate accident consequences. Most of the proposed devices and systems require the interaction with the rider through Human Machine Interface (HMI) devices. This work focuses on the design of an innovative haptic HMI device to communicate information/warnings to the rider in a reliable and intuitive way.

30|$|In {{the last}} decade European {{accidentology}} data have shown a significant reduction {{of the total number}} of fatalities, as a consequence of improvements achieved in the sector of car safety.

In 2006 PTW accidents accounted for 22 % {{of the total number of}} fatalities in the EU- 141 countries [1, 2], and riders are 18 times more likely to be involved in a fatal accident, compared to other road users [3]. As part of the road safety strategy stated in the European Commission’s 2001 Transport White Paper [4] and its 2006 review [5] aiming at a 50 % reduction of total fatalities by 2010, the European Community promoted and co-financed several research projects in the sector of PTW safety.

30|$|Nowadays, <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> {{vehicles}} (PTW) {{are widely}} used not only for pleasure, but also for increasing mobility in the crowded urban and sub-urban roads of many European towns. For several reasons, PTW dynamics and safety have not been investigated as much as with four-wheeled vehicles, {{despite the fact that}} riders are among the most vulnerable road users. Therefore the development of devices aimed at improving the comfort and safety of PTWs, as well as investigating the behavioural factors that contribute to crashes, are important areas for research. Moreover, the roll degree of freedom which makes PTWs quick and prompt on urban roads and diverting on the rural track has some safety implications which require new riders to receive proper training. Unfortunately {{it is not easy to}} train new riders in dangerous situations, such as riding on a slippery road or emergency braking. From this point of view riding simulators may help both as a training tool and in the development of innovative devices aimed at improving rider safety.|$|E

40|$|The global {{fleet of}} powered two-wheelers (PTWs) is {{constantly}} increasing. In many countries, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds {{play a significant}} role in mobility, particularly in many of the world's large cities. As such, PTWs are becoming an important component of the transport system. However, they represent an important challenge for road safety. PTW riders are at far more risk than car drivers per kilometre ridden in terms of fatalities and severe injuries entailing long-term disability. Moreover, they have not benefited from safety improvements at the same pace as car occupants over recent decades. Addressing the issue of PTW safety is thus an essential contribution to the success of the United Nations' Decade of Action for Road Safety, which aims at halving the expected number of road deaths worldwide by 2020. This report reviews recent trends in <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheeler</b> crashes, the factors contributing to these crashes and their severity.

30|$|Evidence {{regarding}} {{the nature and}} circumstances of PTW accidents comes from several sources. In the Motorcycle Accident In-Depth Study, or MAIDS [29], in-depth accident data covering 921 motorcycle accidents in five European countries suggested that some 60 % of motorcycle accidents involve collisions with passenger cars—exactly the types of collisions that the <b>Powered</b> <b>Two-Wheeler</b> On-coming Information System aims to prevent. According to the MAIDS data, {{over a third of}} these accidents (35 %) pointed to two main accident configurations: accidents at an intersection, where the colliding vehicles were following perpendicular paths, and left-turn accidents (right-turn in the UK and Ireland), where two vehicles were approaching the intersection from opposite directions and one vehicle cut across the path of the oncoming motorcycle. Similarly, Reed & Morris [30] found that of 283 fatal PTW accidents, 46 % occurred at an intersection whereas 54 % occurred away from an intersection. These figures conform to findings from the EU CARE database used in our calculations, which show that 41 % of fatal accidents and 46 % of injury accidents involving mopeds with vehicles occur at intersections, compared with 41 % and 54 % respectively for motorcycles with vehicles also at intersections.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRoad {{traffic is}} in {{addition}} to the energy sector and the industry one main source of air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. Although most countries and manufacturers agreed to environmental regulations to reduce the pollutant emissions, particularly in urban areas with high traffic density, the impact of road traffic emissions on the environment and human health has been growing in importance steadily. Due to stricter emission standards and the binding use of emission-reducing systems (e. g. three-way catalyst) hydrocarbon emissions from passenger cars have been reduced significantly since the last two decades. Unlike to passenger cars the emissions standards of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> have not been adjusted since 2006 although their share of hydrocarbon emissions to the total amount of hydrocarbon emissions of road traffic is estimated to be disproportionately high. Due to the new regulation (EU) No. 168 / 2013 <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> have to fulfill new emission standards from 2016 (Euro 4) and 2020 (Euro 5) onwards. Besides new limits for the tailpipe emissions the evaporative emissions are regulated separately for the first time, as they make up a high proportion to the total hydrocarbon emissions in this vehicle class. In this context, the calculation and forecast of road traffic emissions is an important tool to verify compliance of climate targets and to assess the reduction potential of emission-reducing systems. For that purpose the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) uses the emission- and calculation tool TREMOD (Transport Emission Model) which provides baseline data and calculated results for pollutants in almost every differentiation e. g. vehicle category, traffic situation and road type. Moreover, estimations of future emission trends, stock information and mileage distribution can be made. The main objective is to illustrate the impact of the upcoming emission standards Euro 4 and Euro 5 on the operational hydrocarbon emissions of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers</b> based on statistical estimations. The significant aspect is to generate scenarios to show the reduction potential of hydrocarbon emissions of <b>powered</b> <b>two-wheelers,</b> differentiated into motorcycles and small motorcycles, in relation to the total share of hydrocarbon emissions in this vehicle class and to the total hydrocarbon emissions from road traffic. As a part of our research, we can make initial statements about the possible effect of the new emission standards of regulation (EU) No. 168 / 2013 by means of modeling with TREMOD...|$|R

Most of these single crashes are not (yet) detected in the standard police reported accident statistics, but do represent costs to society that probably exceed crash costs of car related crashes. It can be expected that the shares of URU fatal and injury crashes will increase, particularly because of the ageing of the population, urbanization and despite ICT/ITS developments. Some of these crashes can be prevented by relatively simple measures, others need more investments e. g. infrastructure, legislation or enforcement. From a policy point of view it will be wise to address this issue, not only for road safety reasons, but also because the elderly are getting more numerous and a serious economic and political factor...|$|R
