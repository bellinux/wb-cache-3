5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide.</b> This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E
25|$|Schlosser's base is a superbase {{produced}} by treating butyllithium with <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide.</b> It is kinetically more reactive than butyllithium {{and is often}} used to accomplish difficult metalations. The butoxide anion complexes the lithium and effectively produces butylpotassium, which is more reactive than the corresponding lithium reagent.|$|E
25|$|Analogous to benzene, {{nucleophilic}} substitutions to pyridine {{can result}} {{in the formation of}} pyridyne intermediates as heteroaryne. For this purpose, pyridine derivatives can be eliminated with good leaving groups using strong bases such as sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide.</b> The subsequent addition of a nucleophile to the triple bond has low selectivity, and the result is a mixture of the two possible adducts.|$|E
25|$|Amine 7 and {{carboxylic}} acid 18 were condensed through the acid chloride to amide 19. treatment with <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> in tert-butanol then gave tricycle 20 in a Michael reaction with hydrogen atoms in trans relationship. In anticipation to the partial {{reduction of the}} aromatic ring in the later compound protective groups were added: one of the carbonyl groups as the ketal in 21 and the other as an enol ether through the iminium salt 22 (Triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate) and the orthoamide 23 (sodium methoxide / methanol). Enol ether 24 was obtained by heating in toluene expelling ethanol. Birch reduction provided tetraene 25 and acid treatment gave the dione 26 dubbed pentacyclenone.|$|E
500|$|Deprotonation with sodium or {{potassium}} hydride {{in a mixture}} of liquid ammonia/THF at -40°C has been reported for imidazole-based carbenes. Arduengo and co-workers managed to prepare a dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene using NaH. However, this method has not been applied to the preparation of diaminocarbenes. [...] In some cases, <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> can be employed without the addition of a metal hydride.|$|E

2500|$|For most {{practical}} purposes, hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst. Hydrogenation can, however, proceed from some hydrogen donors without catalysts, illustrative hydrogen donors being diimide and aluminium isopropoxide, the latter {{illustrated by the}} Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction. [...] Some metal-free catalytic systems have been investigated in academic research. One such system for reduction of ketones consists of tert-butanol and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> and very high temperatures. The reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation of benzophenone: ...|$|E
2500|$|NET is {{made from}} estr-4-ene-3,17-dione (bolandione), {{which in turn is}} {{synthesized}} by partial reduction of the aromatic region of the 3-O-methyl ether of estrone with lithium in liquid ammonia, and simultaneously of the keto group at C17 to a hydroxy group, which is then oxidized back to a keto group by chromium trioxide in acetic acid. The congugated [...] C4-C5 olefin and the carbonyl group at C3 is then transformed to dienol ethyl ether using ethyl orthoformate. The obtained product is ethynylated by acetylene in the presence of <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide.</b> After HCl hydrolysis of the formed O-potassium derivative, during which the enol ether is also hydrolyzed, and the remaining double bond is shifted, the desired NET is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most popular}} {{use of the}} Wittig {{reaction}} is for {{the introduction of a}} methylene group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph3P=CH2). Using this reagent even a sterically hindered ketone such as camphor can be converted to its methylene derivative. [...] In this case, the Wittig reagent is prepared in situ by deprotonation of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide with <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide.</b> In another example, the phosphorane is produced using sodium amide as a base, and this reagent converts the aldehyde shown into alkene I in 62% yield. The reaction is performed in cold THF, and the sensitive nitro, azo and phenoxide groups are tolerated. The product can be used to incorporate a photostabiliser into a polymer, to protect the polymer from damage by UV radiation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> does {{react with}} {{chloroform}} yielding dichlorocarbene, the reaction {{can result in}} ignition. <b>Potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> does also react heavily with dichloromethane.|$|E
50|$|The Schlosser base (or Lochmann-Schlosser base), the {{combination}} of n-butyllithium and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide,</b> is a commonly used superbase. n-Butyllithium and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> form a mixed aggregate of greater reactivity than either reagent alone and with distinctly different properties in comparison to tert-butylpotassium.|$|E
50|$|Slow {{addition}} of preformed hydrazones to <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> in DMSO as reaction medium instead of glycols allows hydrocarbon formation {{to be conducted}} successfully at temperatures as low as 23 °C. Cram attributed the higher reactivity in DMSO as solvent to higher base strength of <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> in this medium.|$|E
5000|$|Commonly, {{the mixture}} called Schlosser's base is {{produced}} by combining n-butyllithium and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> in a one-to-one ratio.|$|E

50|$|In the Woodward modification, Woodward {{substituted}} <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> for the aluminium alkoxide. The Woodward {{modification of}} the Oppenauer oxidation, also called the Oppenauer-Woodward oxidation, is used when certain alcohol groups do not oxidize under the standard Oppenauer reaction conditions. For example, Wooward used <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> and benzophenone for the oxidation of quinine to quininone, as the traditional aluminium catalytic system failed to oxidize quinine due to the complex formed by coordination of the Lewis-basic nitrogen to the aluminium centre.|$|E
50|$|This {{finding was}} {{confirmed}} {{in another study}} with a slightly modified NHC using DBU as the base instead of <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> (Scheme 3).|$|E

50|$|Reduction of 1 with NMe4BH(OAc)3 in AcOH {{and water}} gives 2. Then tosylation with {{pyridine}} and TsOH gives 3, and elimination with <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> in tert-butanol gives 4.|$|E
50|$|A notable reagent that {{is based}} on a heavier alkali metal alkyl is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide.</b> This reagent reacts with toluene to form the red-orange {{compound}} benzyl potassium (KCH2C6CH5).|$|E
50|$|The Seyferth-Gilbert {{homologation}} is {{a chemical}} reaction of an aryl ketone 1 (or aldehyde) with dimethyl (diazomethyl)phosphonate 2 and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> to give substituted alkynes 3. Dimethyl (diazomethyl)phosphonate 2 {{is often called}} the Seyferth-Gilbert reagent.|$|E
50|$|Many free mesoionic carbenes are {{synthesized}} {{from their}} protonated salt form by deprotonation using strong potassium bases, such as potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (KHMDS) or <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> (KOt-Bu). Potassium bases are used {{because they do}} not form stable carbene-alkali metal adducts.|$|E
50|$|When {{tert-butyl alcohol}} is {{deprotonated}} {{with a strong}} base, the product is an alkoxide anion. In this case, it is tert-butoxide. For example, the commonly used organic reagent <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> is prepared by refluxing dry tert-butanol with potassium metal.|$|E
5000|$|A modern {{synthesis}} {{involves the}} reaction of butyllithium, <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide,</b> and toluene.

50|$|Sodium tert-butoxide is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula (CH3)3CONa. It {{is a strong}} base and a non-nucleophilic base. It is sometimes written in chemical literature as sodium t-butoxide. It is similar in reactivity to the more common <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In general, the {{reaction}} of haloalkane with potassium hydroxide can compete with an SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction by OH− [...] a strong, unhindered nucleophile. Alcohols are however generally minor products. Often dehydrohalogenations employ strong bases such as <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> (CH33CO− K+).|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} synthesis {{started by}} the Eglinton reaction of the di-alkyne 1,5-hexadiyne with copper(II) acetate in pyridine to give the trimer, followed by deprotonation and isomerization with <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> in tert-butanol and was concluded with hydrogen organic reduction with the Lindlar catalyst.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{published}} on the synthesis of cyclopropylacetylene. The earliest one start with the chlorination of cyclopropylmethylketone with phosphorus pentachloride. Thereafter, the reaction product, 1-cyclopropyl-1,1-dichloroethane, is converted into cyclopropylacetylene via double dehydrochlorination. This occurs in presence of a strong base, such as <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide,</b> in dimethyl sulfoxide: ...|$|E
50|$|New {{catalyst}} {{systems are}} actively researched which can {{bring down the}} processing temperature. In one study 1-pentanol is reacted with an iridium dehydrogenation catalyst (Cp* stands for the pentamethylcyclopentadiene ligand) and <b>potassium</b> <b>tert-butoxide</b> as a base in p-xylene.

50|$|As a {{laboratory}} reactant, heating 2-chloropropane with alcoholic potassium hydroxide will yield propene (an alkene) by a dehydrohalogenation reaction. However, reacting with potassium hydroxide would compete with an SN2 nucleophilic substitution reaction (minor product) because OH−-ion is a strong, sterically unhindered nucleophile.
