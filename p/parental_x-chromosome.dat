40|$|Female Safari {{cats are}} {{offspring}} {{of domestic and}} Geoffroy parents, and are balanced helcer,oz,rgc,tes with equal numbers of blood cells containing domestic as Geoffroy-type glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), an X-chromosome derived enzyme. In previous studies, however, we observed increasing percentages of blood cells with Geoffroy G 6 PD over 4 - 12 years. Similarly, ratios of <b>parental</b> <b>X-chromosome</b> phenotypes greater than three to one are common in women over age 60, while women under 40 typically exhibit one to one ratios. Using a two-compartment hidden-Markov model to represent the first two stages of hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell production, we show through simulation and math-ematical calculation that small differences in the kinetics of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), less than might be detected by in vitro assays, can explain the "clonal dominance " observed with aging in cats, and by extension, human females. Conceptually, hematopoiesis in females {{can be viewed as}} a competitive exclusion process in which two populations of HSC (defined by <b>parental</b> <b>X-chromosome</b> phenotype) compete for environmental resources. As in many ecological examples, dominance may occur only after long periods of time...|$|E
40|$|X {{chromosome}} inactivation (XCI) is the mammalian {{mechanism of}} dosage compensation that balances X-linked gene expression between the sexes. Early during female development, each cell of the embryo proper independently inactivates {{one of its}} two <b>parental</b> <b>X-chromosomes.</b> In mice, the choice of which X chromosome is inactivated {{is affected by the}} genotype of a cis-acting locus, the X-chromosome controlling element (Xce). Xce has been localized to a 1. 9 Mb interval within the X-inactivation center (Xic), yet its molecular identity and mechanism of action remain unknown. We combined genotype and sequence data for mouse stocks with detailed phenotyping of ten inbred strains and with the development of a statistical model that incorporates phenotyping data from multiple sources to disentangle sources of XCI phenotypic variance in natural female populations on X inactivation. We have reduced the Xce candidate 10 -fold to a 176 kb region located approximately 500 kb proximal to Xist. We propose that structural variation in this interval explains the presence of multiple functional Xce alleles in the genus Mus. We have identified a new allele, Xce(e) present in Mus musculus and a possible sixth functional allele in Mus spicilegus. We have also confirmed a parent-of-origin effect on X inactivation choice and provide evidence that maternal inheritance magnifies the skewing associated with strong Xce alleles. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of 155 laboratory strains and wild mice we conclude that Xce(a) is either a derived allele that arose concurrently with the domestication of fancy mice but prior the derivation of most classical inbred strains or a rare allele in the wild. Furthermore, we have found that despite the presence of multiple haplotypes in the wild Mus musculus domesticus has only one functional Xce allele, Xce(b). Lastly, we conclude that each mouse taxa examined has a different functional Xce allele...|$|R
40|$|Currently, mapping {{genes for}} complex human traitsrelies on two {{complementary}} approaches, linkage and association analyses. Both suffer from several methodological and theoretical limitations, which can considerably increase the type- 1 error rate {{and reduce the}} power to map human quantitative trait loci (QTL). This review focuses on linkage methods for QTL mapping. It summarizes the most common linkage statistics used, namely Hasemanâ€“Elston-based methods, variance components, and statistics that condition on trait values. Methods developed more recently that accommodate the <b>X-chromosome,</b> <b>parental</b> imprinting and allelic association in linkage analysis are also summarized. The type-I error rate and power of these methods are discussed. Finally, rough guidelines are provided to help guide th...|$|R
40|$|Cells of {{multicellular}} {{organisms are}} genetically homogenous but are heterogeneous {{in terms of}} morphology and functional specialization {{as a consequence of}} cell-specific expression of various sets of genes. During development, this cellular differentiation is established, maintained and changed in conjunction with cascades of transcription factors and epigenetic modulators such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs which work in tandem to co-ordinate the activity and regulation of the genome. DNA methylation is the principle epigenetic signal inducing genetic variation and plays a quintessential role in control of gene expression, cellular differentiation and development, preservation of chromosomal integrity, <b>parental</b> imprinting and <b>X-chromosome</b> inactivation. DNMT 1, the maintenance methyltransferase is the main perpetuator of methylation, faithfully propagating existing methyl marks across successive cell divisions. Several intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in the mammalian cells regulate DNMT 1 levels, their activity and stability including varied transcriptional activation of the respective genes, post-translational modifications of the enzyme, numerous interactions with other molecules involved in DNA methylation can affect catalytic activity, targeting and enzyme degradation at multiple levels. A comprehensive knowledge about DNMT 1, its structural and functional organization, regulatory mechanisms and quantification of the various interactions is essential to elucidate its function at the molecular level and to understand the dynamics of DNA methylation at the cellular level. The present study was carried out to clone and characterize DNMT 1. Further structure-function studies in this area will provide a comprehensive idea on DNMT 1 function...|$|R
40|$|Definition and {{characterization}} {{of the role of}} Epigenetic mechanisms have gained immense momentum since the completion of the Human Genome Project. The human epigenetic layer, made up of DNA methylation and multiple histone protein modifications, (the key elements of epigenetic mechanisms), is known to act as a switchboard that regulates the occurrence of most cellular events. In multicellular organisms such as humans, all cells have identical genomic contents but vary in DNA Methylation (DM) profile with the result that different types of cells perform a spectrum of functions. DM within the genome is associated with tight control of gene expression, <b>parental</b> imprinting, <b>X-chromosome</b> inactivation, long-term silencing of repetitive elements and chromatin condensation. Recently, considerable evidence has been put forward to demonstrate that environmental stress implicitly alters normal interactions among key epigenetic elements inside the genome. Aberrations in the spread of DM especially hypo/hyper methylation supported by an abnormal landscape of histone modifications have been strongly associated with Cancer initiation and development. While new findings on the impact of these key elements are reported regularly, precise information on how DM is controlled and its relation to networks of histone modifications is lacking. This has motivated modelling of DNA methylation and histone modifications and their interdependence. We describe initial computational methods used to investigate these key elements of epigenetic change, and to assess related information contained in DNA sequence patterns. We then describe attempts to develop a phenomenological epigenetic "micromodel", based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo principles. This theoretical micromodel ("EpiGMP") aims to explore the effect of histome modifications and gene expression for defined levels of DNA methylation. We apply this micromodel to (i) test networks of genes in colon cancer (extracted from an in-house database, StatEpigen), and (ii) to help define an agent-based modelling framework to explore chromatin remodelling (or the dynamics of physical rearrangements), inside the human genome. Parallelization techniques to address issues of scale during the application of this micromodel have been adopted as well. A generic tool of this kind can potentially be applied to predict molecular events that affect the state of expression of any gene during the onset or progress of cancer. Ultimately, the goal is to provide additional information on ways in which these low level molecular changes determine physical traits for mormal and disease conditions in an organism...|$|R
