Two firm types characterise {{the industry and}} this particular set of activities; large multinational firms (‘majors’) and smaller regionally bound companies (‘independents’). We find that the Transaction Cost Economies frame-work of Oliver Williamson (1985, 1999) provides only a partial explanation for the observed hybrid organisational structures established by the two firm types. A more sensitive model {{can be achieved by}} including a number of moderating variables drawn from the socially constructed and situationally dependent idiosyncrasies of the assets involved in the PS&D activities under consideration.

Africa is a large continent, containing numerous countries, dialects and cultures. Each country presents {{its own set of}} unique opportunities and threats, and therefore a focused approach is required to develop a plan for organisations to not only grow into new markets and to service new clients, but also to expand service-rendering capability among its current clients by providing services from the <b>product</b> <b>source</b> to their end destination in Africa. It is therefore the purpose of this research project to focus on Mozambique and the Port of Maputo, with a detailed consideration of the strategic value that the Port of Maputo presents to organisations {{on the basis of its}} geographic location and proximity to <b>product</b> <b>sources,</b> both within Mozambique and its neighbouring countries [...] ...|$|R

30|$|The one-site-one-license {{process is}} {{commonly}} deployed among the APEC economies which are “CPP-dependent” (ASEAN Variation Guidelines 2013; Hong Kong Drug Office 2017), and {{this approach is}} quite the opposite of that practiced by ICH members. This results in highly duplicative and onerous procedures which are mainly administrative and have little (if no) positive impact on quality, safety and efficacy. The burden to apply and maintain multiple licenses for a single product significantly reduces <b>product</b> <b>sourcing</b> flexibility and affects continuity of supply, thus impacting patients {{in the case of}} product shortages. It is therefore strongly recommended that the APEC economies with the one-site-one-license requirement consider reviewing this system to allow for single licenses for multiple sites in order to converge regional regulatory practice in this particular area.|$|E
40|$|Multi-national {{manufacturing}} companies are often faced with very difficult decisions regarding {{where and how}} to cost effectively manufacture products in a global setting. Clearly, they must utilize efficient and responsive manufacturing strategies to reach low cost solutions, but they must also consider the impact of manufacturing and transportation solutions upon their ability to support sales. One important sales consideration is determining how much work in process, in-transit stock, and finished goods to have on hand to support sales at a desired service level. This paper addresses this important consideration through a comprehensive scenario-based simulation approach, including sensitivity analysis on key study parameters. Results indicate that the inventory needs vary considerably for different manufacturing and delivery methods in ways {{that may not be}} obvious when using common evaluative tools.

40|$|One major body of {{literature}} {{in the application of}} institutional economics to market development concerns economic coordination. This literature seeks to explain why market systems are structured as they are, thereby revealing fundamental challenges that have to be addressed if efficient markets (for goods and services) are to develop. On a practical level, interest in coordination has risen dramatically as supply chains have become increasingly globalized and have tried to respond to the greater demands placed on them by consumers and regulators. In the agro-food sector, the dramatic rise in the power of supermarkets in many countries (Reardon et al. 2003) is associated with moves away from <b>product</b> <b>sourcing</b> through traditional wholesale markets toward vertically coordinated chains. It is in this context that Jaffee (1995, 25) writes: “In commodity systems analysis, the central focus is on the problems and mechanisms for coordination. ”Book chapterPRIFPRI...|$|E
