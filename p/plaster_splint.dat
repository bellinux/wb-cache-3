40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} varying numbers of layers of plaster of Paris bandages on the mechanical properties of specimens used {{on the construction of}} orthopedic splints. METHODS: Rectangular plate-shaped and cylinder-shaped specimens were constructed and assigned to two groups simulating plaster slabs and cast and further divided into six subgroups according to the number of layers used: 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 layers. The specimens were subjected to either a three-point bending test (plates/slab) or compressive strength test (cylinders/cast). The following mechanical properties were evaluated: maximum load, elastic limit load and stiffness. Specimen weight was also calculated. Data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and the least significant difference (LSD) tests. RESULTS: Pairwise comparisons of the subgroups 10 x 12 and 10 x 14 revealed significant differences for all mechanical properties (p< 0. 05). The {{results of this study suggest}} that when the goal is to construct appliances with high mechanical strength, regardless of weight, such as serial <b>plaster</b> slabs <b>splints</b> for stimulating tissue growth through the application of gradual load, <b>splints</b> made with <b>plaster</b> of Paris bandages with 12 or 14 layers should be preferred. For orthotic devices such as positioning orthotics, the use of 10 layers <b>plaster</b> bandages slab <b>splints</b> is advisable as they were found to have better correlation between mechanical strength and weight in comparison to those made wtih 6 or 8 layers.

30|$|Burns from {{orthopaedic}} <b>plaster</b> cast <b>splints,</b> {{although not}} common occurrences, {{have been reported}} [5, 6, 11]. Previous investigators have evaluated the exothermic properties of plaster or synthetic casting materials separately. Ganaway and Hunter [12] and Lavalette and Pope [1] demonstrated plaster could, under the right set of conditions, create temperatures {{at or above the}} burn threshold. Synthetic materials, however, have a smaller exothermic potential and even under the worst conditions did not create dangerous temperatures [2]. The important variables identified in previous studies which influenced the temperatures generated have been cast thickness, dip water temperature, type of casting material, and the presence of an insulator (pillow) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13]. Deignan et al. [14] were even able to show that pressure applied during themolding of casts results in a significant increase in temperature at the side where the mold was applied. Variables of lesser importance included the amount of cast padding, the room humidity, the room temperature, and the use of previously used dip water. Haasch [5] emphasized that when the cast rolls are soaked in hot water, they absorb water at a slower rate than when they are soaked in cold water. Also, if the cast rolls are dipped in water {{for a short period of}} time, they absorb less water. When less water is present in the cast rolls, the temperature of the cast increases. The specific heat capacity of water of 4, 190  J/kg K is very high, which means the more water is present, the more of a cooling effect the water has on the temperature of the cast.|$|R

30|$|In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, {{the risk}} of thrombosis, and therefore, the need for prophylaxis, can generally be considered as proportional to the duration and invasiveness (trauma, demolition) of the surgical procedure. Other surgery-related factors that may influence the likelihood of thrombogenesis are: {{the position of the}} patient on the operating table (particularly if prone), any forced twisting or traction of a limb that could damage the blood vessels, and the use of additional medical devices (in particular, the tourniquet). One significant thrombotic risk factor in both surgical and non-surgical interventions (lower limb <b>plaster</b> casts, brace, <b>splints</b> or appliance) is the length of time before the patient returns to normal ambulation. In fact, compression on the plantar venous plexus brought about by normal ambulation, and the concomitant activation of the calf muscle pump, are key factors to ensuring the centripetal venous return. Ambulatory patients with fully functional feet and ankle movements are, therefore, far less likely to develop venous stasis. Hence, as venous stasis can cause thrombogenesis (particularly in the calf), the need for antithrombotic prophylaxis should be evaluated in cases of impediment to normal ambulation and calf muscle function (ankle/calf splinting or casting and/or non-weight bearing, NWB). Although the precise contribution of plantar venous plexus compression and calf muscle pump function to the circulation has not been evaluated, and firm evidence is, therefore, lacking, a load of 10 – 20  kg should be considered the minimum for its activation.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ankle sprains {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} treated musculoskeletal injuries. The three main treatment modalities for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries are immobilisation with <b>plaster</b> cast or <b>splint,</b> 'functional treatment' comprising early mobilisation and use of an external support (e. g. ankle brace), and surgical repair or reconstruction. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (January 2006), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2005), EMBASE, CINAHL and reference lists of articles, and contacted researchers in the field. This review is considered updated to January 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions for treating ankle sprains in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled. We performed sensitivity analyses to explore the robustness of the findings. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty trials were included. These involved a total of 2562 mostly young active adult males. All trials had methodological weaknesses. Specifically, concealment of allocation was confirmed in only one trial. Data for pooling individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 12 trials and under 60 % of participants. The findings of statistically significant differences in favour of the surgical treatment group for the four primary outcomes (non-return to pre-injury level of sports; ankle sprain recurrence; long-term pain; subjective or functional instability) when using the fixed-effect model were not robust when using the random-effects model, nor on the removal of one low quality (quasi-randomised) trial that had more extreme results. A corresponding drop in the I(2) statistics showed the remaining trials to be more homogeneous. The functional implications of the statistically significantly higher incidence of objective instability in conservatively treated trial participants are uncertain. There was some limited evidence for longer recovery times, and higher incidences of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inversion injuries, {{primarily}} sprains, of {{the ankle}} {{are one of}} the most commonly treated injuries. The three main treatment modalities for acute lateral ankle ligament injuries are immobilisation with <b>plaster</b> cast or <b>splint,</b> 'functional treatment' comprising early mobilisation and the use of an external support (e. g. ankle brace or taping), and surgical repair or reconstruction. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare surgical versus conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2001), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2000), EMBASE (1980 to May 2000), CURRENT CONTENTS (1993 to 1999), BIOSIS (to 1999), reference lists of articles, and contacted organisations and researchers in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical with conservative interventions for treating acute injuries to the lateral ligament complex of the ankle in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two, usually three, reviewers independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Where appropriate, results of comparable studies were pooled using fixed and random effects models and relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes calculated. Heterogeneity between trials was tested using a standard chi-squared test. We undertook sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of inclusion of quasi-randomised trials and subgroup analyses by the two main methods of conservative treatment. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen studies, involving a total of 1950 mostly young active adult males, were included. All trials had methodological flaws. In particular, allocation was rated as effectively concealed in only one trial and there was no report of masking outcome assessors to the interventions in any trial. Outcome measures were variously defined and data for pooling for individual outcomes were only available for a maximum of 11 studies. While there were statistically significant differences for three primary outcomes (non-return to pre-injury level of sports; undefined pain or pain on activity; and subjective or functional instability) in favour of the surgical treatment group using the fixed effects model, these findings failed to demonstrate robustness in sensitivity analyses. Exclusion of the data from explicitly quasi-randomised trials or, given the highly statistically significant heterogeneity, analyses using the random effects model modified these findings to non-statistically significant differences. There was no statistically significant difference in ankle sprain recurrence, the other primary outcome measure. Though there was a statistically significantly higher incidence of objective instability in conservatively treated patients, the functional implications of this are uncertain. There was some evidence for a lower incidence of long-term ankle swelling in surgically treated patients. However, as well as tending to take longer to resume normal activities, including work, there was some limited evidence from a few trials for a higher incidence of ankle stiffness, impaired ankle mobility and complications in the surgical treatment group. Subgroup analyses by type of conservative treatment (plaster cast or functional treatment) revealed no statistically significant differences in effect for any of the six outcomes examined. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence available from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment for acute injuries of the lateral ligament complex of the ankle.

40|$|Having {{compared}} {{the results of}} five cases of ruptured patellar tendon we concluded that it was imperative to protect the suture by a metallic cerclage 12 / 10 mm through a tunnel in the tibial crest and sutured in a figure of 8 fashion around the patella.

Three weeks later walking is permitted with a posterior removable <b>plaster</b> <b>splint</b> allowing further kinesitherapy. After 2 mth extension is full and active flexion during squatting without aid is 90 °. There must be no fear for rupture of the wire which occurs only after healing of the tendon.

30|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} advocacy {{for the implementation of}} an “Orthopaedic Surgery Boot Camp” for first-year residents. These “boot camps” are being trialed at numerous orthopaedic surgery residency programs across North America in various forms. While varying greatly in length, most such sessions include surgical skills training on both cadaveric specimens and simulators. No current consensus is available regarding the appropriate structure, time, or objectives of such “boot camps,” though the literature suggests that they may be of some benefit to first year orthopaedic surgery residents. Some of the most robust data regarding orthopaedic surgery “boot camps” for first year residents is available from the University of Toronto (Sonnadara et al. 2011). While arthroscopic knot tying was not a part of their “boot camp” curriculum, other relevant orthopaedic surgery technical skills, such as wedge cutting using reciprocating and oscillating saws, bone drilling, screw insertion, and <b>plaster</b> <b>splint</b> application, were taught with statistically significant improvements from pre-test measurements. However, the application of these “boot camps” is resource intensive and may ultimately take away from other aspects of clinical training.|$|E
40|$|Mallet finger is the {{deformity}} {{caused by}} a tear of the extensor expansion from its attachment {{to the base of}} the terminal phalanx. Sometimes there is an associated fracture {{caused by a}}vulsion of a small triangular fragment of bone.

Nasal fractures are common, and although their surgical treatment is standardized, there is disagreement about their splintage and postoperative management. A variety of nasal splints are at present in use. Small splints of aluminium or dental impression compound, {{which can be}} moulded to the nose, are available. More commonly a <b>plaster</b> <b>splint</b> is applied, and this is fixed in place with adhesive strapping or tapes around the head. The plaster may be cut so {{that it has a}} broad area for attachment to the forehead or broad flanges for resting on the maxillae to provide further support. In the latter case, the plaster is usually fixed in place by connecting it to tapes which are tied behind the head. In no case should a splint be applied in the hope that it can exert pressure on and compensate for an incompletely reduced fracture. Satisfactory postoperative results will be obtained only if reduction is complete {{at the time of the}} operation. Therefore the main function of splints for nasal fractures without loss of support is to prevent further injuries displacing the bones during healing. Open Acces...|$|E
30|$|Patient was {{positioned}} supine and whole right upper extremity was prepared and draped. A sterile tourniquet was applied on upper {{arm and a}} 20 -cm posterior longitudinal incision was made. Upon opening the subcutaneous layer, the TT was found ruptured and retracted proximally. The gap was filled with dense fibrous healing tissue (Fig.  2). The ulnar nerve was exposed and dissected free from surrounding fibrosis and protected with Penrose drain. Medial epicondyle was observed devoid of any tissue. Flexor-pronator muscle group was found totally avulsed from the medial epicondyle and retracted distally. Ulnar collateral ligament was totally ruptured and remaining parts were attenuated. Triceps tendon was surgically freed from the proximal ulna in continuum with the strong fibrous healing tissue. Since UCL tissue was irreparable, a reconstruction using ipsilateral free palmaris longus tendon graft was performed as described previously [2]. Non-absorbable sutures in Krackow fashion were used to secure the TT. Four drill holes 1  cm apart were prepared at the posterior cortex of the proximal ulna for TT fixation. To improve fixation, two 3.5 -mm suture anchors were used {{at the tip of}} the olecranon. Triceps tendon was then secured to the bone while the elbow in 10 – 20 ° of flexion. The ulnar nerve was transferred to the anterior aspect of the elbow submuscularly. Flexor-pronator muscle group was repaired to the medial epicondyle with non-absorbable sutures passing through the bone. Stability and range of motion were tested before the closure over a suction drain. Posterior <b>plaster</b> <b>splint</b> was applied with elbow at 50 – 60 ° flexion.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} according to GCP criteria as a prospective randomized cross-over study. The primary goal {{of the study was}} to determine clinical findings and patient satisfaction with postoperative treatment. 29 patients with a distal radius fracture that was surgically stabilized from volar and who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled over a 12 -month period. Each patient randomly received either a dorsal <b>plaster</b> <b>splint</b> or a vacuum-fit flexible but blocked orthosis applied postoperatively in the operating theatre to achieve postoperative immobilization. After one week all patients were crossed over to the complementary device maintaining the immobilization until end of week 2. After week 2 both groups were allowed to exercise wrist mobility with a physiotherapist, in the orthosis group the device was deblocked, thus allowing limited wrist mobility. After week 4 the devices were removed in both groups. Follow-up exams were performed after postoperative weeks 1, 2, 4 and 12. Results were determined after week 1 and 2 using SF 36 and a personally compiled questionnaire; after weeks 4 and 12 with a clinical check-up, calculation of ROM and the DASH Score. Comparison of the two groups showed a significant difference in ROM for volar flexion after 4 weeks, but no significant differences in DASH Score, duration of disability or x-ray findings. With regard to satisfaction with comfort and hygiene, patients were significantly more satisfied with the dynamic orthosis, and 23 of the 29 patients would prefer the flexible vacuum orthosis in future.

40|$|Background. Primary {{treatment}} of 779 closed epiphysial, diaphyseal, comminutive, oblique and periarticular fractures of metacarpals and phalanges {{was carried out}} with painless reposition and fixation with a <b>plaster</b> <b>splint.</b> In 435 cases, fracture slides occurred after one week. For correction, the ligamentotaxis metod with aluminium (Alu-) splint and Softcast plaster was used. This method allows the retaining of a good position of fractured fragments after reposition by neutralization of the pathologic action of kinetic vectors on these fragments. Our goal in using this method is to stabilize the fractured fragments individually with consideration of soft tissues. Methods. In local (in the fracture) or Oberst analgesia, a correct size Alu-splint is placed over the wad-protected skin on the volar or dorsal side of the hand. The Alu-splint is fixed with Urgopore proximally and distally from the fracture. Then, correction using the reduction technique over the Alu-splinting is done. Such correction is followed by X-ray control and if the fragments are in good position, the construction is fixed with plaster. One week later, X-ray control verifies the position of broken parts. Results. In the year 2000, 740 outpatients {{with a total of}} 779 (100 %) metacarpal and phalangeal fractures were treated. There were 569 (73 %) men and 210 (27 %) women. The incidence in men was highest in the 10 – 19 years age group with 143 fractures. In the 50 – 59 years group, the incidence was equal in men and women (69 fractures). The highest prevalence of fracture slides was in the group of proximal phalanx fractures (190 fractures or 44 %). X-ray control after one week showed 435 (56 %) fracture slides in immobilization with plaster. This high percentage is due to a severe damage to skeletal connective tissue. 321 (41 %) fractures were re-repositioned with ligamentotaxis, 172 (22 %) fracture slides were treated using other methods (e. g. surgery). 385 (49 %) fractures treated with ligamentotaxis were without significant slides, the fragments healing in good position. End functional results were satisfactory. We had only one decubitus, which healed per primam after reshaping of the splint. Conclusions. The application of local analgesia and ligamentotaxis represents a simple and safe method of treatment. It allows individual biomechanical neutralization of the pathologic activity of kinetic energy vectors on the fracture. Repositioning and physiological positioning of the hand in Softcast plaster is simple, {{there is no need to}} hospitalize the patient for surgery. This makes the method less costly as well. There are less fracture slides, and repairs due to decubitus are simpler as there is no need for total immobilization removal. Therefore ligamentotaxis is the method of choice. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar a {{amplitude}} de movimento (ADM) em mãos que sofreram reparo tendinoso dos músculos flexores superficial e profundo dos dedos, comparando os dados de cada dedo na mão lesada e entre mãos lesadas e não lesadas. MÉTODOS: Foi realizada a goniometria ativa em 15 pacientes e 120 dedos, 60 dedos de mãos lesadas e 60 de mãos controle não lesadas. Os sujeitos foram avaliados no momento da retirada da tala gessada, tendo sido realizada a movimentação precoce pelo método de Duran modificado. A partir dos dados goniométricos, foram registrados os valores do índice TAM (Total Active Motion) dos dedos nas mãos lesadas e controle. Para análise dos dados, foi acessada a fórmula de índices funcionais proposta pela American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) e para cálculo estatístico, foi escolhido o Modelo de Efeitos Mistos. RESULTADOS: A fórmula da ASSH para os dedos lesados mostrou que 18, 33 % tiveram a classificação do movimento "bom", 18, 33 %, "regular" e 63, 34 %, "pobre". Foram comparadas as médias das medidas em graus de todos os dedos entre si dentro de cada grupo, controle ou lesado, e as médias das medidas entre os grupos, encontrando-se um p-valor significante apenas entre os grupos controle e lesado. Não houve diferença estatística entre o TAM de cada dedo na mão lesada. CONCLUSÃO: Independente de quantos dedos tenham sofrido lesão tendinosa em uma mão, os dedos não lesados também terão suas ADMs ativas diminuídas no período logo após a retirada da imobilização. OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} range of motion (ROM) in hands that underwent tendon repair in the flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus muscles of the fingers, comparing the data between the fingers on the injured hand, and between the injured and uninjured hands. METHOD: Active goniometry was performed on 15 patients, making a total of 120 fingers (60 on injured hands and 60 on noninjured control hands). The patients were examined {{at the time of}} removing the <b>plaster</b> <b>splint.</b> Early mobilization was performed using the modified Duran method. Goniometric data were used for recording the TAM (total active motion) values of the fingers on the injured and uninjured (control) hands. To analyze the data, the functional index formula proposed by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) was utilized, and for statistical calculations the mixed-effect model was selected. RESULTS: The ASSH formula for the injured fingers classified the movement as "good" in 18. 33 %, "fair" in 18. 33 % and "poor" in 63. 34 %. The means, in degrees, of the measurements for all the fingers were compared with each other within each group (control and injured) and between the groups. A significant difference was found between control and injured groups. There was no statistical difference between the TAM of each finger on the injured hand. CONCLUSION: Independent of how many fingers on one hand had suffered tendon injuries, the uninjured fingers also presented diminished active ROM during the period immediately after removal of the immobilization...|$|E

Ta iznimno rijetka lokalizacija osteoid osteoma predstavlja problem za prepoznavanje i zbog atipične prezentacije. Dvadesetogodišnji bolesnik se pet godina žalio na bol u području jagodice IV. prsta desne šake koja je bila praćena oteklinom i crvenilom jagodice prsta te deformacijom nokta. Na rendgenskim snimkama vidjela se osteoliza u području baze distalne falange. Magnetskom rezonancijom je postavljena sumnja na osteoid osteom, što je potvrđeno kompjuteriziranom tomografi jom. Nakon kirurškog liječenja tijekom kojeg je osteoid osteom ekskohleiran, dolazi do potpunog nestanka tegoba. Potpuni oporavak bolesnika pokazuje i rezultat DASH upitnika, koji je već tri mjeseca nakon zahvata pao sa 54, 5 na 0 što je prema tom upitniku uredan nalaz. Na osteoid osteom se uvijek mora posumnjati ako je oteklina distalne falange prsta s deformacijom nokta praćena bolovima koji se smanjuju korištenjem NSAIL. Metoda izbora u dijagnostici je kompjuterizirana tomografi ja koja mora biti načinjena tako da slojevi ne budu deblji od 1 do 2 mm. Zbog blizine neurovaskularnih struktura i tetiva najboljim oblikom liječenja osteoid osteoma u području distalne falange prstiju šake smatra se kirurška ekscizija ili ekskohleacija. With this {{clinical}} observation {{we would}} like to bring to mind osteoid osteoma as a possible cause of problems of distal phalanx of the fi ngers. Osteoid osteoma occurs rarely at this location and has atypical presentation. The main symptoms are swelling and redness of the fi ngertip with nail deformity, while typical night pain may not be present. Unusual clinical and x-ray presentation of tumor in this localization can make diagnosis of osteoid osteoma very difficult. A 20 -year-old patient reported pain in the fi ngertip of his right ring finger persisting for fi ve years. Swelling and redness of the fi ngertip combined with nail deformity was also present. X-rays showed osteolysis in the base of distal phalanx. Magnetic resonance imaging showed suspicion of osteoid osteoma, which was confi rmed by computed tomography (CT). We performed surgical removal of osteoid osteoma in February 2014. The tumor was approached by longitudinal incision on the lateral side of the distal phalanx of the ring fi nger and the basal part of distal phalanx was cut with a small chisel to enable access to cystic change of the bone. Tumor removal with excochleation was performed and the material thus obtained was sent for histopathologic analysis. After surgery, the ring fi nger was immobilized in a <b>plaster</b> <b>splint</b> for a three-week period. After removal of immobilization, the patient was referred to physical therapy consisting of individual exercises in order to obtain the full range of motion in all joints of the hands and strengthen hand and forearm muscles. After surgical removal of osteoid osteoma, all symptoms disappeared completely. Histopathologic findings confi rmed the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. After physical therapy, he returned to daily activities without any problems. On regular follow ups at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, clinical fi ndings were normal and the patient had no pain or discomforts. Full recovery was shown by the result of the DASH questionnaire three months after the procedure. Preoperative DASH score 54. 4 decreased to 0. Distal phalanx of the fi nger is a very rare localization of osteoid osteoma, and typical night pain may not be present. In addition, appearance on x-rays is not typical. Instead of central enlightenment surrounded with sclerosis, x-rays usually show a lytic lesion. For this reason, it may be diffi cult to make the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. The main symptom is permanent pain, swelling and redness of the fi nger, with nail deformity. The imaging method of choice is CT, which must be performed with thin layers of 1 to 2 mm. Furthermore, cooperation of surgeon and radiologist is extremely important to reach the accurate diagnosis. Many treatment options are described in the literature, such as CT-guided percutaneous thermocoagulation, destruction of lesions with alcohol, or CT-guided radiofrequency ablation. However, due to the proximity of neurovascular structures, tendons and joints, the best method for treatment osteoid osteoma in distal phalanx of the fi ngers is surgical excision or excochleation. Our conclusion is that one should always bear in mind that osteoid osteoma can be the cause of swelling of distal phalanx of the fi nger with nail deformity, and pain that alleviated with the use of non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs. Surgical excision or excochleation is the best method for the treatment osteoid osteoma of distal phalanx of the finger...|$|E
