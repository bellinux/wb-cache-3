40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of downstream coronary stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) or left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) on the assessment of fractional flow reserve (FFR) across an intermediate left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis in humans with the pressure wire positioned in the nondiseased <b>downstream</b> <b>vessel.</b> BackgroundAccurate assessment of intermediate LMCA disease is critical for guiding decisions regarding revascularization. In theory, FFR across an intermediate LMCA stenosis will be affected by downstream disease, even if the pressure wire is positioned in the nondiseased <b>downstream</b> <b>vessel.</b> MethodsAfter percutaneous coronary intervention of the LAD, LCx, or both, an intermediate LMCA stenosis was created with a deflated balloon catheter. FFR was measured in the LAD and LCx coronary arteries before and after creation of downstream stenosis by inflating an angioplasty balloon within the newly placed stent. The true FFR (FFRtrue) of the LMCA, measured in the nondiseased <b>downstream</b> <b>vessel</b> in the absence of stenosis in the other vessel, was compared with the apparent FFR (FFRapp) measured in the presence of stenosis. ResultsIn 25 patients, 91 pairs of measurements were made, 71 with LAD stenosis and 20 with LCx stenosis. FFRtrue of the LMCA was significantly lower than FFRapp (0. 81 ± 0. 08 vs. 0. 83 ± 0. 08, p  0. 85, FFRtrue was > 0. 80. ConclusionsIn most cases, downstream disease does not have a clinically significant impact on the assessment of FFR across an intermediate LMCA stenosis with the pressure wire positioned in the nondiseased vessel...|$|R

40|$|Elevated intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) {{is the main}} risk factor for glaucoma. Exogenous nitric oxide (NO) decreases IOP by increasing outflow facility, but whether endogenous NO production contributes to the physiological regulation of outflow facility is unclear. Outflow facility was measured by pressure-controlled perfusion in ex vivo eyes from C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type (WT) or transgenic mice expressing human endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) superimposed on the endogenously expressed murine eNOS (eNOS-GFPtg). In WT mice, exogenous NO delivered by 100 μM S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) increased outflow facility by 62 ± 28 % (SD) relative to control eyes perfused with the inactive SNAP analog N-acetyl-d-penicillamine (NAP; n = 5, P = 0. 016). In contrast, in eyes from eNOS-GFPtg mice, SNAP {{had no effect on}} outflow facility relative to NAP (− 9 ± 4 %, P = 0. 40). In WT mice, the nonselective NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 10 μM) decreased outflow facility by 36 ± 13 % (n = 5 each, P = 0. 012), but 100 μM l-NAME had no detectable effect on outflow facility (− 16 ± 5 %, P = 0. 22). An eNOS-selective inhibitor (cavtratin, 50 μM) decreased outflow facility by 19 ± 12 % in WT (P = 0. 011) and 39 ± 25 % in eNOS-GFPtg (P = 0. 014) mice. In the conventional outflow pathway of eNOS-GFPtg mice, eNOS-GFP expression was localized to endothelial cells lining Schlemm's canal and the <b>downstream</b> <b>vessels,</b> with no apparent expression in the trabecular meshwork.

50|$|Historically, the {{thousands}} of square miles that comprised the floodplain of the Missouri River supported {{a wide range of}} plant and animal species. Biodiversity generally increased <b>proceeding</b> <b>downstream</b> from the cold, subalpine headwaters in Montana to the temperate, moist climate of Missouri. Today, the river's riparian zone consists primarily of cottonwoods, willows and sycamores, with several other types of trees such as maple and ash. Average tree height generally increases farther from the riverbanks for a limited distance, as land adjacent to the river is vulnerable to soil erosion during floods. Because of its large sediment concentrations, the Missouri does not support many aquatic invertebrates. However, the basin does support about 300 species of birds and 150 species of fish, some of which are endangered such as the pallid sturgeon. The Missouri's aquatic and riparian habitats also support several species of mammals, such as minks, river otters, beavers, muskrats, and raccoons.|$|R

These results suggest that the role of RNA polymerase during the initiation of lambda phage DNA replication may be more complex than solely influencing DNA topology. Results demonstrated in this study also show that gyrase supercoiling activity stimulates the formation of a complex between lambdaO and RNA polymerase, suggesting that the introduction of negative supercoils by DNA gyrase, besides lowering the energy required for DNA strand separation, may play an additional role in modeling protein–protein interactions at early steps of DNA replication initiation...|$|R

The process of vortex shedding at {{the trailing edge of}} the blade and its <b>proceeding</b> <b>downstream</b> in the wake area is analyzed using a wavelet based vortex identification algorithm. The wavelet algorithm automatically detects vortices and extracts e. g. their position, their vorticity, and their convection velocity. This procedure enables a statistical analysis on the basis of numerous PIV recordings. The vortex production, the downstream transport and the vortex decay are observed successfully. The Strouhal number and the shedding frequency are directly derived from the vortex position and confirm previous investigations. The PIV combined with a wavelet based analysis constitutes a remarkable insight to time dependent flow structures...|$|R
