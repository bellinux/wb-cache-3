40|$|Pierced is a {{collection}} of Oven to Tableware products manufactured by Leeds Pottery. This collection of contemporary cookware and tableware is the fruit of an extensive and in-depth body of research undertaken at the V&A supported by Ceramics curator Alun Graves. This research unearthed the relationship between ornament and function in historical ceramics, how the decoration was often integral to the function of the object. The collection seeks to invent the notion of the functional decoration, using the traditional technique of piercing, where the clay is <b>pierced</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> usually to create geometric patterns. Unique to this project, any mark or cut is integral to the function of the object, thus re-inventing this traditional area of ceramics for a contemporary market. This method of cutting by hand is almost unique and acts as trademark or identity for the collection. Each object is handcrafted using techniques that have been employed in the Leeds Pottery for over 200 years. Fundamental to this project was the use of new technologies to expand and enhance old processes. The designs were modelled using 3 D printing technology to develop prototypes. These models were then converted for traditional manufacturing processes, exploring the notion of reverse engineering...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{account of}} his death was first {{recorded}} 80 years after the events by Roman chronicler Marcellinus Comes. It reports that [...] "Attila, King of the Huns and ravager of the provinces of Europe, was <b>pierced</b> <b>by</b> the <b>hand</b> and blade of his wife". The Volsunga saga and the Poetic Edda claim that King Atli (Attila) died {{at the hands of}} his wife Gudrun. Most scholars reject these accounts as no more than hearsay, preferring instead the account given by Attila's contemporary Priscus. Priscus' version, however, has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Babcock. Based on detailed philological analysis, Babcock concludes that the account of natural death given by Priscus was an ecclesiastical [...] "cover story", and that Emperor Marcian (who ruled the Eastern Roman Empire from 450 to 457) was the political force behind Attila's death. Jordanes recounts: ...|$|R

5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being <b>pierced,</b> frequently <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|R
