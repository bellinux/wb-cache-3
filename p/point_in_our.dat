500|$|Popjustice writer Peter Robinson said Porcelain Black {{was one of}} pop music's most confusingly styled artists, {{attributing}} {{the shift}} from her edgier, rock-inspired look to one resembling Jennifer Lopez as an attempt by her team to make her image more marketable. Despite the appraisal, he critiqued her song [...] "Rich Boi" [...] as being influenced by rock icons, Def Leppard and Steve Miller Band. In another review, Robinson commented on another record called [...] "One Woman Army" [...] from Porcelain Black's private Hollywood show. Stylistically in vein with Porcelain Black's pop rock genre hybrid, [...] "One Woman Army" [...] contains rapping, which Robinson said was [...] "completely ridiculous and we love it."

[...] "I think at this <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> career, we are better musicians and we've evolved our way of thinking as far as songwriting", DeLonge told Billboard in reference to the more mature lyricism. Hoppus, in his interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, described the lyrics as the most personal he had written to that point. While past recordings tended to meditate on feelings from high school, the band felt it was akin to a safety net and desired to write about [...] "what's going on [...] right now." [...] Lyrics continued to be autobiographical, but the band took more time than usual on their writing. DeLonge would routinely rewrite his sections upwards of four times.|$|E

This line was not in the original script, but was added because Perry, as Charles explained, [...] "just had the right look". Christine Dunford was cast as Leslie, Charles commented [...] "she just came in; gave a great reading. At this <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> show business history, I don't think we knew anybody". Dunford would return later as a saleswoman in the season five episode [...] "The Pie". Margaret Reed, best known for her role on the soap opera As the World Turns, appeared as Mary Cantardi, a woman who screams at Jerry for not calling her back after a date. Vic Polizos and James Lashly guest-starred as the Russian cable installers. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra in the first scene of the episode, standing at the counter at Monk's Cafe.|$|E

500|$|Getting {{funding for}} the project was {{difficult}} because of the taboos against death, and the crew had to approach several companies before Departures was approved by Toshiaki Nakazawa and Yasuhiro Mase. According to the film's director, Yōjirō Takita, a consideration in taking on the film was {{the age of the}} crew: [...] "we got to a certain <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives when death was creeping up to become a factor around us". Kundō Koyama was enlisted to provide the script, his first for a feature film; his previous experience had been in scripting for television and stage. Takita, who had begun his career in the pink film genre before entering mainstream filmmaking in 1986 with Comic Magazine, took on the director's role in 2006, after producer Toshiaki Nakazawa presented him with the first draft of the script. In a later interview he stated [...] "I wanted to make a film {{from the perspective of a}} person who deals with something so universal and yet is looked down upon, and even discriminated against". Although he knew of the encoffining ceremony, he had never seen one performed.|$|E
500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives fall." ...|$|E

2500|$|In their book, Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson helped pioneer this approach, {{claiming}} that metaphor {{is what makes}} human thought special. All language, they argued, is permeated with metaphor, whose use in fact constitutes distinctively human— that is, distinctively abstract— thought. To conceptualise things which cannot be directly perceived— intangibles such as time, life, reason, mind, society or justice— {{we have no choice}} but to set out from more concrete and directly perceptible phenomena such as motion, location, distance, size and so forth. In all cultures across the world, according to Lakoff and Johnson, people resort to such familiar metaphors as ideas are locations, thinking is moving and mind is body. For example, we might express the idea of [...] "arriving at a crucial <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> argument" [...] by proceeding as if literally travelling from one physical location to the next.|$|E

[...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning <b>point</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> macro-economic performance." ...|$|E
