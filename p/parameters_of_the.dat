Cornering, camber stiffnesses and relaxation length of the rear tire make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same <b>parameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.|$|E
