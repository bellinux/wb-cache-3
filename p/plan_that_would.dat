5|$|In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme {{presented}} a new management <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> run from 2006 to 2016. The key goals {{of this plan}} are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity (since the low number of individuals {{can be expected to}} result in inbreeding depression), maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support.|$|E
5|$|The site {{occupied}} by the tower was home to the Palace Hotel, and organised opposition was formed {{to try to save}} that building from demolition to make way for an office tower. The site was subsequently acquired by businessman Alan Bond and the tower was approved and constructed in a <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> retain much of the Palace Hotel. The tower then remained the headquarters of Bond's companies until their collapse. The tower has also been the headquarters of Western Australia's state bank, Bankwest (formerly known as the R Bank), between its completion and 2012.|$|E

5|$|Upon taking office, Johnson {{faced the}} {{question}} {{of what to do with}} the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 the OSI {{transferred}} {{ownership of}} the property to a local conservancy, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust (WVLT). An informal association of businesses, the Joppenbergh Mountain Advisory Group (JMAG), began working with the WVLT to create a land use policy. The WVLT began having monthly meetings with the JMAG, and with town and state departments; its stated goal was to combine Joppenbergh's development with the rehabilitation of the adjacent railroad trestle and subsequent expansion of the rail trail. In late September 2012, the WVLT held a hearing on a proposed land use <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> allow deer hunting on the property beginning in 2013, and would prohibit entry into several caves on the mountain.|$|E

5|$|In June 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union. Unlike {{many of the}} border troops who were caught off guard by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General Mikhail Kirponos, {{believed}} an invasion by Germany was inevitable. However, Kirponos chose to ignore Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed Blitzkrieg tactics like those seen in the campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940. Since the winter of 1939–40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> counter threats from the western Ukraine, which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley {{plan had}} the support of the more extreme segregationists in Virginia as well. The first week of July, the Defenders {{promoted}} a <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> withdraw the legal basis for lawsuits against school districts, permit state takeovers of school districts which integrated, and deny state funds to school districts which integrated. The Defenders opposed any pupil assignment plan as too moderate a response. Accommodating this extremist sentiment, the pupil assignment plan approved at the July 2 meeting was fairly weak. After the meeting, Gray independently asked Mays to draft a stronger pupil assignment proposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} the islands in the {{predicted}} path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats {{in preparation for the}} storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla enacted a <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50mph (80km/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs.|$|E

5|$|As the New Hampshire primary neared, Rockefeller {{began to}} attack Goldwater, {{claiming}} he supported a voluntary social security <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> bankrupt the nation. Goldwater denied the charge. He campaigned in New Hampshire until the primary vote, spending approximately $150,000 {{as opposed to}} $250,000 by Rockefeller. Voters grew wary of Goldwater's stances on social security, Cuba, {{the military and the}} role of the Federal government, and were likewise turned off by Rockefeller's very public divorce. As a result, the electorate sought out other candidates. Surprisingly, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. won the primary with 35.5 percent as a write-in candidate while still serving in Vietnam and without making any public appearances in New Hampshire. Goldwater finished in second with 22.3 percent, followed by Rockefeller with 21.0 percent. Neither won any delegates from the primary. The chairman of the Florida GOP attributed the defeat to a divided campaign, which he also witnessed in his state, where party leaders such as Congressman William C. Cramer disagreed over a delegate slate.|$|E
5|$|Nature’s Plan For Parkways - Recreational Lands was {{published}} in 1932 and proposed a regional <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> place Darby and Cobbs Creeks in an interior network of parks. These streams were chosen {{due to the fact}} that the flowed through some of the most densely populated areas in Southeastern Pennsylvania and it could serve as buffers through urban areas. During the 1930s there were a number of projects undertaken on Darby Creek by the Army Corps of Engineers. The dikes along the southern end of the creek were repaired by a joint force of the Works Progress Administration, the Pennsylvania legislature, and Delaware County. A series of ditches in the Tinicum marshland were constructed by the Corps in 1935 as a means of mosquito control. The dredged material was deposited throughout the marsh over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|On April 28, 2014, {{pedestrian}} {{access to}} the station was partially cut off when the abutting landowner erected a fence on the station's primary access point, forcing riders to walk a short distance along the tracks to a different business lot, {{in an effort to}} stop commuters from parking on his business lots. He removed a section of the fence for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 land sale. Despite intervention by state legislators and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014. In December 2014, the MBTA rejected a <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have created a pedestrian access path and a vehicle dropoff lane, alleging that the landowner had unfairly shifted property lines.|$|E

5|$|Rappaport died in 1994, and in January 1995 {{developer}} P Associates {{announced its}} agreement {{to buy the}} properties from his estate. The developer also disclosed {{plans to build a}} luxury residential tower at the site. The plan called for dismantling part of Furness's additions to the PSFS headquarters, which would serve as the tower's lobby. The York Row houses would have been completely demolished. The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged. P Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a new <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade. The new plan, which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space. The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored. P Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses, back to the roof ridge line.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{after eight}} years of private operation, the Pillsbury Company {{acquired}} the Burger King brand and its parent company Burger King Corporation. At the time of the purchase, the chain had grown to 274 restaurants in the United States. Pillsbury continued to grow the company utilizing the existing franchise system despite its flaws. The power of its independent franchises came to a head in 1973 when Chart House, owner of 350 restaurants and one of its largest franchise groups, attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for $100million (USD) which Pillsbury declined. When Chart House's bid failed, its owners Billy and Jimmy Trotter put forth a second <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> require Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate company. Again Pillsbury declined the proposed divestiture. After the failed attempts to acquire the company, the relationship with Chart House and the Trotters soured; when Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for failing to comply with the right of first refusal clause in their contracts. Burger King won the case, successfully preventing the sale. The two parties did eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio. Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King holdings and refocused on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury $390million (USD) in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.|$|E
