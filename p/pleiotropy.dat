25|$|A {{putative}} {{cause for}} the broad changes seen in domestication syndrome is <b>pleiotropy.</b> <b>Pleiotropy</b> occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Certain physiological changes characterize domestic animals of many species. These changes include extensive white markings (particularly on the head) floppy ears, and curly tails. These arise even when tameness is the trait under selective pressure. The genes involved in tameness are largely unknown, {{so it is not}} known how or to what extent <b>pleiotropy</b> contributes to domestication syndrome. Tameness may be caused by the down regulation of fear and stress responses via reduction of the adrenal glands. Based on this, the <b>pleiotropy</b> hypotheses can be separated into two theories. The Neural Crest Hypothesis relates adrenal gland function to deficits in neural crest cells during development. The Single Genetic Regulatory Network Hypothesis claims that genetic changes in upstream regulators affect downstream systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{breeding}} experiments, Michael R. Rose selected {{fruit flies}} for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic <b>pleiotropy,</b> Rose expected {{that this would}} surely reduce their fertility. His team found {{that they were able}} to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for <b>pleiotropy</b> theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artefact.|$|E
25|$|The NK {{model has}} found use in many fields, {{including}} {{in the study of}} spin glasses, epistasis and <b>pleiotropy</b> in evolutionary biology, and combinatorial optimisation.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the experiment, the populations have evolved to {{specialize}} on the glucose resource on which they grow. This was first described in 2000, when Cooper and Lenski demonstrated that all populations had experienced decay of unused metabolic functions after 20,000 generations, restricting the range of substances on which the bacteria could grow. Their analysis suggested that this decay was due to antagonistic <b>pleiotropy,</b> in which mutations that improved ability to grow on glucose had reduced or eliminated the ability to grow on others substances. A later study by Leiby and Marx that used more advanced techniques showed that much of the decay Cooper and Lenski had identified were experimental artifacts, that loss of unused functions was not as extensive as first thought, and that some unused functions had improved. Moreover, they concluded that the metabolic losses were not due to antagonistic <b>pleiotropy,</b> but the neutral accumulation of mutations in unused portions of the genome, suggesting that adaptation to a simple environment might not necessarily lead to specialization.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} such {{limitations}} Kriete proposed consideration of systems-level properties like robustness to characterize ageing as a robustness tradeoff. According to this concept living systems {{evolve into a}} state of highly optimized tolerance promoting traits beneficial for survival and fitness at the cost of fragilities driving the ageing phenotype. The view is compatible with aspects of the antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> and the disposable soma theory, but offers additional mechanisms rooted in complex systems theory.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difficulty}} with antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> and other theories that suppose that ageing is an adverse {{side effect of}} some beneficial function is that the linkage between adverse and beneficial effects {{would need to be}} rigid {{in the sense that the}} evolution process would not be able to evolve a way to accomplish the benefit without incurring the adverse effect even over a very long time span. Such a rigid relationship has not been experimentally demonstrated and, in general, evolution is able to independently and individually adjust myriad organism characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{regulatory}} {{networks are}} generally {{thought to be}} made up of a few highly connected nodes (hubs) and many poorly connected nodes nested within a hierarchical regulatory regime. Thus gene regulatory networks approximate a hierarchical scale free network topology. This is consistent with the view that most genes have limited <b>pleiotropy</b> and operate within regulatory modules. This structure is thought to evolve due to the preferential attachment of duplicated genes to more highly connected genes. Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{dilemma is}} that {{classical}} evolutionary theory says {{that what is}} maintained in a lineage is that which ensures the viability of an organism and its offspring. Ageing can only cut off an individual's capacity to reproduce. So, according to classical theory, ageing could only evolve as a side effect, or epiphenomenon of selection. The disposable soma theory and antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> theory are examples in which a compensating individual benefit, compatible with classical evolution theory (See neo-Darwinism) is proposed. Nevertheless, there is accumulated evidence that ageing looks like an adaptation in its own right, selected for its own sake.|$|E
25|$|Antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> is a {{prevailing}} theory today, {{but this}} is largely by default, and not because the theory has been well verified. In fact, experimental biologists have looked for the genes that cause ageing, and since about 1990 the technology has been available to find them efficiently. Of the many ageing genes that have been reported, some seem to enhance fertility early in life, or to carry other benefits. But there are other ageing genes for which no such corresponding benefit has been identified. This is not what Williams predicted. This may {{be thought of as}} partial validation of the theory, but logically it cuts to the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.|$|E
500|$|Another {{derivation}} of {{the name}} is the Greek word Πλειόνη (pr. plêionê), meaning [...] "more", [...] "plenty", or [...] "full"a lexeme with many English derivatives like <b>pleiotropy,</b> , pleonasm, pleonexia, [...] and Pliocene. This meaning also coincides with the biblical Kīmāh and the Arabic word for the Pleiades — Al Thurayya. In fact, Pleione may have been numbered amongst the Epimelides (nymphs of meadows and pastures) and presided over the multiplication of the animals, as her name means [...] "to increase in number".|$|E
500|$|The protein {{products}} of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of <b>pleiotropy,</b> being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved {{in the development of the}} embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.|$|E
2500|$|Williams (1957) {{proposed}} his own theory, called antagonistic <b>pleiotropy.</b> <b>Pleiotropy</b> {{means one}} gene that has {{two or more}} effects on the phenotype. In antagonistic <b>pleiotropy,</b> one of these effects is beneficial and another is detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on. If evolution is a race {{to have the most}} offspring the fastest, then enhanced early fertility could be selected even if it came with a price tag that included decline and death later on. Because ageing was a side effect of necessary functions, Williams considered any alteration of the ageing process to be [...] "impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who believe}} in the idea that ageing is an {{unavoidable}} side effect of some necessary function (antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> or disposable soma theories) logically tend to believe that attempts to delay ageing would result in unacceptable side effects to the necessary functions. Altering ageing is therefore [...] "impossible", and study of ageing mechanisms is of only academic interest.|$|E
2500|$|Genetic {{conditions}} which affect {{more than one}} physical trait—in the case of lethal white syndrome, both pigment cells and enteric nerve cells—are termed pleiotropic. The unusual instance of <b>pleiotropy</b> in LWS foals suggested early on that the syndrome was related to an important section of embryonic tissue called the neural crest. As the name suggests, the stem cells of the neural crest are precursors to nerve cells. [...] Another cell type that descends from neural crest cells are melanocytes, pigment-producing cells found in hair follicles and skin. The migration of nerve- and melanocyte-precursors {{from the top of}} the embryo to their eventual destinations is carefully controlled by regulatory genes.|$|E
2500|$|One is apoptosis, or {{programmed}} cell death. Apoptosis {{is responsible}} for killing infected cells, cancerous cells, and cells that are simply {{in the wrong place}} during development. There are clear benefits to apoptosis, so the existence of apoptosis isn't a problem for evolutionary theory. The problem is that apoptosis seems to ramp up late in life and kill healthy cells, causing weakness and degeneration [...] And, paradoxically, apoptosis has been observed as a kind of 'altruistic suicide' in colonies of yeast under stress. This seems to be a direct hint that senescence arose because it conferred a direct evolutionary advantage, rather than some kind of side effect of genes that have other evolutionary advantages (<b>pleiotropy).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Genomics is an {{interdisciplinary}} {{field of science}} {{within the field of}} molecular biology. A genome is a complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism, and as such, focuses on the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes. Genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research to understand even the most currently complex biological systems such as the brain. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics uses high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble, and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. [...] The field also includes studies of intragenomic (within the genome) phenomena such as heterosis (hybrid vigour), epistasis (effect of one gene on another), <b>pleiotropy</b> (one gene affecting more than one trait) and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in systems biology which facilitates the understanding of complex biological systems such as the brain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pleiotropy</b> {{can arise}} from several {{distinct}} but potentially overlapping mechanisms, such as molecular gene <b>pleiotropy,</b> developmental <b>pleiotropy,</b> and selectional <b>pleiotropy.</b> Molecular gene <b>pleiotropy</b> {{occurs when the}} gene product interacts with multiple other proteins or catalyzes multiple reactions. Developmental <b>pleiotropy</b> occurs when mutations have multiple effects on the resulting phenotype. Selectional <b>pleiotropy</b> occurs when the resulting phenotype has multiple effects on fitness (perhaps depending on age, gender, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|After Plate's definition, Hans Gruneberg was {{the first}} to study the {{mechanisms}} of <b>pleiotropy.</b> In 1938, Gruneberg published an article dividing <b>pleiotropy</b> into two distinct types: [...] "genuine" [...] and [...] "spurious" [...] <b>pleiotropy.</b> [...] "Genuine" [...] <b>pleiotropy</b> is when two distinct primary products arise from one locus. [...] "Spurious" [...] <b>pleiotropy,</b> on the other hand, is either when one primary product is utilized in different ways or when one primary product initiates a cascade of events with different phenotypic consequences. Gruneberg came to these distinctions after experimenting on rats with skeletal mutations. He recognized that [...] "spurious" [...] <b>pleiotropy</b> was present in the mutation, while [...] "genuine" [...] <b>pleiotropy</b> was not, thus partially invalidating his own original theory. Through subsequent research, it has been established that Gruneberg's definition of [...] "spurious" [...] <b>pleiotropy</b> is what we identify simply as [...] "pleiotropy".|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1950s, Richard Goldschmidt and Ernst Hadorn, through {{separate}} individual research, {{reinforced the}} faultiness of [...] "genuine" [...] <b>pleiotropy.</b> A few years later, Hadorn partitioned <b>pleiotropy</b> into a [...] "mosaic" [...] model (which states that one locus directly affects two phenotypic traits) and a [...] "relational" [...] model (which {{is analogous to}} [...] "spurious" [...] <b>pleiotropy).</b> These terms {{are no longer in}} use but have contributed to the current understanding of <b>pleiotropy.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pleiotropy</b> {{can have}} an effect on the {{evolutionary}} rate of genes and allele frequencies. Traditionally, models of <b>pleiotropy</b> have predicted that evolutionary rate of genes is related negatively with <b>pleiotropy</b> - as the number of traits of an organism increases, the evolutionary rates of genes in the organism's population decrease. However, this relationship has not been clearly found in empirical studies.|$|E
50|$|Antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> {{has several}} {{negative}} consequences. It results in delayed adaptation, an altered path of evolution, and reduced adaptation of other traits. In addition, the overall benefit of alleles is cut down significantly (by about half) by <b>pleiotropy.</b> Still, antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> has some evolutionary benefits. In fact, {{the conservation of}} genes {{is directly related to}} the pleiotropic character of an organism. This implies that genes that control for multiple traits, even if the traits have different implications for the organism's fitness, have more staying power in an evolutionary context.|$|E
5000|$|Antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> is {{a theory}} {{proposed}} as an alternative by George C. Williams, a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic <b>pleiotropy,</b> genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} {{contributes to}} studying both expressivity, <b>pleiotropy</b> and sporadic mutations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1941, American geneticists George Beadle and Edward Tatum further invalidated Gruneberg's {{definition}} of [...] "genuine" [...] <b>pleiotropy,</b> advocating instead for the [...] "one gene-one enzyme" [...] hypothesis which was originally introduced by French biologist Lucien Cuénot in 1903. This hypothesis shifted future research regarding <b>pleiotropy</b> towards how a single gene can produce various phenotypes.|$|E

50|$|The {{antagonistic}} <b>pleiotropy</b> {{hypothesis was}} first proposed by George C.

Antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> is when one gene controls {{for more than one}} trait where {{at least one of these}} traits is beneficial to the organism's fitness and at least one is detrimental to the organism's fitness. The theme of G.C. William's idea about antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> was that if a gene caused both increased reproduction in early life and aging in later life, then senescence would be adaptive in evolution. For example, one study suggests that since follicular depletion in human females causes both more regular cycles in early life and loss of fertility later in life through menopause, it can be selected for by having its early benefits outweigh its late costs.|$|E

50|$|One {{example for}} {{costs related to}} gene <b>pleiotropy</b> was found for coevolving Escherichia coli and bacteriophages.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} <b>pleiotropy</b> is phenylketonuria, {{which is an}} {{inherited}} disorder that affects the level of phenylalanine in the body. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that {{can be obtained from}} food. Phenylketonuria causes this amino acid to increase in amount in the body, which can be very dangerous. The human disease is caused by a defect in a single gene on chromosome 12 that affects multiple systems, such as the nervous and integumentary system. Other examples of <b>pleiotropy</b> are albinism, sickle cell anemia, and certain forms of autism and schizophrenia. <b>Pleiotropy</b> not only affects humans, but also animals, such as chickens and laboratory house mice, where the laboratory house mice have found to exhibit the [...] "mini-muscle" [...] allele.|$|E

50|$|Cytokine {{redundancy}} {{is associated}} with the term cytokine <b>pleiotropy,</b> which refers to the ability of cytokines to exert multiple actions.|$|E
50|$|Sickle cell anemia, Beta-thalassemia, and cystic {{fibrosis}} {{are some other}} examples of the role antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> may play in genetic disorders.|$|E
50|$|Pleiotropic gene {{action can}} limit {{the rate of}} multivariate {{evolution}} when natural selection, sexual selection or artificial selection on one trait favors one specific version of the gene (allele), while selection on other traits favors a different allele, which shows how evolution is negatively related with <b>pleiotropy</b> in models. Although some of the evolution in genes can be beneficial, some gene evolution is harmful to an organism. Genetic correlations and responses to selection most often exemplify <b>pleiotropy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, {{the process}} of {{antagonistic}} <b>pleiotropy</b> may result in an altered evolutionary path with delayed adaptation, in addition to effectively cutting the overall benefit of any alleles by roughly half. However, antagonistic <b>pleiotropy</b> also lends a greater amount of evolutionary [...] "staying power" [...] to genes controlling beneficial traits, since an organism with a mutation to those genes would have a decreased chance of successfully reproducing, as multiple traits would be affected, potentially for the worse.|$|E
