By involving the general public and using off-the-shelf smartphones as noise sensors, we seek to provide a low cost solution for citizens to measure their personal exposure to noise in their everyday environment and participate in the creation of collective noise maps by sharing their geo-localized and annotated measurements with the community. We believe our work represents an interesting example of the novel mobile crowdsourcing applications which are enabled by ubiquitous computing systems. Furthermore we believe the NoiseTube system, and the currently ongoing validation experiments, provide an illustrative context for some of the open challenges faced by creators of ubiquitous crowdsourcing applications and services in general. We will also take the opportunity to present the insights we gained into some of the challenges.

40|$|Hitherto {{the task}} of valuing {{differences}} in environmental quality arising from air <b>pollution</b> <b>and</b> noise <b>nuisance</b> {{has been carried out}} mainly by using the hedonic price technique. This paper proposes a different approach to deriving information on individual preferences for local environmental quality. It analyses data drawn from the German socio economic panel in an attempt to explain differences in self-reported levels of well-being in terms of environmental quality. Mindful of existing research a large number of other explanatory variables are included to control for socio-demographic differences, economic circumstances as well as neighbourhood characteristics. Differences in local air quality and noise levels are measured by how much an individual feels affected by air pollution or noise exposure in their residential area. The evidence suggests that even when controlling for a range of other factors higher local air <b>pollution</b> <b>and</b> noise levels significantly diminish subjective well-being. But interestingly differences in perceived air <b>and</b> noise <b>pollution</b> are not capitalised into differences in house prices. air pollution, environmental quality, Germany, life-satisfaction, noise exposure, well-being...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} an analytical procedure developed {{in order to}} monitor specific volatile organic compounds (VOC) causing olfactive nuisances in the environment of a landfill site. 1 -Methyl- 4 -iso-propenyl- 1 -cycolohexene (limonene) and 1 -methyl- 4 -iso-propyl-benzene (p-cymene) detected by GC-MS in the landfill gas emissions were considered as tracers of the malodour. An on-line analytical system including a gas chromatograph coupled with a photoionisation detector was installed 'on-site' to detect these markers at μg/m 3 level in the atmosphere after pumping up the ambient air at close intervals. Quantitative results of the semi-continuous monitoring were strongly correlated with olfactive nuisances reported {{in the vicinity of}} the source. The chemical characterisation of odorous organic tracers and their 'on-site' monitoring was shown to be a useful technique to detect malfunctions in the bio-gas collecting facilities and to prevent air <b>pollution</b> <b>and</b> olfactive <b>nuisances</b> in the environment.

30|$|The {{internalization}} of externalities is {{a complex}} issue that requires reasonable road pricing policies and effectively organized mechanisms (i.e. police enforcement) in order to mitigate tax evasion (for road charging or LEZ charges) or fraud. Based {{on the results of}} our analysis, we could draw a conclusion that within urban areas it is difficult to achieve the foreseen level of revenues because of the multidimensional nature of the drivers that generate externalities. Congestion, air <b>pollution</b> <b>and</b> noise <b>nuisance</b> depend on the time of day, any unexpected incidents taking place in road network, policy implementation, etc. However, surveillance and enforcement could be more efficiently promoted. With regards to the regional transport, although the level of traffic could be more effectively anticipated, surveillance is more difficult due to the dispersion of traffic and the expansion of the road network. The enforcement actions should be accompanied with awareness campaigns in order to properly disseminate the usefulness of those measures to drivers. Finally, the road pricing policies and the mechanisms towards the collection of taxes/charges should be fair and transparent so as to achieve the highest possible social uptake.|$|R
40|$|The Dutch {{approach}} to risk assessment {{is defined in}} the National Plan for Environmental Protection Policy (NMP) of 1988. The goal is {{the present and future}} protection of humans, animals, plants, the ecosystem, and property through measures designed to provide for a sustainable development. The safety goals are defined in "Premises for Risk Management," an annex to the NMP, in 1989. Safety goals are determined with quantitative values. Maximum permitted risks are differentiated from negligible risks. Risks that fall between these two values must be reduced to a negligible level within one generation (ALARA-principle). The safety thresholds for existing and new hazards are also differentiated. Hazards include stationary installations, transport systems (road, rail, water, and air transport), hazardous substances (chemical, radioactive), and genetically-altered organisms. The two most important criteria for risk assessment are the individual probability of death and the probability of death for groups. Although quantitative safety goals have been defined for other criteria such as ecosystems, noise <b>pollution,</b> <b>and</b> odor <b>nuisance,</b> they have little effect in practice. Criteria which are deliberately left out include injured persons, financial-economic damages, damages to plants by radioactivity, and different reductions in activities...|$|R

Baker, who advised residents to stay put and see what happened. The Air Pollution consultant, Mr A. Keil, informed them that, though there were no immediate plans to use the land for industry, it was a definite possibility - <b>and</b> <b>pollution</b> problems were [...] "unavoidable", and would only get worse. Residents responded that they didn't mind moving, so long as the compensation was fair, and enabled them to purchase a property of at least equal value - rather than leaving them in debt. Finally, a committee was formed to look into the issues.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate what the future offers with respect to toll financing of infrastructure projects, based on Norwegian experiences. Specifically, we; (1) address the success of the Norwegian toll systems by looking at the organisational and the decision making framework; (2) examine users attitudes towards the tolls and factors determining them; (3) finally, in the light of the changing political environment and reforms being made in others areas of transport policy, we address the issue of how toll financing of road infrastructure can be designed for future projects. The tentative results of this paper may be summarised as follows: i. In urban areas where air <b>pollution</b> <b>and</b> noise <b>nuisance</b> from road traffic are a problem, the cordon tolls can easily be adopted to the principle of congestion. Such a move will generate benefits greater than those attainable with the current cordon tolls. ii. In the light of increasingly scarce government funding, the share of toll financed non-urban road infrastructure projects will increase. A possible implication is that, for a continued success, a new model integrating the private sector needs to be developed. One such a model is the increased Private Public Partnership model (PPP). iii. In order to achieve more successful toll systems, users should be involved and informed at earlier stages in the planning process. This implies that considerable marketing efforts of tolls and/or congestion pricing prior to their implementation, is necessary for the significant majority of the public to accept them as a tolerable transport financing policy. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the Dutch transport scenarios for the OECD project on Environmental Sustainable Transport (EST). The EST project contains a business-as-usual scenario (BAU) and three EST scenarios which attain the EST criteria (i. e. {{a reduction of}} CO 2 by 80 %, NOx by 90 %, VOC by 90 %, PM 10 by 90 %) : (i) a "high-technology" scenario containing only technological changes, (ii) a "mobility-management" scenario containing only mobility changes, (iii) a combination scenario containing a combination of technological and mobility changes. Furthermore, the report describes possible instrument packages {{for the implementation of}} EST and the social and economic impacts of EST. The main conclusions are: (1) only if a high increase in technological developments and/or very stringent behaviour adaptations and changes in spatial and economic structures at the national and international level are assumed, the EST criteria can be met, (2) if EST is to be realised, measures will have to be taken in the short term and innovative policy instruments must be developed and implemented. The implementation of the tradeable CO 2 emission permit system for passenger and freight transport is crucial for the attainment of EST, (3) a timely implementation of the policy instruments for the attainment of EST means that the current policy life cycle must radically change, (4) the level of material wealth (expressed in GDP) and employment will be somewhat slower in EST compared to BAU, but several social factors will improve. Firstly, differences between societal groups in (a) travel behaviour, (b) the level of accessibility of economic and social opportunities and (c) (perceived) environmental quality will decrease.
