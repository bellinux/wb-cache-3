40|$|March 2004. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 16) Projector low beams {{are subject}} to color aberrations near the vertical cutoff caused by dispersion of light when passing through the lens. Color aberrations are especially of concern with high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps, because these color changes likely contribute to the discomfort-glare complaints for HIDs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the extent and magnitude of color aberrations in HID and tungsten-halogen projector low beams. Specifically, we made colorimetric measurements near the cutoffs of 8 projector HIDs and 4 projector tungsten-halogens. For experimental control, we also evaluated 9 nonprojector HIDs and 5 nonprojector tungsten-halogens. Major color changes were present for 38 % of the HID <b>projector</b> <b>lamps,</b> 50 % of the tungstenhalogen <b>projector</b> <b>lamps,</b> and (as expected) for 0 % of the HID or tungsten-halogen nonprojector lamps. Transformation of the chromaticity data into a perceptually uniform color space indicated that the color changes caused by aberrations near the cutoff were often considerably greater than the typical color differences between tungsten-halogen and HID sources. This suggests that some of the recent concern about headlamp color and glare on the part of the driving public may be caused by color aberrations—in either tungsten-halogen or HID lamps—rather than by HID lamps themselves. To minimize discomfort glare (especially for HIDs), it is important to avoid color aberrations in the regions of the beam pattern with substantial luminous intensity levels that may be directed toward oncoming drivers...|$|R
50|$|However, because {{projected}} {{images are}} almost always viewed at some distance, lack of very fine focus and slight unevenness of illumination is often acceptable. Projector lenses {{have to be very}} tolerant of prolonged high temperatures from the <b>projector</b> <b>lamp</b> and frequently have a focal length much longer than the taking lens. This allows the lens to be positioned at a greater distance from the illuminated film and allows an acceptable sized image with the projector some distance from the screen. It also permits the lens to be mounted in a relatively coarsely threaded focusing mount so that the projectionist can quickly correct any focusing errors.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, one of {{the company}} engineers, Jim Bornhorst, while looking at {{alternative}} methods of colouring light, realised that dichroic filters display a strange side effect: when you twist them, the frequency of light on which the filter operates, shifts—causing it to apparently change colour. That might have been the extent of their advancement if not for a barbecue lunch in the fall of 1980. At that gathering, the idea of adding two extra motors to the fixture to actually make the light move was conceived. This [...] "eureka" [...] moment facilitated an all-out building effort for a fully automated lighting system. This idea, coupled with the recent appearance on the market of the General Electric Marc 350 <b>projector</b> <b>lamp</b> resulted in a prototype in December 1980, that had taken twelve weeks to build.|$|E
5000|$|Although Eastman Kodak {{had first}} {{introduced}} acetate-based film, {{it was far}} too brittle and prone to shrinkage, so the dangerously flammable nitrate-based cellulose films were generally used for motion picture camera and print films. In 1949 Kodak began replacing all nitrocellulose (nitrate-based) films with the safer, more robust cellulose triacetate-based [...] "Safety" [...] films. In 1950 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Kodak with a Scientific and Technical Academy Award (Oscar) for the safer triacetate stock. By 1952, all camera and projector films were triacetate-based. Most if not all film prints today are made from synthetic polyester safety base (which started replacing Triacetate film for prints in the early 1990s). The downside of polyester film {{is that it is}} extremely strong, and, in case of a fault, will stretch and not break-potentially causing damage to the projector and ruining a fairly large stretch of film: 2-3 ft or ~2 seconds. Also, polyester film will melt if exposed to the <b>projector</b> <b>lamp</b> for too long. Original camera negative is still made on a triacetate base, and some intermediate films (certainly including internegatives or [...] "dupe" [...] negatives, but not necessarily including interpositives or [...] "master" [...] positives) are also made on a triacetate base as such films must be spliced during the [...] "negative assembly" [...] process, and the extant negative assembly process is solvent-based. Polyester films are not compatible with solvent-based assembly processes.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the shows}} {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic had much in common they {{differed}} in two important ways. First, the American shows tended to be larger, with seven operators and over thirty projectors not being exceptional. In contrast, the shows in England seldom had more than three operators and ten or so projectors. Second, American shows were generally built around the overhead projector with the liquids in large clock cover glasses. Shows in England and Europe, in contrast, used modified 2" [...] sq. slide projectors which had their Dichroic heat filters (one or both) removed and employed two layers of slide cover glasses with two liquids (oil and water based, in the early days) between each layer. Alternatively different coloured water based dyes were used in each layer, which slowly boiled producing pulsing vapour bubbles when exposed to the heat of the <b>projector</b> <b>lamp</b> with the heat filters removed. Consequently randomly pulsing and moving blobs of colour were projected on the screen creating the light show. Before the projected layers totally dried out a new slide would be switched in the projector slide holder, meanwhile the old glass would be removed, cleaned and refurbished with new dyes and the projection process would continue. The surface tension of the liquids largely retained the mixtures between the glass slides, but the process was nevertheless very messy indeed and operators had their hands almost permanently stained by the dyes. A popular choice of colored liquids for light shows was Flo-Master ink, a product developed for use in permanent marker pens. While this ink was very vivid it also had the problem of staining the operator's hands very deeply.|$|E
50|$|As the {{quantity}} of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved. A number of film gauges were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumiere reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it 'Etiquette Violette' (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to Pathé in 1907 and retired to the US. Pathe began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. 35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the popularity of Edison's and Lumière's cameras. Consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began {{to be made by}} Bell and Howell. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell's machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison's organization of the Motion Picture Patents Trust agreed to what would become the standard: 35 mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 aspect ratio.Agfa began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the UFA film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa's orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base, which is highly flammable. Nitrate film fires were difficult to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the <b>projector</b> <b>lamp</b> made ignition most likely. Amateur filmmaking (home movies) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant 'safety base' for home projection. In 1909, tests showed cellulose diacetate to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22 mm widths for Edison's work on the Home Kinetoscope, which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a non-inflammable 35 mm film stock in 1909. The plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock. More amateur formats began to use acetate based film, and several, including Kodak's own 16 mm format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offerings; the improvements were in granularity and sharpness.|$|E

30|$|In this research, it {{is aimed}} to develop a pulsed-laser Raman {{scattering}} method as a remote and standard system for estimation of the junction temperature of LEDs including white-LED during the operation. Using a nanosecond pulsed-laser as an incident light source, sufficient laser power density for detection of weak Raman signal can be achieved even at relatively large irradiation area of a LED package placed far from the laser injection and scattering light detection optics, instead of a CW laser being focused to very small area. A pulsed-laser Raman scattering technique, which is equipped with ns-order pulsed-laser and long focusing lens, has potentials of remote measurement and simultaneous multipoint measurement, which lead to 2 D mapping of {{the temperature of the}} LED package in the future. Also, as influence of strong disturbance light such as LED emission itself can be eliminated by a combination with a highly time-resolved detection system, for example a gated-ICCD camera, so the measurement for LED <b>projector</b> <b>lamp,</b> for example, would be enabled. Therefore, this technique is considered {{to be one of the}} prospective candidates of temperature estimation method of white LEDs for illumination application.|$|E

Center and Right: two {{photographs of the}} same projected image taken at different exposures.

We demonstrate {{for the first time}} a proof of concept projector with a secondary array of individually controllable, analog micromirrors added to improve the contrast and peak brightness of conventional projectors. The micromirrors reallocate the light of the <b>projector</b> <b>lamp</b> from the dark parts towards the light parts of the image, before it reaches the primary image modulator. Each element of the analog micromirror array can be tipped/tilted to divert portions of the light from the lamp in two dimensions. By directing these mirrors on an image-dependent basis, we can increase both the peak intensity of the projected image as well as its contrast. In this paper, we describe and analyze the optical design for projectors using this light reallocation approach. We also discuss software algorithms to compute the best light reallocation pattern for a given input image, using the constraints of real hardware. We perform extensive simulations of this process to evaluate image quality and performance characteristics of this process. Finally, we present a first proof-of-concept implementation of this approach using a prototype analog micromirror device. CR Categories...|$|E
50|$|In early 1917, the National Sylvan Theater {{was built}} to the {{southeast}} of the Washington Monument, {{at the foot of}} the hillside. The filling material used to construct the stage, which is 5 ft above grade, 80 ft wide, and 30 ft deep, combined with two wings, each 30 sq ft, was brought to the site at no cost to the government. The stage was constructed with three flights of flag steps, which give access to the wings from the lower ground level in the rear. A special electric cable was laid to provide current for a series of larger <b>projector</b> <b>lamps,</b> which when placed on platforms were meant to furnish light for the performances.

50|$|Three-D {{systems for}} movies using {{polarized}} light cause a significant (about 75%) loss of screen brightness {{due to the}} inherent filter absorption. Although the silver screen used in RealD Cinema is brighter than the standard white screen used for 2D projection, the ZScreen polarization filter {{in front of the}} projector blocks half of the projected light, then half of the light reflected by the silver screen is filtered away by the polarized glasses. This results in less than 25% of the projected light reaching the eyes of the viewer. Conversely, in a standard 2D system, the only significant cause of light loss is absorption by the white screen. RealD estimates the viewer sees about 35% of the light when viewing RealD 3D when compared to a similarly projected 2D image on a standard white screen. The overall effect is that of wearing a pair of slightly darkened glasses in a standard movie theater, which could be compensated for by using <b>projector</b> <b>lamps</b> that are about three times brighter if a 100% compensation is intended.|$|R
50|$|TI's {{technology}} {{is based on}} the use of digital micromirror devices (DMDs). These devices are manufactured from silicon using similar technology to that of computer memory chips. The surface of these devices is covered by {{a very large number of}} microscopic mirrors, one for each pixel, so a 2K device has about 2.2 million mirrors and a 4K device about 8.8 million. Each mirror vibrates several thousand times a second between two positions: In one, light from the <b>projector's</b> <b>lamp</b> is reflected towards the screen, in the other away from it. The proportion of the time the mirror is in each position varies according to the required brightness of each pixel. Three DMD devices are used, one for each of the primary colors. Light from the lamp, usually a Xenon similar to those used in film projectors with a power between 1 kW and 7 kW, is split by colored filters into red, green and blue beams which are directed at the appropriate DMD. The 'forward' reflected beam from the three DMMDs is then re-combined and focused by the lens onto the cinema screen.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Transforming the Poetic Experience of Space Through Light investigates {{theoretical}} and practical artistic methods of manipulating senses through which the space is experienced cognitively and emotionally. The focus is on innovative use of experimental lighting that engages perception, emotion, memory, and imagination. Theoretical research focuses on historical and contemporary references that demonstrate transformation of spatial experience by means of manipulating light. Studying {{theoretical and}} practical examples leads towards discovering, interpreting, and developing a novel body of knowledge for enhancing the multisensory spatial experience that provides access to transforming the perception of space in the purpose of art. Practice based research investigates both traditional and progressive principles of spatial design, fabrication, lighting design, audiovisual systems, and algorithmic composition. The interest is in exploiting technological advancements in lighting that can fuse perception of senses {{and add to the}} phenomenological experience of the artistic intentions. The core of the artistic research is the sublime that is inherently unknowable by reason, but accessible in experience that can be created in art. A collected {{theoretical and practical}} body of knowledge on Transforming the Poetic Experience of Space Through Light is summed up and reflected in the light art installation Horizon is an Imaginary Line. The piece utilizes beams of light emitted from projectors positioned around a darkened space that is filled with haze and fog. Homogeneous clouds suspended in the air make light beams visible and appear perceptible by touch. These palpable light beams travel from the <b>projector</b> <b>lamp</b> across the space and form dynamic light spaces that change based on video that is projected into the state of the haze. The videos are designed to sculpt the light while emulating the vast scale of the universe and sublimity of nature. The kinetic light sculptures in tandem with the electroacoustic compositions are designed to transform the poetic experience of space. The premise for this piece is an expansion of the lighting apparatus into immersive perceptual hyperspace.
