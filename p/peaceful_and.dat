5|$|A {{capacity}} for aggressive behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize that even between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the Turin canon, the {{duration}} of Amenemhat's reign is uncertain. It was given as eight years under the name Ammenemes in Manetho's Aegyptiaca. In any case, Amenemhat's rule {{seems to have been}} <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> uneventful. Amenemhat IV is well attested by contemporary artefacts, including a number of scarab- and cylinder-seals.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with the Jakarta Globe {{after the release of}} his controversial film ?, Bramantyo said that he had intended Sang Pencerah to use Dahlan's life to examine different aspects of Islam. He meant for the film to show Islam as being a <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> truthful religion. Pramono, writing for Tempo, notes that the film presents a different side of Dahlan, who is usually portrayed as an old, bearded man who, in his opinion, seems neither modernist nor progressive.|$|E
5|$|Student {{activism}} became {{common in}} the 1960s, reflecting the various social and political events of the time period. Vietnam War protests were common in downtown Bowling Green and on campus. In 1969, a Black Student Union formed to encourage unity, scholarship, leadership, culture and political awareness of African Americans students. The majority of student activism at BGSU was <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> Bowling Green was the only public college or university in Ohio to remain open {{in the spring of}} 1970, following the Kent State shootings during anti-war protests.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Civic District Master Plan public {{exhibition}} was held from 22–26 February by the URA. An important revision was the mentioning of the one-way Fort Canning Tunnel, entering the hill at the existing National Library and emerging at Penang Road {{to be built}} by the year 2000. The URA explained that the 380m long tunnel would help smoothen the major traffic intersection in front of Cathay Building and direct heavy traffic away from the Marina to Orchard areas, thus giving the museum precinct a <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> quiet ambience.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Switzerland under Roman rule was, from the Augustan period up until 260AD, {{a time of}} {{exceptional}} peace and prosperity.

The Romans urbanized the territory with numerous settlements and built a network of high-quality Roman roads connecting them, allowing for the integration of Helvetia into the imperial economy.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift {{over time}} in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more {{cautious}} foreign policy. He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard line against Communism, but moderated over time. However Friedman did state in a 1995 interview {{that he is an}} anti-interventionist. He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War. In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the USA's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> independent country.|$|E

5|$|In mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines for {{yet another}} {{prisoner}} exchange (which eventually would take place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent an embassy under John Mystikos in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> undisputed, due {{to the influence of}} the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February, {{thousands}} of Bahrainis participated in 55 marches in 25 locations throughout Bahrain. Protests were <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> protesters demanded deep reforms. The earliest demonstration started at 5:30a.m. in Nuwaidrat, the last just minutes before midnight {{in the vicinity}} of Salmaniya hospital heading to the Pearl Roundabout. The largest was in Sitra island. Security forces responded to protests by firing tear gas, rubber bullets, stun grenades and birdshot. More than 30 protesters were injured and one was killed by birdshot. The Bahraini Ministry of Interior said a number of security forces were injured after groups of protesters attacked them.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1945, the Nazi {{governor}} (Reichskommissar) of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, {{offered to}} open up Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease {{the suffering of the}} civilian population. Smith and Strong, representing SHAEF, along with Major General Ivan Susloparov representing the Soviet Union, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld representing the Dutch government, and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand from 21st Army Group, met with Seyss-Inquart in the Dutch village of Achterveld on 30 April. After threatening Seyss-Inquart with prosecution for war crimes, Smith successfully negotiated for the provision of food to the suffering Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country, and he opened discussions for the <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> complete German capitulation in the Netherlands, to the First Canadian Army, that did follow on the 5th of May.|$|E

5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> that he had suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because {{the contents of the}} reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{associated}} many gods {{who took}} felid form with the sun, and many lioness deities, like Sekhmet, Menhit, and Tefnut, were equated with the Eye. Bastet was depicted {{as both a}} domestic cat and a lioness, and with these two forms she could represent both the <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> violent aspects of the Eye. Yet another goddess of the solar Eye was Mut, the consort of the god Amun, who was associated with Ra. Mut was first called the Eye of Ra in the late New Kingdom, and the aspects of her character that {{were related to the}} Eye grew increasingly prominent over time. Mut, too, could appear in both leonine and cat form.|$|E
5|$|The main {{villages that}} {{supported}} Shahin's government were Rayfoun, Ajaltoun, Ashqout, Qleiat and Mazraat Kfardebian. The representatives of these villages {{were able to}} gain the solidarity of other villages by persuading their inhabitants through both <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> coercive means that as Christians they were all a part of single community with a united purpose. The leaders of some villages, {{such as those of}} Ghosta, Aramoun, Ghazir and Ftuh opposed Shahin and his revolt. Shahin's popularity among the Christian peasants of Mount Lebanon grew as he came to be viewed as their savior from both the Druze nobles and the traditional Maronite elites. This reputation was further solidified after Shahin's men backed Christian residents in a clash with Druze residents in the mixed village of Beit Meri in Matn in August 1859.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Relapse Records re-released Horsecore <b>and</b> <b>Peaceful</b> Death <b>and</b> Pretty Flowers; all of {{the tracks}} from Death Rides a Dead Horse were bonus tracks for Horsecore while <b>Peaceful</b> Death <b>and</b> Pretty Flowers was {{accompanied}} with a track from Feed Me and tracks from their 1990 demo. Additionally, there were hidden tracks on both of the reissued CD's. On Horsecore, the hidden track was the slowed down version of French Fry immediately followed by the real-time version of French Fry. French Fry appeared on the original CD issue as track eight while apparently not on the original vinyl. On <b>Peaceful</b> Death <b>and</b> Pretty Flowers, the unnamed bonus hidden track was a collection of slowed down, spoken voices from the song Peaceful Death.|$|R

5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike {{anywhere else in the}} archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the babirusa (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} day, the Seimas adopted a four-{{paragraph}} resolution. The first paragraph declared that the Tsarist government was Lithuania's most dangerous enemy. The second paragraph demanded autonomy; the third outlined the means towards this goal that were deemed acceptable. The resistance was to be <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> passive. The fourth and final paragraph demanded that children be taught in their native language by teachers chosen by the people. The Seimas, unlike the 1917 Vilnius Conference, did not attempt to elect an institution that could carry out these resolutions and act as a Lithuanian government. After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands. Because the attachment was not fully discussed, Social Democrats did not consider it officially adopted.|$|E
5|$|During the First Indochina War, Thảo was a {{communist}} {{officer in the}} Vietminh and helped oversee various operations in the Mekong Delta in the far south, at one point commanding his future enemy Nguyễn Khánh, who briefly served the communist cause. After the French withdrawal and the partition of Vietnam, Thảo stayed {{in the south and}} made a show of renouncing communism. He became part of the military establishment in the anti-communist southern regime and quickly rose through the ranks. Nominally Catholic, Thảo befriended Diệm's elder brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục—the devoutly Roman Catholic Ngô family strongly favored co-religionists and had great trust in Thảo, unaware that he was still loyal to the communists. He went on to serve as the chief of Bến Tre Province, and gained fame after the area—traditionally {{a communist}} stronghold—suddenly became <b>peaceful</b> <b>and</b> prosperous. Vietnamese and US officials, as well as journalists hostile to or supportive of Saigon, misinterpreted this as a testament to Thảo's great ability, and he was promoted to a more powerful position where he could further his sabotage. Thảo and the communists in the local area had simply stopped fighting, so that the communists could quietly recuperate, while Thảo would appear to be very skillful and be given a more important job where he could do more damage.|$|E
