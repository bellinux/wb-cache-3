40|$|Many {{kinds of}} {{recently}} developed materials are {{very hard and}} brittle, {{and it is very}} difficult and expensive to process them. Thus, it is necessary to develop an easier and more economical method to process these materials. As an example, <b>punching</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass was studied. Because <b>punching</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass by ordinary methods is impossible, we present a method for <b>punching</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass under static high pressure. This research confirmed {{that it is possible to}} <b>punch</b> <b>holes</b> in sheet glass, and clarified the conditions needed to obtain good holes without defects...|$|R

40|$|A large {{experimental}} study was undertaken {{to determine the}} effect of hole making upon the strength, ductility, and fatigue performance of structural steel plates and connections. The variables included steel strength, plate thickness, <b>hole</b> size, <b>punch</b> to die clearance, galvanizing, temperature, and edge distance. Approximately 300 tension and fatigue tests were performed. The study agreed with the results of previous research that plates with <b>punched</b> <b>holes</b> have lower strength and ductility than ones with drilled holes. The fatigue performance of plates with <b>punched</b> <b>holes</b> was also less than ones with drilled holes. Galvanizing further reduced the fatigue strength of plates with <b>punched</b> <b>holes.</b> The effect upon hole making upon the fatigue strength and to some extent the tensile strength reduced when fully pretensioned bolts were used. Empty holes had a lower fatigue strength then holes used in a bolted connection. The practice of increasing the hole diameter by 1 / 16 in. when calculating the net section of a tension member did not account for the reduction in strength when the <b>hole</b> was <b>punched.</b> It is recommended that this increase in hole be eliminated and the tension strength of members with <b>punched</b> <b>holes</b> b...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrent fatigue codes only {{consider}} the fatigue performance of drilled and <b>punched</b> <b>holes,</b> limiting {{the use of}} thermal cutting processes to produce bolt holes. This paper studies the fatigue performance of structural steel S 460 M plates containing thermally cut bolt holes. The research covers three thermal cutting methods: the traditional one (oxy-fuel cutting) and two more modern processes (plasma and laser cutting). Specimen geometry is defined by a rectangular cross section with a cut hole in the middle. All the specimens were conducted to failure by applying fatigue cycles, the stress ratio (R) being 0. 1. The corresponding S-N curve and fatigue limit were obtained for each cutting method. Fatigue results have been compared with previous researches on fatigue performance of drilled and <b>punched</b> <b>holes,</b> and with the predictions provided by current fatigue standards, analyzing the possibility to extrapolate their S-N curves, focused on drilled and <b>punched</b> <b>holes,</b> to thermally cut holes...|$|R

The signatures are then sewn and glued together at the spine to form a text block. In contrast to oversewing, through-the-fold books have wide margins and can open completely flat. Many varieties of sewing stitches exist, from basic links to the often used Kettle Stitch. While Western books are generally sewn through <b>punched</b> <b>holes</b> or sawed notches along the fold, some Asian bindings, such as the Retchoso or Butterfly Stitch of Japan, use small slits instead of <b>punched</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
