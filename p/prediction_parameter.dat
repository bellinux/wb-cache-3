Thus, XCS is designed to address sequential (multi-step) decision problems with the objective of maximization of the total discounted rewards.

Gravimetric method is widely used to measure soil moisture content. Although the result is quite accurate, however it is very time consuming. In this research, soil moisture content of arid field has been analyzed by image processing method using webcam and infrared webcam as the image-captured devices. This research aimed to estimate soil moisture content from images captured by webcam and infrared webcam and to define the most appropriate visual properties as the soil moisture content <b>prediction</b> <b>parameter.</b> Soil samples used in this research was from arid field of Gunung Tugel Village Banyumas Regency. Thirty samples of arid field soils were collected using soil ring samplers in 5 cm of soil depth. All samples were wetted until they reached a saturated condition. After that, the samples were stored for 30 days under room temperature condition until the soils became dry. Everyday the weight of each soil was measured and the images were captured by using webcam and infrared webcam. The images were then extracted by using image processing to obtain visual parameters such as RGB index as well as HSI colour and texture feature. Each of the visual parameters was then determined its correlation with soil moisture content and the R 2 of the correlations. The final step of the analysis was calculating the mean percentage error (MPE) of the moisture content estimation. A visual parameter which has the least MPE would {{be used as the}} <b>prediction</b> <b>parameter.</b> The results of this research showed that soil moisture content of arid field could be predicted by using visual parameters from images captured by webcam and infrared webcam.

In our proposed algorithm the unknown pixels are categorized into various bins depending upon the characteristic of the neighboring pixels (activity level) and for each bin fixed prediction parameters are used for prediction. We have presented different set of fixed predictors for both smooth type and edgy type of images. We have also proposed a modified algorithm in which selection of <b>prediction</b> <b>parameter</b> is done on block by block basis instead of image basis.

A {{combined}} axial-torsional {{low cycle}} fatigue test was carried out to predict the fatigue life under in-phase and out-out-phase loading conditions for CF 8 M cast stainless steels.

40|$|Abstract Prediction of {{atmospheric}} phenomena needs three components: a theoretical (or numerical) model {{based on the}} natural laws (physical, chemical, or biological), a sampling set of the reality, and a tolerance level. Comparison between the predicted and sampled values leads to the estimation of model error. In the error phase space, the prediction error is treated as a point; and the tolerance level (a <b>prediction</b> <b>parameter)</b> determines a tolerance-ellipsoid. The prediction continues until the error first exceeding the tolerance level (i. e., the error point first crossing the tolerance-ellipsoid), which is the first-passage time. Well-established theoretical framework such as backward Fokker-Planck equation {{can be used to}} estimate the first-passage time – an up time limit for any model prediction. A population dynamical system is used as an example to illustrate the concept and methodology and the dependence of the first-passage time on the model and prediction parameters. 1...|$|E
