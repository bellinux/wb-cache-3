5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the age of}} the Penny Reds {{had come}} to an end along with the Perkins Bacon {{printing}} contract. The new low values were also surface-printed: first was a penny stamp coloured Venetian red in a square frame, issued in 1880. However, the passage of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 necessitated new stamps valid also as revenue stamps, and so the Penny Lilac was issued in that year, inscribed [...] "POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE". This stamp remained the standard letter stamp for the remainder of Victoria's reign, and vast quantities were printed. Later issues were inscribed POSTAGE & REVENUE which became the more familiar <b>POSTAGE</b> <b>REVENUE.</b>|$|E

At that time the Bureau of Engraving and Printing produced all United States <b>postage</b> and <b>revenue</b> stamps.

50|$|Kedah's first {{revenues}} were three high values of $25, $100 and $250 issued in 1929 showing the Council Chamber building. For lower amounts dual-purpose <b>postage</b> and <b>revenue</b> stamps {{were used for}} fiscal needs. These were replaced by another set showing Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim in 1937 with the values of $25, $100 and $500. Kedah fell to Japanese forces in 1941 and its <b>postage</b> r <b>revenue</b> stamps were variously overprinted in Japanese. In 1943 the Japanese gave Kedah to Thailand, and a single stamp showing the coat of arms and inscribed with the new name Syburi was issued in 1944.

50|$|The first {{revenues}} of the Bechuanaland Protectorate were issued in 1887, and were British Bechuanaland <b>postage</b> & <b>revenue</b> stamps overprinted Protectorate. Like the original issues these were valid for both <b>postage</b> and <b>revenue,</b> but were mainly used fiscally. From 1903 to 1913, {{revenues of}} the Cape of Good Hope and Transvaal were overprinted, and from 1914 to 1942 similar overprints {{were made on}} South African revenues. In 1918 British Bechuanaland 1s stamps were surcharged £5 for use as revenues however one exists postally used. In 1932, pictorial designs with the portrait of King George V similar to the contemporary postage stamps but with a different inscription were issued. Similar issues but with the portraits of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II followed in 1938 and 1955 respectively. In 1961 the 1955 stamps were issued surcharged in South African rand.In 1965, a set of six stamps with face values from 25c to 4R was issued for Local Government Tax.|$|R

50|$|While revenue stamps often {{resemble}} postage stamps, {{they are}} not normally intended for use on mail and therefore do not receive a postal cancellation. Some countries such as Great Britain have issued stamps valid for both <b>postage</b> and <b>revenue,</b> but this practice is now rare. Many different methods {{have been used to}} cancel revenue stamps, including pen cancels, inked handstamps, perforating, embossing, hole punching or simply tearing.|$|R
50|$|A used stamp {{with a pen}} cancel {{is usually}} worth much less than a stamp {{cancelled}} using a handstamp or machine. In particular, the additional information from the handstamp is lost and the pen cancel may indicate fiscal (revenue) rather than postal use. Pen cancelling is a common method of cancelling stamps used fiscally. Stamps marked valid for both <b>postage</b> and <b>revenue</b> use are usually worth less when fiscally used.|$|R
50|$|In most countries, {{the cost}} of sending a {{telegram}} was paid using normal postage stamps. These can often be identified by their distinctive telegraphic cancels or punched holes. In some countries and at some times, special telegraph stamps were produced or <b>postage</b> or <b>revenue</b> stamps overprinted to pay the fee (e.g. Nicaragua, Ecuador). Private companies also issued telegraph stamps in countries where the telegraph network was in private ownership.|$|R

From 1942, Japanese revenue stamps were used in Hong Kong, and these can only be identified by their cancellations. In 1943 and 1944, Japanese <b>postage</b> or <b>revenue</b> stamps were overprinted for Hong Kong. New designs were also issued printed locally, showing either the HSBC building (then the government headquarters) or Mount Fuji.|$|R
