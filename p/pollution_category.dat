40|$|The {{object of}} this research, {{conducted}} between December 8, 1970, and August 27, 1971, {{was to assess}} the effect of pollution on benthic macroinvertebrates in Halfway Creek and the Mississinewa River at Albany, Indiana. Data related to macroinvertebrate composition, population density and distribution were obtained through the utilization of Surber and Coleman Pot Samplers. Physical and chemical characteristics were determined using Standard Methods to provide background data for the biological conditions encountered. Data from diversity and standard deviation indices were analyzed separately, and then combined to produce three pollution categories indicating degree of water quality degradation. The diversity index evaluated organically enriched situations but was inadequate in evaluating toxic chemical situations. The standard deviation index indicated toxic conditions, but failed to interpret population dominance satisfactorily. The indices and <b>pollution</b> <b>category</b> data indicated substandard water quality in Halfway Creek. At the confluence of the two streams limiting and selective effects of pollution produced subtle population changes of macroinvertebrates that were measurable by indices and <b>pollution</b> <b>category</b> data. Supportive data from seasonal life histories, decrease of organisms known to be sensitive to toxic and organic wastes, and chemical data indicated a decrease in quality of the Mississinewa River near the mouth of Halfway Creek as compared to its upstream condition.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} environmental indexes and indicators. A short definition of some indicators is considered and a new environmental performance framework is proposed in close relation to environmental performance index (EPI). The aim is to explore the relation between indicators and {{as well as to}} find the most suited index that could gear environmental aspects towards SD. New Environmental Performance scores (i. e. new aggregate scores (NAS) according to the proposed framework) of some selected countries were used for comparison purpose and the poor performance in some policy categories was analyzed in a time series data contextually. Sri Lanka is considered as a case study. The result of the analysis shows that Sri Lanka’s performance in air <b>pollution</b> <b>category</b> and environmental burden on diseases are poor. To conclude, the environmental performance category analysis shows that the growing demand on scarce resources and pollution {{play an important role in}} environmental stress. The use of fossil fuel is the major contributor to CO 2 emission in Sri Lanka. The increasing trend of CO 2 emission contributes to the environmental burden of diseases and air pollution in Sri Lanka. </p...|$|E

The study was carried out on 25 July 2011 till 27 July 2011. Four sampling points 200 meters apart were fixed by Global Positioning Systems (GPS). There was no significant difference for in-situ water quality reading between sampling station as well as the date of sampling. Based on in-situ parameters which was compared with Interim National Water Quality Standard for Malaysia was found that Sungai Pichong could be categorized under Class I, river which has excellent water quality. In addition, a total of nine families and 137 individual taxa were identified and of these, three families belonged to the order ephermeroptera (caenidae, baetidae and siphlonuridae) and dipteral (chironominae, tabanidae and tipulidae), two families to coleopteran (elmidae and gyrinidae) and one family to odonata (aeshnidae).

40|$|The {{performance}} and the uncertainty of receptor models (RMs) were assessed in intercomparison exercises employing real-world and synthetic input datasets. To that end, the results obtained by different practitioners using ten different RMs were compared with a reference. In order to explain {{the differences in the}} performances and uncertainties of the different approaches, the apportioned mass, the number of sources, the chemical profiles, the contribution-to-species and the time trends of the sources were all evaluated using the methodology described in Belis et al. (2015). In this study, 87 % of the 344 source contribution estimates (SCEs) reported by participants in 47 different source apportionment model results met the 50 % standard uncertainty quality objective established for the performance test. In addition, 68 % of the SCE uncertainties reported in the results were coherent with the analytical uncertainties in the input data. The most used models, EPA-PMF v. 3, PMF 2 and EPA-CMB 8. 2, presented quite satisfactory performances in the estimation of SCEs while unconstrained models, that do not account for the uncertainty in the input data (e. g. APCS and FA-MLRA), showed below average performance. Sources with well-defined chemical profiles and seasonal time trends, that make appreciable contributions (> 10 %), were those better quantified by the models while those with contributions to the PM mass close to 1 % represented a challenge.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to study the effects of oil {{pollution}} in a desert location (the Greater Al-Burgan oil fields, an area damaged in the second Gulf War) in Kuwait on the behaviour of the Sand lizard A. scutellatus. Polluted sites with apparently different degrees of contamination (namely tar mat, soot and clear sites) were compared with control areas outside this region. Between 2002 and 2003, ten lizards (5 of each sex) on each polluted and each control site were observed in the field at a time of the year when they were highly active. Air, substrate and burrow temperatures were recorded and lizards were monitored for their morning emergence times, as well as their basking and foraging activities. The present study confirmed that the morning emergence times and the basking behavior varied in sand lizards among the different <b>pollution</b> site <b>categories.</b> Physical changes in the tar mat sites caused the substrate temperatures in these locations to rise more quickly in the morning in response to solar gain than {{was the case in the}} other sites. This gives lizards in these locations the opportunity to emerge earlier and to start eating more quickly, giving them an energetic advantage (perhaps, in turn, influencing their rates of growth and fecundity). The clear sites had the next earliest emergence and were the next hottest but it is difficult to account for this in terms of the physical characteristics of this site. The basking times were clearly shorter on the dark soot and tar mat sites that appeared to have higher solar gain than control or clear sites. There did not appear to be any obvious differences in foraging activity of lizards in the different locations. It appears that some aspects of simple behaviour in these lizards provides a reliable, noninvasive indices for assessing oil pollution in desert locations. The precise impact of these changes in these reptiles on their long-term viability needs to be evaluated...|$|R

We included 1, 956 seabirds (133 dead on admission and 1, 823 admitted alive) in this study. Causes of morbidity were classified into nine categories: light pollution (fallout), fishing gear interaction, crude oil, poisoning/intoxication, other traumas, metabolic/nutritional disorder, orphaned young birds, other causes, and unknown/undetermined. The crude and stratified (by causes of admission) rates of the three final disposition categories (euthanasia Er, unassisted mortality Mr, and release Rr), the time until death, and the length of stay were also studied for the seabirds admitted alive. Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) was the species most frequently admitted (46. 52 %), followed by Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) (20. 09 %). The most frequent causes of morbidity were light pollution (fallout) (25. 81 %), poisoning/intoxication (24. 69 %), and other traumas (18. 14 %). The final disposition rates were: Er = 15. 35 %, Mr = 16. 29 %, and Rr = 68. 34 %. The highest Er was observed in the 'other traumas' category (58. 08 %). Seabirds admitted due to metabolic/nutritional disorder had the highest Mr (50 %). The highest Rr was observed in the light <b>pollution</b> (fallout) <b>category</b> (99. 20 %). This survey provides useful information for the conservation of several seabird species.

The present study sets out to investigate the correlation between kidney cancer and the concentration of Pb in Iran. Materials and Methods: In this study, the first challenge was to collect some relevant information. In this connection, the authors managed {{to gain access to}} data concerning kidney cancer in Iran. The data were collected by a health centre for the period of 2008 - 2010. Besides, a map of Pb distribution in soil, drawn by the Mineral Exploration Organization, and Plumb Concentration Information, collected by Agriculture Jihad Organization, were used. Using a geographic information system (GIS) software such as ArcGIS (USA), the researchers drew the map of the spatial distribution of kidney cancer in the Iran country. In the indirect methods, one measures vegetation stress caused by heavy metal soil contamination. In direct methods, target detection algorithms are used to detect a selected material {{on the basis of its}} unique spectral signature. In this research, we applied target detection algorithms on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to detect Pb. MODIS is a sensor placed on the Terra satellite that collects data in 35 spectral bands with 250 - 1, 000 m special resolutions. Results: The spatial distribution of kidney cancer in Iran country delineated above revealed a positive correlation between the amount of lead and the high frequency of kidney cancer.
