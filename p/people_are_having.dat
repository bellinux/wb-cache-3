The albatross was Steve Irwin's first voice role in the film before he voiced the elephant seal in the final cut. The scene was finished and included on the DVD in Irwin's memory. This scene is done in Irwin's classic documentary style, with the albatross telling the viewer all about the other characters in the scene, and the impact <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> on their environment.|$|E

Melina Matsoukas responded to the news in an interview with MTV News, stating: [...] "When I go out to make something, I kind of go out with the intention to get it banned– [...] not to get it banned... but to make something provocative... it's making an effect and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> a dialogue about it, so, to me, that's successful." ...|$|E

Doctors said that nine of the thirty-two casualties who reached Salmaniya hospital were in critical condition. Some medics cried while treating the injured, some of whom had bullets still lodged into their bodies, X-rays showed. A doctor interviewed by Al Jazeera English pleaded for help from [...] "all countries in the world". Describing the situation in hospital as a war, Dr. Ghassan said, [...] "They are shooting at people's heads. Not at the legs. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> their brains blown out".

He felt that the election season was [...] "the time of decision in this country... the most critical {{time in the history}} of the country". When asked about concerns over [...] "", Cooder said in an interview for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I thought I should have a record that says, 'This here record is for you during election time.' Rather than be vague and poetic, let's just call this what it is. That way I may get people's attention. That's the idea." [...] Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression-era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them. When writing the album, he also touched on the Occupy movement, which he felt optimistic about, saying that [...] "There's a sign of something.

500|$|Michael {{had shown}} the office a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{cut of the}} film years ago, but the {{employees}} all mistook it for a comedy, and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening. Everyone is very eager to see Michael's film, albeit only because they all appear in it, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) warns everyone {{to be mindful of}} how sensitive Michael is and not laugh. However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers the rest of the office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> fun watching. They sit down and laugh {{with the rest of the}} office through the film's conclusion.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They tell me a lot of <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. I put myself back there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{purchases}} {{are made}} by New Zealanders or foreigners, it is generally those who are already well off that are buying the bulk of properties on the market. This has had a dramatic effect on home ownership rates by Kiwis, now at its lowest level since 1951. Even as recently as 1991, 76% of New Zealand homes were occupied by their owners. By 2013, this was down to 63%, indicating {{that more and more}} <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> to rent. Raewyn Cox, chief executive of the Federation of Family Budgeting, says: [...] "High prices and high interest rates (have) sentenced a rising number of New Zealanders to be lifetime tenants" [...] where they are [...] "stuck in expensive rental situations, heading towards retirement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Post-traumatic amnesia is {{generally}} {{due to a}} head injury (example: a fall, {{a knock on the}} head). Traumatic amnesia is often transient, but may be permanent or either anterograde, retrograde, or mixed type. The extent of the period covered by the amnesia is related to the degree of injury and may give an indication of the prognosis for recovery of other functions. [...] Mild trauma, such as a car accident that results in no more than mild whiplash, might cause the occupant of a car to have no memory of the moments just before the accident due to a brief interruption in the short/long-term memory transfer mechanism. The sufferer may also lose knowledge of who <b>people</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Having</b> longer periods of amnesia or consciousness after an injury may be an indication that recovery from remaining concussion symptoms will take much longer.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>having</b> easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
