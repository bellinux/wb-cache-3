5000|$|Harcourt {{identifies}} the treaty signing location as [...] "West Bend", {{a bend in}} the Merri Creek at the western end of Cunningham Street, Northcote and opposite Rushall Station[...] He relies on a range of evidence including oral traditions, the description of the signing location in John Pascoe Fawkner's accounts, previous commemorative markers and ceremonies, interpretation of landmarks in contemporary descriptions, and later depictions such as Burtt's painting of the event, which may have been prepared following discussions with participants in Batman's expedition. In 2004, a 45 square centimetre concrete block was found during works by the City of Darebin which now incorporates Northcote; the top of the white <b>painted</b> <b>block</b> has four upright steel bolts and a coating of glue, which indicate that it had been used as the base for a plaque.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps most tragic is {{the loss}} of the {{unfinished}} frescoes for the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence which consumed the last decade of his life. His frescoes depicted a Last Judgment day composed of an unsettling morass of writhing figures. The remaining drawings, showing a bizarre and mystical ribboning of bodies, had an almost hallucinatory effect. Florentine figure painting had mainly stressed linear and sculptural figures. For example, the Christ in Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel is a massive <b>painted</b> <b>block,</b> stern in his wrath; by contrast, Pontormo's Jesus in the Last Judgment twists sinuously, as if rippling through the heavens in the dance of ultimate finality. Angels swirl about him in even more serpentine poses. If Pontormo's work from the 1520s seemed to float in a world little touched by gravitational force, the Last Judgment figures seem to have escaped it altogether and flail through a rarefied air.|$|E

50|$|Djehuti is attested on the Turin canon and the Karnak king list. All of Djehuti's {{contemporary}} attestions {{come from}} a 145 km long stretch of the Nile valley from Deir el-Ballas in the north to Edfu in the south. This roughly corresponds to the territory {{in the sphere of}} influence of the rulers of the 16th dynasty. Djehuti's nomen and prenomen are known from a single block discovered by Flinders Petrie in Deir el-Ballas. A <b>painted</b> <b>block</b> bearing Djehuti's cartouche and showing him wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt - far beyond his sphere of influence - was uncovered in Edfu and otherwise, Djehuti is only attested by objects from his wife's burial. Queen Mentuhotep's tomb was found intact in 1822 and her (now lost) coffin was inscribed with one of the earliest cases of the texts from the Book of the Dead. Mentuhotep's cosmetic box bears Djehuti's nomen, prenomen and cartouche together with funerary formulae and an inscription revealing that the box was a gift from the king.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Pixel puzzle is a logic puzzle which {{consists}} of a blank grid with clues on the left of every row and {{on the top of}} every column. The objective is to <b>paint</b> <b>blocks</b> in each row and column so their length and sequence corresponds to the clues, and {{there is at least one}} empty square between adjacent blocks. There are many possible solutions to <b>paint</b> <b>blocks</b> in each row and column. Solving the puzzle manually gives the possibility to fill cells yield erroneously. Therefore an attempt to solve the puzzle with the aid of computer software is performed. In this paper, rule–based techniques and best-first search are utilized to solve the puzzle. According to experiments have been conducted, it can be concluded that rule-based techniques and best-first search are able to solve the Pixel Puzzle. The result also indicates that the larger size of pixel puzzle, the longer average time to solve is needed. Moreover, the average time to solve one cell of pixel puzzle depends on the size itself except for the 10 × 10 and 15 × 15 pixels...|$|R

5|$|Several {{designs for}} the exact method of {{destroying}} the target were suggested. One of these {{was to have the}} satellite carry out a kamikaze attack on the target, while another was to coat it with black <b>paint,</b> <b>blocking</b> its ability to see or transmit, rendering it inoperable. Yet another was for it to use a laser to disable reconnaissance or optical sensors of the target. Another suggestion was for the satellite to carry a nuclear missile, of up to one megaton yield, and launch it at the satellite. However, in July 1959, Joseph V. Charyk directed that all technical efforts were to be focused on developing the inspection function, rather than the kill function, effectively ending its role as a satellite interceptor, and shifting the project {{to the development of a}} satellite inspector.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{laboratory}} {{investigation of}} UV-C effects was conducted over a 62 -h period: {{a much higher}} dose than in classic UV-C treatment was applied to five pigments and two painting binders used by prehistoric humans. Colorimetric parameters were compared to a control to see if UV-C can change pigment and binder color. Infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma and X-ray crystallography were also carried out to confirm colorimetric measurement. In order to understand how microorganism may physically deteriorate paintings, limestone <b>blocks</b> were <b>painted</b> and monitored until their complete colonization by algae, cyanobacteria, fungi and/or mosses. The results show that UV-C {{has no effect on}} mineral compounds. Conversely, it is noteworthy that binder color changed under both UV-C light conditions as well as in visible light. Concerning <b>painted</b> <b>blocks,</b> a fast proliferation has been observed with deterioration of the paintings. These results show the high importance of treating biofilm as soon as possible. Moreover, these findings may be a promising avenue inducing cave managers to use friendly UV-C light to treat contaminated cave paintings and also in the prevention of biodeterioration by lampenflora...|$|R

In each puzzles, players must analyze the numbers featured on rows and columns and either paint or break away specific blocks to reveal a 3D model of an object or character. This time around, each puzzle possesses two kinds of colored blocks that must be <b>painted</b> accordingly; blue <b>blocks,</b> which represent straight square blocks, and orange blocks, which transform into curved or cut-out blocks when filled in. This introduces dual numbers, indicating rows or columns containing both blue and orange blocks. Players are penalised for destroying <b>blocks</b> incorrectly or <b>painting</b> a <b>block</b> the wrong color. Players can use flags to highlight potential blocks in certain colors if they are unsure, and can use bombs to quickly clear rows and columns containing no blocks. Players can also unlock additional puzzles by scanning in compatible amiibo figures.|$|R

40|$|Quartz veins {{acted as}} {{impermeable}} barriers to regional fluid flow {{and not as}} fluid-flow conduits in Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Mt <b>Painter</b> <b>Block,</b> South Australia. Systematically distributed asymmetric alteration selvedges consisting of a muscovite-rich zone paired with a biotite-rich zone are centered on quartz veins in quartz–muscovite–biotite schist. Geometric analysis of the orientation and facing of 126 veins at Nooldoonooldoona Waterhole reveals a single direction along which a maximum of all veins have a muscovite-rich side, irrespective of their specific individual orientation. This direction represents a Mesoproterozoic fluid-flow vector and the veins represent permeability barriers to the flow. The pale muscovite-rich zones formed on the downstream side of the vein and the dark biotite-rich zones mark the upstream side. The alteration couplets formed from mica schist at constant Zr, Ga, Sc, and involved increases in Si, Na, Al and decreases in K, Fe, Mg for pale alteration zones, and inverse alteration within dark zones. The asymmetry of the alteration couplets is best explained by the pressure dependence of mineral–fluid equilibria. These equilibria, in combination with a Darcian flow model for coupled advection and diffusion, and with permeability barriers imposed by the quartz veins, simulate the pattern of both fluid flow and differential, asymmetric metasomatism. The determined vector of fluid flow lies along the regional foliation and {{is consistent with the}} known distribution of regional alteration products. The presence of asymmetric alteration zones in rock containing abundant pre-alteration veins suggests that vein-rich material may have generally retarded regional fluid flow...|$|R
