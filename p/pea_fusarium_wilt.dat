Options {{for control of}} the causal organism, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) are limited. Suppressive soil sites have previously been identified where, despite the presence of Foc, <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> does not develop. In order to understand some aspects of this disease suppression, endophytic Fusarium oxysporum isolates were obtained from banana roots. These isolates were genetically characterized and compared with an isolate of Fusarium oxysporum previously identified as being capable of suppressing <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> of banana in glasshouse trials. Three additional isolates were selected for glasshouse trials to assess suppression of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> in two different cultivars of banana, Cavendish and Lady Finger.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State UniversityThe {{maritime}} Pacific Northwest is {{the only}} region of the USA suitable for production of spinach seed, a cool-season, daylength-sensitive crop. However, the acidic soils of this region are highly conducive to spinach <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt,</b> caused by <b>Fusarium</b> oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae. Rotations of 10 to 15 years between spinach seed crops are necessary {{to reduce the risk}} of losses to this disease. Raising soil pH with limestone partially suppresses spinach <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt,</b> but the suppressive effect is transitory, and the disease still limits seed crop acreage in the region. Experiments were conducted to: 1) assess the potential for annual applications of limestone for three years prior to a spinach seed crop to improve <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> suppression compared to the level of suppression from a single limestone amendment, 2) develop a soil-based greenhouse bioassay to characterize the spinach <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> risk of soil samples submitted from stakeholders' fields, and 3) explore the mechanism(s) of limestone-mediated <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> suppression. Annual applications of limestone for each of three years prior to a spinach seed crop were superior to a single limestone application for suppressing <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> and increasing seed yield. A soil bioassay to assess <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> risk was developed in which three spinach lines representing a range in <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> susceptibility were used to test soil samples from growers' fields under consideration for spinach seed crops. In the four years that the soil bioassay has been offered as a risk assessment service, soil samples from 147 fields were submitted by stakeholders for evaluation. Follow-up visits to spinach seed crops planted in fields assessed with the soil bioassay validated the results. In vitro experiments demonstrated that deficiencies of iron, manganese, and zinc can reduce growth and sporulation of F. oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae. Furthermore, greenhouse experiments in naturally-infested field soil indicated that reduction in availability of these micronutrients in limestone-amended soils reduced <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> inoculum potential. Together, these findings reveal relationships among soil properties and spinach <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> development, increase the capacity for and profitability of USA spinach seed production, and will guide future research on soil-based management of this disease.  Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State Universit...|$|R

In four of five field experiments there were significant elevations in soil microbial respiration. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of watermelon roots following cover crop amendments of V. villosa and T. incarnatum, were significantly higher compared to bare ground. The elevation in respiration was significantly positively correlated with disease suppression of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> induced by V. villosa and T. incarnatum (both cover crops reduced <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> as much as 21 %). In greenhouse experiments using infested field soil, <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> suppression was observed in pots amended with V. villosa and T. incarnatum. However, {{there was an increase}} in <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> of watermelon in pots that were amended with V. villosa and T. incarnatum which were also inoculated with FON when compared to plants in nonamended, inoculated pots.

In addition, in vitro growth experiments showed that media amended with V. villosa leachate significantly stimulated the in vitro growth rates of FON and Trichoderma harzianum compared to nonamended plates.

This fungus is a soil-borne pathogen that can remain viable in soil for many years. Cultural disease control measures, such as extended soil flooding and soil solarization, have shown promise in managing <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> in other cropping systems. The specific objectives {{of this research}} were to repeat preliminary soil solarization and flooding experiments conducted last year and to evaluate the effect of preplant treatment of planting beds with either Vapam or soil solarization on the subsequent incidence of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> on lettuce. In a microplot study, soil naturally infested with Fol was flooded or solarized for 15, 30, 45 and 60 days, then bioassayed by transplanting and growing lettuce plants in samples of treated soil as well as nontreated soil. In field studies, plots were solarized for 40 days or treated with Vapam before planting to lettuce. In the microplot experiment, the severity of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> on lettuce grown in previously flooded or solarized soil was significantly less than that in nontreated soil. Additionally, {{there was no difference}} between flooding and solarization with respect to disease severity, as lettuce plants in both cases had virtually no symptoms of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt.</b> Weight of the tops of lettuce plants was significantly greater for plants grown in flooded or solarized soil compared to that in nontreated soil. Furthermore, top growth in solarized soil was sometimes significantly greater than that in flooded soil. Compared to nontreated soil, root growth in solarized soil was significantly greater. In contrast, root growth in flooded soil was not significantly different than that recorded in nontreated soil. In the field studies, the incidence of lettuce plants with foliar symptoms of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> was reduced by an average of 42 % when grown on solarized beds compared to nonsolarized beds. Preplant application of Vapam at rates of 30, 45 and 60 gallons of product per acre resulted in reductions in the incidence of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> of 38, 50, and 45 %, respectively. Further work is needed to attempt to increase the reduction of disease recorded this past year. Refinements in our solarization technique as well as application methods for Vapam may increase the efficacy of these tools in reducing the incidence and severity of <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> of lettuce...|$|R

Infection and disease assessment {{were carried out}} based on wilt incidence and percentage mortality of theplants. Overall screening results revealed that 5 out of 15 accessions were moderate to highly resistant while 6 accessions werehighly susceptible to <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt.</b> The results were further supported by differences in root and shoot weight and lengthamongst susceptible and resistant genotypes. Polymorphism analysis based on AFLP data revealed only a sub-set of thesedivergent genotypes confirming to genetic divergence levels required for raising segregant population. Based on the results ofcombined analyses, the genotypes 500108 KA and IC 471870, 500101 KA and 500155 AP have been recommended as suitableparents for developing population for mapping <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> resistance in Velvetbean...|$|R
