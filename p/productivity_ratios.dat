The results of data envelopment analysis indicate that the two leading Brazilian mobile operators, Vivo and TIM, are fully efficient throughout the entire period of study; however, Indian mobile operators are the least efficient among BRIC operators. Interestingly, {{the findings of this}} study verify that full operational efficiency can be achieved by operators with large revenues, such as China Unicom, and by others with medium and small revenues, such as Vivo, TIM and Oi. Partial factor productivity demonstrates that 3 of the 4 Brazilian mobile operators, Vivo, TIM and Oi, have remarkable <b>productivity</b> <b>ratios,</b> and that the state-owned operator, China Unicom, has the highest revenue per capital expenditure among BRIC operators.

To illustrate some of the powerful implications we propose <b>productivity</b> <b>ratio</b> to measure the decrease in productivity associated with the succession and quantify it for instances of within- and across-location succession.

The results show that the <b>productivity</b> <b>ratio</b> of DCS increases with increasing pressure and increases firstly and then decreases with increasing feeding ratio or temperature.

From the previous result, the maximum amount of sand for all cases showed slight differences (approximately < 5  %) between the values of HF mathematical model and field data. The volume of fluid for all cases also showed minimum values of percentage differences (approximately < 2  %) between the values of HF mathematical model and field data. The <b>productivity</b> <b>ratio</b> of the well after fracturing also showed the percentage differences which range from 1 to 7  %. This shows that the equations used to obtain the values of maximum amount of sand and volume of fracture fluid in HF design are valid, practical and workable.|$|R

40|$|The {{discussion}} of productivity is usually dominated by considerations of {{the productivity of}} labour, but in general terms a productivity ratio may {{be defined as the}} number of physical units of output per unit of resource input.
