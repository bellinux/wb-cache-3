40|$|Premio {{best paper}} award IEEE An IEC main <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> {{electric}} hazards by shock or burns or fire is the “active” measure. It {{is based on}} preventing {{the persistence of the}} electrical hazards limiting the time duration of the risk exposure to the contact for shock and fire and to the fault consequences. The active protection of detecting the hazardous fault and disconnecting automatically the supply is named in the paper “π-protection” to highlight the characteristic profile of the risk exposure. For studying the near miss incidents, complying with the Heinrich theory, characteristic parameters are introduced that allow dealing with the various classes of the “π -protection” like with dynamical collision problems. Considering the components of an electric hazard like massparticles in motion, the protection practice in IEC standards solves:- avoiding the “collision”, limiting the fault exposure time (probable protection);- controlling the “collision”, limiting the risk “weight” (safe conventional protection) or at the least limiting the colliding time (additional protection). In particular, the IEC approach recognizes the “π -protection”: - against indirect contact, coordinated with grounding, as acceptable, considering improbable the simultaneous operator contact (probable protection), and more as safe, if the limited exposure time guarantees also the prospective touch voltage lower than the safe admissible value (conventional <b>protection),</b> - <b>against</b> <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> with the supply voltage to ground, as an additional protection (no-guaranteed safe), in spite of using residual current devices RCD up to 30 mA.

40|$|Abstract. Recently many {{international}} {{terrorist groups}} can actively plan coordinated attacks against both military and space computer and telecommunication systems and civilian critical infrastructures (such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems), using high level electromagnetic field techniques. Because the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding activities play the major {{role for the}} prevention of the damages, disrupt equipment operations, change processing control, or corrupt stored data. High energy electromagnetic fields with a large frequency range, different duration and intensity can overload circuit boards, transistors, and other electronics, as well as they can erase electronic memory, upset software, or permanently disable all electronic components. Defense and Security Sector leaders plan different strategies in the three directions: ONP (Open Network Provision), Satellite Telecommunication (ST) and Mobile Telecommunication Systems (MTS). All of these directions include the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> non-authorized accesses to the data bases and voice transmissions, which can implement via a interception of own frequencies as well as the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>directed</b> electromagnetic hazardous flows.

These advantages allow the method to be high competitive, compared to the other methods, and draw its future development and multiplication. І...|$|R

The evaluation of {{efficacy of the}} lightning protection schemes among others requires an accurate knowledge of the consequential potential rise at the struck point and the current injected into soil at the earth termination.
